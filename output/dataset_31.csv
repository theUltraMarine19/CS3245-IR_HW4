ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Sunday observance—Transportation
of non-perishable goods on Sunday—Exemption for “works of necessity”—Exigencies
of modern day society and economy—Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C., 1970, c. L-13, ss. 4,
11.

The appellant company, in the course of its
business as a motor carrier of goods, carried non-perishables on a Sunday, and
was charged with a violation of s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act. The trial
judge acquitted the appellant on the ground that it was carrying on a “work of
necessity”, which was excepted from the prohibitions of the Act by s. 11. In
the case stated by the trial judge for the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Ontario, it is mentioned that the appellant had not sought the authorization or
permission of the Canadian Transport Commission. It was further mentioned that
the work conducted by the appellant was necessitated by: the operational
requirements of the appellant; the geographic distances between points of
departure and destination; the requirements of the appellant’s customers; the
economic well-being of the appellant, its customers, and to an extent, as well,
the ultimate purchasers of the goods involved; and the exigencies of modern day
society and economy. The acquittal was affirmed by a judge of the Supreme Court
of Ontario. On a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, the order of acquittal
was set aside and a conviction was registered. The company appealed to this
Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant’s activities were clearly
within the prohibitions of s. 4 unless exempted under s. 11. Parliament has not
chosen to include motor transport in the exception under s. 11 (h) but
has left it to the Canadian Transport Commission to give exemptions under
s. 11(x). The appellant company cannot invoke the general words
“work of necessity” in s. 11. If, as is the case, the appellant can claim no
exemption

[Page 636]

under s. 11 as a transportation operation,
there is nothing else in the facts herein that would entitle it to exemption,
any more than any other operator of a business that would find it convenient or
that would respond to customers’ requests to carry on business on Sunday.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], setting aside an
order of acquittal and registering a conviction. Appeal dismissed.

Brian A. Crane, and Douglas MacLeod, for
the appellant.

W.J. Parker, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LASKIN J.—The appellant company was charged with
a violation of s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. L-13, in
operating a commercial vehicle on Sunday in the ordinary course of its business
as a motor carrier of goods. At the time of the alleged violation, the
particular vehicle was carrying non-perishables. The accused company was
acquitted in the Provincial Court on the ground that it was carrying on a “work of necessity”, which
was excepted from the prohibitions of the Act by s. 11 thereof.

The trial judge stated a case for the opinion of
the Supreme Court of Ontario and, in addition to the facts already mentioned,
it contained the following findings:

(v) The respondent had not sought the
authorization or permission of the Canadian Transport Commission for the
conduct of its business on September 5, 1971, as proved.

(vi) The work conducted by the respondent
was necessitated by: the operational requirements of the respondent; the
geographic distances between

[Page 637]

points of departure and destination; the
requirements of the respondent’s customers; the economic well-being of the
respondent, his customers, and to an extent, as well, the ultimate purchasers
of the goods involved; and the exigencies of modern day society and economy.

Grant J., after an extensive canvass of the authorities,
affirmed the acquittal under the following conclusions:

I therefore hold that the learned
Provincial Judge, in determining whether the respondent’s activities on the day
in question amounted to a work of necessity, was entitled to take into consideration
the requirements of the respondent’s customers as well as those ultimate
purchasers of the goods involved and the exigencies of modern day society and
economy, as well as the other matters referred to by him in the stated case.

On the narrower limits of jurisdiction of a
Court of Appeal when hearing an appeal by way of stated case, I am unable to
determine that the decision appealed from is wrong.

On further appeal to the Ontario Court of
Appeal, the order of acquittal was set aside and a conviction was registered.
Schroeder J.A., speaking for the Court, summed up in these words:

Giving the words “work of necessity” their
ordinary meaning, we are unable to agree with the submissions of counsel for
the respondent that a case of necessity has been made out so as to bring the
respondent within the exempting provisions of s. 11.

The issue in this appeal is narrow. The
appellant’s activities were clearly within the prohibitions of s. 4 unless
exempted under s. 11. The relevant portions of that provision read as follows:

11. Notwithstanding anything herein
contained, any person may on the Lord’s Day do any work of necessity or mercy,
and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the ordinary meaning of
the expression “work of necessity or mercy”, it is hereby declared that it
shall be deemed to include the following classes of work:

(g) the conveying of travellers and
work incidental thereto;

[Page 638]

(h) the continuance to their
destination of trains and vessels in transit when the Lord’s Day begins, and
work incidental thereto;

(x) any work that the Canadian
Transport Commission, having regard to the object of this Act, and with the
object of preventing undue delay, deems necessary to permit in connection with
the freight traffic of any transportation undertaking.

The Lord’s Day Act does not define “work
of necessity or mercy”, and the heterogeneous classes of deemed inclusions in
paras. (a) to (x) of s. 11 do not reflect any consistent
approach. They range from the supply of health services and attendant drugs and
medicines to specified emergency services; they include utility and
communication services and specified transportation services; milk delivery,
and maple sugar and maple syrup grove operations; domestic service and service
of watchmen; certain loading and unloading operations; unavoidable late Sunday
work by fishermen and by newspapermen preparing next day’s edition. Although
para. (g) excepts conveyance of travellers without limitation of the
means of conveyance, there is no equivalent provision respecting conveyance of
goods save as this is included in para. (h) respecting trains and
vessels in transit and as may be permitted under para. (x). Assuming the
conveyance of perishable goods (“caring” for them is covered by para. (m))
could fall within the general words “work of necessity”, that is not this case.

The evidence does not show when the transit in
question here began, and hence even an analogous application of the words “work
of necessity” in the light of para. (h) is precluded. To the extent to
which business or economic convenience of the operator of transportation
services and of its customers underlies the exception in para. (h), there
may be as much to be said for permitting motor transport as rail and vessel
service. Parliament has not, however, chosen to do this by a general exception
but has left it open to the Canadian Transport Commis-

[Page 639]

sion to give exemption under para. (x). Since
it is work within para. (x) that the Commission “deems necessary” that
may be exempted, and since, admittedly, the respondent’s activities fall within
the Commission’s authority, I am unable to accept the contention of the
appellant company that it may properly invoke the general words “work of
necessity” in s. 11.

If, as I think is the case, the appellant
company can claim no exemption under s. 11 as a transportation operation, there
is nothing else in the facts herein that would entitle it to exemption, any
more than any other operator of a business that would find it convenient or that
would respond to customers’ requests to carry on business on Sunday. Parliament
has declared otherwise.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Misleading
advertisement—Crown’s appeal—Question of law—Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1910, c. C-23, s. 37.

The appellant, a discount catalogue firm,
distributes a catalogue in which its prices for certain items are indicated.
The catalogue contained the statement that “Whenever obtainable, we have
included manufacturer’s suggested retail prices. Where no such price is
available, we have ourselves suggested what we feel to be a fair retail price”.
The “manufacturer’s suggested retail prices” were not only obtainable but in
the possession of the accused, but the figures appearing in the catalogue after
the word “retail” were in all cases in excess of that price. The appellant was
charged with publishing to the public statements purporting to be statements of
fact which statements were misleading, contrary to the provisions of s. 37
of the Combines Investigation Act. The trial judge acquitted the accused
on the ground that “available” had a much wider meaning than “obtainable” and
meant “capable of avail, of use or advantage”, and that therefore the
advertisement was not misleading. The acquittal of the appellant was set aside
by the Court of Appeal. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

In construing a will, deed, contract,
prospectus or other commercial document, the legal effect to be given to the
language employed, is a question of law and in the construction of such a
document, it is an error in law to attribute a fixed meaning to a word of
variable connotation by selecting one of alternative dictionary definitions
without regard to the context of the paragraph or sentence in which the word is
used. Possession of the actual “manufacturer’s suggested retail price” seized
the appellant with knowledge of

[Page 585]

the untruth of the representations which it
made in its advertisement and it therefore knowingly published an advertisement
containing a statement that purported to be a statement of fact but which was
untrue, deceptive, and misleading.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1],
setting aside the acquittal of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.

L.H. McDonald, Q.C., for the appellant.

I.C. Hutton, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside the
acquittal of the appellant in respect of three charges that it caused to be
published by means of a catalogue distributed to the public statements
purporting to be statements of fact which statements were misleading, contrary
to the provisions of s. 37 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1970, C. C.23. The relevant section of the Combines Investigation Act reads
as follows:

37. (1)
Every one who publishes or causes to be published an advertisement containing a
statement that purports to be a statement of fact but that is untrue, deceptive
or misleading or is intentionally so worded or arranged that it is deceptive or
misleading, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment
for five years, if the advertisement is published

(a) to promote, directly or
indirectly, the sale or disposal of property or any interest therein, or

(b) to promote a business or
commercial interest.

The appellant is a discount catalogue firm which
serves the public generally and which distributed a catalogue in which its
prices for certain types of “Leader” tricycles and bicycles were indicated by a
type of code which was explained in the body of the catalogue. The

[Page 586]

particular items with respect to which charges
were laid against the appellant were as follows:

(1) Leader Mini Sidewalk Bicycle ‘Duster’ model.
Wheels 16″ … VPW
196/3850—Retail $56.95.

(2) Leader Mini Sidewalk Bicycle. ‘Pinto’
model. 12″ Wheels. VPW
912/2835—Retail $33.95.

(3) Leader Tike-Trike … 10″ Front wheel … VPW-T-10/1095—Retail
$15.95.

The reference to the explanatory material contained
at the beginning of the catalogue shows that the figures or letters appearing
directly after the initials “VPW” and before the oblique stroke are the stock
number of the article whereas the figures after the oblique stroke represent
the sale price from the appellant (i.e. $38.50, $28.35, $10.95).

The alleged misrepresentation concerns the
listed “retail” price and in this regard the catalogue contains the following
information:

The prices in this catalogue are not
offered as a firm quotation, being subject to market fluctuations without
notice. They do, however, concur with the latest current list prices at the
time of publication. You will find that our prices are as low as good business
practice will allow. Whenever obtainable, we have included manufacturer’s
suggested retail prices. Where no such price is available, we have ourselves
suggested what we feel to be a fair retail price. (The italics are my own).

In all cases the “manufacturer’s suggested
retail prices” were, as the learned trial judge found, not only obtainable but
in the possession of the accused, but the figures appearing in the catalogue
after the word “retail” were in all cases in excess of that price.

The goods were manufactured in Montreal and
evidence to the effect that the retail price suggested by the manufacturer was
intended to apply in that area was treated by the trial judge as making it
“obviously unrealistic in Edmonton” because it failed to take account of the

[Page 587]

cost of freight, sales tax and local competitive
factors governing mark-up. It appears, however, that the actual “manufacturer’s
suggested retail price” was in the same range and in some cases higher than the
retail price currently charged by other Edmonton dealers. The position can
perhaps be most graphically portrayed by expressing it in tabular form as
follows:

I agree with the learned trial judge that the
appellant’s listed “retail price” cannot be construed as a representation of
any “prevailing retail price” in Edmonton. The respondent’s main contention,
however, is that the catalogue read as a whole constitutes a representation
that the “retail price” listed there is the “manufacturer’s suggested retail
price” which is “untrue” within the meaning of that word as used in
s. 37(1) of the Combines Investigation Act, supra, and would have
the effect of misleading the public.

The learned trial judge agreed that “the bare
statement ‘Whenever obtainable, we have included manufacturer’s suggested
retail prices’ is untrue”, but he went on to say of this statement:

However it must be read with the statement
which follows:

[Page 588]

‘Where no such price is available, we have
ourselves suggested what we feel to be a fair retail price.’

If instead of using the word ‘available’, the
accused had repeated the word ‘obtainable’, it would be obvious that the two
statements, read together, comprised an untruth. Yet, ‘available’ has a much
wider meaning than ‘obtainable’. It does not mean merely ‘capable of being
gotten or obtained’, but rather its meaning is ‘capable of avail, of use or
advantage.’

The learned trial judge acquitted the appellant
because he had “grave doubt … that the advertisement was misleading” and it is
apparent that this doubt was created by the legal effect which he attached to
the word “available”. The determining factor which governed his conclusion was
that the palpable untruth contained in the advertisement was tempered by the
meaning which he gave to the word “available” so as to create a doubt which
would not otherwise have existed.

“Available”, like many other words in the
English language, is capable of different shades of meaning, and in my opinion
in construing a will, deed, contract, prospectus or other commercial document,
the legal effect to be given to the language employed, is a question of law and
in the construction of such a document, it is an error in law to attribute a
fixed meaning to a word of variable connotation by selecting one of alternative
dictionary definitions without regard to the context of the paragraph or
sentence in which the word is used.

The learned trial judge, however, substantiated
the interpretation which he gave to the word “available” in the following
fashion:

Both Webster and Oxford dictionaries define
‘Available’ as being capable of being employed with advantage, whereas
Bouvier’s Law Dictionary defines the word as: ‘Capable of being used; valid or
advantageous.’

[Page 589]

Thus, it is evident that the advertising is
not untrue. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price was obtainable, but was
not ‘available’ in that it was obviously not capable of being used to advantage
in the Edmonton area.

Reference to the Oxford English Dictionary
indicates that the learned judge has not reproduced the entire definition to
which he makes reference. In that work the definition to which he appears to be
referring is:

Capable of being employed with advantage or
turned to account; hence capable of being made use of at one’s disposal,
within one’s reach. (The italics are contained in the Dictionary).

There can be little doubt that the
“manufacturer’s suggested retail price” was within the appellant’s reach as it
had been supplied to it by the manufacturer. It will be found also by reference
to Webster’s Third New International Dictionary that although the word
“available” is defined as “such as may be availed of: capable of use for
accomplishment of a purpose: immediately utilizable”, it is also defined as
“That is accessible or may be obtained: personally obtainable”.

I have considered the meaning of “available”
found by the learned trial judge in Bouvier’s Law Dictionary and find that the
only authority cited in support of the meaning given is Brigham v.
Tillinghast[2], where
the words “available means” as they occurred in an assignment for the benefit
of creditors, were defined as “a term well understood to be anything which can
readily be converted into money”.

Bouvier’s definition does not assist me in
determining the true meaning of the word “available” as it occurs in
association with “obtainable” in the appellant’s catalogue and I adopt the
meaning assigned to it by the Court of Appeal, the effect of which is
succinctly stated by Mr. Justice Cairns in the course of his reasons for
judgment where he said:

[Page 590]

In this case … the respondent had in fact a
statement from the manufacturers showing the suggested retail price on each
article so that its price had been obtained and obviously was available to it
at the time it published the catalogue in question.

It is the difference between the view of the
trial judge and that of the Appellate Division as to the legal effect of the
word “available” as used in the catalogue which gives rise to this appeal and,
as I have indicated, I am of opinion that the trial judge erred in assigning
the meaning which he did to that word in the context of the appellant’s
catalogue and that his error was one of law.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the question of whether the advertisement was misleading or not does not
involve “a question of law alone” so as to have entitled the Crown to appeal to
the Appellate Division under the provisions of section 605(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code . In support of this latter contention reference was
made to the case of Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited v. Her Majesty The
Queen[3] and
to Lampard v. The Queen[4], but
in both of these cases the trial judge had determined that the evidence was not
sufficient to satisfy him of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt
and this Court held, while accepting the view of the Court of Appeal, that the
evidence was sufficient, that the further question of whether the guilt of the
accused should be inferred from it was one of fact within the province of the
trial judge and that the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction to entertain
an appeal by the Attorney General.

Unlike the Sunbeam and the Lampard cases,
this appeal does not turn on a question of sufficiency of evidence or propriety
of inference because the trial judge has made it clear that had it not been for
the error in law to which I have referred, he would have been satisfied that

[Page 591]

the evidence was sufficient to support a finding
that the statement referred to was “untrue”, and I think it follows that it
would therefore have been misleading to at least some prospective purchasers.
In my opinion the sole question governing the disposition of this appeal to the
Appellate Division and to this Court is whether or not the trial judge erred in
the effect which he gave to the word “available”. As I have indicated, I think
that he did and in so doing erred in law so that the appeal on this ground
“involves a question of law alone” within the meaning of section 605(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

It was also contended on behalf of the appellant
that there was no proof of mens rea but, if intention is a necessary
ingredient of the offence charged, as to which it is unnecessary to express an
opinion, I am satisfied that possession of the actual “manufacturer’s suggested
retail price” seized the appellant with knowledge of the untruth of the
representations which it made in its advertisement and it therefore knowingly
published an advertisement containing a statement that purported to be a
statement of fact but which was untrue, deceptive and misleading within the
meaning of section 37(1) of the Combines Investigation Act.

For the above reasons, I would dismiss this
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Possession of counterfeit
money—Statement by accused at time of arrest that the coins “are not
counterfeit”—Lawful justification or excuse—Mens rea—Criminal Code , ss. 309(1) ,
408 , 605 .

The appellant, a coin dealer, was charged
with possession of counterfeit money. The police found in his apartment, hidden
in a chesterfield cushion, a quantity of United States gold coins and a quantity of United States “dimes” marked 1941/42. After his arrest, the appellant told the
police that the coins “are not counterfeit”. The dimes were legal tender for
their face value although the peculiarity in their dating gave them a
considerable numismatic value. Having found that the gold coins were not legal
tender in the United States,
the trial judge accepted the argument that the dimes could not be said to be
“money” in any accepted sense because the accused did not intend to use them as
currency but was holding them for the purpose of selling them as numismatic curiosities.
On this basis, he found the appellant not guilty of the offence. The Court of
Appeal concluded that the appellant had not met the burden of showing lawful
justification or excuse, and directed a verdict of guilty. On appeal to this
Court, it was contended that proof of mens rea was an essential
ingredient of the offence and that the evidence of the statement made by the
appellant at the time of his arrest that the coins were not counterfeit,
constituted evidence of “lawful justification or excuse”, which the trial judge
had to weigh against the Crown’s evidence in order to reach his conclusion, so
that the issue before the Court of Appeal involved a question of fact, and
there was therefore no jurisdiction in that Court to entertain the appeal of the
Crown under the provisions of s. 605 of the Code.

[Page 574]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Abbott,
Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: What the appellant said when he was first
arrested was admissible in evidence. Viewed in isolation the statement made by
the accused was not a statement that he had no knowledge of the true nature of
the coins and this construction could only be placed upon his language if it
could be said that the circumstances under which the statement was made were
such as to make the inference necessary. No such inference could be justified
in the circumstances of this case nor, was such an inference derived by the
trial judge. In any event the question of whether or not the words “lawful
justification or excuse” are to be construed as including the statement made by
the appellant is a question of law and they cannot be held to bear such a
meaning in the circumstances of the present case.

Per Laskin J.:
Want of intention to use the counterfeit coins as currency if established in a
balance of probabilities is as much within the scope of lawful justification or
excuse as proof that the accused was unaware that the coins were counterfeit.
There is no evidence in the present case upon which a finding could be made
that the appellant did not intend to use the coins as currency.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, setting aside a
verdict of acquittal and directing a conviction against the appellant. Appeal
dismissed.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., for the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
setting aside the verdict acquitting the appellant which

[Page 575]

had been entered at trial before His Honour
Judge Daymen, and directing that a verdict of guilty be substituted therefor on
the charge that the appellant and one Henry Mehrer “without lawful
justification or excuse had in their possession counterfeit money contrary to
the Criminal Code .”

Mehrer did not appear at the appeal before the
Court of Appeal and he is not a party to this appeal which is brought by
Robinson under the provisions of s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code , the
relevant portions of which provide:

618. (2) (a) A person who is
acquitted of an indictable offence other than

(i) an offence punishable by death or

(ii) by reason of a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity and whose acquittal is set aside by the court of
appeal…may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on a question of law.

The italics are my own.

The circumstances giving rise to the laying of
this charge are that the appellant, who appears to have been engaged in the
coin business and was the prospective purchaser of an organization known as the
Canada Coin Exchange, was accompanied to his apartment by three police officers
on the afternoon of May 14, 1969, where they uncovered a cardboard box which
had been hidden in a chesterfield cushion and had contained 711 United States
gold coins and 146 United States “dimes” marked 1941/42. None of the coins was
genuine, but the evidence was such as to justify the trial judge in finding
that the gold coins were not legal tender in the United
 States. The dimes, on the other hand, were legal tender
for their face value although the peculiarity in their dating gave them a
numismatic value of between $100 and $800 each.

The appellant was charged under s. 392 (now 408)
of the Criminal Code  which provides, in part, that:

[Page 576]

Everyone who without lawful justification
or excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his custody or possession
counterfeit money is guilty of an indictable offence.

This section must be read in conjunction
with s. 391(b)(1) (now 406) by which it is provided that:

‘Counterfeit money’ includes a false coin
or a false paper money that resembles or is apparently intended to resemble or
pass for current coin or current paper money

and with s. 391(d) which provides that:

‘Current’ means lawfully current in Canada or elsewhere by virtue of a law,
proclamation or regulation in force in Canada or elsewhere as the case may be.

The learned trial judge having found that the
gold coins were not legal tender in the United States, proceeded to accept the
argument advanced by counsel for the accused that the dimes could not be said
to be “money” in any accepted sense because the accused did not intend to use
them as currency but was holding them for the purpose of selling them as
numismatic curiosities for some hundred of dollars, and on this basis he found
the appellant not guilty of the offence as charged. In this regard the relevant
portions of the learned trial judge’s reasons for judgment read as follows:

Mr. Martin argues that these dimes
cannot be said to be money in any accepted sense of that phrase, and I agree
with that argument. Reference is made to the case of Moss versus Hancock, which
is reported in 1899, 2 Queen’s Bench Division at page 111, and at page
116, the following occurs:

Money as currency, and not as medals, seems
to me to have been well defined by Mr. Walker in ‘Money Trade and
Industry’ (1) as ‘that which passes freely from hand to hand throughout the
community in final discharge of debts and full payment for commodities, being
accepted equally without reference to the character or credit of the person who
offers it and without the intention of

[Page 577]

the person who receives it to consume it or
apply it to any other use than in turn to tender it to others in discharge of
debts or payment for commodities.’

Now if you examine these silver coins, they are
said to be copies of what was known as a 1941/42 dime which has become a
collectors’ item apparently because of an under-printing of the one under the
two on the coin. The evidence before me is that they have a value of anywhere
from $100.00 to $800.00 apiece. If they were genuine, I would think they would
be—they certainly would not be the object of ordinary commerce passed from hand
to hand as money as defined in the part I have just read from the case of Moss
and Hancock and I must find from that definition of money, which I find to
be the proper one, they are not money and the prisoners will be discharged; the
charge is dismissed.

A representative of the Treasury Department of
the Secret Service in Washington, D.C., gave the following evidence with
respect to the counterfeit dimes which were found in the appellant’s
possession:

Q…I have in this plastic bag which is part
of exhibit number 2, 146, 1942 over 1941 U.S. dimes. Are these currency in the
United States of America?

A. Most definitely.

Q. Are they legal tender?

A. They are.

Q. If they have been—they were genuine
since the day they were minted?

A. If they were genuine, they would be
legal since they were minted in the United States.

Q. And if they were genuine, would they be
legal tender today?

A. They would be, sir.

It is thus apparent that these false coins
resembled and were “apparently intended to resemble…current coin” within the
meaning of s. 391 (b)(1)  of the Criminal Code  and that in their
primary character they were therefore “counterfeit money” within the meaning of
section 392  and this character is not, in my opinion, altered by the fact
that they were also curiosi-

[Page 578]

ties having an enhanced value on the numismatic
market. Nor do I think that these coins cease to be counterfeit money in the
hands of the appellant because of the high probability that he was holding them
in the hope of disposing of them for their greatly enhanced value as
curiosities.

I am not persuaded that the definition quoted by
Darling J. in Moss v. Hancock[1] has any
application to the present case. The definition was there applied in support of
the conclusion that where a stolen current coin having enhanced numismatic
value had been actually sold as a curiosity an order might be made under s. 100
of the Larceny Act, 1861 (24 & 25 Vict., c. 96) directing its return
to the true owner. The question at issue in that case was clearly stated by
Darling J. at page 116 where he said:

Now, here it is plain that the mere fact
that the stolen gold piece was money would not render it unfit for the
application to it of an order for restitution. The true question seems to me to
be whether by the manner of dealing with it which the thief adopted the gold
piece passed in currency.

In the present case the 1941/42 dimes were
counterfeit money within the meaning of the Criminal Code  which the
appellant was charged with having in his possession, and I do not think that
reliance on a case which is concerned exclusively with the meaning of “money”
in relation to the sale of current coins of numismatic value under the
provisions of another statute affords any justification for the learned trial
judge’s finding that the coins here in question “are not money”.

The appellant, however, contended that proof of mens
rea was an essential ingredient of the offence charged and that the
evidence of one of the police officers to the effect that the appellant stated
at the time of his arrest that the coins were not counterfeit, constituted
evidence of “lawful justification or excuse” which the trial judge had to weigh
against the Crown’s evidence in order to reach his conclusion, so that

[Page 579]

the issue before the Court of Appeal involved a
question of fact and there was therefore no jurisdiction in that Court to
entertain the appeal of the Crown under the provisions of s. 605  of the Criminal
Code  or otherwise and the conviction by that Court should therefore be set
aside.

Section 295(1) (now 309(1)) of the Criminal
Code  provides in part as follows:

309. (1) Every one who, without lawful
excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession any instrument
suitable for house-breaking…

and I adopt the language used in relation to
that section in Tupper v. The Queen[2]
as applying with equal force to a case such as this where the accused has been
shown to be in possession of counterfeit money. In the Tupper case,
Mr. Justice Judson said, at page 594:

Once possession of an instrument capable of
being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused
to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for
possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.

In the present case neither the appellant nor
his confederate gave any evidence and it is not now disputed that the dimes
found in the appellant’s possession were counterfeit, but it is urged that his
unsworn statement to the police at the time of his arrest should be admitted as
evidence of lack of knowledge of their counterfeit character. This proposition
was argued before the trial judge but, as he found himself able to dispose of
the case on the ground that the coins were “not money”, he did not need to
consider the appellant’s unsworn statement that they were “not counterfeit”.

In my opinion, what the appellant said when he
was first arrested for having these counter-

[Page 580]

feit coins in his possession was admissible in
evidence, but it is now contended on his behalf that when he said of the coins
“they are not counterfeit” this was tantamount to saying that he had no
knowledge of their true nature, and therefore amounted to at least some
evidence of “lawful justification or excuse” within the meaning of s. 392 of
the Code. This contention must be predicated on the assumption that lack of
knowledge on his part must necessarily be inferred from the statement which he
made. Viewed in isolation the statement made by the accused was not a statement
that he had no knowledge of the true nature of the coins and in my view this
construction could only be placed upon his language if it could be said that
the circumstances under which the statement was made were such as to make the
inference necessary. I do not think that any such inference could be justified
in the circumstances of this case, nor, as I have said, was such an inference
drawn by the learned trial judge.

In any event, the question of whether or not the
words “lawful justification or excuse” as used in s. 392 are to be construed as
including the statement made by the appellant is a question of law and in my
opinion they cannot be held to bear such a meaning in the circumstances of the
present case. See Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v. Bairstow[3], per Lord Radcliffe at page 33 and Regina
v. Vail[4].

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

LASKIN J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons in this case prepared by my brother Ritchie, and I agree with him
that the legal issue whether the coins were “counterfeit money” within s. 391 (b)(i)
and (d) of the Criminal Code  (now s. 406 (a)) must be
resolved against the accused. There is no doubt that he was in possession of
them, and hence the issue

[Page 581]

that remains in respect of culpability under s.
393(b) (now s. 408 (b)) is whether the accused has discharged the
burden, on a balance of probabilities, of showing lawful justification or
excuse.

The question of lawful justification or excuse
was argued by counsel for the accused on two bases; first, that the accused did
not intend to use the counterfeit coins as currency or as a medium of exchange;
and, second, that this intention was a matter of fact which was either found in
the accused’s favour by the trial judge or was a matter for the trier of fact
so as to require a new trial.

Since the accused was acquitted at his trial,
the Crown’s appeal to the provincial Court of Appeal was limited to questions
of law alone. That Court, properly in my view, reversed the determination of
the trial judge that the coins were not money for the purposes of the Criminal
Code . On the further question raised before that Court respecting a
requirement of mens rea, it considered the point in terms of lawful
justification or excuse, based upon a denial by the accused that he knew the
coins to be counterfeit. It was the Court’s conclusion that the accused had not
met the burden of showing lawful justification or excuse and it went on to say
this:

Accordingly, the inference to be drawn from
the simple fact of possession, unexplained as it was, was sufficient to support
the [a?] verdict of guilty.

(The interpolation is mine since the accused was
acquitted at trial.)

What was contested by the accused in this Court
in respect of lawful justification or excuse was not “knowing possession” but
rather the want of intention to use the counterfeit coins as currency. In my
opinion, this, if established on a balance of probabilities, is as much within
the scope of lawful justification or excuse as proof that the accused was
unaware that the coins were counterfeit. I exclude, of

[Page 582]

course, use for a fraudulent purpose. The
offence with which the accused was charged is a “currency” offence, so
captioned in the part of the Criminal Code  in which it appears; and it
is clear from the associated sections of the Code that what is aimed at by
all of them is the prohibition of having or using counterfeit money for
currency purposes.

The section under which the accused was
charged calls for evidence, whether adduced on his behalf or brought out in the
Crown’s case, upon which it can be concluded on a balance of probabilities that
his possession did not carry with it any intention to use or pass the coins as
currency. The accused, who was a coin dealer, gave no evidence, and the only
testimony going to any lawful justification or excuse was that of a police
officer who told of a statement of the accused after his arrest that (referring
to the coins) “they are not counterfeit”. The trial judge, disposing of the
case on the ground that the coins were not money, made no findings on lawful
justification or excuse. The Court of Appeal, as I have already noted,
addressed itself to the question whether the accused had proved that he did not
know the coins were counterfeit; and its conclusion, to be consistent with its
limited jurisdiction upon an appeal against acquittal, must be treated as based
upon an absence of any evidence of lawful justification or excuse. Certainly,
if there was evidence from which a trier of fact might infer want of knowledge,
it would be beyond the power of the Court of Appeal to dispose of this issue,
and a new trial would be necessary.

Counsel for the accused did not stress want of
knowledge here, but he did contend that implicit in the trial judge’s reasons
was a finding that there was no intention to use the coins as currency. As a
finding of fact, it would support acquittal and would be beyond challenge on
appeal unless there was no evidence at all to

[Page 583]

support it. I cannot, however, read the reasons
of the trial judge as involving the implicit finding contended for by counsel
for the accused. Is this then a case where a defence open on the evidence has
not been disposed of and a new trial must be ordered? The judgments of this
Court in Hubin v. The King[5] and in Paige
v. The King[6] were
invoked in support of an affirmative answer to this question. They were cases
however where there was evidence upon which the trier of fact could act under
the law as established by this Court. There is no evidence in the present case
upon which a finding could be made that the accused did not intend to use the
coins as currency.

It follows that the burden of proof upon the
accused cannot be met, and I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

Present: Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Martland,

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Non-capital murder—Evidence—Probative
value—Admissibility—Second trial—Evidence of voluntary surrender—Evidence of
consciousness of innocence—Whether evidence admissible.

At his first trial, the appellant was tried
on a charge of non-capital murder and was acquitted as a result of a direction
of the trial judge to acquit. The acquittal was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal. On a further appeal to this Court, a new trial was directed.

At the new trial, the judge refused to admit
the evidence sought to be adduced by the appellant’s counsel that the accused
had been at large in the community since October 31, 1968, had not been under
any legal requirement to remain within the jurisdiction and appeared without
any legal compulsion for his second trial. It was submitted that this was
evidence which was relevant to his state of mind as to whether or not he had a
consciousness of guilt. The appellant was convicted and his conviction was
affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. He appealed to this
Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon and Laskin JJ.: The
Crown not having called any evidence to the effect that the appellant had
attempted to evade justice in any way or that he had been brought into Court
under compulsion, there appears to be no issue on which the isolated fact of
the appellant having voluntarily submitted to justice can be relevant. The
evidence of lack of flight and voluntary surrender has no probative value.
There was no error in the ruling of the trial judge in refusing to admit it at
the trial.

Per Hall J.:
The evidence was admissible. Its weight is a different matter. However, the
exclusion

[Page 566]

of the evidence did not result in any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.

R.J. Carter, for the appellant.

C.M. Powell and E.F. Then, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon and Laskin JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
which affirmed the appellant’s conviction on a charge of non-capital murder
entered after a trial held before Mr. Justice Haines sitting with a jury
at Toronto on November 13, 1970.

The appellant’s appeal is brought under the
provisions of s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  on the basis of
the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Jessup which is described in the
formal order of the Court of Appeal in the following terms:

The Honourable Mr. Justice Jessup dissented
therefrom…expressing the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new
trial directed, on the following grounds, in law, namely that the learned trial
judge was not justified in excluding the evidence sought to be adduced by the
appellant’s counsel.

The question of law so stated forms the basis of
this appeal. Section 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  reads as
follows:

618. (1) A person who is convicted of an
indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose
conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents…

The question upon which Mr. Justice Jessup
founded his dissent and upon which the appellant now alleges that the majority
of the Court

[Page 567]

of Appeal erred, is confined to the ruling of
the learned trial judge that the evidence sought to be adduced by appellant’s
counsel on cross-examination of a police officer to the effect that the
appellant had surrendered voluntarily for his trial, was inadmissible. The majority
of the Court of Appeal supported this ruling but in conformity with the views
expressed by Mr. Justice Jessup, it is now alleged on behalf of the
appellant that the exclusion of this evidence was an error requiring the
conviction to be quashed and a new trial ordered.

It should be observed that this appellant was
first tried for this offence in October, 1968, and was then acquitted as a
result of a direction of the trial judge to acquit, this acquittal was affirmed
in the Court of Appeal[2] for
reasons which are now reported, but on a further appeal being taken to this
Court[3], a new
trial was directed on the 26th of June 1970, and the proceeding held before
Mr. Justice Haines in November, 1970, was accordingly the second trial of
the appellant on the same indictment.

There is no doubt that from the time of his
acquittal on his first trial (31st October 1968) until his surrender in
November 1970, the appellant was at large, free to go where he pleased,
although after the second trial was directed he must have realized that his
freedom was again in jeopardy.

At the trial before Mr. Justice Haines,
appellant’s counsel made the following submission:

My Lord, I propose to establish that since
October, 31st, 1968, Mr. Wray has been at large in the community and has
not been under any legal requirement to remain within the jurisdiction and that
he did appear without any legal compulsion for his trial this Monday. In my
submission, that is evidence which is relevant to his state of mind as to
whether or not he

[Page 568]

has a consciousness of guilt. The Crown in
many cases where the accused has fled has adduced that evidence to establish a
consciousness of guilt and, in my submission, by the same token, the lack of
fleeing in the case of a charge of this nature is equally evidence of the lack
of consciousness of guilt.

HIS LORDSHIP: DO you have any authority for
that latter proposition?

MR. CARTER: It flows from the former
proposition. There can be no doubt about the former proposition. What is sauce
for the goose is sauce for the gander.

HIS LORDSHIP: Has any authority so stated?

MR. CARTER: None I have been able to find
at the moment.

HIS Lordship: I don’t think there is any.

The only ground alleged in the Notice of Appeal
to this Court is:

That the learned Trial Judge erred in
refusing to admit at trial evidence of lack of flight and voluntary surrender
as evidence of a consciousness of innocence.

The basic issue in this appeal appears to me to
be whether this evidence was relevant to any issue at the second trial and this
in turn involves consideration of the question of whether it can indeed be said
to constitute any “evidence of a consciousness of innocence”.

No evidence was adduced to the effect that the
appellant had attempted to evade justice in any way or that he had been brought
into court under compulsion, and the Crown having called no such evidence,
there appears to be no issue on which the isolated fact of the appellant having
voluntarily submitted to justice can be relevant. His innocence being presumed
in his favour at his trial, proof that he did not refuse to do what he was
required to do by law does not, in my opinion, affect the issue of his guilt or
innocence in one way or the other.

As the learned trial judge indicated, the
submission made on behalf of the appellant does not appear to find any support
in the case law in this country or in England, but appellant’s coun-

[Page 569]

sel relied on excerpts from certain writers of
text books on the law of evidence of which the most favourable to his contention
is to be found in Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th ed., page 277,
where it is said:

Since falsehood, concealment, flight and
other like acts are generally regarded as indications of conscious guilt, it
naturally follows that the absence of these marks of mental emotion, and still
more a voluntary surrender to justice when the party had the opportunity of
concealment or flight, must be considered as leading to the opposite
presumption, and these considerations are frequently urged with just effect, as
indicative of innocence…

Under certain circumstances “falsehood,
concealment, flight and other like acts” by a man accused of murder may no
doubt carry with them the implication that he had some reason for attempting to
evade justice, and taken together with other evidence, may constitute strong
indicia of a guilty conscience and be admissible on this ground, but with the
greatest respect for the learned author, I cannot agree that, particularly when
no such evidence is adduced, the opposite conclusion is to be drawn from
evidence of failure of the accused to run away in the face of such a charge,
and I venture to say that the notion of any “presumption” of innocence being
raised by the isolated fact that a man surrendered voluntarily for his trial when
he was under a duty to do so, is quite unknown to our law. As the learned trial
judge told the jury, an accused person, after his arraignment and plea of “not
guilty” is presumed to be innocent, and while proof of his flight or attempted
flight might well be accepted as some evidence to rebut this presumption, in
the absence of such evidence, I am, as I have indicated, unable to see that
proof of his having come into court of his own accord adds anything to the
presumption to which he was entitled in any event.

It does appear to me, however, that if the Crown
had adduced evidence of the appellant having attempted to evade justice and
having

[Page 570]

been brought to trial under compulsion, then
proof that he appeared voluntarily might be relevant and admissible to
counteract any inference of “consciousness of guilt” which might arise from
that evidence.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Arnup made reference to the view expressed by
Wigmore in his work on evidence in Vol. II, page 293 which was the principal
authority relied on by appellant’s counsel. The passage cited reads as follows:

If guilt leaves the psychological mark
which we term ‘consciousness of guilt’, and if this is available as evidence,
then the absence of that mark (which for want of a better term may be spoken of
as ‘consciousness of innocence’) is some indication of the absence of guilt,
i.e. of not having done the deed charged. No Court seems to repudiate the proposition; but the tendency to reject
evidence of a consciousness of innocence is rather due to a distrust of the
inference from conduct to that consciousness, since the conduct is often
feigned and artificial.

Mr. Justice Arnup also points out that
evidence of this kind appears to have been rejected in many United States
authorities and the effect of these authorities appears to me to be well
summarized in 16 Corpus Juris (1918) at page 533, paragraph 1067 where it is
said:

Refusal to Flee. Where the state does not seek or offer to prove flight, it is
improper to receive evidence on the part of defendant that he voluntarily
surrendered, or that he did not flee or become a fugitive from justice, or that
he refused to fly, even though he had an opportunity to do so or was advised to
do so after suspicions against him were excited. Where, however, testimony has
been introduced by the prosecution to show flight as evidence of conscious
guilt, evidence that accused notified the sheriff of his desire to submit
himself to custody is admissible, as is also evidence that he voluntarily
returned from another state, or that he talked with officers and made no
attempt to escape.

The present case is one where no evidence
whatever was called for the defence and no attempt was made by the prosecution
to

[Page 571]

introduce any evidence of consciousness of guilt
through flight, attempted flight or other means of evading justice. In these
circumstances, as I have indicated, the appellant’s voluntary appearance at his
trial does not necessarily give rise to any inference except that he was doing
what the law required and furthermore, as Mr. Justice Arnup points out in
the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal at page 383:

…there may be a large number of reasons why
an accused, although under suspicion, refrained from flight and (as in this
case) voluntarily surrendered for his trial. It would not be a long step from
the proposition advanced here to the stage where it would be submitted that an
inference of innocence could be inferred from the fact that the accused was at
large on only nominal bail and could easily have fled the jurisdiction without
other than minor pecuniary loss.

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
evidence of lack of flight and voluntary surrender now sought to be introduced
has no probative value and that there was no error in the ruling of Mr. Justice
Haines in refusing to admit it at the trial.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

HALL J.—I agree that this appeal should be
dismissed. I wish, however, to deal with the question of the admissibility (as
distinct from the weight) of the evidence which the trial judge rejected. The
evidence which counsel for the appellant sought to introduce is set out in the
reasons of my brother Ritchie and as well the discussion between His Lordship
and Mr. Carter.

Haines J. refused to admit the proffered
evidence, it seems to me, principally on the ground that there was no reported
precedent on the point. I do not see the law as being in such a frozen state
that new arguments or propositions are to be rejected if no reported case can
be cited to support them.

[Page 572]

In my view the evidence was admissible. Its
weight is a different matter. The fact that the exclusion of the evidence did
not, in my view, result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice cannot
be regarded as a bar to the admission of evidence which can be classified as
constituting “evidence of a consciousness of innocence”. I think the statement
to be found in Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th ed., p. 277, quoted
by my brother Ritchie in his reasons is a sound proposition and not one to be
rejected out of hand as unknown to our law. The fact that the proposition has
not been articulated in a reported decision is of no consequence.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Manslaughter—Defences—Provocation—Wrongful act or
insult—Automatism—Functions of trial judge—Criminal Code , s. 203 .

The appellant, who was born in India, killed
the woman he wanted to marry by stabbing her with a knife. The victim’s son
testified that his mother told the appellant “I am not going to marry you
because you are a black man” and to go away because her boyfriend was coming
that night. The appellant then produced some letters which he had received from
the victim and handed one to her son to read whereupon she grabbed the letter
and tore it because she did not want the children to read them. The knifing
followed almost immediately. The appellant testified that he did not hear the
slur against him. A psychiatrist testified that the appellant was in a
dissociated state at the time when the woman was killed and that this state
commenced when she tore up the letter. The doctor also expressed his opinion
that there was a possibility of the appellant having suffered an “hysterical
amnesia” following the psychological blow occasioned by the tearing up of the
letter.

The appellant was charged with non-capital
murder but found guilty of manslaughter by a jury. The Crown appealed against
this verdict on the ground that the trial judge erred in putting the defences
of provocation and of automatism to the jury. The Court of Appeal set the
verdict aside and ordered a new trial on the charge of non-capital murder. The
accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall and
Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.: If the record is denuded of
any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find a
wrongful act or insult of the nature

[Page 450]

and effect set forth in s. 203 (3)(a)
and (b), it is then, as a matter of law, within the area exclusively
reserved to the trial judge to so decide and his duty to refrain from putting
the defence of provocation to the jury. In this case, there was no evidence of
a wrongful act or insult upon which a defence of provocation could be founded
and be put to the jury.

Per Ritchie
and Spence JJ.: The question of whether or not there is any evidence of a
wrongful act or insult is a question of law to be determined by the trial
judge, but the further question of whether there is any evidence which could
support a finding that the wrongful act or insult was of the required nature is
a question of fact. The question of what evidence is and what is not sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is a question of
fact. The question of whether or not there was any evidence fit to go to the
jury as to the existence of “sudden provocation” is undoubtedly a question of
law for the judge as is the question of whether or not there was any such
evidence of a wrongful act or insult. As there was no evidence of a wrongful
act or insult in this case there was therefore no foundation upon which to base
the defence of provocation.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
If the trial judge holds as a matter of law, as he is entitled to do, that
the record contains no evidence of any wrongful act or insult, that is an end
to any defence of provocation. However, having concluded that there is evidence
of a wrongful act or insult of the nature required by s. 203 (2), he
cannot additionally charge the jury as a matter of law that there is no
evidence that the accused did not act upon it on the sudden and before there
was time for his passion to cool. That is a question of fact, not of law.
Parliament has so enacted and the presiding judge cannot usurp the functions of
the jury in this respect.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: The function of the trial judge as arbiter on the law is to
determine only whether there is any evidence of a wrongful act or insult. The
further question whether it was of such a nature as to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control is a question of fact for the jury, as well
as the question whether the accused himself was deprived of the power of
self-control by the alleged provocation. Under the circumstances of this case,

[Page 451]

there was evidence of a wrongful act or
insult to justify putting the defence of provocation to the jury.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan[1],
quashing a verdict of manslaughter and ordering a new trial on a charge of
non-capital murder.

E.D. Bayda, Q.C., for the appellant.

S. Kujawa, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Charged with the non-capital
murder (s. 206(2), now s. 218(2), Cr. C.) of one Anna Mazeros, the
appellant was found guilty of manslaughter by a jury presided by Johnson J.

The Crown appealed against this verdict on the
grounds that the trial judge erred in law (i) in holding that there was some
evidence of a wrongful act or insult within the meaning of s. 203(2), now
s. 215(2), of the Criminal Code  upon which a defence of provocation
could be founded and in putting that defence to the jury and (ii) in holding
that there was some evidence upon which a so-called defence of automatism could
be founded and in putting that defence to the jury.

The unanimous judgment of the Saskatchewan Court
of Appeal[2] was
delivered by Chief Justice Culliton who fully reviewed the evidence and dealt
at length with the relevant questions of law. With respect to provocation:—He
held that the acts referred to by the trial judge did not constitute
provocation within the meaning of s. 203  and that, even if they did, there
was no evidence that the accused acted upon

[Page 452]

these acts on the sudden and before there had
been time for his passion to cool. Hence the conclusion that the trial judge
erred in putting the defence of provocation to the jury. With respect to
automatism:—The learned Chief Justice expressed the opinion that, if one
accepts the evidence of Dr. Benjamin—the psychiatrist called for the
defence—that at the time Parnerkar killed Anna Mazeros he was in a dissociated
state, he was then suffering from a disease of the mind within the M’Naghten’s
rules and that if the acts committed by Parnerkar were unconscious acts, that
depended upon a defect of reason from a disease of the mind. Consequently, the
defence, if any, was one of temporary insanity and not of automatism. Hence the
conclusion that the trial judge erred in law in putting to the jury the defence
of automatism in addition to that of insanity. With respect to the instructions
given as to the latter defence, Chief Justice Culliton noted that no objection
was taken in appeal in relation thereto.

The appeal was allowed, the verdict of
manslaughter was set aside and a new trial was ordered on the indictment as preferred,
i.e., on the charge of non-capital murder.

Parnerkar now appeals to this Court pursuant to
s. 597(2), now s. 618(2), of the Criminal Code .

The opinion I have formed as to provocation
makes it unnecessary for me to deal with any question other than provocation,
and in respect thereto, I only wish to express, concisely and in my own words,
my view of the law as applicable to the facts of this case.

Our law as to provocation is expressed in
s. 203  Cr. C. of which subs. (1) provides that:

(1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would
be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person

[Page 453]

who committed it did so in the heat of
passion caused by sudden provocation.

Provocation is defined in s. 203(2):

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of such a
nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

The main issue or source of conflict of opinion,
at this stage of the proceedings in this case, stems from the provisions of
s. 203(3) and calls for the adequate determination of the area exclusively
reserved to the trial judge and the area exclusively reserved to the jury.

Section 203(3) provides:

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular wrongful
act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was deprived
of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,

are questions of fact,…

On the basis of these provisions, it is asserted
that the functions of the Trial Judge, as arbiter of the law, is to determine
only whether there is any evidence of a wrongful act or insult.

With deference and for reasons hereafter stated,
I am unable to agree with this assertion.

The provisions of s. 203(2) and the
provisions of s. 203(3) are enactments dealing with two different matters.

Subsection (2), the definition section,
states all of the constituent elements of provocation. Within the restrictive
meaning given to that word by Parliament for the purposes of the section, it
is:

(i) a wrongful act or insult,

(ii) which must satisfy

(a) the objective test and then be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person, not confronted

[Page 454]

with all the same circumstances of the
accused, of the power of self-control, and

(b) the subjective test, i.e., of
having caused the accused himself to act actually upon it,

(iii) on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool.

Subsection (3) declares that the
constituent elements, which are described in (ii)(a) and (b) above,
are questions of fact and, therefore, assigns exclusively to the jury the
function to decide as to these facts.

The function assigned to the jury with respect
to the particular facts mentioned in s. 203(3) does not in any way differ
from the function they have to decide all other questions of fact, whether
these facts constitute elements of a crime or elements of an excuse or a
justification for a crime charged. Indeed and in all of the cases, the valid
exercise of the function of the jury is, according to the very words of the
oath of office taken by them, to give a verdict according to evidence. They
cannot go beyond the evidence and resort to speculation nor, of course, would
it be proper for the trial judge to invite them to do so. If, then, the record
is denuded of any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury acting
judicially to find a wrongful act or insult of the nature and effect set forth
in s. 203(3)(a) and (b), it is then, as a matter of law,
within the area exclusively reserved to the trial judge to so decide and his
duty to refrain from putting the defence of provocation to the jury.

There is nothing, either expressed or
necessarily implied, in the language of s. 203(3) to indicate an intention
of Parliament to modify the principle according to which the sufficiency of
evidence, which is an issue only where there is some evidence, is a question of
fact for the jury and the absence of evidence is a question of law for the
trial judge.

[Page 455]

As to the question whether there was, in this
case, some evidence of a wrongful act or insult within the meaning of
s. 203(2)  of the Criminal Code  upon which a defence of provocation
could be founded and be put to the jury, I agree with the Court of Appeal that
there was no such evidence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Ritchie and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought pursuant to
s. 618, subs. (2) of the Criminal Code  from a judgment rendered by
Culliton C.J.S., on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[3], allowing an appeal by the Crown from the
verdict of the jury acquitting the appellant on the charge of non-capital
murder, setting aside the subsequent conviction of the appellant on the reduced
charge of manslaughter and directing that there be a new trial on the charge of
non-capital murder.

The origin and background of the appellant and
the course of his long association with the woman whom he admittedly killed are
accurately described in considerable detail in the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, and as this judgment has now been reported, I do not find it necessary
to do more than make reference to the circumstances which appear to me to be
directly connected with the killing which was the subject of the charge in this
case.

The appellant was born in India and when he came
to Canada in 1963, he settled in Regina, where he met a young Hungarian named
Anna Meszaros, hereafter referred to as Anna. He became interested in this
young woman and in her children, and was on very friendly terms with her until
he left Regina in 1965 and went to Toronto, where he obtained employment as an
accountant. In May 1966, Anna came to stay with him in Toronto for a week, during
which

[Page 456]

time they lived together as man and wife, and he
made a proposal of marriage which he says was accepted. After this they
exchanged letters fairly frequently, and on one occasion in December 1966, the
appellant came out to Regina, where he resumed his friendship with Anna and her
children but not his intimacy with Anna.

Between the time of this visit and December
1969, the appellant paid three brief visits to Regina, and also travelled to
Hungary in order to meet Anna’s parents at a time when she and her children
were there. It is apparent, however, that at least after the trip to Hungary,
the relationship was cooling although the appellant did pay an overnight visit
to Regina in December 1969.

On May 26, 1970, the appellant decided to go out
to Regina and, in preparing for his trip, he packed two knives in his flight
bag, together with a letter addressed to the R.C.M.P., in the following terms:

Respected Sir,

In case if I die, please give my body to
the medical students in Medical College for their studies. After that burn the
body and throw ashes in water. Under any circumstances do not give the body to
my parents and do not send it out of Canada.

I am very much sorry to give you the
unnecessary trouble but under some circumstances you are the only one who will
realize my condition. There is no need to investigate about me.

Thank you.

The appellant arrived in Regina in the evening
and went directly to Anna’s house, where he found her and her three children
outside in the yard fixing the sidewalk. After he had kissed the children, the
whole family came into the house with him. It appears that the children
displayed some affection to him at this time and at one stage the little girl
was sitting on his knee when he asked her if she wanted to be his daughter and
stated that he wanted the two boys to have professional training. The eldest
boy testified that he then told his mother that the appellant wanted to marry
her, whereupon he says that

[Page 457]

his mother at first said nothing, then laughed
and “told me she does not want to because he is black.”

In cross-examination, this boy testified that
his mother’s statement to the appellant was “I am not going to marry you
because you are a black man”, and that she also told him to go away because her
boyfriend, Bill Toth, was coming that night. After his mother had made this
remark, the boy says that the appellant took two or three letters written by
Anna out of his pocket and gave them to him. The boy took one of the letters
out of its envelope and started to read it, putting the remainder on the top of
a cupboard.

Anna appears to have been opposed to the letters
being read by the children and the boy testified that she tore up the envelope
and told the children to go outside, but that as he was going out, he turned
and saw the appellant take a knife out of his flight bag and stab his mother,
after which she fell into the living room and the appellant went in after her.
The boy says that Anna cried out to him for help and he went into the house but
found his mother on her back and the appellant on his knees stabbing her, and
that the appellant chased him out with the knife in his hand. After running
out, the boy says he looked through the living room window and saw the
appellant stab his mother and himself. The boy then alerted one of the
neighbours, who called the police, but when the first policeman arrived he
found that Anna was already dead.

The appellant’s evidence was that when the
letters were produced, Anna had protested against the children reading them and
had then torn up the one that her son had opened, saying that she did not want
the children to see references to her having been ill. After giving his
evidence about the letter having been torn, the appellant continued:

… his mother grabbed that letter and she
tore that letter, and it was falling down on the dining table, and she told me
that children should not read our letters, and I said let them read the
letters. In the meantime the boy got up and was walking I think was going out,
and at the same time I saw my girl friend leaning

[Page 458]

towards the living room side. She was
bending down like that, so I throw my black wallet on the table, and I ran to
hold her but she fell down in the living room, and my left hand was on her
right hand shoulder and I also fell down in the living room, and I noticed that
she was holding something in her stomach, and I fell down because there was a
coffee table, it touched my legs, and so I couldn’t balance my full body, so I
also fell down with her, with my hands on her hands, and she put her two hands
aside both hands, and then I saw something in her stomach and then I pulled
something out and I saw the knife.

The defence called a psychiatrist,
Dr. Benjamin, who had seen the appellant for the first time on January 20,
1971, and twice thereafter. He talked to him in all for about ten hours, during
which time he subjected him to a so-called “truth” test through the use of
sodium amutal, and gave the opinion that the appellant’s story while under the
influence of that drug was identical to that which he told prior to its
administration.

For the purpose of this appeal, the most
important part of the doctor’s evidence appears to me to be the expression of
his opinion that the appellant was in a dissociated state at the time when Anna
was killed and that this state commenced when she tore up the letter and lasted
until he pulled the knife from Anna’s stomach and realized that he had a knife
in his hand. The doctor also expressed his opinion that there was a possibility
of the appellant having suffered an “hysterical amnesia” following the
psychological blow occasioned by the tearing up of the letter. In describing
this dissociated state, the doctor said that while it lasted the appellant
would be incapable of forming any intent; incapable of appreciating the nature
and quality of the act he committed, or that such act was wrong; that he could
not appreciate the probable and natural consequences of his act. He further
stated that during the period of dissociation, Parnerkar’s acts would be
automatic or, in other words, he would be in a state of automatism and would
have no recollection or control over the events which occurred during that
period.

[Page 459]

On this evidence, the trial judge left the
defence of “automatism” to the jury, but I agree with C.J. Culliton when he
says:

In my opinion, if the evidence of
Dr. Benjamin is accepted, that Parnerkar was in a dissociated state at the
time he killed Anna, he was, at that time, suffering from a disease of the mind
within the McNaghten rules as defined by this Court. If the acts committed by
Parnerkar were unconscious acts, they depended upon a defect of reason from
disease of the mind, and consequently the defence, if any, was one of insanity,
and not of automatism. Therefore, in my respectful view, the learned trial
Judge erred in law in putting the defence of automatism to the jury. I would
also point out that Dr. Benjamin stated, if Parnerkar was in a dissociated
state, then during that time he was temporarily insane.

The learned trial judge also instructed the jury
on the defence of insanity and no objection was taken to his directions in this
regard.

In the result, the jury did not give effect to
the defenses of “automatism” or “insanity” but rather returned a verdict of
manslaughter, which must obviously have been based on the defence of
provocation and the Court of Appeal found that the learned trial judge had
erred in putting this defence to the jury on the evidence before them.

A portion of the learned trial judge’s charge to
which objection is taken, reads in part as follows:

And I tell you further as a matter of law
that there are acts or words here which may amount to provocation in law… What
may be provocation here? You’ve heard counsel deal with this—mainly two things:
the tearing up of the letter, and the symbolic severing of the bond which that
implied, and then the remark: “I will not marry you because you are black.”

[Page 460]

As will hereafter appear, I consider it to be
highly significant in relation to the question of whether the words “I will not
marry you because you are black”, constituted any evidence of provocation, that
the appellant on more than one occasion denied that he had ever heard these
words or that they were ever used.

The defence of provocation must be considered in
light of the provisions of s. 203  of the Criminal Code , which reads
as follows:

203. (1)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter
if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation.

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular wrongful
act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was deprived
of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,

are questions of fact, but no one shall be
deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a
legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in
order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to
any human being.

The learned Chief Justice in the course of the
reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, after
very extensive review of relevant cases, reached the following conclusion as to
the meaning and effect of s. 203 :

Clearly under Section 203 , to find in law
there was evidence of provocation, there must be evidence of a wrongful act or
insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self-control. The incidents of such provocation relied upon by the
trial Judge were the tearing of the letter by Anna and the statement by her “I
will not marry you because you are black.”

[Page 461]

In my view the question of whether or not there
is any evidence of “a wrongful act or insult” is a question of law to be
determined by the trial judge, but the further question of whether there is any
evidence which could support a finding that the wrongful act or insult was “of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self control” requires a finding as to what is and what is not evidence of a
wrongful act or insult sufficient to have such an effect on an ordinary person
having regard to the circumstances in which the wrongful act or insult occurs.

The question of the sufficiency of evidence is
normally one of fact for the jury and the argument that a trial judge is
authorized under s. 203  to decide as a matter of law, for example, that
certain testimony could not amount to evidence that the wrongful act or insult
was sufficient and that the case should therefore be taken from the jury, in my
opinion runs contrary to the specific language of s. 203(3)(a)
whereby the whole question of what evidence is and what is not sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self control is declared to be a
question of fact.

Section 203 , like the former s. 261 of the
1927 Criminal Code , is concerned with “sudden provocation” and, in this
regard, I adopt the language employed by Rand J., speaking on behalf of himself
and of Taschereau J., as he then was, and of the present Chief Justice in The
Queen v. Tripodi[4], where
he said:

What s. 261 of the Code provides
for is ‘sudden provocation’, and it must be acted upon by the accused ‘on the
sudden and before there has been time for his passion to cool’. ‘Suddenness’
must characterize both the insult and the act of retaliation. The question here
is whether there was any evidence on

[Page 462]

which the jury, acting judicially, could
find the existence of ‘sudden provocation’.

I take that expression to mean that the
wrongful act or insult must strike upon a mind unprepared for it, that it must
make an unexpected impact that takes the understanding by surprise and sets the
passions aflame. What was there of that here?

The question of whether or not there was any
evidence fit to go to the jury as to the existence of “sudden provocation” is
undoubtedly a question of law for the judge as is the question of whether or
not there was any such evidence of a “wrongful act or insult”. In this latter
regard, Mr. Justice Kellock, speaking on behalf of himself and
Mr. Justice Taschereau, as he then was, in Taylor v. The King[5], adopted the meaning of the word
“insult” as it is defined in The Oxford English Dictionary in the following
terms:

… an act, or the action, of attacking or
assailing; an open and sudden attack or assault without formal preparations;
injuriously contemptuous speech or behaviour; scornful utterance or action
intended to wound self-respect; an affront; indignity.

The same learned judge again applied the test
which is implicit in this definition in the reasons for judgment which he
delivered on behalf of himself and Mr. Justice Locke in The Queen v.
Tripodi, supra, at p. 445.

The questions of law to be determined by the
learned trial judge in this case in my opinion were whether or not there was
any evidence on which it could be found that Anna’s words and actions
constituted a wrongful act or insult and whether there was any evidence that
the appellant acted on a sudden as a result of such act or insult.

The only evidence as to the use of the words “I
will not marry you because you are a black man” is that of the little boy, and
it is to be remembered that the appellant more than once

[Page 463]

denied that he had heard the words used. In
direct examination the boy said:

Q. And when you said that to her that
that’s why you think he is here, he wants to marry you, what did your mother
say, do you remember?

A. She didn’t say nothing. She just
laughed.

Q. She just what?

A. Laughed.

Q. She laughed?

A. Yes.

Q. What is the next thing that was done or
was said?

A. My mother told him that she doesn’t want
to because he’s black.

Q. What did he say to that?

A. He didn’t say nothing.

Q. What did he do?

A. He gave me two or three letters, and he
told me to read them.

Q. Now, he gave you two or three letters?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, your mother was talking to him, she
said these things to him, and you say he didn’t say anything?

A. He didn’t.

On cross-examination, the boy told the same
story in slightly different language making it plain that if the words “black
man” were in fact used, they evoked no reaction from the appellant except the
production of the letters. Even if the use of the words “black man” were
considered as affording some evidence of an insult, there is not only no
evidence that the appellant acted “on the sudden” as a result of the use of
these words; but the evidence is all the other way both from the appellant
himself who did not hear the words, and from the boy who described his negative
reaction.

I am satisfied also that the tearing of the
letter, which the learned trial judge characterized as a symbolic severing of
the bond between Anna and the appellant and which the psychiatrist described as
having induced a “dissociated state” on the part of the appellant, cannot be
described as an insult within the meaning of the

[Page 464]

definition which was adopted by this Court in Taylor
v. The King, supra. To come within that definition, tearing the letter
would have to be characterized as “injuriously contemptuous… behaviour;
scornful… action intended to wound self-respect; an affront; indignity”.

The boy did not at any time state that his
mother had torn up a letter at all, but rather that the letter had been given
to him by Parnerkar, that he had opened it and that

… I had the envelope in my hand, and I had
the letter in my hand. I put the envelope on the table.

He later testified that his mother then told him
to go outside and that he

Put the letter down, and my sister and my
brother and I was walking outside, and yeah, we were going outside, and my
sister and my brother was standing by the kitchen door, I mean by the porch
door, and I went there. My Mom grabbed the envelope and she tore it up.

Q. Now, which envelope are you speaking of?

A. The one that was on the table.

Q. Is this the one you took the letter
from?

A. Yes.

Parnerkar’s evidence on the other hand was that
Anna tore the letter up and he is quite clear that he thought this was because
she did not want the children to read some reference in the letter to an
illness which she had suffered. In this regard he gave the following evidence:

Q. You say that Anna tore the letter saying
that the children shouldn’t read letters between the two of you?

A. Yes.

Q. This is why she tore it?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that what she said also: ‘I don’t
like the children to read these letters’?

A. Yes, she said children should not read
our letters.

Q. Why?

[Page 465]

A. Because in some letters she used to
mention that she is not feeling well, like that, things, some private things,
but not all the time.

Q. Are you saying that she didn’t want the
children to know that she wasn’t feeling well? 

A. Yes.

If, as Parnerkar says, Anna tore up the letter
because she did not want her children to read the references which she had made
to her illness, it does not seem to me that this act is capable of being
construed as evidence of an insult to the appellant. There is nothing in the
appellant’s evidence to suggest that he regarded the destruction of the letter
as “the symbolic severing of the bond”. His was the only evidence of the letter
being torn and it cannot in my opinion be read as meaning that this action had
anything to do with his relations with Anna, but rather that it had to do
exclusively with the relations between herself and her own children and her
reluctance to have them read references to her illness and other intimate
matters contained in the letter. I am therefore of opinion that the letter
incident cannot be construed as evidence of an insult. It was not contended in
the argument before us that the tearing of the letter was a “wrongful act” and
although it might be suggested that it was wrong in the sense that the letter
was, strictly speaking, Parnerkar’s property and Anna had no right to destroy
it without his permission, I am nevertheless satisfied that having regard to
the fact that the letter appears to have contained intimate details of Anna’s
condition which she was prepared to share with Parnerkar but entitled to keep
from her children, her act cannot be considered as wrongful within the meaning
of s. 203 .

Although I do not consider the tearing of the
letter to be any evidence of a wrongful or insulting act, it appears to have
been almost immediately followed by the brutal assault which culminated in
Anna’s death. This sequence of events must, however, be viewed in light of the

[Page 466]

evidence of the little boy as to what happened
after Parnerkar gave him the letters. His evidence is:

When he gave me the letters my Mom told us
to go and finish the sidewalk because she was expecting her boyfriend.

These words cannot in my opinion be construed as
a “wrongful act or insult”, but the actions which followed them indicate that
Parnerkar was motivated by jealousy in doing what he did.

Had there been any evidence of a “wrongful act
or insult” the learned trial judge would have been required to instruct the
jury in accordance with the judgment in this Court in Wright v. The Queen[6], to the effect that they must first
consider whether the insult relied on was of such a nature as to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self control, and if they so determined, that they
must then further consider the subjective test to determine whether the
appellant actually acted upon the provocation on the sudden before there was
time for his passion to cool. As there was in my opinion no evidence of a
“wrongful act or insult” in this case, these latter questions did not arise as
matters for the consideration of the jury and there was no foundation upon
which to base the defence of provocation.

For all these reasons, I agree with the Court of
Appeal that the learned trial judge should have instructed the jury on the
charge of non-capital murder to the effect that if they believed, upon a
preponderance of evidence, that Parnerkar was insane within the M’Naghten
rules, then their verdict would be one of “not guilty because of insanity.”

I would therefore dismiss this appeal and direct
a new trial on the charge of non-capital murder.

HALL J. (dissenting)—This appeal involves
consideration of s. 203  of the Criminal Code  of Canada which reads:

[Page 467]

203. (1)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter
if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation.

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular wrongful
act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was deprived
of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,

are questions of fact, but no one shall be
deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a
legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in
order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to
any human being.

(4) Culpable homicide that otherwise would
be murder is not necessarily manslaughter by reason only that it was committed
by a person who was being arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality
of the arrest was known to the accused may be evidence of provocation for the
purpose of this section.

The issue here is as to the functions of a trial
judge in dealing with the situation where provocation is put forward as a
defence to a charge of murder.

If the trial judge holds as a matter of law, as
he is entitled to do, that the record contains no evidence of any wrongful act
or insult, that is an end to any defence of provocation in a given case.
However, if the record contains evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury
to find “a wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control” the second aspect
of s. 203(2) , namely, whether “the accused acted upon it (the wrongful act
or insult) on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool” is
purely a matter of fact as

[Page 468]

provided by s. 203(3)(b) and not a
question of law for the judge alone.

There must, of course, be evidence upon which a
jury, acting judicially, could find that the accused was deprived of the power
of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received. In the absence
of any such evidence, the verdict would be perverse and would be set aside on
appeal. However, it is my view that once the evidence is sufficient to permit
the first aspect of s. 203(2)  (the objective test) being left with the
jury that the trial judge has no further function in law on the second aspect
of the case insofar as taking the defence away from the jury. The trial judge
has, of course, the important function of charging the jury on the evidence and
as to the second aspect of s. 203(2)  (the subjective test) to instruct the
jury that they cannot go beyond the evidence and/or resort to speculation. The
trial judge may, if he sees fit, express his opinion to the jury on the
presence or absence of evidence upon which the jury may act, but having
concluded that there is evidence of a wrongful act or insult of the nature required
by s. 203(2)  he cannot additionally charge the jury as a matter of law
that there is no evidence that the accused did not act upon it on the sudden
and before there was time for his passion to cool. The ruling that the evidence
permits consideration of the first aspect of s. 203(2)  forecloses a ruling
in law that there is no evidence to go to the jury on the second aspect of
s. 203(2) . That conclusion is a question of fact, not of law. Parliament
has so enacted and the presiding judge cannot usurp the functions of the jury
in this respect.

On the merits of the appeal, I agree with Laskin
J. and would dispose of the appeal as proposed by him.

[Page 469]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons proposed by my brother Ritchie, and I confine
myself to one point only which, in my opinion, is decisive of this appeal.

The trial judge left the issue of provocation to
the jury on the view that there was evidence of insults which could amount to
provocation in two respects; first, in the statement of the deceased to the
accused “I will not marry you because you are black”, and, second, in the
tearing up by the deceased of a letter which she sent to the accused, carrying
the implication (in the words of the trial judge in his charge) of the symbolic
severing of the bond between them.

The fact that the accused testified that he did
not hear the slur against him does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that
there was no evidence in that respect of a wrongful act or insult. The deceased’s
son John, who was a credible witness, gave evidence that the remark “I will not
marry you because you are black” was addressed to the accused in the course of
a conversation in which the witness, the deceased and the accused participated,
and it was open to the trial judge as well as to the jury to disbelieve the
accused when he said he did not hear it just as the jury disbelieved his
assertion that he did not kill the deceased. However, be that as it may, the
trial judge was certainly right to leave the defence of provocation to the jury
in respect of the incident concerning the letters which the accused produced to
the deceased and her children; and the jury was entitled to support this
defence as it did in bringing in a verdict of manslaughter.

In setting aside this verdict and in directing a
new trial on the original charge of non-capital murder, the Saskatchewan Court
of Appeal determined that the defence of provocation should not have been put
to the jury because, in its view, there was no evidence that the tearing

[Page 470]

of a letter would be provocation to an ordinary
person; and so too in respect of the utterance by the deceased that she would
not marry the accused because he was black. The proposition of law upon which
this view proceeded was stated by Culliton C.J.S. for the Court as follows:

Clearly under Section 203 , to find in law
there was evidence of provocation, there must be evidence of a wrongful act or
insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self-control.

In my opinion, this is a mistaken view of the
law on the subject as set out in s. 203  of the Criminal Code , and I
agree with Ritchie J. in his assertion that the function of the trial judge as
arbiter on the law is to determine only whether there is any evidence of a
wrongful act or insult, and that the further question whether it was of such a
nature as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control was a
question of fact for the jury, equally with the question whether the accused
himself was deprived of the power of self-control by the alleged provocation.

Because of this mistake in the law, the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal did not address itself to the narrow question open
on the law, namely, whether there was any evidence of a wrongful act or insult
in respect of the tearing of the letter under the attendant circumstances. I am
of the opinion, as was the trial judge, that there was such evidence in the
testimony of the deceased’s son John, in that of the accused himself and in the
evidence of Dr. Benjamin who sat through the trial and testified last. The
formulation of s. 203 , distinguishing the law of Canada from the common
law of England, shows the preference for giving the jury the major role on the
question of provocation, subject only to a preliminary ruling by the trial
judge on whether the conduct alleged to be provocation is capable of being a
wrongful act or insult. (S. 3 of the English Homicide Act, 1957 has
brought the law there closer to that in

[Page 471]

Canada by expressly limiting the power of a
trial judge to withdraw the issue of provocation from the jury, confirming, in
the view of one author, a gradual development by the judges themselves in that
direction: see Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law (19th ed. 1966, at
p. 175). In my opinion, a trial judge should be slow to rule adversely so
as to take this defence from the jury. Of course, in making this preliminary
assessment of the evidence, he cannot always do so abstractly, and it may not
be unreasonable for him to consider the evidence from the standpoint of the
accused’s reaction as well as putting himself in the position of the so-called
ordinary man, but without, however, making a determination of the effect upon
the accused and upon the ordinary man. It is a tentative appraisal that the
trial judge must make, and there must be a clear case for denying to the jury
the opportunity to consider provocation where it is suggested by the evidence.

In the present case, the tearing of a letter
written by the deceased to the accused was a destruction of something belonging
to the accused and to that extent a wrongful act. But in the setting in which
the act occurred, it was certainly capable of being an insult. In his
examination in chief the accused recounted how he had produced three letters
which he had received from the deceased and had handed one to her son to read
whereupon she grabbed the letter and tore it, saying to the accused that
“children should not read our letters”, to which he replied “let them read the
letters”. The knifing of the deceased by the accused, which he did not admit in
his testimony, followed almost immediately. The deceased’s son John testified
in chief that when his mother tore the letter the accused took a knife out of a
bag that he had brought with him and ran at the deceased and stabbed her. On
cross-examination he reiterated that the accused ran towards the deceased to
knife her and said further that he was mad whereas previously he was gentle. It
should be noted that the letter incident occurred just after

[Page 472]

there had been a reference to a boy friend of
the deceased who told the accused to go away because the boy friend was coming
in that night.

On cross-examination the accused testified that
the only reason the deceased did not want her letters read by the children was
because of references in them to illness that she had. He added, “I said let
them read the letters, and that was my last words”. The tearing followed, and
then the knifing. In these circumstances, the reason above mentioned attributed
by the accused to the deceased is hardly determinative, adversely to the
accused, of the question whether there was evidence of any wrongful act or
insult to go to the jury. The deceased’s reason for tearing the letter, as
narrated by the accused, does not affect the capacity of that act to be an
insult to him. Moreover, it is not evidence which stands alone, and the episode
of which it is part must also be considered in the light of the medical
evidence given by Dr. Benjamin, a qualified psychiatrist. This doctor
considered the stabbing to be, in his words, “a sudden reaction to an insult”,
resulting from a psychological blow, in this case the tearing of the letter
which in the accused’s mind was a bond between him and the deceased. As the
doctor put it, “the letter signifying the bond, it’s a very close emotional
bond particularly in Shashi’s mind, the letter would mean this bond was being
ripped apart”.

On cross-examination, the doctor was asked
whether it did not seem odd to him that a person who was supposed to be
provoked doesn’t say that he was. The answer was “no”, and it relates to what
the witness, who had examined the accused and had sat through the trial, said
in chief when asked “what things do you put into the mill as it were to
determined just how extreme or how intensive the provocation was?”. He replied:

[Page 473]

I would have to repeat the factors involved
in Shashi’s state of mind, his cultural upbringing, his social life, his
involvement with Anna, his involvement with her children, the hopes and
aspirations he had for them, the world he had built for them, and the sudden
shattering of this great idealistic world that he had.

The references I have made to the evidence make
it abundantly plain to me that under the law applicable to the defence of
provocation there was evidence of a wrongful act or insult to justify putting
that defence to the jury to enable it to determine, on all the evidence, the
objective and subjective issues committed to it under s. 203  of the Criminal
Code . Even if there be some doubt whether the trial judge was correct in
concluding that there was such evidence, I would think it rash of me to differ
from him on a matter so integral to the conduct of a jury trial which was under
his control.

It follows that I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and restore the verdict
of the jury.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Obstructing a peace
officer—Security measures for visit of foreign dignitary—Whether police acting
in execution of their duty—Criminal Code , s. 118 (a)—Police Act, 1971
(Alta.), c. 85.

The appellant was charged with having
unlawfully and willfully obstructed a peace officer in the execution of his
duty. The police had cordoned off an area in front of the entrance of a hotel
where Premier Kosygin of the U.S.S.R. was to make a short stop. The appellant
indicated to two constables that he wanted to take pictures and stated that he
wished to proceed along that part of the sidewalk which was in the cordoned off
area. Because of the appellant’s forceful insistence on his right to enter that
area, he was warned that if he did, he would be arrested. He refused to take
heed of this warning and pushed his way between two constables. He was then
arrested. The trial judge dismissed the charge on the ground that the police,
at the relevant time, were not enforcing any provisions of the Criminal
Code , or any by‑law or other law. On appeal by the Crown, the Court
of Appeal convicted the accused. That Court held that the trial judge should
have taken judicial notice that the Premier was a visiting dignitary from
another country who had already been assaulted in the City of Ottawa not long
before and that it was necessary to ensure that he be not again assaulted or be
exposed to other indignities. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The authorities were not only entitled, but
in duty bound, as peace officers, to prevent a renewal of a like criminal
assault on the person of the Premier. In this respect they had a specific and
binding obligation to take proper and reasonable steps. The conduct of the
police clearly fell within the general scope of the duties imposed upon them.
There is in the record no

[Page 444]

evidence showing that the police officers
resorted, on the occasion, to any unjustifiable use of the powers associated
with the duty imposed upon them.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division, setting aside the acquittal of the appellant. Appeal
dismissed.

B.M. Barker, for the appellant.

J.W. Shortreed, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Appellant was charged with
having on or about October 24, 1971, at the City of Edmonton, in the Province
of Alberta, unlawfully and wilfully obstructed Sergeant Grandish, a peace
officer, in the execution of his duty, committing thereby the offence then
described as follows in s. 118 (a) of the Criminal Code :

118. Every
one who

(a) resists or wilfully obstructs a
public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty or any person lawfully
acting in aid of such an officer,

(b) …

(c) …

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

Knowlton was tried and acquitted by Provincial
Judge J. Rennie.

Pursuant to s. 605(1)(a), the Crown
appealed against this judgment of acquittal. In a unanimous judgment delivered
for the Court by Mr. Justice Cairns, the appeal was allowed, the
respondent was convicted as charged and the case was remitted to the Provinical
Judge for sentence.

Hence the appeal to this Court pursuant to
s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

The charge arose out of relatively simple facts.
On Sunday, October 24, 1971, Premier

[Page 445]

Kosygin of the U.S.S.R., was to visit the City
of Edmonton as part of his official visit to Canada and, on the occasion, was
to make a short stop at the Chateau Lacombe Hotel. Police Sergeant Grandish, a
member of the Edmonton City Police Force, had been assigned to security duties
in the area surrounding the entrance to the hotel. For this purpose and with
the assistance of 25 Police Officers, he cordoned off, as instructed by his
superiors, an area in front of the entrance of the hotel, which included part
of the sidewalk on the south side of Macdonald Drive. At one point, prior to
the impending arrival of Premier Kosygin, Sergeant Grandish was called by two
constables posted on the south side of the sidewalk. There he met the appellant
who had indicated to the two constables that he wanted to take pictures and
stated that, to that end, he wished to go down Bellamy Hill, proceeding along
that part of the sidewalk which was in the cordoned off area. Sergeant Grandish
informed the appellant that he could not enter that area and, because of the
latter’s forceful insistence on his right to do so, warned him that if he did,
he would be arrested. Knowlton refused to take heed of this warning. He began
to proceed into the restricted area, pushing his way through two constables. He
was then arrested and charged under s. 118 (a) Cr. C. This incident
took place at 11.45 a.m., which, according to prior official arrangements, was
about the time at which Premier Kosygin was expected to arrive at the Chateau
Lacombe.

On these facts, the trial judge concluded his
reasons for judgment by saying:

… the police at the relevant time were not
enforcing any provisions of the Criminal Code , or any by-law or other law and
that therefore they were not acting in the execution of their duty and that
therefore the accused could not have been obstructing them and therefore not
guilty of the offence of obstruction. Finding as I do there was not any law
being enforced the accused could not have been found committing an offence so
as to justify an arrest without a warrant and therefore the charge is
dismissed.

In the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Cairns,
speaking for all the members of the Court, said:

[Page 446]

There was the evidence of Sergeant Grandish
that the area had been cordoned off by the police because of the impending
arrival of Premier Kosygin of the U.S.S.R. With this information the learned
Provincial Judge should have taken judicial notice that Premier Kosygin was a
visiting dignitary from another country who had already been assaulted in the
City of Ottawa not long before and that it was necessary to ensure that he be
not again assaulted or be exposed to other indignities.

Had this been taken into account, the
learned Provincial Judge should have been satisfied the police officers were
acting in the execution of their duties and the acts of the accused in this
case amounted to an obstruction of the execution of these duties.

Police duty and the use of powers associated
with such duty are the sole matters in issue in this appeal. The police having
interfered with the liberty of the appellant, or more precisely, with his right
to circulate freely on a public street, the questions to be determined are, as
formulated by the Court of Criminal Appeals in Regina v. Waterfield and
Another[1].

(i) whether such conduct of the police
falls within the general scope of any duty imposed by statute or recognized at
common law and

(ii) whether such conduct, albeit within
the general scope of such a duty, involved an unjustifiable use of powers
associated with the duty.

As to the first question:—Section 26(1) of the Alberta
Police Act (1971), c. 85, assigns to a member of a municipal police force,
within the limits of the municipality, all the powers and duties of a member of
the Provincial Police Force under Part I of the Statute. Section 2(1) of Part I
provides for the establishment of a Provincial Police Force “… for the
preservation of peace, order and public safety, the enforcement of law and the
prevention of crime …”. And section 3(1) of Part I states, in part, that:

3. (1) Every member of the Alberta
Provincial Police has the power and it shall be his duty to

[Page 447]

(a) perform all duties that are
assigned to police officers in relation to

(i) the preservation of peace,

(ii) the prevention of crime and of
offences against the laws in force in Alberta, and

(iii) the apprehension of criminals and
offenders and others who may lawfully be taken into custody.

It is notorious and of common knowledge that the
official visit of the head of state or high rank dignitary of a foreign
country, friendly as either may be, is an event that frequently engenders a
real or apprehended threat to the preservation of peace and that calls,
therefore, for the adoption of proper and reasonable security measures in and
by the host country. Demonstration of this assertion can hardly be here more to
the point than by merely referring to the criminal assault actually committed
on the person of Premier Kosygin, in the City of Ottawa, a few days only before
his visit to the City of Edmonton. This assault was instantly publicized
throughout Canada and was, indeed, while being committed, witnessed on
television by a very great number of persons in the country including,
admittedly, the appellant himself. From these facts, it is only natural to draw
the inference that Canadian officials specially involved in the preservation
and maintenance of peace, order, public safety and of the security of our
visiting dignitary, gained immediate knowledge of this event of regrettable
import.

According to the principles which, for the
preservation of peace and prevention of crime, underlie the provisions of
s. 30, amongst others, of the Criminal Code , these official
authorities were not only entitled but in duty bound, as peace officers, to
prevent a renewal of a like criminal assault on the person of Premier Kosygin
during his official visit in Canada. In this respect, they had a specific and
binding obligation to take proper and reasonable steps. The restriction of the
right of free access of the public to public streets, at the strategic point
mentioned above, was one of the steps—not an unusual one—which police
authorities consid-

[Page 448]

ered and adopted as necessary for the attainment
of the purpose aforesaid. In my opinion, such conduct of the police was clearly
falling within the general scope of the duties imposed upon them.

As to the second question:—We are not concerned
here with a case of false arrest, but with a case of wilful obstruction of a
police officer in the execution of his duty. Thus, even if founded, appellant’s
grievances other than those he relates to circumstances which preceded and led
to his arrest, are irrelevant. As to the latter grievances, his main, if not
only complaint, is that, notwithstanding his request, the police did not inform
him of any legal justification for their interference with his right of free
access to public streets. It is not too much to assume that all persons present
on the occasion, including appellant himself, who, as above mentioned, had
witnessed on television the criminal assault suffered in Ottawa, only a few
days before, by Premier Kosygin, were fully conscious of the situation with
respect to security. In law, appellant cannot, any more than in fact, plead
ignorance of the legal duty then performed by the police. Upon request of the
police, he produced an identification card which was found to be inadequate. He
might possibly have obtained the privilege extended to members of the press and
others to access to the restricted area had he applied for a pass at the proper
time, at the proper place and from the proper authorities. He did not. I cannot
find in the record any evidence showing that Sergeant Grandish or other police
officers resorted, on the occasion, to any unjustifiable use of the powers
associated with the duty imposed upon them.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Attempted murder—Intent—Charge
to jury—Criminal Code , ss. 21 , 24 , 201 ,202 , 210 .

The appellant shot a taxi driver while
attempting to rob him. The victim was wounded but not killed. The appellant
was, inter alia, charged with attempted murder. The trial judge told the
jury that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time the
appellant did the shooting he had the intent to kill. The appellant was found guilty
of the lesser offence of discharging a firearm with intent to endanger life. By
a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the charge of
attempted murder. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge should have directed the jury
that the intent, which must be established to support a charge of attempted
murder, is proven if the jury is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
appellant meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not. If it can be established that the
accused tried to cause bodily harm to another of a kind which he knew was
likely to cause death, and that he was reckless as to whether or not death would
ensue, then, under the wording of s. 210  of the Criminal Code , if
death did not ensue an attempt to commit murder has been proved. In the light
of the wording of s. 210 , there may be an intent to do that which
constitutes the commission of the offence of murder without that intent being
to kill the victim. When s. 24(1) of the Code refers to “an intent to
commit an offence”, in relation to murder it means an intention to commit that
offence in any of the ways provided for in the Code, whether under s. 201 
or under s. 202 .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of

[Page 400]

Appeal for British Columbia[1],
ordering a new trial. Appeal dismissed.

G.J. Lecovin, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., and F.A.
Melvin, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This appeal is from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which, by a majority of two to one,
allowed the appeal of the present respondent from the acquittal of the
appellant on a charge of attempted murder, and ordered a new trial on that
issue.

The facts are summarized in the reasons for
judgment of Nemetz J.A. as follows:

Alexander Von Heyking was a student at the
University of British Columbia. He had a part time job as a taxi driver in the
City of Vancouver. On the night of April 28th, 1970 he was flagged down by
Lajoie and a female companion and directed to drive to a West End address. On
arrival, Lajoie locked the driver’s door and before Von Heyking had turned
around, Lajoie fired a shot which missed Von Heyking. When the driver turned he
saw Lajoie holding a small black hand gun and while he was shaking it Lajoie
said, “Give me your money”. Lajoie and the female alighted from the car. The
driver radioed for help and then got out and ran. Lajoie ran after him. When
Lajoie was some 30 feet behind him, Von Heyking felt his arm suddenly go numb.
Lajoie turned and ran and the driver hailed a passing car which took him to the
hospital. There was blood on the back of the driver’s shirt some six inches below
the shoulder and he correctly concluded that Lajoie had shot him. The following
morning a surgeon extracted the bullet. It had passed about an inch below the
level of the artery, about an inch from one of the lungs and about three inches
from the heart. It is apparent that the victim luckily escaped death. Lajoie
was, inter alia, charged with attempted murder.

[Page 401]

In charging the jury, the learned trial
judge said, in part, “in order that this person may be found guilty of the
crime of the attempt to murder … you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that at the time he did that shooting he had the intent to kill that taxi
driver”. The jury found the accused guilty, not of attempted murder, as
charged, but of the lesser offence of discharging a firearm with intent to
endanger life.

The question of law, which is in issue in this
appeal, as a result of the dissent of Taggart J.A. in the Court of Appeal, is
as to whether the learned trial judge should have directed the jury that the
intent, which must be established to support a charge of attempted murder, is
proven if the jury is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant
meant to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was
reckless whether death ensued or not. Branca J.A. and Nemetz J.A. were of the
opinion that the learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in
this way. Taggart J.A. took the opposite view.

The charge of attempted murder is defined by
s. 210  (now s. 222) of the Criminal Code , which reads as
follows:

210. Every
one who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

An attempt is defined in and by s. 24  of
the Criminal Code  as follows:

24. (1)
Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt
to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the circumstances to
commit the offence.

(2) The question whether an act or omission
by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere
preparation to commit the offence, and

[Page 402]

too remote to constitute an attempt to
commit the offence, is a question of law.

Section 201  (now s. 212) of the Criminal
Code  defines culpable homicide amounting to murder as follows:

201.
Culpable homicide is murder

(a) where the person who
causes the death of a human being

(i) means to cause his death, or

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless. whether death ensues or
not;

There is judicial authority to support the
submissions of both the appellant and the respondent in respect of the issue
now in question. The appellant relies upon the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in R. v. Flannery[2]; the judgment of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in R. v. Whybrow[3]; and
the judgments of the Quebec Court of Queen’s Bench in R. v. Menard[4], and Tousignant v. R.[5] The respondent relies upon the later
judgment of the Quebec Court of Queen’s Bench in R. v. Walker[6], and the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Ritchie[7].
These authorities were reviewed in the judgments in the Court of Appeal. The
difference of view can be illustrated in the following passage from the reasons
of Nemetz J.A.:

In charging the jury as he did, the judge
was following a line of authority enunciated in Rex v. Flannery; R. v.
Menard; Tousignant v. The Queen; and R. v. Whybrow. In Whybrow, at
p. 146, Lord Chief Justice Goddard said in part:

“In Murder the Jury is told—and it has
always been the law—that if a person wounds another or attacks another either
intending to kill or intending to do

[Page 403]

grievous bodily harm, and the person
attacked dies, that is murder, the reason being that the requisite malice
aforethought, which is a term of art, is satisfied if the attacker intends to
do grievous bodily harm. Therefore, if one person attacks another, inflicting a
wound in such a way that an ordinary, reasonable person must know that at least
grievous bodily harm will result, and death results, there is the malice
aforethought sufficient to support the charge of murder. But, if the charge is
one of attempted murder, the intent becomes the principal ingredient of the
crime. It may be said that the law, which is not always logical, is somewhat
illogical in saying that, if one attacks a person intending to do grievous
bodily harm and death results, that is murder, but that if one attacks a person
and only intends to do grievous bodily harm, and death does not result, it is
not attempted murder, but wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. It
is not really illogical because, in that particular case, the intent is the
essence of the crime while, where the death of another is caused, the necessity
is to prove malice aforethought, which is supplied in law by proving intent to
do grievous bodily harm.”

With great respect, it is difficult for me
to resolve the illogicality referred to by Lord Goddard with such facility. I
prefer to follow the reasoning set out by Schroeder, J.A. in R. v. Ritchie (1970)
3 O.R. 417. At p. 423 he said, in part:

“I feel great difficulty in concluding that
the attempt is only proven when a direct intent rather than an indirect intent
within the meaning of s. 201  (a)(ii) is established. The attempt to
commit murder must surely be an attempt to commit the act with the intent as
defined in s. 201 (a)(i) and (ii) of the Code. Section 24 
and s. 201  must be read together and due regard must be had to both sections in
determining whether or not an attempt to murder has been established.

“The bare intention does not constitute a
crime and an innocent act acquires the quality of criminality only if it is
coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent. There is nothing in the
statement

[Page 404]

of this proposition to suggest that the mens
rea for attempt should be restricted to direct intention. In R. v.
Cunningham, [1957] 2 Q.B. 396 at pp. 399-400, the Court of Criminal Appeal
adopted the following principle which had been propounded by the late Professor
C.S. Kenny in the first edition of his Outlines of Criminal Law published
in 1902 and repeated at p. 186 of the 16th edition published in 1952:

“ ‘In any statutory definition of a crime,
malice must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as
requiring either (1) An actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that
in fact was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or
not (i.e., the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be
done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It is neither limited to nor
does it indeed require any ill will towards the person injured.’ ”

(I note that this quotation from Kenny is
substantially repeated in the 19th edition at p. 211.) In England (vide Whybrow,
supra, R. v. Grimwood [1962] 2 Q.B. 621 and R. v. Loughlin [1959]
C.L.R. 518) and in the United States (vide Thacker v. Commonwealth 114
SE 504) the curious result is that a greater blameworthy state of mind must be
proven on a charge of attempting to commit murder than of actually committing
murder. In essence, these cases hold that on a charge of attempted murder
nothing less than an intention to kill must be proven to establish the guilt of
the accused. I cannot agree that this is the law in Canada.

I am in agreement with the reasons of the
majority in the Court of Appeal. We are concerned in this case with the
application of certain specific provisions of the Criminal Code . Section
201  (a) provides that culpable homicide is murder where the person who
causes the death of a human being means either: (1) to cause his death, or (2)
to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause death and is reckless
whether death ensues or not.

[Page 405]

Section 210 of the Code provides that every one
who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for life. Murder may be committed if the accused
means to cause death, but it may also be committed if he means to cause bodily
harm knowing that it is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death
ensues or not. If it can be established that the accused tried to cause bodily
harm to another of a kind which he knew was likely to cause death, and that he
was reckless as to whether or not death would ensue, then, under the wording of
s. 210 , if death did not ensue an attempt to commit murder has been
proved.

Section 210 , which took effect when the new Criminal
Code  was proclaimed in 1954, is worded differently from its predecessor,
s. 264 of the old Code. That section provided that:

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life who, with intent to commit murder,
….

There then followed eight paragraphs defining
various acts; e.g., the administration of poison, wounding and shooting. The
last paragraph, (h), read: “by any other means attempts to commit
murder”, which wording is similar to the wording of the later s. 210. It
should be noted, however, that paragraph (h) was only operative
subject to the preliminary governing words “with intent to commit murder”. When
s. 210 was enacted those words were eliminated.

It was those words which were considered in the Flannery
case, when they were construed, in their context, as meaning an actual
intent to kill.

It was this kind of intent which was in the mind
of Lord Goddard in the Whybrow case

[Page 406]

when he referred to intent becoming the
principal ingredient of the crime of attempted murder.

The word “intent” does not appear in s. 210.
It appears in the definition of an attempt in s. 24 , but the reference
there is to “having an intent to commit an offence”. For the reasons already
given, it is my view that, in the light of the wording of s. 210, there
may be an intent to do that which constitutes the commission of the offence of
murder without that intent being to kill the victim.

This Court dealt with a situation somewhat
analogous to the present one in R. v. Trinneer[8]. That case was concerned with the
conviction of the accused on a charge of non-capital murder. The charge was
based on the application to the accused of s. 21(2) of the Code, which
provides:

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

The accused and a companion, Frank, who was
armed with a hunting knife, to the knowledge of the accused, forcibly drove a
woman to a lonely point some distance out of Vancouver, with the intention of
robbing her. Frank took her some distance from the car, in which the accused
remained. Frank inflicted multiple stab wounds on the woman, which resulted in
her death.

The issue of law was as to whether, on these
facts, the accused knew or ought to have known that the commission of the
offence of murder would be a probable consequence of the carrying out of the
common purpose of robbery. The Court of Appeal had held that this could only be
established if the accused knew or should have known that the death of the
deceased would be

[Page 407]

a probable consequence of carrying out the
robbery.

In allowing the appeal and restoring the
conviction this Court held that the “commission of the offence”, referred to in
s. 21(2), as applied to the offence of murder, contemplated and included
commission of that offence in the manner defined in s. 202 (a)
and/or (d) (now s. 213, which provided:

202.
Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being
while committing or attempting to commit … robbery … whether or not the person
means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death
is likely to be caused to any human being, if

(a) he meant to cause bodily harm
for the purpose of

(i) facilitating the commission of the
offence, or

(ii) facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

* *
*

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon
his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

As the offence of non-capital murder was
complete when Frank intentionally caused bodily harm to the victim resulting in
her death, while committing robbery, whether or not he meant to cause her death
or knew that death was likely to be caused, it was not necessary, in applying
s. 21(2) to the accused, to show that he knew or ought to have known that
death was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery.

In relation to the present case the important
point is that, in applying s. 21(2) to the offence of murder, this Court
held, in the Trinneer case, that “the commission of the offence” meant
commission in any of the ways contemplated by

[Page 408]

the Code and not merely its commission in the
form of an intentional killing. Similarly, in my opinion, when s. 24(1)
refers to “an intent to commit an offence”, in relation to murder it means an
intention to commit that offence in any of the ways provided for in the Code,
whether under s. 201  (now 212) or under s. 202  (now 213).

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Possession—Goods obtained by
the commission of an indictable offence—Rights of holders of conditional sales
agreements—Duty of Judge to direct jury on significance of “obtained”—Criminal
Code , ss. 312(1) (a), 283(1) .

Respondent was convicted of possessing goods
obtained by the commission of an indictable offence. The goods, T.V. and stereo
sets subject to conditional sales agreements held by third parties, had been in
a store operated by a business partnership but were found behind bales of hay
in a truck owned by appellant. There was evidence that the goods had been
removed from the store with the complicity of at least one of the partners in
the business, that a window had been broken to give the appearance of a
breaking and entering and that the partnership was on the verge of bankruptcy.
The Court of Appeal felt that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury’s
attention to the defence that the Crown had not established that the goods were
“obtained” by the commission of an indictable offence.

Held: the
appeal should be allowed and the conviction affirmed.

The word “obtained” is not to be given too
narrow a construction. The partnership was not the outright owner of the goods
which were stolen when they were taken from the store. There was here a
fraudulent conversion within the meaning of s. 283(1)  of the Criminal Code  as
the holders of the conditional sales contracts owned, or at least had a special
property or interest in, the goods.

[Page 307]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario quashing the
conviction at trial by Scott, Co. Ct. J., with a jury, and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed,
conviction affirmed.

C. Scullion, for the appellant.

R. Carter, and P. Forestell, Q.C., for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.—The respondent in this appeal, William
James Maroney, was convicted after trial before a judge and jury on the following
count:

WILLIAM JAMES MARONEY on or about the 29th
day of July, in the year 1971, at the City of St. Catharines in the
Judicial District of Niagara North in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did
have in his possession a quantity of merchandise having a total value exceeding
Fifty Dollars ($50.00) knowing it to have been obtained by the commission of an
offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 312(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code  of Canada.

He was acquitted on two other counts.

Section 312(1) (a) reads:

312. (1) Every one commits an offence who
has anything in his possession knowing that it was obtained

(a) by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by
indictment.

The merchandise referred to in the indictment
consisted of 29 television and stereo sets which, on July 28, 1971, were on the
premises of a partnership known as “House of Taylor”, in the City of St. Catharines, and formed part of its
stock. On the following day, July 29, 1971, the police found this merchandise in a truck owned by Maroney
hidden behind bales of hay. The truck was parked on Maroney’s parking lot.
There was evidence before the jury that the sets had been removed from the
premises of the House of Taylor during the night with the complicity of at
least one of the partners of the business; that the business was on the verge
of

[Page 308]

bankruptcy, and that a window had been broken to
give the appearance of a breaking and entering. While on the premises the goods
were lawfully in the possession of the partnership, having been delivered by
the manufacturers or distributors. They were subject to conditional sales
agreements held by third parties.

The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and
directed a new trial. Its reason for doing so is contained in the following paragraph:

The main ground of appeal taken by counsel
for the appellant is that there was evidence to support the theory of the
defence that the owners of the goods in question were parties to the removal
thereof from their store premises to the vehicle on the premises of the
appellant where they were found. Hence, it was argued, it could not be
contended that the Crown had established that the goods were “obtained” by the
commission of an offence punishable by indictment even if it were to be assumed
that the appellant was fully aware of the presence thereof in his van.

The learned trial judge did not direct the
jury’s attention to this point or give them any instruction with relation
thereto. This, it was contended, was non-direction amounting to mis-direction.
In fairness to the learned trial judge it must be said that neither counsel
raised this point during the course of the trial.

My opinion is that the Court of Appeal put too
narrow a construction on the word “obtained” in s. 312(1) (a). It is
obvious that in the first place, the partnership obtained possession of these
goods legally by purchase under the conditional sales agreements, and while the
goods were on the premises they were legally in possession of the partnership.
The owners, however, were the holders of the conditional sales agreements. The
partnership was not the owner except in a very limited sense. When these goods
were removed from the premises with the connivance of one or both of the
partners, they

[Page 309]

were stolen when they crossed the threshold.
There were two stages in the “obtaining”, and the second stage constituted
theft under s. 283(1) of the Code. Section 283(1) (a) reads:

283. (1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything
whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

(a) to deprive, temporarily or
absolutely, the owner of it or a person who has a special property or interest
in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it,

(b) to pledge it or deposit
it as security,

(c) to part with it under a
condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be
unable to perform, or

(d) to deal with it in such a
manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time
it was taken or converted.

On the facts of this case there was here a
fraudulent conversion within the meaning of this section. The learned trial
judge, in my opinion correctly instructed the jury on this point, telling them
that the holders of the conditional sales agreements owned these goods or, at
least, in accordance with the definition of theft, had a special property or
interest in them.

The Court of Appeal was strongly influenced by a
decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Misell[1]. This was a decision on s. 33(1) of
the English Larceny Act, 1916, 6 & 7 Geo. 5, c. 50. That
section reads:

33.—(1) Every person who receives any
property knowing the same to have been stolen or obtained in any way whatsoever
under circumstances which amount to felony or misdemeanour, shall be guilty of
an offence of the like degree (whether felony or misdemeanour) and on
conviction thereof liable...

[Page 310]

The facts of that case are that goods were
placed in the possession of a servant, who was a commercial traveller, for the
purpose of sale. He sold them at a price much below their real value and kept
the proceeds. The Court of Appeal held that “obtained” in s. 33(1) above quoted
meant “obtained physically”. What the Court really decided was that there was
no larceny in the case.

We are not concerned with larceny here but with
theft by conversion, as defined by the Criminal Code  of Canada. Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 3rd.
ed., p. 396, point out that the 1916 Larceny Act was often construed on
the tacit assumption that there was no intention to alter the previous law and
the earlier case law had lost little or no authority. We are concerned here
with a Code. We start with the Code and not with the previous state of the law
for the purpose of enquiring whether the Code has made any change. On the plain
meaning of our Code the facts of this case show the commission of an indictable
offence—theft. In my opinion, the goods were obtained by the commission of that
offence.

I would allow the appeal and affirm the
conviction.

Appeal allowed, conviction affirmed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Order excluding
witnesses—Crown witnesses failing to comply and permitted to testify—Trial
judge expressly reserving question of weight to be attached to rebuttal
evidence of only one witness—Whether error in law—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 618 (1).

The appellant was convicted at trial for
having narcotics in his possession for the purpose of trafficking contrary to
s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1. At the
outset of the trial an order excluding all witnesses was granted on the
application of counsel for the appellant. Despite this order a number of Crown
witnesses remained in the court-room while defence evidence was being given and
later were called in rebuttal. Although the trial judge expressly reserved to
himself the question of the weight to be attached to the evidence of one of
these witnesses, no similar reservation was expressly stated in relation to the
evidence of the others. On appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, by a majority, affirmed the appellant’s conviction. An appeal under
s. 618(1)  of the Criminal Code  was then brought to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: In criminal cases
where a trial judge has ordered witnesses to be excluded from the court-room,
the rule is that if a witness nevertheless remains in court (a) he is not
necessarily disqualified, although, in certain circumstances, the trial judge
may exclude his evidence; (b) the weight, if any, to be given to his evidence
is for the jury, or for

[Page 561]

the judge, if there is no jury, to decide.
Under the present circumstances, where the trial judge had expressly indicated
his understanding of the rule in the case of one of the rebuttal witnesses, it
should be assumed that he governed himself by the same considerations in evaluating
the testimony of the other witnesses who remained in court notwithstanding the
order excluding them. Accordingly, no question of substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice arose in this case.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: It was with respect to the
rebuttal evidence of only one of the Crown witnesses that the trial judge
mentioned the necessity to caution himself as to the weight it should be given.
He regarded the evidence given by the other witnesses, upon the rebuttal, as
being important, but the record indicated that he did not feel under any
compulsion to consider the effect on the weight of their evidence caused by
their remaining in court to hear the very evidence which they later, in their
testimony, rebutted. There was error in law not in the failure to recite the
caution as to these witnesses but rather in the failure to realize that a
caution was required.

APPEAL from a judgment of the majority of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the appellant’s conviction at
trial for having narcotics in his possession for the purpose of trafficking
contrary to s. 4 (2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. N‑1. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting.

[Page 562]

R. Sadownik, for the appellant.

A.A. Sarchuk, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment which are being delivered by
Ritchie J. With respect, I must differ with my learned brother’s conclusion. I
am of the opinion that Sinclair J.A., in his dissenting reasons in the Appellate
Division of the Province of
Alberta, accurately cited the practice with respect to the exclusion of
witnesses that ought to be followed in a criminal case, as follows:

1. The trial judge may order any witness,
other than the accused, excluded from the court room. Such a direction will
ordinarily apply to all witnesses whose names are listed on the indictment, to
any other persons who may be called by the prosecution, and to witnesses who
may be called by the accused.

2. Unless otherwise directed by the judge,
such a witness must remain outside the court room until all of the evidence,
including that given in rebuttal is completed.

3. If a witness nevertheless remains in
court:

(a) he is not necessarily disqualified,
although, in certain circumstances, the trial judge may exclude his evidence.

(b) the weight, if any, to be given to his
evidence is for the jury, or for the judge, if there is no jury, to decide.

In my opinion, the discretion exercised by Bowen
J. when he received the evidence of the various witnesses who had remained in
the court room despite the order for their exclusion made at the commencement
of the hearing, cannot be criticized. Bowen J. realized that when exercising
his discretion to receive the evidence of such a witness he should none the
less have regard for the fact that the witness had wilfully disobeyed the order
of the Court by remaining in the court-room despite the order for exclusion and
should consider that in weighing

[Page 563]

the evidence of the said witness. I quote the
learned trial judge’s comments when admitting the evidence of Sergeant John
William Fitzpatrick:

I think, sir, this witness will be heard.
The question of the weight of his evidence will certainly be weighed by this
court.

However, Bowen J. made no similar comment as to
the evidence of any of the other witnesses who had heard the order of exclusion
and then had remained in the courtroom relying, perhaps, on the fact that they
had not been called in chief. I would not be ready to say that such failure to
mention the necessity to caution himself as to weight in each of these cases
would justify an inference that the learned trial judge had failed to exercise
such caution apart from certain important circumstances at the trial. I cite
from the transcript as to what occurred when Detective Walter Porfon was called
in the Crown’s reply:

DETECTIVE WALTER PORFON, sworn, examined by
Mr. Mousseau:

Q. Detective Porfon, you were present while
Mr. Fallis gave his evidence?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And—

MR. SADOWNIK: By what right does he have to
be present while Fallis gave his evidence? That was one of the conditions that
the witnesses be excluded as I understood—

MR. MOUSSEAU: If I may, My Lord, he was not
called as a witness in these proceedings. He is now being called as a witness
in rebuttal.

MR. SADOWNIK: A witness is a witness. I
fail to see the distinction.

THE COURT: I think there is quite a
distinction in terms of being able to use the rebuttal evidence properly,
Mr. Sadownik. I will allow him to go ahead.

Detective Porfon had been listed as a Crown
witness on the indictment but had not been called to give evidence as part of
the Crown’s

[Page 564]

case. He was therefore in the same position as
Sergeant John William Fitzpatrick as to whom the Court had made the remark
which I have quoted above in reference to the weighing of his evidence.
Detective Porfon’s evidence in rebuttal was most critical. The accused’s
companion, Fallis, had sworn that it was he and not the accused who placed the
prohibited drugs in the trunk of the accused’s automobile. Detective Porfon
testified, in rebuttal, that Fallis had told him, Detective Porfon, that the
appellant himself had placed the drugs in the vehicle.

The learned trial judge was under a duty to warn
himself even more strictly as to the evidence of Detective Porfon than as to
the evidence of Sergeant Fitzpatrick and yet the learned trial judge was silent
as to any such necessity.

Another rebuttal witness was Corporal Murray. He
had given evidence upon the Crown’s case and he was fully cognizant of the
order excluding witnesses because part way through his testimony he noticed
that another constable, Meggison, was present despite the order excluding him
and pointed out this fact so that Meggison was directed personally by the judge
to leave the court-room. Corporal Murray was also recalled in rebuttal and
although Sinclair J.A. has come to the conclusion that he had been present
during the defence evidence there was no reference to that fact during the
course of the trial. I would presume that neither the learned trial judge nor
the defence counsel realized that Murray had been present during that period. Corporal Murray gave very
important evidence of a conversation which he had with the accused man at the
preliminary hearing when the accused had asked Corporal Murray why he wanted a
certificate of analysis that indicated there were some empty capsules since the
capsules had all been full, and also why the accused’s name appeared on the
certificate of analysis. Despite a very long cross-examination during his
evidence given upon the Crown’s case in-chief, Corporal Murray had not referred

[Page 565]

to this important evidence which might well have
been considered an admission by the accused.

The learned trial judge regarded the evidence
given by these two witnesses, Detective Porfon and Corporal Murray, upon the
rebuttal, as being important. He said:

If there were any doubt in my mind the
rebuttal evidence has certainly overcome it, particularly the evidence of
Corporal Murray who recited to the Court the statement of the accused at the
time of the Preliminary Hearing, when the accused asked why on one certificate
it indicated empty capsules—or at least why one certificate indicated empty
capsules because they were all full.

Before placing such reliance upon the evidence
of these two witnesses, Corporal Murray and Detective Porfon, the learned trial
judge should have been careful to consider the effect on the weight of their
evidence caused by their remaining in court to hear the very evidence which
they later, in their testimony, rebutted. I am, however, of the opinion, with
respect, that the learned trial judge did not feel that he was under any such
compulsion and I rely upon the remarks which I have quoted above and which I
repeat:

I think there is quite a distinction in
terms of being able to use rebuttal evidence properly, Mr. Sadownik. I
will allow him to go ahead.

I am therefore of the opinion that there was an
error in law not in the failure to recite the caution as to these last-two
named witnesses but rather in the failure to realize that a caution was
required. For that reason, I would allow the appeal.

Sinclair J.A. in giving dissenting reasons in
the Appellate Division would have quashed the conviction saying:

[Page 566]

The problem in this case is that the
evidence given by the Crown witnesses in rebuttal may be material in a new
trial. If such evidence were to be given its value would still be affected by
the fact that it came into being, at the first trial, in conditions where its
character may have been adversely affected, consciously or unconsciously, by
the evidence given by the defence witnesses. For that reason, it seems to me
that in the circumstances of this case it would be impossible for the accused
to receive a fair trial if a new one were to be directed. Accordingly, a
verdict of acquittal ought to be entered.

Surely, that comment would be applicable to any
case where an Appellate Court directed a new trial. I think that the matter
will have to be handled at that new trial and, therefore, I would, in allowing
the appeal and quashing the conviction not enter an acquittal but rather direct
a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Granpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Mr. Justice Sinclair dissenting, which affirmed the appellant’s conviction
at trial for having narcotics in his possession for the purpose of trafficking contrary
to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1. It
appears that no formal order was taken out embodying the conclusion reached by
the majority of the Appellate Division or reciting the reasons for
Mr. Justice Sinclair’s dissent, but the appeal is clearly brought under
s. 618(1)  of the Criminal Code  on the ground that that dissent was
on a question or questions of law.

Broadly speaking, Mr. Justice Sinclair’s
dissenting opinion appears to me to be limited to the proposition that, whenever
a trial judge has made an order excluding all witnesses and some

[Page 567]

are later called who have remained in court and
hear the evidence which they are called to rebut, the trial judge is required,
as a matter of law, to instruct himself orally in respect of the evidence of
each such witness that he will consider the weight to be given to that evidence
in light of the witness having remained in court in breach of the order. In
view of the narrow grounds upon which Mr. Justice Sinclair based his reasons
for judgment, I do not consider it necessary to deal with the facts which the
learned trial judge found to constitute proof of the offence as charged.

At the outset of the trial before
Mr. Justice Bowen, counsel for the appellant moved for the exclusion of
the witnesses and the learned trial judge made the following order:

All of the witnesses that are in this court
room that are going to give evidence in this matter will go outside the court
room and will remain there until such time as they are called. And they will
not communicate with any witnesses who have given evidence and gone out of the
court room.

During the course of the Crown’s evidence in
chief it was pointed out to the Court that one Constable Meggison, whose name
appeared as a witness on the indictment, had remained in the court and he was
duly excluded from the courtroom. Constable Meggison was, however, later called
for the sole purpose of proving the service on the appellant of the
certificates of analysis of the narcotics which had been seized. No objection
was taken to this evidence at the time but he was subjected to
cross-examination as to the facts by counsel for the appellant. While
Mr. Justice Sinclair does not take express objection to Meggison having
been called as he was, it is quite apparent that the fact of calling him after
the order for exclusion is viewed at least with suspicion by counsel for the
appellant.

After the evidence for the defence had been
completed three witnesses were called in rebuttal. The first was Corporal Murray
who had

[Page 568]

already testified in chief and of whom
Mr. Justice Sinclair says:

Although the record is not clear on this
point, it seems probable that he had remained in the court room after leaving
the stand, and that he was present while the appellant and Fallis testified. No
objection was, however, made by counsel for the appellant.

The next Crown witness in rebuttal was Detective
Porfon who had been named on the indictment and not previously examined by
either side. Counsel for the appellant at once objected and the following
colloquy ensued:

MR. SADOWNIK: (for the appellant) By what
right does he have to be present while Fallis gave his evidence? That was one
of the conditions that the witnesses be excluded as I understood—

MR. MOUSSEAU: (for the Crown) If I may, My
Lord, he was not called as a witness in these proceedings. He is now being
called as a witness in rebuttal.

MR. SADOWNIK: A witness is a witness. I
fail to see the distinction.

THE COURT: I think there is quite a
distinction in terms of being able to use the rebuttal evidence properly,
Mr. Sadownik. I will allow him to go ahead.

The Crown then called Staff Sergeant Fitzpatrick
whose name had appeared on the indictment but who had not been previously
examined, although he had been present for part of the appellant’s evidence and
for that of the appellant’s companion, Mr. Fallis. Counsel for the accused
again objected and the Court made the following ruling:

THE COURT: I think, sir, this witness will
be heard. The question of the weight of his evidence will certainly be weighed
by this Court.

The ratio decidendi of the dissenting
opinion is, in my opinion, aptly summarized in the fol-

[Page 569]

lowing paragraph of Mr. Justice Sinclair’s
reasons for judgment:

As I have mentioned, in my opinion none of
the Crown witnesses called in rebuttal ought to have been present while defence
evidence was being given. The fact that they were undoubtedly affects the
weight to be given to their testimony. It was only with respect to the rebuttal
evidence given by Detective Sergeant Fitzpatrick that the learned trial judge
said he would consider the weight it should be given. However, nowhere did he
direct himself as to the weight to be given to the rebuttal evidence of
Corporal Murray and Detective Porfon, bearing in mind that it may have been
affected by their being present when the very evidence they were called to
rebut was being heard. In my view, in the circumstances here, that was a wrong
decision on a question of law, and the judgment should be set aside unless this
Division is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred.

In the result Mr. Justice Sinclair would
have directed that a verdict of acquittal be entered.

In the course of his reasons for judgment the learned
dissenting judge examined a number of cases and appears to have given at least
tacit approval to the observations of Edmund Davies L.J. in the case of Moore
v. Lambeth County Court Registrar[2], where
he said, at p. 142:

No rule of law requires in a trial that the
witnesses to be called by one side must all remain out of the court until their
turn to give testimony arises. This is purely a matter within the discretion of
the court. Indeed, if the court rules that witnesses should be out of court and
a witness nevertheless remains inside, while the judge may well express his
grave displeasure over such disobedience, he has no right to refuse to hear the
evidence of such a witness.

This state of the law has existed in England from the earliest times and reference
can conveniently be made to the case of Cook v.

[Page 570]

Nethercotte[3], which is a
judgment of Baron Alderson, and Thomas v. David[4], in which Mr. Justice Coleridge
presided at Assize in March 1836. In the former case, the headnote reads:

It is no ground for rejecting a witness’s
evidence, that he remained in Court after an order for all witnesses to leave
the Court, it is merely a matter of observation on his evidence.

while in the latter case Coleridge J. stated the
rule as follows:

The rule you refer to in in the Court of
Exchequer is confined to revenue cases, in other cases, the rule there is the
same as it is in the other Courts, namely, that the rejection of the evidence
is entirely in the discretion of the Judge; and that being so, I think that
under the particular circumstances of this case I shall be exercising sound
discretion in rejecting the evidence.

The purport of Coleridge J.’s statement is made
even clearer in the headnote of that case which reads:

If a witness come into Court and hear some
of the evidence after the witnesses have been ordered out of Court, it is
entirely in the discretion of the Judge whether he shall be examined or not;
and this is so in the Exchequer as well as in other Courts, the only difference
in that Court being confined to revenue cases, in which the rule is strict,
that such witnesses cannot be examined.

As the learned trial judge has noted,
Mr. Justice Erskine in the case of Chandler v. Home[5] made the following comment on the
treatment to be accorded to witnesses who had remained in court after an order
for exclusion:

It used to be formerly supposed that it was
in the discretion of the judge whether the witness should be examined. It is
now settled and acted upon by all the judges that the judge has no right to
exclude the witness; he may commit him for the contempt, but he must be
examined; and it is then matter of remarkon the value of his testimony that he
has wilfully disobeyed the order.

[Page 571]

Mr. Justice Sinclair also refers to the
more recent English cases of R. v. Briggs[6]
and R. v. Thompson[7] in
which the well-established rule is restated, and he also had occasion to refer
to the Canadian case of Black v. Besse[8],
where Proudfoot J. said, at p. 523:

…I think the practice is, that the evidence
of such a witness should be received, but with great care.

The Canadian case of R. v. Carefoot[9] was also made the subject of comment
by the learned dissenting judge. In that case the magistrate presiding at trial
had refused to hear a Crown witness who remained in court after an order for
exclusion was made. On appeal by way of stated case LeBel J. ordering a new
trial said, at p. 335:

When an order has been made for the
exclusion of witnesses one side, and sometimes both sides, are unaware of all
that a witness may say in the course of his testimony, and if it becomes
necessary unexpectedly to call some present in the Court room in rebuttal, this
person cannot be said to be included in the order for exclusion. Moreover, if
witnesses remain in Court after an order has been made for their withdrawal, a
Court has no right to exclude their testimony however much a witness’
disobedience of the order may lessen the value of his evidence and render him
liable to prosecution for contempt …

I think that when Mr. Justice LeBel
referred to the unexpected necessity of calling some person present in the
court-room in rebuttal he must be taken to have been referring to a witness who
the Crown had not originally intended to call and I think his remarks are
particularly apt in dealing with the case which he had before him where there
appears to have been some doubt as to whether the witness had been present in
the court when the exclusion order was made.

[Page 572]

Mr. Justice Sinclair, in the course of
giving approval to the practice followed in Alberta in criminal cases where a
trial judge has ordered witnesses to be excluded from the court room, included
the following rule:

If a witness nevertheless remains in court:

(a) he is not necessarily disqualified,
although, in certain circumstances, the trial judge may exclude his evidence.

(b) the weight, if any, to be given to his
evidence is for the jury, or for the judge, if there is no jury, to decide.

In the present case the learned trial judge
expressly reserved to himself the question of the weight to be attached to the
evidence of the last Crown witness, Fitzpatrick, and it appears to me that
Mr. Justice Sinclair’s dissent rests upon the contention that a similar
reservation should have been expressly stated in relation to the evidence of
Corporal Murray and Detective Porfon. In my view, however, Mr. Justice
Bowen’s failure to state orally that he would reserve to himself the question
of the weight to be attached to the evidence of the last‑named witnesses
cannot be construed as meaning that he was not giving the same consideration to
their evidence as he did to that of Fitzpatrick and thus complying with the
rule which Mr. Justice Sinclair himself recognizes. I am in fact of
opinion that under the present circumstances, where the learned trial judge had
expressly indicated his understanding of the rule in the case of Fitzpatrick,
it should be assumed that he governed himself by the same considerations in
evaluating the testimony of the other witnesses who had remained in court notwithstanding
the order excluding them.

In light of the above, it will be seen that in
my view no question of substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can arise in
this case.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA, APPEAL DIVISION

Appeal—Jury—Credibility—Function of
jury—Whether verdict contrary to weight of evidence—Test to be applied by
appellate court.

Trial—Denial
of motion to take case from jury—Inflammatory terms—Adequacy of
Judge’s direction.

The three vehicles involved were being driven
east on the Trans-Canada Highway near Monastery, N.S., between 1 p.m. and 2
p.m. on a clear, dry Sunday afternoon. An accident occurred when the truck
driven by Spagnoletti struck the rear of the car owned and driven by Auld. The
third car driven by Landry was part of the res gestae but not involved
in the actual collision. The evidence at trial was confusing and contradictory,
involving three completely different, yet corroborated, versions by the three
drivers. The jury found Spagnoletti 100 per cent at fault and judgment was
rendered accordingly. The Appeal Division came to the conclusion that the
jury’s findings should be set aside as being against the weight of the
evidence.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed with costs.

Per Ritchie
J.: The governing consideration rests upon an assessment of the credibility of
witnesses. It was the function of the jury to weigh that evidence and there
were none of the very exceptional circumstances which sometimes exist and
entitle an appellate Court to undertake that function.

[Page 821]

Per Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The test to be applied in a matter of this
kind allowed the jury to accept the uncorroborated testimonies of Mr. and
Mrs. Auld, especially since the evidence as a whole was confusing and
contradictory. Credibility is essentially the domain of the jury. A jury
verdict should not scrutinized with a magnifying glass but should be applied
reasonably if the entire picture is clear.

There was no reason to interfere with the
trial judge’s decision, affirmed in the Court of Appeal, to deny the
defendants’ motion that the case be taken from the jury because of what counsel
referred to as “inflammatory terms”.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division[1]
allowing an appeal from a judgment at trial of Bissett J. with a jury. Appeal
allowed with costs.

J.M. Davidson, and R. Parker, for the
plaintiffs, appellants.

D.R. Chipman, Q.C., for the defendants,
respondents.

W.J. Grant, Q.C., and C.A. Beckett, for the third-parties,
respondents.

RITCHIE J.—This was indeed a case where, as
Mr. Justice Cooper observed in the course of his reasons for judgment:
“The evidence as to how the accident happened can only be described as
confusing and contradictory.”

In my opinion the governing consideration in
determining liability here rests upon an assessment of the credibility of the
witnesses. The members of the jury obviously believed the evidence of the
appellants notwithstanding the fact that it conflicted in many important
particulars with the evidence of others, but it was their function to weigh
that evidence and, with the greatest respect for the views expressed in the Appeal
Division, I cannot find in this case the

[Page 822]

kind of very exceptional circumstances which
sometimes exist entitling an appellate court to undertake that function.

I sympathize with the conclusion reached by the
Appeal Division and it is one which I might well have reached had I been
sitting on the jury; but handicapped by the great disadvantage of not having
seen and heard the witnesses, I am unable to substitute my assessment of their
credibility for that of the jury.

For these reasons I would dispose of this appeal
in the manner proposed by my brother de Grandpré.

The judgement of Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—As a result of a motor car
accident, the following actions were commenced:

Mr. and Mrs. Auld against Wallace
and Spagnoletti with Landry and Eastern Automobile as third parties; Wallace
also entered a counterclaim.

Webb against Auld, Landry and Eastern
Automobile with Wallace and Spagnoletti as third parties.

OSF Industries against Auld, Landry,
Eastern Automobile with Wallace and Spagnoletti as third parties.

The Auld case was set for trial before a judge
and jury in Pictou and the parties agreed that the determination of liability
by the jury (subject to any appeal) would be binding on all of them.

To bring the problem before this Court, leave to
appeal, where needed, was granted by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia.

The main point in issue is thus the
determination of the liability for an accident where a large trailer truck, 56
feet in length, belonging to Wallace and driven by Spagnoletti, struck the rear
of a passenger car owned and driven by Auld. A third motor car belonging to
Eastern Automobile and driven by Landry, although not physically involved in
any impact, was from the

[Page 823]

outset considered part and parcel of the res
gestae for reasons that will appear shortly.

All three motor cars were being driven from west
to east, that is from Antigonish to Cape Breton on Trans-Canada
 Highway (No. 104) near Monastery. It was between 1 and
2 p.m. on March 1, 1970, a Sunday. The weather was nice and the pavement dry.

The accident occurred near the eastern end of a
bridge having some 315 feet in length and 32 feet 4 inches in width between
concrete curbs. On the west side of the river, the road goes down into the
valley for more than half a mile and the grade for the last 2000 feet is
approximately five per cent. For one driving east, there is a good visibility
west of the bridge for approximately 2000 feet. From the east side of the
bridge, the road goes up the other side of the valley and there is a similar
grade of five per cent for approximately 2000 feet. Soon after the road leaves
the bridge on the east side, it curves slightly to the left for approximately
500 feet. To complete the basic picture, two other facts should be mentioned:

1. both east and west of the bridge, the paved
portion of the highway is wider, the paved shoulders being much more
substantial off the bridge than on the bridge;

2. the day before the accident with which we are
here concerned, another accident had taken place on the bridge as a result of
which some 20 feet of the railing had been torn off near the eastern end of the
bridge on the south side, namely the right hand side in the direction followed
by the three motor cars.

Three completely different versions of the
accident were given in evidence by the three drivers:

1. Auld told the jury that at all material time
he had been proceeding well below the speed limit on his own side of the road
when as he was approaching the eastern end of the bridge

[Page 824]

he was overtaken by Landry and immediately
afterwards struck on the rear left side by the truck which sent his car
spinning around; the evidence discloses that after the accident Auld’s car was
more or less at the east end of the bridge, looking back towards the west,
partly on the westbound lane partly on the north paved shoulder;

2. Landry, for his part, testified that he at no
time overtook Auld and that the impact between Auld’s car and the trailer truck
occurred behind him, as a result of which Auld’s car was seen practically
overtaking Landry’s automobile in the westbound lane proceeding backwards
whereas the truck left the bridge behind Landry through the opening created by
the accident of the previous day; Landry maintains that he was well on his side
of the road and proceeding at a speed in the neighbourhood of 50 miles per
hour;

3. Spagnoletti, the truck driver, stated that
before he entered the bridge when driving at about 50 miles per hour, he saw
the two cars almost half a mile ahead of him; he was getting closer to the
bridge when he noticed what he described in his own words:

When I started getting closer to the
bridge, I noticed the one car stop and I was starting to come up close behind
and so I tried to stop my vehicle. But it takes quite a long distance to stop
that vehicle and I didn’t think it would stop in time, in my opinion.

The second car was then stopped or nearly
stopped behind the first one; when Spagnoletti made that decision to overtake
them, the two cars were 400 or 500 feet in front of him; then Auld slowly swung
out to overtake Landry at which time the truck itself was already occupying the
left lane for traffic proceeding from west to east; it was not possible to avoid
an accident and, although the brakes were applied to reduce the speed to 30
miles per hour, the truck crashed into the rear

[Page 825]

of Auld’s car and finally landed on the east
bank of the river below the bridge having gone around the front of Landry’s
automobile.

The passengers in the two automobiles supported
their respective drivers but Webb, the companion of Spagnoletti in the truck,
did not see the accident being asleep at the time. However, Spagnoletti’s
evidence (except as to speed) was substantially corroborated by an independent
witness, one Snow, and to a lesser extent by the two companions of that
witness.

Snow had stopped his small truck on the north
shoulder west of the bridge, had crossed the roadway on foot and had walked a
few feet on the south concrete curb in an easterly direction towards the
opening in the railing of the bridge when he heard and saw the motor cars and
the accident. At that time, his companions were seated in the truck. Two points
in Snow’s evidence should be underlined:

1. Landry would have been stopped directly
across from the hole in the railing of the bridge;

2. the speed of the truck at impact was around
50 or 55 miles per hour.

With this evidence in the record, the jury came
to the following conclusion:

1. Was there any negligence on the part of
Spagnoletti which caused or contributed to the damages?

“Yes”

If so, of what did such consist?

1. Inexperience.

2. Apparent lack of control of his vehicle.

3. Failure to signify intention to pass by
blowing his horn.

2. Was there any negligence on the part of
Landry which caused or contributed to the damages?

“No”

If so, of what did such consist?

3. Was there any negligence on the part of
Auld which caused or contributed to the damages?

[Page 826]

“No”

If so, of what did such consist?

4. If your answer to more than one of
questions 1, 2 and 3 is “yes”, is it possible for you to apportion the
percentage of fault of each of the persons referred to in those questions that
you answered “yes”?

“Yes”

5. If your answer to question 4 is “yes”,
what percentage of fault do you attribute to each?


 
  
  (a) Spagnoletti
  
  
  —
  
  
  100%
  
 
 
  
  (b) Landry
  
  
  —
  
  
  0%
  
 
 
  
  (c) Auld
  
  
  —
  
  
  0%
  
 


Judgment was rendered in accordance with the
verdict but the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia came to the
conclusion that the jury’s findings cannot stand because “they are against the
weight of evidence and such that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and
acting judicially could have reached”. Of course, the Court of Appeal explicity
adopted the test laid down by Duff C.J. in McCannell v. McLean[2].

The question to be determined by this Court is
whether or not the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was
right in thus setting aside the jury’s verdict. In my opinion, the answer must
be in the negative.

Cooper J., speaking for the Court, prefaced his
detailed examination of the evidence with the statement: “The evidence as to
how the accident happened can only be described as confusing and
contradictory”. This review of the evidence undertaken by Cooper J. was
concluded with the following:

The jury in answering question three must
have accepted the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Auld as to how the
accident happened. Could they have done so in view of the evidence as a whole
and if they acted judicially? In the first place, one thing that seems
established is that there were only two motor vehicles on the bridge
immediately prior to the accident. One was the Auld vehicle and the other the
Landry vehi-

[Page 827]

cle. The evidence of Snow, his wife, and
Spagnoletti is that it was the second in line of the two vehicles that was
struck. In other words, the Landry vehicle was at all relevant times ahead of
the Auld vehicle. The evidence of the Landrys was to the same effect. There is
no support in any of the evidence of any of the witnesses other than
Mr. and Mrs. Auld that the Landry vehicle has been behind the Auld
vehicle and had passed the Auld vehicle.

If the Auld version of the accident is
correct, the impact occurred in the right-hand traffic lane for vehicles
proceeding from west to east.

The evidence of Mr. Snow and his wife
and Spagnoletti is that the impact occurred in the left-hand lane. In fact, no
witness supports the Auld version in this respect. The Landrys, father and son,
did not see the impact, but saw the Auld vehicle in the left-hand lane. Their
evidence as to the car proceeding in reverse direction at the speed it must
have been going if their testimony is correct is clearly incredible, but their
evidence as to the Auld vehicle being in the left-hand lane is consistent with
the evidence of the other witnesses. Moreover, Mr. Auld said that upon
impact his car ‘took a right-hand turn around and when it swung, the car was
facing Antigonish with it stopped’ and again in answer to the question, ‘You’re
saying your car spun to the right?’ he said ‘spun to the right’. If the Auld
vehicle was in its right-hand lane upon impact as Mr. Auld said it was, it
seems almost impossible for it to have stayed on the road and have ended up as
Mr. Auld said it did.

Surely, the test to be applied in a matter of
this kind allowed the jury to accept the uncorroborated testimonies of
Mr. and Mrs. Auld, especially in a matter where the evidence as a
whole is “confusing and contradictory”. Credibility is essentially the domain
of the jury. This in itself should dispose of the appeal and bring us to the
conclusion that the verdict of the jury should be restored.

However, I would like to add a few words:

1. If the Auld’s vehicle was in its right hand
lane upon impact, it is quite possible for it to have spun around and to have
ended up in its left-hand lane facing in the other direction;

[Page 828]

the width of the pavement at the scene of the
accident is certainly substantial enough to accommodate a Chevrolet motor car
having a maximum length of 17½ feet;

2. It was physically impossible for the accident
to have occurred in the fashion described by Spagnoletti and Snow considering
that, according to them, Landry’s car was stopped opposite the hole in the
railing created by the accident of the previous day and that Spagnoletti’s
truck left the bridge through that opening; Landry’s car would then have been
very much involved physically in the accident;

3. On the pure “weight” aspect of the evidence,
four witnesses have stated that Landry never stopped on the bridge as opposed
to four who stated that such stopping took place.

I cannot but repeat with respect that the jury
acting judicially could have reached the verdict expressed in their answers.

Counsel for respondents has argued very strongly
that by stating that Spagnoletti had been negligent for his “failure to signify
intention to pass by blowing his horn”, the jury had accepted the version of
the accident offered by the truck driver and the independent witness Snow. I am
unable to accede to this proposition. Whatever was meant by that answer (with
imagination, it is possible to give it many meanings), the proper approach is
to look at the verdict as a whole and to determine what conclusions were truly
reached by the jury. In the present instance, it is clear that they meant to
put all of the blame on Spagnoletti and that, in their view, neither Auld nor
Landry had contributed to the accident. As has been mentioned repeatedly, a
jury’s verdict should not be scrutinized with a magnifying glass but should be
applied reasonably if the entire picture is clear. In the present case, I have
no doubt that it is.

The defendants respondents have submitted that
should this Court come to the conclusion that on its face the jury’s verdict
should stand, a new trial should nevertheless be ordered

[Page 829]

because of the three submissions made to the
Court of Appeal but not accepted by that Court.

In his address to the jury, counsel for Landry
said:

There is a story told about long ago, a man
on his way to Samaria who had a problem along the road and some kind man came
by and helped him and it comes to us as the story of the Good Samaritan, that
we all know—and we all know well. But today, in New York and the major cities
such as Montreal and, I presume, in Toronto, there is the doctrine of
non-involvement—’Let thy brother perish by the side of the road but don’t
bother me—don’t get me involved—don’t bother me with your troubles—you look
after your own and don’t bother me.’

James Landry, at his own personal risk,
because there was fire already started there, helped haul Webb out of the cab
to safety and I think that photograph very graphically shows the wreckage of
that cab. And he helped haul him out to safety, so that he could get back to Ontario to sue him; put out the flames so
that the Wallace van wouldn’t be destroyed or the Ontario fixture company wouldn’t have their material burnt and, as it
turned out, so they could later sue him and bring him into this court today.

Counsel for Spagnoletti and the Storage Company
forthwith made a motion that the case be taken away from the jury because of
what he described as inflammatory terms. This motion was denied by the trial
judge and this judgment was affirmed on appeal, the court below relying in particular
upon Dale v. Toronto R. Co.[3] I
do not see any reason to come to a different conclusion.

A second ground was the rejection by the trial
judge of the evidence of constable Dwyer with respect to a conversation with
Mr. Auld. Here again the Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge and I
am disposed to confirm on the simple ground that the evidence of the constable,
which had been submitted to the trial judge on a voir dire, could not
have substantially

[Page 830]

modified the picture so that no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice was thereby occasioned.

As to the alleged misdirection of the jury on
the law, particularly because the trial judge did not refer explicitly to the Motor
Vehicle Act, I do not see that there was such obligation on his part. The
Court of Appeal underlined that, reading the charge as a whole, the jury were
clearly told all they needed to know about the law.

On the whole, I would maintain the appeal, set
aside the rule of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
dated October 9, 1973, and reinstate the order of the Trial Division, dated May 11, 1972, with costs throughout.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Constitutional law—Civil rights—Criminal
trial—Right to interpreter during Judge’s charge.

Criminal law—Trial—Refusal of right to
interpreter by trial judge on basis of possible distraction of jury—Criminal
Code , s. 577(1) —Canadian Bill of Rights, s. 2 (g).

Respondent, whose mother tongue is Italian,
was tried on a charge of non-capital murder. He was unable to follow the
proceedings at the trial without the services of an interpreter and was
accordingly provided with an interpreter at the start of the trial. The trial
judge having invited submissions from cousel, particularly with respect to the
interpretation of the addresses to the jury and his charge, indicated that he
would dispense with the interpreter’s services when all the evidence was in.
The trial judge did permit the addresses of the jury to be interpreted as they
were delivered but ruled that with respect to his own charge there would be no
interpretation at all during that charge. The Court of Appeal allowed the
respondent’s appeal on the point that the accused had been deprived of his
categorical right to hear the judge’s charge.

Held (Judson
and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.:
Section 2 (g) of the Canadian Bill of Rights provides that
in the absence of express alleviation by Parliament every law of Canada shall
be construed so as not to “deprive a person of the right to the assistance of
an interpreter in any proceedings in which he is involved…, if he does not
understand or speak the language in which such proceedings are conducted”.
There is no room in the present case to deny to s. 2(g) the efficacy
which the language in which it is couched carries.

[Page 625]

Although a trial judge may be justified in
refusing to allow his charge to be interpreted while he is giving it he is not
relieved from giving effect to s. 2(g) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
in some other way.

Per Judson and
de Grandpré JJ., dissenting: The right to translation, the rule in s. 2(g)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights has to be read in the light of the other
rights of the accused, particularly the right to be tried by a jury properly
instructed. The trial judge formed the conclusion that a danger existed that
the jury would be distracted by the voice of the interpreter translating the
charge as it was being read and decided that in the circumstances the right to
translation should not take precedence. As neither appellate Court is familiar
with the facts on which the trial judge based this conclusion his finding
should be given its full weight.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] allowing an appeal
from a conviction for non-capital murder and directing a new trial. Appeal
dismissed, Judson and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

W.J. Parker, for the appellant.

A. Maloney, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal by the Crown from
an order of the Ontario Court of Appeal, directing a new trial of the accused
on a charge of non-capital murder, comes here by leave of this Court on the
following question of law:

Did the learned trial judge err in law in
ruling that during his charge to the jury the accused should not have the
services of an interpreter?

Although counsel for the respondent accused, as
was his right, sought to sustain the order for a new trial on other grounds
such as misdirection by the trial judge on provocation, misdirection with
respect to the application of s. 212 (c) of the Criminal Code , and
failure to charge the

[Page 626]

jury that they had a duty to bring in a verdict
of manslaughter if they were in any doubt as between murder and manslaughter,
the Court was of the opinion, which it conveyed at the hearing, that none of
these grounds was made out. The only question for consideration then is that on
which leave was given to the Crown.

It is admitted that the accused needed the
services of an interpreter, and one was provided who proved very capable and
was able to carry out her duties without interfering with the orderly course of
the trial. As directed by the trial judge, she sat in a chair adjoining the
prisoner’s dock and interpreted to the accused from that position.
Consideration was given by the trial judge during the trial to the function of
an interpreter in a criminal trial, and submissions were invited by counsel,
especially with respect to the interpretation of the addresses to the jury and
the charge of the presiding judge. Although he indicated that he would dispense
with the interpreter’s services when all the evidence was in, the trial judge
permitted the addresses to the jury to be interpreted as they were delivered,
counsel for the Crown being content to have this done. However, with respect to
his own charge, the trial judge ruled that there should be no interpretation,
saying that “the prime consideration is the distraction of the jury… I think
there is a fair chance, certainly enough of a chance for me to decide there
will be no translation at all during the charge”. And so it was. No alternative
way of providing an interpretation of the charge, which lasted one hour and ten
minutes, was considered. Counsel for the accused contended throughout that all
the proceedings should be interpreted and objected to the trial judge’s ruling.

[Page 627]

On these facts, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded
that there had been a violation of s. 2(g) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights in the application of s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code  which,
so far as material here, provides that “an accused other than a corporation
shall be present in Court during the whole of his trial”. Section 2(g)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights provides that every law of Canada, unless
there is express alleviation by Parliament, shall be construed and applied so
as not to “deprive a person of the right to the assistance of an interpreter in
any proceedings in which he is involved or in which he is a party or a witness
before a court, commission, board or other tribunal, if he does not understand
or speak the language in which such proceedings are conducted”.

It is sufficient to say that I agree completely
with the Ontario Court of Appeal in making s. 2(g) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights the principal ground of its order for a new trial. There is,
in my opinion, no room in the present case to deny to s. 2(g) the
efficacy which the language in which it is couched carries. Assuming that there
may be cases where the trial judge may reasonably apprehend that the jury will
be distracted from attention to his charge by a concurrent interpretation to
the accused and that he may thereupon be justified in refusing to allow his
charge to be interpreted while he is giving it, such apprehension does not
relieve the trial judge from giving effect to s. 2(g) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights in some other way.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Judson and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J. (dissenting)—With leave of
this Court, the Crown submits the following question of law:

Did the learned Trial Judge err in law in
ruling that during his charge to the jury, the accused should not have the
services of an interpreter?

[Page 628]

Respondent was tried on a charge of non-capital
murder.

The mother tongue of respondent is Italian and
it is common ground that he was unable to follow the proceedings at the trial
without the aid of an interpreter.

Accordingly, he was provided with the services
of an interpreter at the start of the trial. This interpreter was seated beside
the accused but outside the dock. At the end of the first day of trial, after
emphasizing that the translation had caused no interference, the trial judge
asked counsel for their views as to the extent to which translation should be
used in the trial. At that stage counsel for the accused submitted that Reale
should be able to follow not only the evidence but the addresses of counsel and
the judge’s charge to the jury.

The trial judge expressed the preliminary
opinion that understanding of the evidence was essential, but that the
addresses and charge were in a different category. However, on the sixth day of
the trial the judge returned to the question, and after considering the
authorities submitted to him, arrived at the following conclusion:

The prime consideration is the distraction
of the jury… I think that there is a fair chance, certainly enough of a chance
for me to decide there will be no translation at all during the charge.

It was accordingly held that the addresses would
be translated, but the charge would not be.

Then the interpreter can do that as long as
there is silence during the charge.

Counsel did not raise the question again at the
close of the charge, and it was not suggested that the accused should have an
opportunity of knowing what the judge had said to the jury.

In the appeal of the accused to the Court of
Appeal of Ontario, he raised
several points, only one of which was allowed by the Court, namely that the
accused had been deprived of his categorical right to hear the judge’s charge,
a right

[Page 629]

conferred on him by both s. 577  of the Criminal
Code  and the Bill of Rights. The Court of Appeal set forth its
reasoning in a lengthy judgment, now reported in R. v. Reale[2], which it is not necessary to
summarize here.

With all due respect to those who do not share
my opinion, I should say at once that I am unable to accept the conclusion of
the Court of Appeal in these circumstances.

Section 577  of the Criminal Code  gives
the accused the right to be present at his trial from the beginning to the end.
In so far as actual physical presence is concerned, it is clear that this right
is of an absolute nature, except of course for the three exceptions mentioned
in para. (2) of the section. To realize this we need only refer to the decision
of this Court in The Queen v. Meunier[3]. Nothing can rectify physical absence,
however short, again with the exception of the three cases listed in the
section.

In principle, this physical presence means
active presence, by which the accused is able to understand what is taking
place. The case law on the point is clear, and long before the Bill of
Rights, the courts recognized the necessity of translation enabling the
accused to fully understand the course of events at his trial. See for example R.
v. Lee Kun[4]. However,
the courts have never to my knowledge held that the accused who is represented
by counsel had an absolute right to follow, through the services of an
interpreter, the evidence, the addresses and the charge by the judge. In the
view of the judges who have dealt with this point the obligation was rather to
enable the accused to have an accurate understanding of the nature of his trial
and of the evidence against him.

Did s. 2(g) of the Bill of Rights alter
the position as I have just summarized it, to the point of making translation
an absolute rule which may not be departed from whatever the

[Page 630]

circumstances? In other words, does this
section of the Bill of Rights set aside the three exceptions of s.
577  of the Criminal Code  dealing with physical presence and the
exceptions recognized by the courts concerning active presence? I think not. If
we were to conclude, for example, that relying on the Bill of Rights the
accused has an absolute right to be present throughout his trial, no matter how
he may behave, anarchy and chaos would result.

The right to translation confirmed by the Bill
of Rights and already granted by the decided cases is a right pertaining to
the accused as do a number of others set out in the Code or recognized by the
courts. There is no doubt that on occasion these rights may conflict with each
other, and the courts must then decide which should have priority.

In the case at bar two such rights must be
considered, namely, on the one hand, the right to translation, and on the
other, the right of the accused to be tried by a jury which has been instructed
on the law relating to the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. The latter
right is just as important as the former, and the number of appeals brought by
accused persons on the ground that the jury was improperly instructed on the
rules applicable to the case clearly demonstrates the significance attached to
it by the accused themselves. Further, this latter right would seem to be
expressly recognized by ss. 2(e) and 2(f) of the Bill
of Rights.

In the case at bar the trial judge, having in
mind the circumstances known to him, namely, the size of the courtroom, its
acoustics, the respective positions of the judge, the jury and the accused,
formed the conclusion that a danger existed that the jury would be distracted
by the voice of the interpreter translating the charge as it was being read.
These are facts which neither the Court of Appeal nor this Court is familiar
with, and as to which we must rely entirely on the trial judge. His finding on
the point must therefore be given its full weight.

[Page 631]

It is true that the translation process had caused
no problems during the presentation of evidence. It should be borne in mind,
however, that the chances of being distracted during an exchange of questions
and answers are less great than during a charge lasting at least an hour,
during which difficult questions of law are being discussed. Furthermore, if
there was any distraction during the presentation of evidence, this could
easily be remedied, during testimony for example by the rewording of a
question, or during the addresses. That is not the case with instructions given
by a judge to the jury on questions of law.

Having to weigh against each other these two
rights of the accused, the right through translation to have a full
understanding of what is taking place at his trial, and the right to be judged
by a jury properly instructed on the relevant points of law, the trial judge,
for the reasons stated by him, came to the conclusion that in the circumstances
the second right should take precedence over the first. As this Court noted in
another context, in Smythe v. The Queen[5], the administration of the criminal
law calls for a choice to be made, and I am not persuaded that in the case at
bar the choice made by the trial judge was incorrect.

With all due respect, I feel the conclusion of
the Court of Appeal of Ontario makes into an absolute requirement which admits
of no exceptions the rule in s. 2(g) of the Bill of Rights, a
rule which must notwithstanding be read in the light of the other rights of the
accused. Ideally, every courtroom in Canada should be constructed so as to facilitate simultaneous translation
without there being the slightest risk of interfering with the conduct of a
trial. So long as that ideal situation does not exist, it must be recognized
that the rule in 2(g), though very important, is somewhat relative when
other rules, which are just as important, conflict with it.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal and
reinstate the conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Theft of
automobile—Joy-riding—Whether included offence—Whether offences mutually
exclusive—Elements of theft—Criminal Code , ss. 283 , 294 , 295 .

Appellant had been drinking at his home in North Bay with some friends. Around
midnight they decided to deliver some stereo tapes and lacking transport went
to the home of one Trudel who told them that he would get them a ride. Trudel
took them to the motel parking lot next to his home, found a car with the keys
in it, drove appellant and his friends around and later returned to his home.
Appellant then took the car intending to go for a drive alone and then return
the car to the motel. While returning to North Bay he was stopped by a police
constable and later charged with the theft of the car under s. 280 (now s. 294 )
of the Criminal Code . Appellant admitted at trial that Trudel had
indicated that the car was stolen but was acquitted on the basis of the
intention of both Trudel and himself to return the car and because the offence
of joy-riding, s. 281  (now s. 295 ) of the Criminal Code , was not an
included offence. The Court of Appeal decided however that all the elements of
theft as defined in s. 269  (now s. 283 ) of the Criminal Code  were
present.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J.: The distinction between the offences of theft and joy-riding makes them
mutually exclusive and permits no verdict other than a verdict on the offence
actually charged. However the trial judge erred in holding that there was no
evidence on which to enter a conviction for theft.

[Page 202]

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The provision contained in s. 281
(now s. 295 ) of taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent creates a separate
offence in order to provide a penalty where it may be difficult or impossible
to establish the offence of theft. The two offences are separate and taking a
vehicle without the owner’s consent is not necessarily included in the charge
of the theft of a vehicle. In certain fact situations the accused may be
prosecuted under either section. In this case however the Court of Appeal
properly found that all the elements of theft were established. The trial judge
erred in law in holding that because the appellant intended to return the
vehicle he could not have intended to commit theft but could only be charged
under s. 281 (now s. 295 ) and this gave to the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to
determine the appeal as it did.

Per Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting: The trial judge found that the
evidence was not sufficient to establish the intent necessary to support a
conviction of theft but was sufficient to establish a conviction of joy-riding,
under s. 281 (now s. 295 ). To differ with this finding is to differ on the
factual inferences from the evidence.

The two offences set out in ss. 280 and 281
(now ss. 294  and 295 ) are separate and mutually exclusive offences and the
required element of intent in each is not common to both. Theft is defined as
involving a taking or conversion “fraudulently and without colour of right”
while s. 281 (now s. 295 ) does not associate with the actus reus of
the offence, and with the intent that is an element thereof, the dishonesty
imported into the elements of theft. There was no question of law involved in
this case to entitle the Court of Appeal to interfere with the acquittal of the
appellant. The findings of fact bring the present case within s. 295  rather than
s. 294 . The appeal should therefore be allowed and the acquittal restored.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario allowing an appeal
from an acquittal at trial by Gratton, Co. Ct. J. Appeal

[Page 203]

dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ.
dissenting.

J.T. Morin, for the appellant.

M.A.F. Lindsay, for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Charged with the offence of
theft of an automobile of a value exceeding $50, contrary to s. 280, now s. 294 
of the Criminal Code , the appellant was tried and acquitted by His
Honour Judge Gratton, District Judge. The Trial Judge held that there was an
absence of any evidence to support a finding of intent to commit theft but only
evidence of the offence of taking a motor vehicle without consent, contrary to
s. 281 , now s. 295  Criminal Code , upon which he would have entered
a conviction had he been of the opinion that such an offence was included under
s. 280  [now s. 294 ] of the Criminal Code .

Pursuant to s. 584(1)  Criminal Code , now
s. 605(1) , respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario against this
verdict of acquittal on the ground that the Trial Judge had erred in law in
holding that there was no evidence to support a finding of intent to commit
theft and a conviction under s. 280  [now s. 294 ] of the Criminal Code .

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set
aside the verdict of acquittal and, as authorized by s. 592(4)(b)(i),
now s. 613(4)(b)(i), entered a verdict of guilty with respect to the
offence charged and remanded the case to the County Court Judge for sentence.
Delivering orally the reasons for the Court at the close of the argument on the
appeal, Mr. Justice Aylesworth declared in conclusion:

“...that the charge of theft of the
automobile, as laid, was made out and there was evidence, and ample evidence,
before the County Court Judge upon

[Page 204]

which the conviction should have been
recorded. We think he erred in law in charging himself that there really was no
such evidence before him.”

Hence the present appeal to this Court pursuant
to s. 597(2)(a)(i), now s. 618(2) (a)(i) Criminal Code .

I had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment of my brothers Martland, Spence and Laskin. I will defer the
consideration of the jurisdictional ground raised by my brother Laskin and
precise at first my views with respect to (i) the essence of the distinction
between the offence under s. 280 and the offence under s. 281, and (ii) the
evidence in the case.

Dealing with point (i):—In R. v. Wilkins[1], the Court of Appeal for Ontario
decided that, in essence, the distinction between the two offences lies in the
difference that characterizes the intent of the taker which, in the case of
theft, is to convert, permanently or temporarily, the property of another in a
motor vehicle—or in any other thing—to the use of the taker and which, in the
case of the offence under s. 281, is merely to drive a motor vehicle or cause
it to be driven. Speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal, Roach J.A.,
said this at p. 370 of the report:—

“Ordinarily and were it not for s. 281 the
taking of a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner and driving it would
carry with it the notion that the taker intended to and in fact did convert
it—that is, the property in it—to his own use and in so doing, deprive the
owner of the use of it even though such deprivation were only temporary. Where
a person in violation of s. 281 takes a motor vehicle without the consent of the
owner with the intention merely of driving it, he still deprives the owner of
the use of it but Parliament has decreed that there can be a taking and use
resulting in deprivation that does not amount to theft and that which
distinguishes such a taking is the intent of the taker. If the intent, so said
Parlia-

[Page 205]

ment, is merely to drive it then it is not
theft but a separate offence. Plainly, however, Parliament did not intend that
every such taking would bring the act of the taker without the definition of
theft contained in s. 269. Otherwise a person could take a motor vehicle
without the consent of the owner and no matter how long or how far he drove it
if he could be heard to say that he took it for no other purpose than to drive
it, he could escape a charge of theft. That submission would be ridiculous. The
taking under s. 281 must be consistent with an intention by the taker that,
having driven it, he shall return it or cause it to be returned to the owner
and the circumstances under which it was taken the length of time the taker
retained possession and the distance he drove it are important indicia in
determining whether in taking it the taker intended merely to drive it as
contemplated by the section or whether he intended to convert the property
in it to his own use. Each case must depend on its own facts.”

With this view of the law, I am in respectful
agreement. While the infringement of possession in the case of theft of
anything constitutes a crime—or to use the familiar expressions of the common
law, a criminal trespass, a felony—generally subject under our Criminal Code 
to prosecution by way of indictment and punishable by imprisonment for ten
years, the infringement of possession of a motor vehicle under s. 281 
constitutes an offence which, participating rather of the nature of a civil
trespass or misdemeanor, is subject under the Criminal Code  to
prosecution by way of summary conviction and punishable by either a fine of no
more than $500 or to imprisonment for six months, or to both. In both cases, as
is generally the case for any other offences, mens rea must necessarily
be proved by circumstancial evidence—except, of course, where the accused
confesses. The difficulty which may, in a particular case, attend the
determination of the specific intent, is foreign to what constitutes the
essential and funda-

[Page 206]

mental distinction between the two offences,
which distinction, founded as it is on a specific intent, makes these offences
mutually exclusive and permits, in the absence of a special provision, no
verdict other than a verdict on the offence actually charged.

Dealing with point (ii):—It is appropriate to
note that in the consideration of the evidence, this Court, as was the case for
the Court of Appeal, is not concerned with the question whether the Trial Judge
ought to have inferred guilt of the offence charged—which is a question of
fact—but whether he might and could have legally drawn such inference
therefrom—which is a question of law.

The evidence is simple. Two witnesses were heard
for the prosecution, namely John B. Lanigan, the owner of the automobile, a Pontiac, and Constable Michael Fawcett who,
while patrolling highway 17 during the night, encountered and stopped that
vehicle then driven by Lafrance. No witness other than the latter was heard for
the defence. According to these testimonies, the facts are:—On September 24, 1970, after his day’s work,
Lanigan, an Ontario Hydro technician, drove back in his Pontiac to the Voyager Hotel in North Bay where he was lodging. He parked
his car in the parking lot of the hotel, leaving the keys in the key hole and
some scientific instruments on the rear seat and in the trunk. The next
morning, he found out that his automobile had disappeared and reported it as
stolen to the police. As to what took place in the interval, during the night,
Lafrance, for his part, testified as follows: He and three companions, namely
Michael Trudel, Jacques Carrière and Paul Boissonneault, drank wine in his home
for about two hours when at about midnight, they decided to drive to Corbeil in
order to deliver some stereo tapes which were then in the possession of
Carrière. For this

[Page 207]

alleged purpose, they went to one of Trudel’s
friends to “get a ride” but with no avail. Trudel told them not to worry, that
they would get a ride. They proceeded to the parking lot of the Voyager Hotel
where several cars were parked. Trudel saw the keys in Lanigan’s Pontiac and
then all, but Boissonneault, boarded that car and left with Trudel at the
wheel. They did not go to Corbeil. They drove behind the airport “because there
was less traffic and less people”. On their way, Carrière threw out of the car
the scientific instruments of Lanigan which were on the rear seat. Eventually,
Trudel drove Carrière to his home because the latter was scared. After cruising
for some time through the city with Lafranee, Trudel decided to go home. He
then left the vehicle to Lafrance and told him to do what he wanted to do with
it. Lafrance boarded the car and then proceeded to Sturgeon Falls intending, he said, “—on just going for a ride and then
returning it to the Voyager so it would not be noticed that it was stolen”.
About half way to Sturgeon Falls, he turned around and was heading back to North Bay when, at 3.40
a.m., he was stopped by Constable Fawcett who had observed that the car was
driven in an erratic manner. Asked for his driver’s licence, owner’s permit and
insurance certificate, Lafrance said he left them at home. He declared falsely
that the scientific instruments in the trunk belonged to his father. He gave a
false name, i.e., the name of Lachance, and the address of 132 Norwood in North
 Bay. Constable Fawcett then locked and secured
Lanigan’s car and proceeded with Lafrance to that address to ascertain the
truth of the answers he received. Upon arriving at that point, Lafrance entered
the house and eventually disappeared. In cross-examination, Lafrance testified:
that “he figured that Trudel was stealing the car” when the latter at the
parking lot walked to the Pontiac, looked through the window, saw the keys,
climbed in and started the motor; that having driven three blocks from the lot,
Trudel told them that the car had been stolen and that when Trudel left the car
with him, he knew that it was a stolen car.

[Page 208]

I agree with the Court of Appeal not only that
the Trial Judge erred in law in holding that there was no evidence from which
he might and could have legally inferred the guilt of the accused with respect
to the offence of theft but also with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal
that there was indeed ample evidence upon which such a conviction could have
been recorded.

Dealing with the jurisdictional
ground:—Obviously, the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to entertain the
appeal of the Attorney General unless it raised—as indeed it did—a question of
law which, as above indicated, was that the Trial Judge had erred in holding
that there was no evidence upon which a verdict of theft could be recorded. The
jurisdictional ground raised rests on interpretation given to the reasons of
the Trial Judge who, it is said, did not conclude that there was no evidence
upon which to convict for theft but that the evidence was not sufficient on the
crucial question of intent. The members of the Court of Appeal were unanimously
of opinion that the Trial Judge had charged himself that there was an absence
of evidence and not an insufficiency of evidence. With this interpretation, I
am in agreement. Furthermore, the conclusion of the Trial Judge rests on the
invalid premise that in the absence of any evidence from Trudel, he could not
find the accused guilty of theft. The evidence of Lafrance, which he accepted,
on the crucial point of intent, was quite sufficient.

For all these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

[Page 209]

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which allowed an appeal by the
present respondent from the present appellant’s acquittal at trial on a charge
of theft of an automobile contrary to s. 280 (now s. 294 ) of the Criminal
Code . Theft is defined in s. 269  (now s. 283 ) of the Criminal Code , the
relevant portions of which read as follows:

269. (1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything
whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

(a) to deprive, temporarily
or absolutely, the owner of it or a person who has a special property or
interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it,

...

The facts which gave rise to the charge are as
follows: Around midnight of
September 23, 1970, the appellant and some friends who were drinking wine at
his home at 132 Norwood Avenue,
in North Bay, decided to go to
Corbeil to deliver some stereo tapes in the possession of one of them, Jacques
Carrière. They went to the home of Mike Trudel, who lived on Delaware Avenue, next door to the Voyager
Motel. Trudel told them he would get them a ride and they went to the Voyager
Motel parking lot where they saw a Pontiac automobile, which had been left there by the owner, John Lanigan,
during the afternoon of September 23. The keys were in the car. Trudel entered
the car and started the motor. The appellant and Carrière got in. Trudel drove
them to the airport, and, later, to Carrière’s home. Carrière got out, and
Trudel drove the car around the city. He drove back to his own house and parked
the car. The appellant then drove the car alone towards Sturgeon Falls,
intending to go for a drive, and, later, to return the car to the Voyager
Motel.

[Page 210]

After driving part way to Sturgeon Falls, he turned around and headed
back towards North Bay. He was
stopped by a police constable before he reached North
 Bay. When asked to produce his driver’s licence and
the ownership and insurance certificates he said that he had left them at home.
He gave his correct name and his address at 132 Norwood
 Avenue. He said that some survey equipment located in
the trunk of the car belonged to his father. The police constable drove him to
the address which he had given. The appellant left the vehicle, advising that
he would be right out. He did not return.

The appellant, in evidence at the trial, said
that when Trudel took the car, he, the appellant, thought that it might have
been stolen. He asked Trudel, while Trudel was driving, if the car was stolen
and Trudel said: “Yes.”

The learned trial judge, relying on the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Wilkins[2], said
this:

Not only am I bound by this decision, but I
agree entirely with the judgment of Mr. Justice Roach in his approach to
the distinction which surely must exist between Sec. 280 and
Sec. 281, and on the basis of the findings that I have made, that is about
the intentions at all times of the people who took it originally and Lafrance
when he did take over the control, i.e. of the intention of returning it, and
in view of the fact that he actually did deprive the owner for only a few hours
of the possession of this motor vehicle, not for such a lengthy period as would
lead me to a different conclusion than the one that he actually intended to
return it, and in the absence of any evidence on the part of the original
taker, that is Trudel, that he intended at that time to deprive the owner in
such circumstances as is called for under Sec. 280, then I must conclude
in view of these findings that the accused at no time, either as a party to the
commission of the offence or as the main offender himself, ever intended to
commit an offence under the circumstances contemplated by Sec. 280.
Sec. 281 not being an included offence under Sec. 280, the charge
will accordingly be dismissed.

[Page 211]

Section 281 (now s. 295 ) to which reference
is made, provides:

281. Every one who, without the consent of
the owner, takes a motor vehicle with intent to drive or use it or cause it to
be driven or used is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

Under s. 280, a person who commits theft is
guilty of an indictable offence.

In the Wilkins case the accused took a
policeman’s motorcycle, while the latter was standing on the sidewalk making
out a parking ticket, intending to drive it a short distance for the purpose of
playing a joke on the policeman. He was charged with theft of the motorcycle.
The majority of the Court, Roach and Kelly JJ.A., held that the accused should
have been charged under s. 281 and that he was not guilty of theft under s.
280. MacKay J.A., dissenting, was of the view that all of the elements of theft
had been proved.

The majority of the Court, in that case,
expressed the following opinion as to the effect of s. 281 in relation to
s. 269:

Ordinarily and were it not for s. 281 the
taking of a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner and driving it would
carry with it the notion that the taker intended to and in fact did convert
it—that is, the property in it—to his own use and in so doing deprive the owner
of the use of it even though such deprivation were only temporary. Where a
person in violation of s. 281 takes a motor vehicle without the consent of the
owner with the intention merely of driving it, he still deprives the owner of
the use of it but Parliament has decreed that there can be a taking and use
resulting in deprivation that does not amount to theft and that which
distinguishes such a taking is the intent of the taker. If the intent, so said
Parliament, is merely to drive it then it is not theft but a separate offence.
Plainly, however, Parliament did not intend that every such taking would bring
the act of the taker without the definition of theft contained in s. 269.
Otherwise a person could take a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner
and no matter how long or how far he drove it if he could be heard to say that
he took it for no other purpose than to drive it, he could escape a charge of
theft. That submission would be ridiculous. The taking

[Page 212]

under s. 281 must be consistent with an
intention by the taker that, having driven it, he shall return it or cause it
to be returned to the owner and the circumstances under which it was taken the
length of time the taker retained possession and the distance he drove it are
important indicia in determining whether in taking it the taker intended
merely to drive it as contemplated by the section or whether he intended
to convert the property in it to his own use. Each case must depend on its own
facts.

In the instant case the facts could not
possibly justify a conviction of theft. The accused did not intend to steal the
vehicle, that is, to convert the property in it to his own use but only to
drive it as contemplated by s. 281. His intention was merely to play a joke on
Nichol and the Judge so found. The intention to perpetrate this joke, stupid
though it was, is incompatible with the evil intent which is inherent in the
crime of theft.

In the present case, Aylesworth J.A., who
delivered the reasons of the Court, had this to say about the application of
the Wilkins case:

We distinguish the case on its facts most
decidedly from those present in Regina v. Wilkins, a judgment of this
Court. We are all of the opinion that the application of the Wilkins case
should be confined to its own facts and we treat it in that manner.

He went on to hold that the charge of theft of
the automobile had been made out and that there was ample evidence upon which a
conviction should have been recorded by the trial judge. He added:

We think he erred in law in charging
himself that there really was no such evidence before him.

The point of law upon which the appeal to this
Court is founded is stated in the appellant’s factum as follows:

[Page 213]

It is respectfully submitted that because
of Section 281 every temporary taking of a motor vehicle without the
consent of the owner is not theft. In the light of that section theft of a
motor vehicle must involve an intention on the part of the accused person to
convert the property in the vehicle to his own use.

The contention is that when Parliament created
the lesser offence, as defined in s. 281, it must be presumed to have intended
thereby to curtail the definition of theft by excluding from it any taking
which would constitute an offence under s. 281.

I do not agree with this submission. In my opinion,
when the predecessor of s. 281 was enacted, the purpose of Parliament was not
to amend the existing law of theft in relation to automobiles. Its sole purpose
was to create a new and separate offence in order to provide a penalty in
certain fact situations in which it was difficult or impossible to establish
the offence of theft. The provision contained in s. 281 does not purport to do
anything more than to define a separate offence in relation to the taking of
automobiles. The definition of theft still covers the taking of “anything”.

The offence provided for in s. 281 is defined in
such a way that in certain fact situations the accused might be prosecuted
under either s. 280 or s. 281. In such an event it is for the Crown to elect
which charge should be laid, as is the case under s. 221(1) and (4) (now
s. 233(1) and (4) where the facts might warrant a charge either of
criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle or of dangerous
driving.

It would have been open to Parliament to have
provided specifically, as it did in relation to the offences defined in s.
221(1) and (4), that an offence under s. 281 should be an included offence
under s. 280, but this was not done. In the absence of such specific provision,
in my view, it is not an included offence under the provisions of s. 569(1)
(now s. 589(1)), because the offence created by s. 281 is not necessarily

[Page 214]

included in the charge of theft, as defined in
s. 269, and it is not included in the count as charged in the present case.

I agree with the Court of Appeal that all of the
elements of theft, as defined in s. 269, were established in this case. The
taking was intentional, under no mistake and with knowledge that the motor
vehicle was the property of another. In my opinion this made the taking
fraudulent. (See R. v. Williams[3], at
p. 666.) The appellant took the vehicle without colour of right and deprived
the owner of it temporarily.

In my opinion the learned trial judge erred in
law in holding that because the appellant intended to return the motor vehicle
he could not have intended to commit theft within s. 280, but could only have
been charged under s. 281. This was a question of law on which, in my opinion,
the respondent was properly entitled to appeal from the appellant’s acquittal,
and, accordingly, the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to determine the appeal
in the manner in which it did.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—This appeal was
first heard by a Bench of five of which I was one. It was re-argued before the
full Court pursuant to a direction by the Court for a re-hearing. The same
counsel appeared. Prior to the direction for a re-hearing I had prepared draft
reasons for allowing the appeal and restoring the order of acquittal. The
re-hearing has not only confirmed me in the view expressed in my draft reasons
but it has persuaded me that there is also a jurisdictional ground upon which
the order of acquittal should be restored. I set out below as Part I my opinion
on the jurisdictional aspect.

[Page 215]

Part II is substantially my set of reasons
prepared after the first hearing.

PART I

The jurisdiction of the Ontario Court of Appeal
to hear an appeal against acquittal depends on whether a question of law alone
is involved in the appeal. In the present case, the point at issue was the
intent associated with the offence charged. The trial judge was of the opinion
that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the intent necessary to
support a conviction of theft but that it was sufficient to establish a
conviction of “joy-riding” under s. 281. In his reasons, he stated that there
was “an absence of evidence showing intention on the part of Trudel [who had
been a companion of the accused but left him before the culminating events] to
commit an offence under sec. 280, but rather there is evidence of the
intention to commit an offence under sec. 281”. He then went on to deal
with the intent of the accused which he found to be short of that required to warrant
a conviction of theft. Counsel for the Crown fastened on the words “absence of
evidence” to urge that a question of law was involved, but this is an
unacceptable literalism when regard is had to the context.

The context is well shown by the concluding
portion of his reasons where the trial judge said this:

...on the basis of the findings that I have
made, that is about the intentions at all times of the people who took it
originally and Lafrance when he did take over the control, i.e. of the intention
of returning it, and in view of the fact that he actually did deprive the owner
for only a few hours of the possession of this motor vehicle, not for such a
lengthy period as would lead me to a different conclusion than the one that he
actually intended to return it, and in the absence of any evidence on the part
of the original taker, that is Trudel, that he intended at that time to

[Page 216]

deprive the owner in such circumstances as
is called for under Sec. 280, then I must conclude in view of these findings
that the accused at no time, either as a party to the commission of the offence
or as the main offender himself, ever intended to commit an offence under the
circumstances contemplated by Sec. 280. Sec. 281 not being an
included offence under Sec. 280, the charge will accordingly be dismissed.

Intent is as much a question of fact as is
physical action. Here the trial judge did not conclude that there was no
evidence upon which to convict for theft but that the evidence did not go far
enough on the central question of intent. To differ from him on this appraisal
is to differ on the factual inferences from the evidence. No question of law
alone is involved.

I appreciate that this assessment depends on a
prior determination that the two offences of theft and joy-riding, as set out
respectively in ss. 280 and 281 (theft being defined for purposes of s. 280 in
s. 269) of the Criminal Code , are separate offences, and that the
required element of intent in each is not common to both. This is the view I
hold, as will be evident from Part II hereof, and it is on this basis (which I
hold is the one upon which the Ontario Court of Appeal should have proceeded)
that I conclude that no question of law was involved before that Court to
entitle it to interfere with the acquittal of the accused.

PART II

The Canadian Criminal Code, from its
first promulgation in 1892, has defined theft in terms of an intent to deprive
an owner “temporarily or absolutely”. Clearly, these words encompassed the
taking and driving of a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent, albeit there
was no intention of permanent deprivation. When the predecessor of s. 281 was
first enacted in 1910 by 9-10 Edw. VII, c. 11, it was included in a group of
provisions dealing with automobile offences and in a part of the Criminal
Code  preceding the theft sections. It was not until the

[Page 217]

Criminal Code Revision of 1953-54, c. 51 that s.
281 was separated and put under the heading of “Offences Resembling Theft”.

There is, of course, nothing commanding in rules
of construction that oblige this Court to defer to the arrangement from time to
time of the various sections of the Criminal Code . They do,
however, consist of separate enactments, so far as they define separate
offences; and the question that is raised by the enactement of the fore-runner
of s. 281 , at a time when intentional temporary deprivation was part of the
definition of theft, is whether the enveloping force of the present s. 294 
(formerly s. 280 ) remained or whether the present s. 295  (formely s. 281 )
diminished, according to its terms, the scope of s. 294 .

Parliament ought to have spoken clearly on a
matter on which there was no difficulty in doing so. But it did not, and we are
left to reach for policy determinants. For myself, a principal one arises from
a preference against a construction that would expose an accused person to more
than one offence for the same conduct. That such double exposure (even apart
from conspiracy and the concurrent force of competent provincial penal legislation)
is foreseeable is attested by s. 11  of the Criminal Code , which goes on
to provide against double punishment. It seems to me, however, that where, as
here, the liability to alternative offences is not obvious, it is better to
avoid assigning the same act or omission to more than one defined offence
rather than to rely on the punishment rule of s. 11 .

On a more pragmatic plane, in extension of an
argument based on the original enactment of s. 295  as an exception from s. 294 ,
there is the fact that theft over $50 was an indictable offence under s. 294 (a)
(it is now theft over $200: see 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 23), punishable by a
maximum prison term of ten years, while s.

[Page 218]

295 has from its inception been a summary
conviction offence, punishable now under s. 722 by a maximum term of six months
or a maximum fine of $500 or both. Although the Criminal Code  exhibits
instances where a particular offence is punishable on indictment or on summary
conviction (thus permitting the Crown to elect how it will proceed), as, for
example, common assault and publication of obscene matter, I cannot be
persuaded that two separately defined offences, the one punishable on
indictment only and the other on summary conviction only, should be merged to
embrace the same facts so as to give the Crown an election not simply on the
form of procedure, with its consequent punishment, but rather on the character
of the substantive charge itself.

United Kingdom
experience with legislation similar to that which is now s. 295  is not of
direct assistance because of the differences between our respective definitions
of theft. Prior to the enactment of the Theft Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 60,
the opinion was expressed in respect of the then s. 217 of the British Road
Traffic Act, 1960 (U.K.), c. 16, (comparable to our s. 295 ) that “a person
indicted for stealing a motor vehicle may be found guilty of this offence”: see
Harris, Criminal Law (21st ed. 1968), at p. 478. This result, which
treats the unauthorized taking and driving of a motor vehicle as an included
but not an alternative offence to theft, was made statutory under s. 12(4) of
the Theft Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 60. There is, however, a cardinal
difference between the definition of theft under the British act and that under
the Canadian Criminal Code; in the former it is principally defined in
s. 1(1) as involving “permanent deprivation”, which in turn is defined in s. 6
so as to give it an expanded meaning but yet one falling short of merely
temporary taking: see Smith, Law of Theft (1968), at p. 46.

[Page 219]

It is this difference in definitions, and the
fact that s. 295  is directed to the taking of the motor vehicle with intent to
drive or use it, without reference to or intent towards the owner, that
precludes the conclusion here that s. 295  is an included offence on a charge of
theft. The theory of an included offence, as reflected in s. 589  of the Criminal
Code , is that the including offence requires proof of an element without
which there is proof of another lesser offence. That is not the case as between
ss. 294  and 295  when the latter involves an element not involved in the former.
Sections 294  and 295  are either alternative offences to the degree to
which the former is restated in s. 295  or are mutually exclusive so far as facts
exist to bring s. 295  into play.

I do not think that there can be any half-way
house whereby the two offences can be viewed as alternative and yet admit of
separateness under particular sets of facts. If there are facts which invite a
charge under s. 295  and not under s. 294 , the two offences are perforce
mutually exclusive, leaving as the central issue the specification or
definition of the features which differentiate them. This is a matter of
determining the scope of the one or the other, and however narrowly s. 295  be
viewed it must to that extent have its separate identity.

There is, however, another factor which must be
considered in this connection, and it reinforces my opinion of the mutual
exclusiveness of the two offences. Theft is defined in s. 283  as involving
a taking or conversion “fraudulently and without colour of right”. Although
there has appeared to be recurrent difficulty in assigning a meaning to the
term “fraudulently” which is not already embraced in the other telling words of
the definition of theft (that is, taking or converting without colour of right,
with intent to

[Page 220]

deprive, etc.), the presence of the term in s.
283  and its absence from s. 295  must be given some effect: see Marsh v. Kulchar[4], at p. 335. I would put it that, as
formulated, s. 295  does not associate with the actus reus of the offence
and with the intent that is an element thereof the dishonesty towards the owner
that is imported into the assessment of the elements of theft under ss. 283  and
294 ; and, moreover, as I have already noted, s. 295  does not speak in terms of
an intent directed to the owner. This, in my opinion, lies behind the appraisal
of the two offences made by Roach J.A. in Regina v. Wilkins[5]. It also emphasizes, in my view, why s.
295  cannot be an included offence within ss. 283  and 294 .

For the reasons above stated, I prefer the
mutually exclusive construction of ss. 294  and 295 . I have not thought it
necessary to reach for the maxim specialia generalibus derogant because
it says no more than does the fact of the subsequent enactment of the
forerunner of s. 295  at a time when theft, as then and now defined, included
what the ancestor of s. 295  carved out in words different from those used in
the definition of theft. When one examines s. 295 , in its different terms
defining the offence and in its character as a summary conviction offence, it
is reasonable to conclude that it has taken “joy-riding”, that is the
unauthorized taking of a motor vehicle with the intent to drive or use it
temporarily, out of the purview of the indictable offence of theft: see Hirshman
v. Beal[6] at
pp. 45 and 49.

The findings of fact in the present case bring
it within s. 295  rather than within s. 294 . In the result, I would allow the
appeal, set aside the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and restore the
order of acquittal entered by Judge Gratton.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Dance performed in the nude in
a cabaret before a paying audience—Whether immoral performance within Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 163(2).

An appeal was brought to this Court from a
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which
allowed an appeal from the judgment of a judge of the Trial Division, who, on a
stated case, had reversed the decision at trial to convict the appellant of an
offence under what is now s. 163(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34. The gravamen of the offence charged was that the appellant “…
did unlawfully appear as a performer in an immoral performance to wit: did
dance in the nude in a theatre before a paying audience”. The appellant was
given leave to appeal to this Court on the following question of law: Did the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta err in law in deciding that
in considering what constitutes an immoral performance under s. 163(2)  of
the Criminal Code , it should be held that Parliament, by enacting
s. 170  of the Criminal Code  has declared that nudity in a public
place without lawful excuse, is a breach of moral standards in Canada?

Held (Fauteux
C.J. and Martland and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction quashed.

Per Abbott,
Judson, Ritchie, Laskin and Dickson JJ.: An act does not become immoral simply
because it has been made an offence by the Parliament of Canada. The provisions
of s. 170  do not stigmatize the display of the human form in its natural
state as “immoral” and as the offence here charged must rest solely on the
ground that the appellant’s body was completely unclothed and there was no
suggestion. that the “performance” was otherwise “immoral”, the

[Page 161]

trial judge was incorrect in holding “the
said dance to be an immoral performance contrary to the provisions of the Criminal
Code ”, and the Appellate Division was wrong in holding that the
language employed by Parliament in enacting s. 170  is to be construed as
meaning that being unclothed in a public place is a breach of moral
standards in Canada and therefore constitutes an “immoral performance”
within the meaning of s. 163(2) .

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ.: The word “immoral” is not defined in the Criminal Code  and
therefore the provincial judge would have had to have some evidence of what was
and what was not immoral in order to found his judgment. Lacking such evidence
there was nothing upon which the provincial judge could come to the opinion
that he should register a conviction.

One must have regard for the arrangement of
the Criminal Code  in testing whether Parliament has, in fact, declared
that dancing in the nude is an immoral performance. Section 163  appears under the
subheading of “Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals”. Section 170 , on the
other hand, appears under the subheading “Disorderly Conduct”. It was
the effect on the public peace of such conduct as was exhibited not
infrequently by members of a certain radical religious sect which Parliament
aimed to control and prevent by the provisions of what is now s. 170  of
the Criminal Code  and Parliament there was not dealing with immorality
at all. Therefore the Appellate Division was in error when it turned to
s. 170  to ascertain the standard of morals.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Martland and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The magistrate, in
deciding whether there was evidence to support the charge against the
appellant, was entitled to take into consideration the fact that the appellant’s
appearance, nude in a public place, without lawful excuse, could have
constituted, in itself, a breach of s. 170  and that it offended against
public decency. She was not charged with an offence under s. 170 , or with
appearing in an indecent performance, but this was a factor which, coupled with
the other evidence, could be considered in deciding whether or not her
performance was immoral.

The other evidence was as follows: The
appellant’s performance was before an entirely male audience and was staged for
the purpose of gain. There was no suggestion in the evidence that the
performance was one which had artistic merit. It was a strip-tease act, the
only purpose of which was to provide a prurient

[Page 162]

titillation of the sensibilities of the audience.
Taking all these factors into account, the magistrate had evidence before him
on which he could find that the appellant had appeared as a performer in an
immoral performance.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division[1],
allowing an appeal by the Crown from a judgment of Riley J., allowing an appeal
by way of stated case from the appellant’s conviction of an offence under
s. 163(2)  of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed, Fauteux C.J. and
Martland and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

A.W. MacDonald and A.E. Golden, for the
appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and Martland and
Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—This appeal is
brought, with leave, from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta, which allowed an appeal from the judgment of a judge of the
Trial Division, who, on a stated case, had reversed the decision at trial to
convict the appellant of an offence under what is now s. 163(2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and imposing a fine of $50 and costs or 30
days.

The relevant subsection provides:

(2) Every one commits an offence who takes
part or appears as an actor, performer, or assistant in any capacity, in an
immoral, indecent or obscene performance, entertainment or representation in a
theatre.

“Theatre” is defined, in s. 138, as
including “any place that is open to the public where entertainments are given,
whether or not any charge is made for admission”.

[Page 163]

The charge against the appellant was that on or
about September 29, 1971, at Calgary, Alberta, she “did unlawfully appear as a
performer in an immoral performance, to wit: did dance in the nude in a theatre
before a paying audience”.

The evidence for the Crown was given by a
detective in the Morality Division of the City of Calgary Police Department. He
stated that on the day in question he went to a cabaret, in the City of Calgary, known as “Dino’s Hideaway”, at
about noon. Patrons of the cabaret were charged a $3 cover charge, which
included a meal and entertainment. There were approximately 16 male persons in
attendance at the time. He described the appellant’s performance as follows:

At approximately twenty after twelve a performer, Miss Kelly
Johnson, was introduced to the audience whereby she got on the stage in front
of approximately twenty tables and—to dance a topless dance. She danced three
dances; one with the top on and two with her top off and then there was a short
intermission. In approximately five minutes she returned to the stage and did
another dance with her top off and then another dance with her—removing her
bikini panties. She danced for approximately two minutes, shortly over two
minutes, whereby she left the stage.

Q. When she removed her bikini panties, how
was she dressed?

A. Completely in the nude.

He further stated that the stage was about six
feet by four feet and was about two feet above the floor level. It was well
lighted with flashing and different coloured lights. There was a spot light on
the stage and the body of the appellant was completely visible to the people
who were there.

No evidence was called for the defence.

Application was made to the magistrate who had
convicted the appellant to state a case. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the stated case
are as follows:

[Page 164]

(e) The grounds on which the same is
questioned are:

That I (the said Provincial Magistrate)
erred in point of law in holding that the Appellant’s appearance as a performer
was unlawful and that to dance in the nude before a paying audience constituted
an immoral performance.

(f) The grounds upon which I support the
preceding questioned are:

On the point under Appeal herein, the
evidence led before me proved:

1. The accused (Applicant) danced in the
nude in a cabaret known as “Dino’s Hideaway Cabaret” on the 29th day of
September, A.D. 1971.

My reasons for judgment in finding the said
dance to be an immoral performance, HELD:

“…dancing in the nude in a public
performance is contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of Canada.”

The question propounded in the stated case was:

Was I correct in holding the said dance to
be an immoral performance, contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of
Canada?

Under s. 762 of the Criminal Code , an
appeal by way of stated case must be on the ground that the conviction is:

(a) Erroneous in point of law, or

(b) In excess of jurisdiction.

There was no question as to jurisdiction and so
the appeal had to be based upon an error in law. In the circumstances of this
case, it was, therefore, necessary for the appellant, in order to succeed on
her appeal, to establish that there was no evidence upon which the magistrate
could have held that she had appeared as a performer in an immoral performance.

The reasons for judgment in the Trial Division
are concerned mainly with the application of s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code , which provides that:

(8) For the purposes of this Act, any
publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploi-

[Page 165]

tation of sex, or of sex and any one or more
of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall
be deemed to be obscene.

The appeal was allowed, because, it was said:

There was nothing to suggest that the
performance

(a) was in any way lustful,

(b) no tendency to deprave or corrupt,

(c) there was no distorted, impoverished
masturbatory concentration on pornography.

Section 159(8)  is concerned with the definition
of “Obscenity” in publications. In my opinion, it did not provide the test for
determining whether or not the performance in the present case was or was not
an immoral performance.

The following passage from the reasons for
judgment of the Appellate Division states the grounds upon which the Appellate
Division allowed the appeal of the present respondent:

Upon the appeal counsel for the Crown
argued that there was no question of law involved. We are extremely doubtful if
there was any question of law involved. However, assuming there was a question
of law, we are of the opinion there was evidence to support the Provincial
Judge’s decision. Section 170  of the Criminal Code  provides:

“170. Every one who, without lawful excuse,

(a) is nude in a public place,

…

is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.”

We think the Provincial Judge was referring
to this section when he said, “Dancing in the nude in a public performance
is contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of Canada”. The respondent
was not charged under this section and therefore could not be convicted
thereunder. However, the offence has always been treated as one relating to
morals, and the Parliament of Canada by making it an offence has declared that
it is a breach of a moral standard in Canada. We know of no better way of establishing a moral standard than a
declaration by the Parliament of Canada, and so the Provincial Judge was
justified in accepting this as his standard in finding that the

[Page 166]

dance by the respondent in the nude was an
immoral performance.

In the above passage s. 170  is not quoted
in full. Paragraph (b) of s. 170(1) reads:

(b) is nude and exposed to
public view while on private property, whether or not the property is his own,

Subsections (2) and (3) provide:

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is nude who is so clad as to offend against public decency or order.

(3) No proceedings shall be commenced under
this section without the consent of the Attorney General.

“Public place” is defined in s. 138 as
including “any place to which the public have access as of right or by
invitation, express or implied”.

The appellant was given leave to appeal to this
Court on the following question of law:

Did the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta err in law in deciding that in considering what constitutes an
immoral performance under Section 163(2)  of the Criminal Code , it should be
held that Parliament, by enacting Section 170  of the Criminal Code  has declared
that nudity in a public place without lawful excuse, is a breach of moral
standards in Canada?

Counsel for the appellant points out that
s. 170  appears, in a group of sections, under the heading of “Disorderly
Conduct”, while s. 163 appears, in a group of sections, under the heading
“Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals.” It was also pointed out that, when the
forerunner of s. 170  was enacted, its ostensible purpose was to try to
curb the activities of a Doukhobor sect which demonstrated in the form of nude
parades. On the other hand, subs. (2) of s. 163, in defining what is
included in the word “nude”, makes it clear that the section is concerned
with conduct which offends against decency or order. Furthermore, as to the
initial reason for the enactment of the provision, it should be

[Page 167]

noted that the section, as contained in 1931 (Can.), c. 28, then made it an offence where
a person, while nude,

(a) is found in any public
place whether alone or in company with one or more other persons who are
parading or have assembled with intent to parade or have paraded in such public
place while nude, or

(b) is found in any public place
whether alone or in company with one or more other persons.

Section 170(1)(a) makes it an offence,
without lawful excuse, to be nude in a public place. The essential feature of
the present provision is solely nudity in a public place.

In my opinion, the magistrate, in deciding
whether there was evidence to support the charge against the appellant, was
entitled to take into consideration the fact that the appellant’s appearance,
nude in a public place, without lawful excuse, could have constituted, in
itself, a breach of s. 170  and that it offended against public decency.
She was not charged with an offence under s. 170 , or with appearing in an
indecent performance, but this was a factor which, coupled with the other
evidence, could be considered in deciding whether or not her performance was
immoral.

The other evidence was as follows: The
appellant’s performance was before an entirely male audience and was staged for
the purpose of gain. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the
performance was one which had artistic merit. It was a strip-tease act, the
only purpose of which was to provide a prurient titillation of the
sensibilities of the audience. Taking all these factors into account, in my
opinion the magistrate had evidence before him on which he could find that the appellant
had appeared as a performer in an immoral performance.

It was for the magistrate to decide, on that
evidence, whether or not the performance was immoral. I do not agree with the
contention that the Crown’s case could only be proved by leading evidence to
establish what were the prevailing moral standards of the community. I agree

[Page 168]

with the view expressed by Dickson J.A., as he
then was, in the Manitoba Court of Appeal, in R. v. Great West News Ltd.[2], at p. 361, that:

… the courts have not found it necessary to
call upon expert testimony to describe the standards of the community. Such
evidence is, of course, admissible but that is not the same thing as saying it
is essential.

In Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions[3], Lord Hodson concluded his reasons
with the following passage, at p. 294:

Since a criminal indictment is followed by
the verdict of a jury it is true that the function of custos morum is in
criminal cases ultimately performed by the jury, by whom, on a proper
direction, each case will be decided. This I think is consonant with the course
of the development of our law. One may take, as an example, the case of
negligence where the standard of care of the reasonable man is regarded as fit
to be determined by the jury. In the field of public morals it will thus be the
morality of the man in the jury-box that will determine the fate of the
accused, but this should hardly disturb the equanimity of anyone brought up in
the traditions of our common law.

The present case was not a jury case, but it was
the duty of the magistrate to perform the function of the jury in assessing the
evidence before him.

In my opinion the appellant has failed to
establish that the magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant, and the
appeal should be dismissed.

Abbott, Judson, Laskin and Dickson JJ. concurred
with the judgment delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the benefit of reading the
reasons for judgment of my brother Spence in which he has outlined the
circumstances giving rise to this appeal and I agree with him

[Page 169]

that the appeal should be allowed; but as I
reach the same conclusion for somewhat different reasons, I think it desirable
that I should express my views separately.

The gravamen of the offence here charged is that
the appellant

… did unlawfully appear as a performer in
an immoral performance, to wit: did dance in the nude in a theatre
before a paying audience, contrary to the Criminal Code .

The italics are my own.

The appellant having been convicted at trial
before a provincial magistrate, application was made for a stated case pursuant
to s. 762  of the Criminal Code  and a case was duly stated which
read, in part, as follows:

(1) (e) The grounds on which the same (i.e.
the conviction) is questioned are:

That I (the said Provincial Magistrate)
erred in point of law in holding that the Appellant’s appearance as a performer
was unlawful and that to dance in the nude before a paying audience constituted
an immoral performance.

(f) The grounds upon which I support the
preceding question are:

On the point under Appeal herein, the
evidence led before me proved:

1. The accused (Applicant) danced in the
nude in a cabaret known as “Dino’s Hideaway Cabaret” on the 29th day of
September, A.D. 1971.

My reasons for Judgment in finding the said
dance to be an immoral performance, HELD:

“… dancing in the nude in a public
performance is contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of Canada.”

The Accused (Applicant) desires to question
the validity of the said conviction on the ground that it is erroneous in Law
and respectfully seeks the opinion, ruling and Judgment of This Honourable
Court accordingly.

[Page 170]

IT IS DESIRED THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY TO
QUESTION:

Was I correct in holding the said dance to
be an immoral performance, contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of
Canada?

The evidence which forms the basis of the case
stated by the learned provincial magistrate is confined to the fact that the
appellant “danced in the nude in a cabaret …” and the sole question posed by
the learned magistrate is whether such a dance constitutes “an immoral
performance contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code ”.

The Courts below, however, took into
consideration the evidence of a police detective who was the only witness
called at the trial, and upon which McDermid J.A., in the Court of Appeal, made
the following comment:

The detective testified that the respondent
did nothing offensive in any way, shape or form by word, gesture or any other
way while the dance was being executed and the detective was not upset by the
performance.

With the greatest respect for those who may hold
a different view, it appears to me that the question of whether or not certain
conduct constitutes an offence under the Criminal Code  is a question of
law in the strict sense and that the Courts below accordingly had jurisdiction
to entertain the appeal. The question raised by the stated case does not turn
on the weighing of any evidence as it is based on a fact which is in no way
disputed, namely, that the appellant was nude when dancing in a cabaret. It was
for the magistrate to decide whether or not this constituted an immoral
performance and proof of community standards of morality did not, in my
opinion, constitute an essential ingredient of the Crown’s case.

I agree with Mr. Justice McDermid that the
charge against the appellant was obviously laid under the provisions of
s. 163(2)  of the Criminal Code  which provide as follows:

163. (2)
Every one commits an offence who takes part or appears as an actor, performer,
or assistant in any capacity, in an immoral, indecent or obscene

[Page 171]

performance, entertainment or
representation in a theatre.

It will be observed that this section is
concerned exclusively with the nature of the “performance” in which the
accused participated and that Parliament clearly contemplated three separate
prohibited categories, none of which necessarily involved nudity and all of
which might well apply to a performance presented by persons who were fully
clothed although the word “indecent” is capable of being construed so as to
apply to any undue exposure of the naked body. The appellant, however, is not
charged with appearing in an “indecent performance” and the issue in this case
is confined to the question of whether the performance of a dance in a theatre
before a public audience, which would have been unexceptional if performed when
fully or partly clad, becomes “immoral” on the sole ground that it is performed
“in the nude”.

I agree with the Appellate Division that the
learned provincial magistrate was not referring to the provisions of
s. 163  of the Criminal Code , but rather to those of s. 170 ,
when he made the finding that “dancing in the nude in a public place is
immoral”, and on the appeal to this Court the question initially posed in the
stated case therefore becomes that which is stated in the order granting leave
to appeal, namely:

Did the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta err in law in deciding that in considering what constituted an
immoral performance under section 163(2)  of the Criminal Code  it should be
held that Parliament by enacting section 170  of the Criminal Code  has
declared that nudity in a public place without lawful excuse, is a breach of
moral standards in Canada.

Although the Appellate Division expressed some
doubts as to whether this constituted a question of law, I take the view that
the true meaning to be attributed to the interrelation of two sections of
the Code raises such a question.

[Page 172]

In delivering the reasons for judgment adopted
by the Appellate Division, McDermid J.A., limited his consideration of
s. 170  to the provisions of subs. (1)(a) thereof, but in my view it
is necessary to consider the section as a whole in order to determine the
intention of Parliament in enacting it.

170. (1)
Every one who, without lawful excuse,

(a) is nude in a public place, or

(b) is nude and exposed to public
view while on private property, whether or not the property is his own,

is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

(2) For the purposes of this
section a person is nude who is so clad as to offend against public
decency or order.

(3) No proceedings shall be commenced under
this section without the consent of the Attorney General.

The italics are my own.

It has been pointed out by my brother Spence
that the provisions of s. 170  were originally included in s. 205 (A)
of the Criminal Code  as enacted by 1931, c. 28, s. 2 , and were
aimed at the maintenance of public order and the prohibition of disorderly
conduct. In seeking to determine the intention of Parliament in enacting
s. 170 , I share the view of my brother Spence that some significance is to
be attached to the fact that this section appears in the Code under the
general heading of “Disorderly Conduct”.

Sections 163(2)  and 170  of the Criminal Code  in
my view create two entirely different offences; the former applies to every one
who takes part in an “immoral, indecent or obscene performance, entertainment
or representation in a theatre”, whereas the latter does not relate to a
performance of any kind and is confined to the case of a person “who is so clad
as to offend against public decency or order”. Some indication of the meaning
which Parliament intended to be assigned to the word “immoral” in relation to
nudity may be derived from the

[Page 173]

fact that it did not find it necessary to
include that word in the definition of “nudity” in s. 170  from which it
seems to me to follow that a person found to be “nude in a public place” could
not be convicted of a charge of having performed an immoral act under that
section or an immoral performance under section 163 .

Mr. Justice McDermid, however, in speaking
for the Appellate Division, expressed his view of the effect of s. 170  in
relation to the offence here charged in the following language:

The respondent was not charged under this
section and therefore could not be convicted thereunder. However, the
offence has always been treated as one relating to morals, and the Parliament
of Canada by making it an offence has declared that it is a breach of a moral
standard in Canada. We know of no better way of establishing moral standard
than a declaration by the Parliament of Canada, and so the Provincial Judge was
justified in accepting this as his standard in finding that the dance by the
respondent in the nude was an immoral performance.

With the greatest respect, I have difficulty in
accepting the proposition that being “so clad as to offend against public
decency or order” has always been treated as an offence relating to morals and
this difficulty is increased by the fact that s. 163(2) , under which this
appellant is charged, makes a distinction between that which is “immoral” and
that which is “indecent”.

The suggestion that an act becomes “immoral”
because it has been made an offence by the Parliament of Canada is to me a
completely novel one. It would mean, for example, that it is a “breach of moral
standards in Canada” to “loiter in a public place and in any way obstruct
persons who are there” contrary to s. 171(b), a section which,
like s. 170 , appears under the general heading of “Disorderly Conduct”.
For my part this reasoning does not assist me in determining what Parliament
intended by the use of the word “immoral” under s. 163(2) .

[Page 174]

The provisions of s. 170  do not stigmatize
the display of the human form in its natural state as “immoral” and as the
offence here charged must rest solely on the ground that the appellant’s body
was completely unclothed and there is no suggestion that the “performance” was
otherwise “immoral”, I conclude that the learned trial judge was
incorrect in holding “the said dance to be an immoral performance contrary to
the provisions of the Criminal Code ” as presently enacted, and I cannot agree
with the Appellate Division that the language employed by Parliament in
enacting s. 170  is to be construed as meaning that being unclothed in a
public place is a breach of moral standards in Canada and therefore
constitutes an “immoral performance” within the meaning of s. 163(2) .

Having regard to the fact that the appellant was
here charged with appearing “as a performer in an immoral performance”,
I find it unnecessary to express any opinion as to what the result would have
been if she had been charged with participating in an “indecent
performance”.

For these reasons I would allow this appeal and
restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Riley quashing the conviction entered
by the learned provincial magistrate at the trial.

Laskin J. concurred with the judgment delivered
by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta pronounced on June 9,
1972. By that judgment, the Appellate Division allowed an appeal from the
decision of Riley J. pronounced on February 8, 1972. Riley J. had allowed an
appeal by way of stated case from a conviction by Provincial Court Judge F.A.
Thurgood which had been pronounced on December 30, 1971.

The accused was charged that she

[Page 175]

On or about the 29th day of September, A.D.
1971 at Calgary in the said Province, did unlawfully appear as a performer in
an immoral performance, to wit: did dance in the nude in a theatre before a
paying audience, contrary to the Criminal Code .

On September 29, 1971, the date of the alleged
offence, s. 152(2)  of the Criminal Code  provided:

152. (2)
Every one commits an offence who takes part or appears as an actor, performer,
or assistant in any capacity, in an immoral, indecent or obscene performance,
entertainment or representation in a theatre.

The same exact section appears in the Criminal
Code  of Canada, 1970 R.S.C., c. C-34, as s. 163(2) .

The learned Provincial Court Judge gave judgment
in the trial before him very briefly as follows:

Well, I have listened to the argument of
both counsel and I appreciate the amount of work that they have put into this matter,
and I appreciate the fact that probably it is a case without precedent before
the Courts in Calgary at least. However, on review of all the authorities, I
cannot come to the conclusion that this case can be decided upon the basis of
most of the cases cited to me. As I said before, I’m inclined, I can find no
case involving the live exhibition of dancing in this country, where the dancer
was completely in the nude. I find the accused guilty of this offence.

And in the case which His Honour stated for the
Supreme Court of Alberta, His Honour said:

My reasons for judgment in finding the said
dance to be an immoral performance, HELD:

“… dancing in the nude in a public
performance is contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of Canada”

McDermid J.A., in giving reasons in the
Appellate Division whereby that Court allowed an appeal from Riley J. and
restoring the conviction of the Provincial Court Judge, summarized the facts in
this paragraph:

[Page 176]

The only evidence given against the
respondent was that of one detective of the City of Calgary Police Force, who
testified that on the day in question he entered the cabaret in question and
paid a $3 cover charge which included a meal and entertainment. There were
about sixteen other paying guests present. There was a stage in the cabaret in
front of which there were approximately twenty tables. The stage was well
lighted. The respondent danced three dances followed by a short intermission
when she returned to the stage and did a dance in the nude. She was entirely
alone on the stage at the time. The detective testified that the respondent did
nothing offensive in any way, shape or form by word, gesture or any other way
while the dance was being executed and the detective was not upset by the
performance.

Detective Scott was the only witness called for
the prosecution and his evidence was so brief that I quote in full the relevant
parts thereof;

A. Approximately sixteen male persons in
attendance. At approximately twenty after twelve a performer, Miss Kelly
Johnson, was introduced to the audience whereby she got on the stage in front
of approximately twenty tables and—to dance a topless dance. She danced three
dances; one with the top on and two with her top off and then there was a short
intermission. In approximately five minutes she returned to the stage and did
another dance with her top off and then another dance with her—removing her
bikini panties. She danced for approximately two minutes, shortly over two
minutes, whereby she left the stage.

Q. When she removed her bikini panties, how
was she dressed?

A. Completely in the nude.

Q. All right, was there any other
individual appearing on the stage besides Kelly Johnson at the time?

A. No, she was the only one.

Q. And what were the individuals doing in this
premises that you described?

A. They were seated at tables eating their
lunch and watching the performance.

And in cross-examination:

[Page 177]

Q. And according to your evidence she
performed a series of dances with various items of clothing?

A. Yes. I believe there were five dances in
all.

Q. She wore progressively less clothing as
the dances proceeded?

A. Yes.

Q. And this last dance, which she was
dancing without any clothes at all, occupied about two minutes perhaps?

A. I would say a little over two minutes.
The length of a record. I would say a little over two minutes.

Q. Was the accused dancing on an elevated
stage?

A. Yes.

…

Q. I repeat the question, she never left
the stage while she was dancing?

A. No.

Q. And I suggest to you, Detective Scott, that
it was rather a beautiful performance?

A. I beg your pardon?

Q. I suggest to you, Detective Scott, that
it was rather a beautiful performance. It didn’t upset you in any way?

A. No.

Q. I suggest further, sir, that the accused
did nothing offensive in any way, shape or form while this dance was being
executed. By offensive I mean by word or gesture or any other way.

A. No.

…

I note that the charge was particular that the
accused

did unlawfully appear as a performer in an
immoral performance, to wit: did dance in the nude in a theatre before a paying
audience, contrary to the Criminal Code .

Section 152(2) , now s. 163(2) , made it an
offence to be a performer in an immoral, indecent or obscene performance
thereby creating three possible offences and the Crown chose to charge only one
of those offences, that is, performing an immoral performance. It was the
Crown’s duty to prove that offence and either evidence or argument dealing with
indecent or

[Page 178]

obscene performance was quite irrelevant. It
will be seen from my recital that the only evidence adduced and therefore the
only evidence upon which the learned Provincial Court Judge could base his
decision was that of Detective Scott and Detective Scott had, as McDermid J.A.
pointed out, testified that the respondent did nothing offensive in any way,
shape or form by word, gesture or any other way while the dance was being
executed and that he was not upset by the performance. Under these
circumstances, it is my opinion that the learned Provincial Court Judge had no
evidence upon which he could come to his conclusion which as I have said, he
outlined in the stated case, that dancing in the nude in a public performance
was contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

The word “immoral” is not defined in the Criminal
Code  and therefore the learned Provincial Court Judge would have had to
have some evidence of what was and what was not immoral in order to found his
judgment.

The learned Provincial Court Judge himself asked
the Crown counsel:

What evidence is there that dancing in the
nude constitutes or what authority is there for the proposition of dancing in
the nude constitutes an immoral performance?

Crown counsel replied:

It is a submission that the Crown in the
terms of the prevailing moral standards …

The Crown failed to adduce any evidence of such
prevailing moral standards and in fact if Detective Scott’s opinion represented
those prevailing moral standards then the performance was certainly not
immoral.

Further in his argument, I think the Crown
counsel put the thing rather well:

I think what is of more material and what
is of the real essence here is whether or not dancing in the nude in Calgary,
Alberta, Canada, today constitutes a contravention of contemporary community
standards

[Page 179]

is real if I can use the expression “guilt
issue” in the case. I respectfully submit that although there is no question
about the fact that there have been changes in the contemporary community
standards over the years that those standards have not changed so much that it
is possible for an individual to stage a performance in public in the nude.
That this offence be prevailing the standards which exist within not only
Calgary, Alberta, but in Canada today.

I am therefore of the view that lacking such evidence
there was nothing upon which the learned Provincial Court Judge could come to
the opinion that he should register a conviction.

Riley J. quashed the conviction expressing his
conclusion in these words:

There was nothing to suggest that the
performance

(a) was in any way lustful,

(b) no tendency to deprave or corrupt,

(c) there was no distorted, impoverished
masturbatory concentration on pornography.

In the result the appeal is allowed and the
conviction quashed.

On the appeal by the Crown to the Appellate
Division, McDermid J.A. gave as his opinion for the registration of the
conviction by the Provincial Court Judge that the Provincial Court Judge was
referring to what is now s. 170  of the Criminal Code  and which at
the time of the offence was s. 159(1)  of the Criminal Code .

Section 170  reads:

170. Every
one who, without lawful excuse,

(a) is nude in a public place, or

(b) is nude and exposed to
public view while on private property, whether or not the property is his own,

is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

McDermid J.A. stated:

However, the offence has always been
treated as one relating to morals, and the Parliament of Canada by making it an
offence has declared that it is a breach of a moral standard in Canada. We know
of no better

[Page 180]

way of establishing a moral standard than a
declaration by the Parliament of Canada, and so the Provincial Judge was
justified in accepting this as his standard in finding that the dance by the
respondent in the nude was an immoral performance.

I am of the opinion that one must have regard
for the arrangement of the Criminal Code  in testing whether Parliament
has, in fact, declared that dancing in the nude is an immoral performance. Both
s. 163 and s. 170 of the Code as they now appear are in Part IV and
the general heading in that Part is SEXUAL OFFENCES, PUBLIC MORALS AND
DISORDERLY CONDUCT. There are after that general heading a series of
subheadings which are not marginal notes but are indented and form part of the
printing of the Code. These subheadings are as follows:

Interpretation

Special
Provisions

Sexual Offences

Offences Tending
to Corrupt Morals

Disorderly
Conduct

Nuisances

Section 163  appears under the subheading of
“Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals”. Section 170 , on the other hand,
appears under the subheading “Disorderly Conduct”.

The predecessor of s. 170  was added (as
s. 205A) to the Criminal Code  by the provisions of 1931, c. 28,
s. 2 , and reads as follows:

205A. (1)
Every one is guilty of an offence and liable upon summary conviction to three
years’ imprisonment who, while nude,

(a) is found in any public place
whether alone or in company with one or more other persons who are parading or
have assembled with intent to parade or have paraded in such public place while
nude, or

(b) is found in any public place
whether alone or in company with one or more other persons, or

(c) is found without lawful excuse
for being nude upon any private property not his own, so as to be exposed to
the public view, whether alone or in company with other persons, or

[Page 181]

(d) appears upon his own
property so as to be exposed to the public view, whether alone or in company
with other persons.

For the purposes of this
subsection any one shall be deemed to be nude who is so scantily clad as
to offend against public decency or order.

(2) No action or prosecution for a
violation of this section shall be commenced without the leave of the
Attorney General for the province in which the offence is alleged to have been
committed.

Section 205 of R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, dealt with
the offence now described in s. 169  of the Criminal Code . A reading
of the original subsection indicates that it is properly placed under the
subheading dealing with disorderly conduct and supports the contention made by
counsel for the appellant that the section was originally aimed at such
conduct as was exhibited not infrequently by members of a certain radical
religious sect. It was the effect on the public peace of such exhibitions which
Parliament aimed to control and prevent by the provisions of what is now
s. 170  of the Criminal Code  and Parliament there was not dealing
with immorality at all.

With respect, therefore, I am of the opinion
that McDermid J.A. was in error when he turned to s. 170  of the Criminal
Code  to ascertain the standard of morals and that the position upon the
prosecution is exactly what it was at the end of the trial before the
Provincial Court Judge, i.e., that the Crown had charged that the
accused had performed an immoral performance and it had utterly failed to prove
that the performance was immoral.

I, therefore, would allow the appeal and restore
the order of Riley J. quashing the conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE
COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal law-Civil rights-Motor vehicles-Ex­cessive
quantity of alcohol in blood---Breathalizer-No sample of breath given to
accused-No denial of right to fair trial-Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.),
c. 44, s. 2(e), (f)--Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 224, 557(3).

The appellant was stopped while driving a
motor vehicle and was taken to a local police station where he gave a sample of
his breath into a breathalizer. He was charged with driving a motor vehicle
having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the propor­tion thereof in his
blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to
s. 224  of the Criminal Code . Eight days after the breath sample was
taken, the appellant's solicitor requested a sample of that breath. The reply
received

[Page 918]

stated that no sample was available
and that none had been retained. The Provincial Judge, before whom the
information came, declined to quash it. Application was then made for an order
of prohibi­tion. That order was granted. On appeal by the Crown, the
prohibition order was set aside. The accused appealed to this Court. It was
argued that the failure to provide the appellant with a sample of his own
breath was a violation of s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per curiam: The legislative history of s. 224A shows that the requirement that
the accused be furnished with a specimen of his breath was deliber­ately
omitted from the legislation. The result is that the statute makes it clear
that the accused is not entitled to receive a specimen of his breath from the
person who takes the sample and that the analysis of the breath sample can be
used in evidence on a charge under s. 222  or s. 224 . Section 224A(1) (c) did
not deprive the appellant of a fair trial under s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights and is not in conflict
with it. In the circumstances of this case, s. 2(f)
of the Bill of Rights is not more comprehensive than s. 2(e) and the same considerations
apply.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, and Pigeon JJ.: The failure
of the Crown to provide evidence to an accused person does not deprive the
accused of a fair trial unless, by law, it is required to do so.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1],
setting aside an order of prohibition.

Harvey R. Daiter, for the appellant. 

M. Manning, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C. J. and of Abbott, Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE-This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario[2], which
allowed the appeal of the

[Page 919]

present respondent from an order of prohibition,
which prohibited any further proceedings against the present appellant under an
information and summons charging him with an offence under s. 224  (now s. 236)
of the Criminal Code . The order of prohibition was set aside. I will
refer to the relevant sections of the Code by the num­bers which they
bore at the time the offence charged is alleged to have been committed.

Section 224  of the Criminal Code  provided:

Every one who drives a motor vehicle or has the
care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having
consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood ex­ceeds
80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty
dollars and not more than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more
than six months, or both.

The facts giving rise to the present appeal are
stated in the reasons of Jessup J. A. in the Court of Appeal:

On March 11, 1971, the respondent was stopped,
while driving an automobile, by a member of the Oakville Police Department. He
was taken to the local police station where he gave a sample of his breath into
a breathalizer. On March 16, 1971, an information was sworn charging him with
driving a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such quan­tity that the
proportion thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood contrary to s. 224  of the Criminal Code . On March 19,
1971, a letter was addressed to the Oakville Po-lice Department by the respondent's
solicitor re-questing a sample of the breath taken from the respondent. On
March 23, 1971, a reply to such letter was received by the solicitor stating
that a breath sample was not available and enclosing the results of the breathalizer
test taken. On March 24, 1971, a further letter from the solicitor was directed
to the Oakville Police Department repeating the request for a breath sample in
order to enable arrangements for an independent analysis of the sample. On
March 26, 1971, a reply was received from the Oakville Police Department
stating that no samples of breath were retained by the police either for the
Crown's use or for the respondent's use.

[Page 920]

The Provincial Judge, before whom the infor­mation
came, declined to quash it. Application was then made for the order of
prohibition previously mentioned.

Section 224A(1)(c) (now s. 237(1)(c))
provided that:

(1) In any proceedings under section 222  or
224 , (c) where a sample of the breath of the accused has been taken pursuant to
subsection (1) of sec­tion 223, if the sample was taken as soon as practicable
after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed and in any
even not later than two hours after that time,

(ii) the sample was received from the accused
directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument operated by
a qualified technician, and

(iii) a chemical analysis of the sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,

(iv) evidence of the results of the chemical
analysis so made is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the
offence was alleged to have been committed;

Chapter 38 of the Statutes of Canada, 1968-69
contained, in addition to paras. (ii), (iii) and (iv), para. (i) which has not
yet been proclaimed and which reads as follows:

(i) at the time the sample was taken, the
person taking the sample offered to provide to the accused a specimen of the
breath of the accused in an approved container for his own use, and, at the
request of the accused made at that time, such a specimen was thereupon
provided to him,

The power of the Governor in Council, under s.
120 of that Act, to proclaim, inter alia, only certain portions
of s. 224A and to omit from the proclamation para. (i) above-mentioned, and cer­tain
other portions of that section, was the subject of a reference of this Court[3], whereupon it was decided that such power
was given by s. 120.

[Page 921]

The reasons which were given for the making of
the order of prohibition are stated in the follow­ing two passages:

If a person is being charged with an offence
based upon a sample of his own breath, in my opjnion [sic], in order to
properly answer that charge he must be given the opportunity of testing that
sample himself, and, to deprive the accused of such sample is to deprive him of
the right to make full answer and defence. It is plain that this accused has no
way of knowing whether or not Crown evidence that the proportion of alcohol in
his blood, at the relevant time, exceeded 80 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood
is true let alone answer it unless furnished with a specimen of the sample for
his own use and analysis.

It appears to me, therefore, that it is
impossible for this man to have a fair hearing in accordance with principles of
fundamental justice. When it appears obvious to the Court that there is going
to be a prosecution in violation of the provisions of section 2(e) of the Bill
of Rights I think that the Court should exercise its discretion and issue a
writ of prohibition to prevent the violation.

The latter passage refers to s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights. Reference was also made in the Court of Appeal and in this Court to
s. 2(f). The relevant parts of the Bill of Rights provide as follows:

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not
to abro­gate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abroga­tion, abridgment
or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and
declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so
as to

(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair
hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the
determination of his rights and obligations;

(f) deprive a person charged with a criminal
offence of the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law in a fair and public

[Page 922]

hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without just cause;

In the Court of Appeal, Jessup J.A. expressed
the view that s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights con­cerned only hearings
to establish civil rights and liabilities and that it is s. 2(f) which
is concerned with criminal liabilities. Aylesworth and MacKay JJ.A. expressed
no opinion on this point. This question was later considered by this Court in Lowry
v. R.[4],
when it was held that s. 2(e) was applicable to criminal as well as
to civil pro­ceedings.

Notwithstanding the view which he expressed as
to the application of s. 2(e), Jessup J.A. was of the opinion that both subs.
(e) and (f) guarantee a fair hearing and that there was little difference
between them in relation to the issue in the present case. He approached it as
if both sections might be applicable.

As Jessup LA. pointed out:

It will be seen that the extraordinary
result of Galligan, J.'s judgment, in effect, is judicially to proclaim in
force s. 224A(1) (c) (i), notwithstanding that the executive branch of
the Government, acting within the authority conferred on it by Parliament, has
not seen fit to do so.

However, he goes on to say, I think correctly:

Moreover, I agree with Galligan, J. that
the issue arising under the Bill of Rights involved in this appeal was not
dealt with, expressly or by impli­cation, by the majority of the judgments in
the re­ference...

The matter was raised in the dissenting reasons
of my brother Ritchie, concurred in by Spence and Pigeon JJ., but he added, at
p. 715:

No question is here raised as to the effect
which the Bill of Rights would have had if Parliament it-self had enacted s. 16
in the form in which it was proclaimed and I do not find it necessary to deal
with any such question.

[Page 923]

In view of the answers given by this Court on
the reference, the provisions which were pro-claimed stand in the same position
as if Parliament had passed them in that form.

However, the history of s. 224A has, I think,
some significance in this case. Section 223, which was enacted and proclaimed
at the same time as s. 224A, makes provision, in the circumstances stated in
the section, for a peace officer to require a person to provide a sample of his
breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made. This Court has held in Curr
v. R[5] that this provision was
not ren­dered inoperative by reason of a conflict with the Bill of Rights. Under that section the person re­quired to furnish a breath sample
is being required to furnish evidence which may be used in the man­ner provided
in s. 224A.

Section 224A, as enacted, would have required
the person taking the breath sample to offer to provide a specimen of the
breath to the accused, and, if requested by the accused, to provide such
specimen to him, before evidence of an analysis of the sample could be used
against him in a charge under s. 222  or s. 224 . However, that requirement was
deliberately omitted when the Act was pro-claimed, and the result is that
the statute makes it clear that the accused is not entitled to receive a
specimen of his breath from the person who takes the sample, and that the
analysis of the breath sample can be used in evidence on a charge under s. 222 
or s. 224 .

It is against this background that the appellant's
submission must be considered. Under s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights no law of
Canada shall be con­strued or applied so as to deprive him of ""a fair
hearing in accordance with the principles of fun­damental justice.""
Without attempting to formulate any final definition of those words, I would
take them to mean, generally, that the tribunal which adjudicates upon his
rights must act fairly, in good faith, without bias and in a judicial temper,
and must give to him the opportunity adequately to state his case.

[Page 924]

5 [19721 S.C.R. 889, 18 C.R.N.S. 281, 7
C.C.C. (2d) 181, 26 D.L.R. (3d) 603.

In the present case, of course, there has not
yet been any hearing. The hearing was prohibited because of events which
occurred before trial. How far pre-trial occurrences may be taken to have
prevented a fair hearing must be decided as the cases arise. In the case with
which we are con­cerned, the substance of the complaint is that, be-cause the
Crown failed to provide the appellant with certain evidence (which,
incidentally, he did not request until eight days after his breath sample was
taken), he has been prevented from having a fair trial, and, consequently, the
Crown is pre­cluded from proceeding to a trial in which an analysis of his
breath sample would be given in evidence.

This is not a case in which the accused has
requested information in the possession of the Crown, and been refused. Whether
or not a re­fusal of that kind would deprive the accused of a fair trial is not
in issue in this case. This is a case in which the complaint is that the Crown
failed to provide the accused with evidence for the purpose of his defence.

In my opinion, the failure of the Crown to
pro-vide evidence to an accused person does not deprive the accused of a fair
trial unless, by law, it is required to do so. In the present case, Parlia­ment
has provided that the analysis of a breath sample is, under certain conditions,
evidence in relation to a charge under s. 222  or s. 224 . It has not required
that the accused be furnished with a specimen of his breath, in order to make
such analysis admissible. On the contrary, the legisla­tive history of s. 224A
shows that such a requirement was deliberately omitted from the legislation.

In my opinion, s. 224A(1) (c) does not deprive
the appellant of a fair trial under s. 2(e) of the Bill of Rights and is not
in conflict with it.

In relation to the circumstances of this case, s. 2(f) of the Bill of Rights is
not more compre­hensive than s. 2(e) and what I have said as to the latter
provision applies equally to the former.

[Page 925]

I would dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
de-livered by

LASKIN J.-I agree with the Chief Justice that on facts of this case and
under the statutory pro-visions applicable thereto the appeal fails for the
reasons he has given, but I reserve my opinion on the general proposition
stated by him in the following words:

In my opinion, the failure of the Crown to
provide evidence to an accused person does not deprive the accused of a fair trial
unless, by law, it is required to do so.

The disposition of this appeal does not, in my
view, depend upon this proposition, and hence my reservation thereon.

Appeal dismissed.

1972: March 7; 1972: June 29.

Present: Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence, Pigeon and Laskin JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Civil rights—Motor
vehicles—Impaired driving—Breath test—Right to counsel—Refusal to take breath
test until lawyer contacted—“Reasonable excuse”—Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960
(Can.), c. 44, s. 2(c) (ii)—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 7(2),
222, 223.

The appellant was arrested for impaired
driving and, at the police station, was requested to submit to a breath test.
He asked for an opportunity to speak to his lawyer and refused to give a breath
sample when he was denied that opportunity. Two hours later, having spoken with
his lawyer, he asked for an opportunity to give a sample of his breath. That
offer was refused.

The appellant was convicted of failing,
without reasonable excuse, to provide a sample of his breath for analysis upon
a demand made pursuant to s. 223(1)  of the Criminal Code . On an appeal
by way of stated case, the conviction was set aside on the ground that the
denial of the appellant’s request to consult counsel afforded him a reasonable
excuse to refuse to give a breath sample. On a further appeal by the Crown, the
Court of Appeal restored the conviction. The appellant was granted leave to
appeal to this Court.

Held (Abbott,
Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the
conviction quashed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The refusal of the police constable
to permit the appellant to speak to his lawyer, in the circumstances of this
case, deprived him of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay,
and constituted a reasonable excuse for his refusal to comply with the

[Page 927]

demand of the police constable that he take a
breath test. Unless it is apparent that an accused person is not asserting his
right to counsel bona fide, but is asserting such right for the purpose
of delay or for some other improper reason, the denial of that right affords a
“reasonable excuse”. As the very purpose for which the appellant wished to
speak to his counsel was in order to determine whether or not he should comply
with the demand, he was deprived of his right to consult a lawyer at a time
when he was detained for the purpose of furnishing a sample, the analysis of
which, or refusal to furnish which, might be used in evidence against him. It
would run contrary to the provisions of the Bill of Rights to hold that
denial to a man under arrest of “the right to retain and instruct counsel
without delay” was incapable of constituting a reasonable excuse for failing to
comply with a demand under s. 223 of the Code.

Per Hall and
Laskin JJ.: There were two separate issues raised: (1) whether the denial of
the opportunity to consult counsel was a reasonable excuse within s. 223(2) and
(2) whether that denial, regardless of whether there was a reasonable excuse,
constituted such an infringement of the Canadian Bill of Rights as to
entitle the appellant to have the information stayed or the conviction set
aside.

Denial of an accused’s request to consult a
lawyer before he would agree to give a breath sample did not provide a
reasonable excuse to an accused for refusing to give such a sample. The phrase
“without reasonable excuse” must be regarded as adding a defence or a bar to
successful prosecution which would not be available without those words, but
not as encompassing defences or bars that would exist without them, such as
diplomatic immunity.

It does not lie with an arresting police
officer to determine in his discretion or on a superior’s instructions whether
or when to permit an arrested person to contact his counsel. The right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay, recognized by s. 2(c) (ii) of
the Bill of Rights, can only have meaning to an arrested or detained
person if it is taken as raising a correlative obligation upon the police
authorities to facilitate contact with counsel. The right given by s. 2(c)(ii),
when invoked by an accused upon whom a demand is made under s. 223(1) , did
not

[Page 928]

entitle him to insist on the personal attendance
of his counsel if he can reach him by telephone. Primacy must be given to the
substantive protection accorded by the Canadian Bill of Rights rather
than to the statutory rule of evidence embodied in s. 224A(c) (ii). It
is not more important for the Crown, to whom ordinary modes of proof are
available, to have the benefit of a rebuttable presumption through an analyst’s
certificate than it is for an accused to have the benefit of counsel.

The facts of this case show that s. 223 can
operate with due obedience to the Canadian Bill of Rights. All that is
required is that in the invocation of or exercise of the powers under it,
allowance be made for the exercise of the overriding right given by s. 2(c)(ii).
The result of the failure of the police officer to make that allowance vitiated
the conviction in this case, because the violation of s. 2(c) (ii) was the very
basis upon which the appellant was charged with an offence under s. 223(2) of
the Code.

Per Abbott,
Judson and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The phrase “require him to provide
then or as soon thereafter as is practicable a sample of his breath” in s. 223
contemplates immediate obedience to the request. What constitutes reasonable
excuse is to be determined under common law principles by virtue of s. 7(2) of
the Code.

Section 2(c) (ii) of the Bill
of Rights applies to “a person who has been arrested or detained”, and such
is not the legal situation of one who has been required “to accompany” a peace
officer for the purpose of having a breath test taken. The situation in this
case is not different because the appellant had already been arrested for
impaired driving. He was not deprived of his “right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay”. The fact that he was under arrest for impaired driving
did not entitle him to obtain legal advice before submitting to the test nor
could the refusal to be allowed to contact a legal adviser before submitting to
the test be a lawful excuse.

APPEAL from a judgement of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1],
reversing a judgment of Haines J. Appeal allowed, Abbott, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting.

[Page 929]

J. Jennings and D.J.D. Sims, for the
appellant.

M. Manning, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Martland,
Ritchie and Spence JJ. was deliverd by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by my brother Pigeon, but as I
do not share his view of the legal effect to be given to the Police Constable’s
initial refusal of the appellant’s request to retain and instruct counsel
without delay, made while he was in the police station under arrest for
impaired driving, I find it necessary to express my views separately.

The appellant was convicted of a charge under s.
223(2) (now 235) of the Criminal Code  of failing, without reasonable
excuse, to provide a sample of his breath for analysis upon demand made
pursuant to s. 223(1) . This conviction was set aside on a case stated before
Mr. Justice Haines of the Supreme Court of Ontario and it is from the reversal
of that decision by the Court of Appeal1 that the appellant
now appeals. We are, of course, bound by and limited to the facts as set forth
in the case stated by the learned provincial judge, which are fully set forth
in the reasons for judgment of my brother Pigeon, and for my purposes it is
only necessary to refer to the following items:

(b) the police officer signaled the accused
to stop the vehicle and when the defendant did so, police constable Mabbott
detected the odour of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and observed that his
eyes were glassy and red and his speech slightly slurred. The accused was
arrested for impaired driving and requested by the police constable to get into
the police car. The accused did so and was taken to a police station at approximately
1:00 a.m.

(d) The demand for a sample of the
accused’s breath was made by police constable Saunders at about 1:00 a.m. on the 19th day of November, 1970.

[Page 930]

(e) The accused then asked for an
opportunity to speak to his lawyer for the purpose of determining whether he
ought to comply with the demand made to him by police constable Saunders. The
accused advised police constable Saunders that he would only take the breath
test if so advised by his lawyer. The accused’s request was refused at that
time.

(f) At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November 19th, 1970, the accused spoke with his
lawyer and then asked for an opportunity to give a sample of his breath, but
the offer was refused.

(The italics in the above quotation are my own.)

The four questions submitted by the learned
provincial judge in the case stated before Mr. Justice Haines are set out
in the reasons for judgment of my brother Pigeon, but in view of the fact that
no argument was presented on question No. 3 and the further fact that the case
of Curr v. The Queen[2], which
has now been decided by this Court, rules out the application of s. 2(d)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, it appears to me that the only
questions remaining for consideration in this appeal are the following:

(1) Did I err in law in holding that the accused
did not offer a reasonable excuse to refuse to provide a sample of his breath,
although he had been denied the opportunity of consulting his lawyer after the
opportunity was requested by him.

(2) Did I err in law in holding that the
accused’s conduct constituted a refusal to comply with a demand to provide a
sample of his breath as contemplated by section 223  of the Criminal
Code .

(4) Did I err in law in holding that the
information of Douglas Germain sworn on the 19th day of November, 1970, was
valid and ought not to be quashed despite the provisions of subparagraph (ii)
of subsection (c) of section 2… of the Canadian Bill
of Rights, Statutes of Canada 1960, Chapter 44.

[Page 931]

Mr. Justice Haines answered “yes” to the
first question, “no” to the second question and “yes” as to s. 2(c) (ii)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario, in allowing the Crown’s appeal, directed that all the questions
stated by the learned provincial judge should be answered in the negative and
ordered that the conviction entered at trial should be restored.

Section 223(2)  of the Criminal Code , under
which the appellant was charged, reads as follows:

Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace
officer under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

(The italics are my own.)

The demand referred to in this
subsection refers to a demand made by a peace officer under s. 223(1)  (now
235(1))

…to provide then or as soon thereafter as
is practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made
in order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, and to
accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to be
taken.

Section 2(c) of the Bill of
Rights is in my opinion effective to establish that s. 223  of the Criminal
Code  shall not be construed or applied so as to

(c) deprive a person who has been
arrested or detained

* * *

(ii) of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay.

The stated case discloses that the accused’s
request to speak to his lawyer for the purpose of determining whether he ought
to comply with the demand for a sample of his breath was refused by the police
at a time when he was in the police station under arrest for impaired driving
and was being detained for the purpose of furnishing a breath sample. On these
facts appellant’s counsel contends that there was “reasonable excuse” for

[Page 932]

the failure to comply with the demand made under
s. 223(1)  on the ground that the question of whether or not the appellant was
required to give a breath sample was one upon which he was justified in seeking
legal advice having regard to the provisions of s. 2(d) of
the Bill of Rights, and on the further ground that he had a right to
contact his lawyer without delay under the provisions of s. 2(c) (ii) of
the Bill.

The refusal of the police constable to permit
the appellant to speak to his lawyer, in the circumstances of this case,
deprived him of the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, and
constituted a reasonable excuse for his refusal to comply with the demand of
the police constable that he take a breath test. Having regard to the
provisions of the Bill of Rights, s. 223(2) of the Criminal Code  is
required to be construed and applied in this sense, so that, unless it is
apparent that an accused person is not asserting his right to counsel bona
fide, but is asserting such right for the purpose of delay or for some other
improper reason, the denial of that right affords a “reasonable excuse” for
failing to provide a sample of his breath as required by the section.

It is suggested that the police officer’s
refusal did not amount to a refusal of the appellant’s right to consult his
counsel without delay, but was simply a refusal to accept the proposition that
the accused should not be required to take the breath test until after he had
spoken to his counsel. As the very purpose for which the appellant wished to
speak to his counsel was in order to determine whether, or not he should comply
with the demand and as the appellant was being detained for the purpose of
furnishing a breath sample, it seems to me that the refusal to accept this
proposition had the direct effect of depriving the appellant of his right to
consult his lawyer, and this right was denied him at a time when he was being
detained for the purpose of furnishing a sample of breath, the analysis of
which, or the refusal to furnish which, might be used as evidence against him
on that charge.

[Page 933]

In the courts below reliance has been placed on
two English cases decided under the Road Safety Act, 1967 (U.K.), c. 30, the relevant sections of
which read as follows:

2. (1) A
constable in uniform may require any person driving or attempting to drive a
motor vehicle on a road or other public place to provide a specimen of breath
for a breath test there or nearby, if the constable has reasonable cause—(a) to
suspect him of having alcohol in his body;…

3. (3) A
person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to provide a specimen for a
laboratory test in pursuance of a requirement imposed under this
section shall be guilty of an offence and—(a) if it is shown that at the
relevant time he was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road
or other public place, he shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished
as if the offence charged were an offence under section 1(1) of this Act;…

The case of R. v. Clarke[3] is relied on by the Court of Appeal as a
relevant authority and I think that in order to assess this case in relation to
the present one, it is essential to understand the facts which gave rise to it.
These are well set out in the judgment of Geoffrey Lane J., speaking on behalf
of the Court of Appeal at page 1009:

The facts of the case, briefly, were these.
In the early hours of Wednesday 7th February 1968 two police officers in
uniform in a police car followed the applicant, who was driving his vehicle
along Holland Park Avenue. His driving gave rise to concern; he was weaving
from one lane of the road to the other, and the policemen in their car in due
course stopped him. His breath smelt of alcohol, and (according to the evidence
of the police officers) one of those officers told him that he wished the
applicant to take a breath test. The reply was ‘All right, but I am only tired;
I have not been drinking’. Then, when the officer went back to the police
vehicle in order to get the test equipment, the applicant started up his motor

[Page 934]

car and suddenly moved off, narrowly
missing one of the officers. There then followed a chase over a distance just
short of two miles during which, according to the police evidence, the
applicant reached speeds of up to 80 miles per hour and went through a number
of sets of traffic lights when those lights were showing red. In due course he
was stopped by another police car, and was then arrested for failing to take
the breath test. He said to the officer ‘You. aren’t a police officer’. He was
then taken to a police station and offered a breath test, but did not take it,
just saying that he wanted to see the officer in charge. A little later he was
again asked to take a breath test, and on this occasion he said ‘I want to see
my solicitor’. He was then asked to supply a specimen of blood then or two
specimens of urine within an hour, and was told that he would be given part of
any specimen supplied and warned of what would happen if he refused to supply
them. To that request he replied ‘No, I will not do anything until I’ve seen my
solicitor’. At a minute before 4.00 a.m. he was asked to supply two samples of urine and warned of the
consequence again of refusal or failure, and to that request he replied ‘No’.
Then at shortly before 4.15 a.m. he was once again asked for a specimen of
blood and warned of the consequences of failure or refusal and told he would be
given a part of any sample supplied, and to that request he said ‘Can I make a
statement at this stage?’. Immediately thereafter he was charged with failing
to take the breath test, failing to supply samples and dangerous driving, and
to that charge he made no reply.

In my view the Clarke case is
distinguishable from the present case on the following grounds:

1. In the Clarke case the Court of Appeal
found that

The circumstances of the present case were
such that the jury were entitled to conclude, and probably did conclude, that
the applicant was pursuing a systematic campaign of prevarication, knowing full
well that the more time which elapsed before he gave a sample the greater
chance of his body metabolising

[Page 935]

the evidence. That being so, the jury would
be justified in inferring from the words ‘Can I make a statement at this stage’
that this was another refusal, albeit couched in different words.

In the present case there is no suggestion that
the appellant had been pursuing a campaign of prevarication and the delay
between the time when the demand was made for a breath sample and the time when
he offered it, was caused entirely by the refusal of the police to allow him to
contact his counsel.

2. In the Clarke case the accused was
charged with refusing to supply a specimen of his blood to the police for
testing at a time when he was in custody after having been arrested for failing
to take a breath test. At the time of his initial arrest the accused did not
make any request to consult with his lawyer but after he reached the police
station and was asked to give a sample of his blood and another sample of his
breath, he did say that he would not comply with the request until he had legal
advice. His attitude was described by the Court of Appeal as follows:

In the present case the applicant’s excuses
were these: first of all, that he was doubtful about what his rights were and
wanted legal advice;… he wished to have legal advice from the senior officer or
a solicitor, and also to make a complaint about the way in which the police had
treated him.

Under the circumstances of that case the Court
of Appeal found as a matter of law that these matters could not amount
to excuses “let alone reasonable excuses”.

It is apparent from a reading of this case that
the accused’s refusals were treated as a sham devised to delay or avoid being
subjected to a test, but in the present case there was, in my view, a genuine
reason for seeking legal advice.

3. In the Clarke case the Court was not
concerned with the provisions of the Canadian Bill

[Page 936]

of Rights, and
the doubts existing at the time when the present case was heard as to the
effect of s. 2(d) of that Bill on the requirement to
supply a sample of breath, formed no part of the question which had to be determined.

In the present case the alleged offence took
place on November 19, 1970, and, as I have indicated, at that time the Curr case,
which was subsequently decided in this Court and which determined that s. 2(d)
did not afford a valid reason for refusing to provide a sample, had not
been decided by Mr. Justice Fraser or by the Court of Appeal of Ontario.

In view of all the above, I do not think that
the Clarke case should be treated as an authority governing the facts of
the present case.

The second English case cited by the Court of
Appeal was Law v. Stephens[4], where
the accused was charged with “failing without reasonable excuse to provide a
specimen for a laboratory test contrary to s. 3(3) of the Road Traffic Act”.

In refusing to provide the sample, while in
custody in the police station, the accused had said “I am not interested until
I have spoken to my solicitor” and again, “No, I want legal advice” and
finally, “Not without my solicitor here”. It was contended on his behalf that
under these circumstances absence of his solicitor afforded him a reasonable
excuse for failing to provide the specimen.

In rendering the decision of the Queen’s Bench
Division, Parker C.J., treated the case of Regina v. Clarke, supra, as
authority for the proposition that, as a matter of law, this was not capable
of being a reasonable excuse within the meaning of s. 3(3) of the Road
Traffic Act. In this regard Parker C.J. said, at page 361:

So far as asking for a solicitor to be
present on the basis that he required legal advice, the Court of

[Page 937]

Appeal have held quite definitely that that
cannot amount to a reasonable excuse. In that connection I think it is
only right to say that it is a question of law in the first instance whether
something put forward is capable of being a reasonable excuse; if it is capable
of being one, then it becomes a matter of fact and degree as to whether or not
it amounts to a reasonable excuse, and the burden of course then is on the
prosecution to negative it.

(The italics are my own.)

With the greatest respect for the views
expressed by Parker C.J., I am unable to treat the case of Regina v. Clarke as
holding that an accused’s request for legal advice when in custody is incapable
of amounting to “a reasonable excuse”. I think rather that that decision is
expressly confined to the very special circumstances with which it was
concerned, and that it is based in great degree on the fact that the Court was
satisfied that Clarke’s request was a frivolous one made for the purpose
of delay. In any event, with the greatest respect for those who hold a
different view, I consider that the case of Law v. Stephens, supra, states
a proposition which is too broad to be applied in the courts of this country
having regard to the rights accorded to the individual by s. 2(c) (ii)
of the Bill of Rights, and it appears to me that it would run contrary
to the provisions of that statute to hold that denial to a man under arrest of
“the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay” was incapable of
constituting a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with a demand under s.
223  of the Criminal Code . This is not to say that there may not be cases
such as that of Regina v. Clarke where it is apparent that the request
for counsel is made purely for the purpose of delay but, as I have said, this
is not the case here.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal,
set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of
Mr. Justice Haines which quashed the conviction.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

[Page 938]

PIGEON J. (dissenting)—This appeal is
from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal[5]
reversing the decision of Haines J. on a stated case, and restoring the present
appellant’s conviction, under subs. 2 of s. 223  (now s. 235) of the Criminal
Code , of failing, without reasonable excuse, to provide a sample of his
breath for analysis upon a demand made pursuant to subs. (1).

(a) the accused, Clarence Wayne Brownridge,
was observed by a police constable Mabbott driving a motor vehicle eastbound on
Queen Street, in the City of Toronto at about 12:45 a.m. on the 19th day of
November, 1970. The vehicle was travelling without its headlights on and the
said police

The case stated by the Provincial Judge was as
follows:

constable stopped the vehicle on Dufferin
Street after it had turned off Queen Street, travelled then north on Gladstone,
then west on Peel and finally north on Dufferin Street.

(b) the police officer signaled the accused
to stop the vehicle and when the defendant did so, police constable Mabbott
detected the odour of an alcoholic beverage on his breath and observed that his
eyes were glassy and red and his speech slightly slurred. The accused was
arrested for impaired driving and requested by the police constable to get into
the police car. The accused did so and was taken to a police station at
approximately 1:00 a.m.

(c) At the police station, police constable
Saunders observed the accused and asked the accused to perform certain physical
tests as a result of which he formed the opinion that the accused’s ability to
drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. He then demanded that the
defendant provide him with a sample of his breath suitable to enable an
analysis to be made to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his
blood.

(d) The demand for a sample of the
accused’s breath was made by police constable Saunders at about 1:00 a.m. on
the 19th day of November, 1970.

[Page 939]

(e) The accused then asked for an
opportunity to speak to his lawyer for the purpose of determining whether he
ought to comply with the demand made to him by police constable Saunders. The
accused advised police constable Saunders that he would only take the breath
test if so advised by his lawyer. The accused’s request was refused at that
time.

(f) At approximately 3:00 a.m. on November
19th, 1970, the accused spoke with his lawyer and then asked for an opportunity
to give a sample of his breath, but the offer was refused.

(g) Upon hearing the evidence I held that
the accused refused to give a sample of his breath when requested.

The defendant desires to question the validity
of the said Order convicting him on the ground that it is erroneous in point of
law, the questions submitted for the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario
being:

(1) Did I err in law in holding that the
accused did not offer a reasonable excuse to refuse to provide a sample of his
breath, although he had been denied the opportunity of consulting his lawyer
after the opportunity was requested by him.

(2) Did I err in law in holding that the
accused’s conduct constituted a refusal to comply with a demand to provide a
sample of his breath as contemplated by section 223  of the Criminal Code .

(3) Did I err in law in holding that
section 223  of the Criminal Code  is operative despite the provisions of
subsections (d) and (e) of section 2 and section 5 of an Act for
the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
(Canadian Bill of Rights), Statutes of Canada 1960, Chapter 44.

(4) Did I err in law in holding that the
information of Douglas Germain sworn on the 19th day of November, 1970, was
valid and ought not to be quashed despite the provisions of subparagraph (ii)
of subsection (c) of section 2 and sub-paragraph.(d) of section 2
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Statutes of Canada 1960, Chapter 44.

[Page 940]

Haines, J. answered these questions as follows:

(1) The answer to question (1) is Yes.

(2) The answer to question (2) is No.

(3) The answer to question (3) is No.

(4) The answer to question (4) is Yes as to
s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and No as to s. 2(d) of the
same Act.

The Court of Appeal held that all the questions
should be answered in the negative. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted
generally. However, no argument was presented on question (3), as the same
matter was involved in the pending case of Curr v. The Queen[6]. The point is now settled by the
decision in that case.

Section 223  (now s. 235) reads:

223(1). Where a peace officer on reasonable
and probable grounds believes that a person is committing, or at any time
within the preceding two hours has committed, an offence under
section 222, he may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as
practicable, require him to provide then or as soon thereafter as is
practicable a sample of his breath suitable to enable an analysis to be made in
order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, and to
accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample to
be taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

[Page 941]

The offence contemplated in s. 222 (now s. 234)
is impaired driving. There is also in s. 224 (now s. 236) the offence of
driving with more than 0.08 per cent blood alcohol. Finally, s. 224A (now
s. 237) provides with respect to proceedings under either section, that the
evidentiary value of a breath analysis is subject to the following requirements
among others:

(ii) the sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time,

The material parts of s. 2 of the Bill of
Rights are as follows:

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to

* *
*

(c) deprive a person who has been
arrested or detained

(i) of the right to be informed promptly of
the reason for his arrest or detention,

(ii) of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay, or

* *
*

(d) authorize a court,
tribunal, commission, board or other authority to compel a person to give
evidence if he is denied counsel, protection against self crimination or other
constitutional safeguards:.

Our decision in the Curr case rules out
the application of s. 2(d) and only s. 2(c) (ii)
has to be

[Page 942]

considered in the present case. However, it
appears more convenient to start by considering the situation under the Criminal
Code  only.

In its judgment, the Ontario Court of Appeal
relied on two decisions of the Criminal Division of the U.K. Court of Appeal
under somewhat similar legislation: R. v. Clarke[7], and Law v. Stephens[8]. In the first of those cases, the
accused had fled in his car after being stoppd and requested to take a breath
test. He was chased at high speed, arrested for failing to take the test, taken
to a police station, again requested to take a breath test and also to supply
specimens of blood or urine. His last reply was “No, I will not do anything
until I have seen my solicitor”. The conviction for dangerous driving and for
failing to supply specimens of blood or urine was upheld, the Court expressing
the view that the wish to obtain legal advice before submitting to the test for
blood alcohol could not be an excuse for not taking it.

In the second case, the accused had willingly
accompanied an officer to the police station but his answers to the requests
made upon him were that he wanted to speak to his solicitor. He was charged for
failing to provide specimens as in the other case. The police contacted the
accused’s solicitor, who promptly came to the station and the accused, after
speaking to him, offered to provide a specimen. This opportunity was refused by
the police on the basis that there had been a refusal some time previously,
that that was a final refusal and that the offence was complete. The conviction
was upheld.

[Page 943]

In my opinion, the same view ought: to be taken
of the legal situation of a person who is properly requested to take a breath
test under s. 222 (now s. 234) of the Criminal Code . What the police
officer is entitled to do is to “require him to provide then or as soon
thereafter as is practicable a sample of his breath…”.The statute clearly
contemplates immediate obedience to the request. What may constitute a
reasonable excuse within subs. (2) is not defined. Therefore, this is to be
determined under common law principles by virtue of s. 7(2)  (now s. 7(3) ) of
the Criminal Code  which reads:

7. (2) Every rule and principle of the common
law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for am act or a
defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings
for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada,
except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

The legal situation of a person who, on request,
accompanies a peace officer for the purpose of having a breath test taken is
not different from that of a driver who is required to allow his brakes to be
inspected or to proceed to a weighing machine under s. 39(6) or s. 78(3) of the
Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 202. Such a person is under a duty
to submit to the test. If he goes away, or attempts to go away, to avoid the
test, he may be arrested and charged but this does not mean that he is under
arrest until this happens. He is merely obeying directions that police officers
are entitled to issue. Motorists cannot reasonably expect to be allowed to seek
legal advice before complying with such orders. Police officers are fully
justified in treating as a definitive refusal a refusal to comply until legal
advice is obtained.

[Page 944]

Does s. 2(c) (ii) of the Bill of
Rights alter the common law situation with respect to motorists requested
to submit to a test required by the Criminal Code  as opposed to tests
required by provincial legislation? I do not think so. The provision under
consideration applies to “a person who has been arrested or detained”. Such is
not, it appears to me, the legal situation of one who has been required “to
accompany” a peace officer for the purpose of having a breath test taken. The
test may well be negative and, in such a case, it would be quite wrong to say
that this person was arrested or detained and then released. Detained means
held in custody as is apparent from such provisions as s. 15 of the Immigration
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. i-2.

It is now necessary to consider whether, in this
case, the situation is different because when the accused was requested to
submit to the breath test, he had already been arrested for impaired driving.
As a person under arrest, he undoubtedly came within the terms of s. 2(c)
(ii) of the Bill of Rights and, therefore, he could not be deprived “of
the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay”. But he was not
deprived of this right: approximately two hours after being taken to the police
station, he was able to speak to his lawyer. It therefore appears from the
stated case that what the police refused to do was to accept that the accused
should not be required to take the breath test until after he had spoken to his
lawyer, not that he should be permitted to retain and to instruct him without delay.
When the accused having spoken to his lawyer finally asked for an opportunity
to give a sample of his breath, the result of the test, if taken, would not
have been available evidence against him. This is said to have occurred at
approximately 3 a.m. while the time when the accused was observed driving a
vehicle in a manner that attracted the attention of the police is given as
12.45. This was the time when an offence under s. 222 or s. 224 (now s. 234 and
s. 236) could be said to have been committed. Therefore, more than two hours
had elapsed.

[Page 945]

I fail to see any reason for which a motorist
suspected of impaired driving would be entitled to require the opportunity of
obtaining legal advice before submitting to a breath test if under arrest at that
time, while he would not have such right if not under arrest. I also fail to
see how a refusal by the police to allow such a person to contact a legal
adviser before submitting to such a test could be a lawful excuse if the person
is then under arrest, not if he is only accompanying a police officer on
request for the purpose of taking it.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Hall and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J.—The central issue in this appeal is
whether an arrested person who, subsequent to his arrest, is requested to
provide a breath sample under s. 223(1)  (now s. 235(1)) of the Criminal Code 
may be convicted under s. 223(2)  (now s. 235(2) of refusing without
reasonable excuse to comply with that request if at that time he has not been
allowed an opportunity to reach and consult his lawyer after having sought
permission to do so. In short, the question before this Court is the effect of
s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights upon s. 223  (now
s. 235 ) and associated provisions of the Criminal Code  in the light of
the circumstances set out below.

This question was not before this Court in Regina
v. Curr[9], in
which judgment was given on May 1, 1972. That case ruled out attempted reliance
by an accused, when requested to give a breath sample, upon the
self-crimination provisions of s. 2(d) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. A factual point of difference between the Curr case
and the present one is that the accused Curr

[Page 946]

had not been under arrest when he was asked to
provide a breath sample; Brownridge, on the other hand, had been arrested on a
charge of impaired driving before he was taken to a police station where he was
asked to give the sample. I do not attach any significance to this factual
difference in its relation to s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights.

Of the four questions set out in the stated
case, out of which this appeal arises, only the first and the fourth need be
considered. The second concerns the factual question whether accused’s conduct
amounted to a refusal to provide a breath sample, and there is no doubt that it
did. The third relates to the self-crimination point which was decided in Regina
v. Curr. Questions 1 and 4 and the answers thereto given by Haines J. and
by the Ontario Court of Appeal respectively are as follows:

1. Did I err in law in holding that the
accused did not offer a reasonable excuse to refuse to provide a sample of his
breath, although he had been denied the opportunity of consulting his lawyer
after the opportunity was requested by him.

4. Did I err in law in holding that the
information of Douglas Germain sworn on the 19th day of November, 1970 was
valid and ought not to be quashed despite the provisions of subparagraph (ii)
of subsection (c) of section 2 and subparagraph (d) of section 2
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Statutes of Canada 1960 Chapter 44.

Answer to question 1: Haines J., Yes. Court
of Appeal, No.

Answer to question 4: Haines J., Yes as to
s. 2(c) (ii). No as to s. 2(d). Court of Appeal,
No.

The breath sample provisions of the Criminal
Code  are in the following terms:

223. (1) Where a peace officer on
reasonable and probable grounds believes that a person is commit-

[Page 947]

ting, or at any time within the preceding
two hours has committed, an offence under section 222, he may, by demand
made to that person forthwith or as soon as practicable, require him to provide
then or as soon thereafter as is practicable a sample of his breath suitable to
enable an analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if any, of
alcohol in his blood, and to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of
enabling such a sample to be taken.

(2) Every one who, without reasonable
excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer
under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and not more
than one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both.

Related to these provisions are s. 222 (now s.
234) making impaired driving an offence and s. 224 (now s. 236) making it an
offence to drive with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of
blood. Section 224A (now s. 237) provides that in proceedings under ss.
222 or 224, evidence of the result of the chemical analysis of the sample taken
pursuant to s. 223(1)  establishes rebuttable proof of the proportion of alcohol
in the blood if, inter alia, “the sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time” (s. 224A(c)(ii)).

Section 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights reads:

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to

* *
*

[Page 948]

(c) deprive a person who has been
arrested or detained

* *
*

(ii) of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay,…

Haines J. held that the effect of s. 2(c)
(ii) upon s. 223  of the Criminal Code  was to provide the accused with a
reasonable excuse for refusing to give a breath sample when he was denied the
opportunity to consult counsel. In his view, s. 2 (c) (ii) did not render
s. 223  inoperative but operated upon the construction of s. 223  so as to
provide a ground of “reasonable excuse” under that exonerating clause of subs.
2 of that section. Indeed, he went on to say that the statutory defence of
reasonable excuse could be invoked in the present case even if there was no Canadian
Bill of Rights. Moreover, he was of the opinion that questions 1 and 4
boiled down to the same question in relation to s. 2 (c) (ii), and he
concluded that the information sworn against the accused under s. 223(2)  was
accordingly invalid and should be quashed.

The Court of Appeal agreed with Haines J. that
one issue only was raised by questions 1 and 4 as they related to s. 2(c)(ii),
namely, whether the denial of the accused’s request to consult counsel afforded
him a reasonable excuse to refuse to give a breath sample upon demand. It based
its negative answer to that question by contrasting the words “without delay”
in s. 2(c) (ii) and the words “forthwith or as soon as practicable”
in s. 223(1) , and concluding that “without delay” did not mean “instantly”, but
was to be construed by taking into account all relevant circumstances. In the
present case, this meant, in the view of the Court of Appeal, making reasonable
allowance for the operation of the policy embedded in s. 223 , which commanded a
police constable to act forthwith, i.e. immediately, or as soon as the
necessary test equipment could be procured, due regard being had to the two
hour time limitation of s. 224A.

[Page 949]

It is not disputed in the present case that
there were reasonable and probable grounds within the stipulations of s. 223(1) 
to support a demand for a breath sample. Counsel for the appellant accused
contended on this basis, and having regard to what happened after the accused
was arrested, that there were two separate issues raised by questions 1 and 4
and not simply one as the Courts below had stated. For him, the question
whether the denial of the opportunity to consult counsel was a reasonable
excuse within s. 223(2) was a different question from whether that denial
(regardless of whether there was a reasonable excuse) constituted such an
infringement of the Canadian Bill of Rights as to entitle the accused to
have the information stayed or quashed or the conviction set aside.

In my opinion, the stated case does raise two
separate issues in its questions 1 and 4. Question. 1 has to do with the
construction and application of s. 223  alone, but question 4 raises a more
general issue of the effect of an infringement of the Canadian Bill of
Rights. That question as formulated in the stated case is limited to the
effect upon the criminal proceedings against the accused of the alleged
infringement of one of the guarantees of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

Counsel for the Crown conceded in this Court
that s. 2(c) (ii), having regard to its text and to the other provisions
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, gave an accused a right to call for
counsel prior to trail. He submitted, however, that the denial of that right
gives rise to no remedy save that of having a federal enactment declared
inoperative. In the present case, moreover (so his contention went) the
discretion given to a police officer under s. 223(1)  of the Criminal Code  to
demand a breath sample was not in conflict with the accused’s right to invoke
s. 2 (c)(ii). I understood his submission to go this far; that even if
there was a conflict which emerged in the administration of the legislation,
the accused’s position in respect of. the charge against him was not affected
by s. 2 (c) (ii) of. the Canadian Bill of Rights; no

[Page 950]

remedy was prescribed by that Act other than to
render legislation inoperative, as in Regina v. Drybones[10]; no such consequence arose in the
present case; and the infringement of a right arising prior to trial could not
affect the regularity of the trial itself. I shall return to the question of
the available relief after I have dealt with the issue raised in question 1.

The precise form of question 1 does not, in my
opinion, reduce it to a question of fact. I read it to mean that the trial
judge ruled as a matter of law that denial of an accused’s request to consult a
lawyer before he would agree to give a breath sample did not provide a
reasonable excuse to an accused for refusing to give such a sample.

I agree with this ruling of the trial judge
because I regard the phrase “without reasonable excuse” as adding a defence or
a bar to successful prosecution which would not be available without those
words, but not as encompassing defences or bars that would exist without them.
For example, a right of diplomatic immunity from the domestic criminal law
would exist regardless of the absence of the words “without reasonable excuse”;
and similarly, in my view, if s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights sets up a bar, it is one which is independent of the presence of the
words in question. It would be strange, indeed, if the effect of the immunity
above-mentioned or of the Canadian Bill of Rights was vitiated by repeal
of the words “without reasonable excuse”.

I take as another illustration the two hour time
limit mentioned in s. 223(1) . It would be a defence to any demand to provide a
breath sample

[Page 951]

that the alleged offence had been committed more
than two hours prior thereto. This defence arises independently of any that are
envisaged by the words “without reasonable excuse” and hence is not dependent
on them.

The English cases cited to this Court, such as Regina
v. Clarke[11] and Law
v. Stephens[12], apart
from such considerations as were raised by Haines J. in his discussion of them,
are inapplicable. The right to counsel in England does not stand on such a
statutory foundation as is provided here by the Canadian Bill of Rights. There,
a defence on that basis would not arise independently of reliance on the
exoneration given by the words “without reasonable excuse”.

The terms of s. 223(1) , taken alone, appear to
me to warrant the construction that, generally speaking, the police are obliged
to proceed promptly to carry out their duties thereunder without waiting upon
third parties whose aid an accused may seek, whether it be his doctor or his
lawyer or his parent or guardian. I would not, therefore, agree to any general
rule that a request for such third party aid must qualify as reasonable excuse
within the meaning of the section.

It follows from my reading of s. 223  that
question 1, confined as it is strictly to the issue of reasonable excuse,
should be answered in the negative. This brings me to the larger issue posed by
question 4, which, put broadly, is whether the administration of s. 223  is in
any way qualified by s. 2(c) (ii) and, if so, whether the accused could
properly be tried or convicted on the charge against him, laid under s. 223(2),
when he was denied an opportunity to consult counsel.

I do not share the opinion of the Ontario Court
of Appeal that the right to resort to s. 2(c)

[Page 952]

(ii) in the face of the invocation of s. 223(1) 
is preserved by giving different meanings to the phrase “without delay” in s.
2(c) (ii) and to the phrase “forthwith or as soon as practicable” in s.
223 (1) . Neither taken by themselves nor in the context in which they appear do
the phrases convey any lesser sense of urgency in the one case than in the
other. I cannot reconcile the Court of Appeal’s view of “forthwith” in the
present case with the view it took of that word in its earlier decision in Regina
c. MacGillivray[13]. For
all practical purposes, “without delay” and “forthwith” are interchangeable.
Whatever leeway of time each allows is particular to its own setting; I can see
no justification for finding leeway in one by measuring it against the other,
except as a matter of preference for the policy which the one or the other
expresses.

If there is to be a preference, I think that the
language of the Canadian Bill of Rights requires that it be accorded to
the guarantees of that enactment. Section 2 enjoins a construction and
application of a law of Canada, in this case s. 223 , that would abridge or
infringe any of the rights or freedoms recognized in the Canadian Bill of
Rights; and one of these is the right of an arrested or detained person to
retain and instruct counsel without delay. I must note however that in
particularizing certain rights, s. 2 speaks in terms of depriving an
arrested or detained person of the right to retain and instruct counsel without
delay. I do not see that this weakens the injunction against abridgment or
infrigement.

On this view, it does not lie with an arresting
police officer to determine in his discretion or on a superior’s instructions
whether or when to permit an arrested person to contact his counsel. The right
to retain and instruct counsel without delay

[Page 953]

can only have meaning to an arrested or detained
person if it is taken as raising a correlative obligation upon the police
authorities to facilitate to reach counsel, if granted, would mean inability
contact with counsel. This means allowing him upon his request to use the
telephone for that purpose if one is available. I am not concerned in this case
with determining how many calls must be permitted. Here, on the facts, the
accused was prevented from making even one. I am content to say for the
purposes of this case that the accused’s right under s. 2(c) (ii)
would have been sufficiently recognized if, having been permitted to telephone,
he had reached his counsel and had spoken with him over the telephone. I would
not construe the right given by s. 2(c)(ii), when invoked by an accused
upon whom a demand is made under s. 223(1) , as entitling him to insist on the
personal attendance of his counsel if he can reach him by telephone. I refrain
from enlarging on the matters mentioned in this paragraph of my reasons because
it is better that this be done when particular cases call for it.

On the facts of the present case, it appears to
me quite probable that an opportunity could have been given to the accused to
try to reach counsel consistently with requiring him to submit to the breath
test within the two hour period within which an analyst’s certificate of the
result of the test would be admissible as prima facie proof of the
proportion of alcohol in the accused’s blood. The stated case shows that it was
about 12:45 a.m. when the accused was seen by a police constable driving a
motor vehicle; and it was about 1 a.m. the same day that the accused, having been
arrested and taken to a police station, was asked to provide a breath sample;
and it was at that time that he asked for an opportunity to speak to his lawyer
and refused to give a breath sample when he was denied that opportunity. He did
speak to his lawyer about 3 a.m. the same day, and then offered to give a
breath sample but his offer was refused. I assume that it was refused because
of the lapse of the two hour period.

[Page 954]

Before turning to my view of the consequences
that flow from the state of the facts herein and from the probability that I
have indicated, I wish to face up to the situation where the request to take
the breath sample within the two hours mentioned in s. 223(1)  and s. 224A (c)(ii),
thus obliging the Crown to prove its case without the benefit of a rebuttable
presumption. Weighing the respective interests involved, I have no doubt that
primacy must be given to the substantive protection accorded by the Canadian
Bill of Rights rather than to the statutory rule of evidence embodied in s.
224A(c) (ii). I cannot be persuaded that it is more important for the
Crown, to whom ordinary modes of proof are available, to have the benefit of a
rebuttable presumption through an analyst’s certificate than it is for an
accused to have the benefit of counsel.

Having regard to the facts and to the
probability stated, the remaining issue is whether the improper denial of an
opportunity to consult counsel affects the validity of the information upon
which the accused was tried and convicted or the validity of the conviction
itself. Question 4 is not framed in a way which expressly raises the validity
of the conviction, but I take this to be necessarily involved in it; certainly
the case was argued on this basis as well as having been so treated in the
respective factums of the parties.

This is not a case where the infringement of the
Canadian Bill of Rights renders a federal enactment inoperative. Regina
v. Drybones was a case where the particular federal enactment could have no
operation at all in the face of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The present
case does not present such a blunt face; its facts show that s. 223  can operate
with due obedience to the Canadian Bill of Rights. Hence, all that is
required is that in the invocation of or exercise of the powers under s. 223 
allowance be made for the exercise of the overriding right given by s. 2(c)
(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

[Page 955]

In my view, the result of the failure of the
police officer who demanded the breath sample to make that allowance vitiated
the conviction in this case. This follows not on any theory that violation of
the Canadian Bill of Rights carries this consequence in every criminal
case, but because the violation in this case was the very basis upon which the
accused was charged with an offence under s. 223(2). In short, the refusal of
the accused to give the breath sample until he had an opportunity to consult a
lawyer, a position that he was entitled to take on the facts herein and on the
application of s. 2(c) (ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights to
those facts, was the foundation of the charge and conviction for refusing to
give a breath sample when so requested.

A police officer cannot turn his violation of an
accused’s rights into an exercise of lawful powers of his own so as to support
a charge of a criminal offence which ordinarily arises if those powers are
flouted. Where the accused’s rights have primacy, as is the case here, the
police officer cannot assert his own powers as being then lawfully exercised
when that assertion amounts to a denial of the rights of an accused.

I am not dealing here with a situation where an
offence has been allegedly committed prior to the denial of the right to
counsel, or where the denial of the right to counsel, if it occurs first, is unrelated
to an offence allegedly committed subsequently. Such cases as Regina v.
Steeves[14],
O’Connor v. The Queen[15] and
Regina v. Ballegeer[16] do not
touch the kind of situation presented here, although the last‑mentioned
one has some affinity. There, the denial of right to counsel, following a
charge against and detention of an accused, from

[Page 956]

whom a statement was subsequently obtained, as a
result of which he pleaded guilty, was the basis of an order for a new trial so
that the accused could withdraw his plea of guilty and plead not guilty.

It follows from my reasons that I would answer
question 1 in the negative and question 4 (in its reference to s. 2(c)
(ii)) in the affirmative. In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside
the order of the Ontario Court of Appeal and restore the order of Haines J.
quashing the conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal Law—Appeals—Breach of trust by
elected municipal official—Indictment quashed—Crown’s right to appeal—Judgment
or verdict of acquittal—Meaning of “official”—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, ss. 99, 103, 510(1), 584 (1)(a).

The respondent, an elected municipal
official, was charged with a breach of trust in connection with the duties of
his office by causing payment to be made out of the County funds for work done
for his personal benefit on his own lands, contrary to s. 103  of the Criminal
Code . He moved, before plea, to quash the indictment on the ground that it
did not disclose any offence known to law. The trial judge quashed the
indictment on the ground that a municipal officer or a municipal official could
not be charged under s. 103  as the Code made it clear that there was a
difference between an “official” and a “municipal official”. The appeal of the
Crown was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Appelate Division on the
ground that this was not a judgment or verdict of acquittal within the meaning
of s. 584(1)(a) of the Code. The Crown was granted leave to
appeal to this Court, which reserved the question of jurisdiction of this Court
in the matter to be decided by the tribunal hearing the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The grounds upon which the trial judge
proceeded to maintain the motion to quash are not founded on procedural or
technical defects in the indictment; on the contrary, his judgment is
predicated on the interpretation he gave to the provisions of s. 103 . His
judgment was, in essence, tantamount to a judgment rendered in a case tried on
the merits. If the respondent were charged subsequently for the same offence, a
plea of autrefois acquit would lie. Being

[Page 615]

thus a final judgment or verdict of acquittal
resting on a question of law alone, the Attorney General had a right of appeal
to the Court of Appeal.

The respondent, as an elected municipal
official, is an official holding an office within the meaning of s. 103 of
the Code and, as such, subject to the provisions of that section. The position
held by the respondent is a position of duty, trust or authority in the public
service or is a service under constituted authority. Hence, the respondent may
be held to be an official holding an office within the meaning of s. 99(e)(i)
and 99(e)(ii) of the Code.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division[1],
affirming a judgment of the trial judge quashing the indictment. Appeal
allowed.

Ross Paisley, for the appellant.

A.M. Harradence, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—On September 29, 1969,
respondent appeared before Mr. Justice H.W. Riley, in the Trial Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta, on an indictment preferred under s. 103 
of the Criminal Code . Section 103  provides that:

103. Every official who, in connection with
the duties of his office, commits fraud or a breach of trust is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years, whether or not
the fraud or breach of trust would be an offence if it were committed in
relation to a private person.

The indictment against Roy Sheets reads as
follows:

That he at or near Red Deer in the Judicial
district of Red Deer in the Province of Alberta between the 1st day of October,
A.D. 1966, and the 30th day of November, A.D. 1966, did, being an official,
unlawfully commit a breach of trust in connection with the duties of his
office, namely as a member of the Council of the County of Red Deer, to wit: by
causing payment to be made out of the County of

[Page 616]

Red Deer funds for work done for the
personal benefit of the said Roy Sheets on his lands contrary to the Criminal
Code .

On the arraignment, respondent, pursuant to
s. 510(1), moved, before plea, to quash the indictment on the ground that
it did not disclose any offence known to law. After argument, the learned judge
took the matter under advisement and, by judgment rendered on November 18,
1969, he quashed the indictment for reasons thus expressed:

A municipal officer or a municipal official
cannot be charged under section 103  as the Code makes it clear that there
is a difference between an official and a “municipal official”. The word
official is defined and it is clearly an office which is involved with either
the federal or provincial government.

The Crown appealed from this decision to the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, pursuant to s. 584(1)(a)
which provides that:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone, or …

At the hearing of the appeal, respondent
submitted (i) that a judgment quashing an indictment is not “a judgment or
verdict of acquittal” within the meaning of s. 584(1)(a) and,
consequently, the Crown had no right of appeal in the premises and (ii) that
the judgment of Riley J. is well-founded.

Respondent’s first submission was acceded to by
Johnson and McDermid, JJ.A., who relied on the decision of this Court in Kipp
v. The Attorney General of Ontario[2]. This,
being decisive of the appeal, the learned judges did not deal with respondent’s
second submission. Kane, J.A., dissented. Resting his opinion on the decision

this Court in Lattoni and Corbo v. The Queen[3], he found that the judgment under
review was a judgment or verdict of acquittal on a question of law alone and,
accordingly, one from which the Crown had a right of appeal. Having then
considered the appeal on the merits, the learned judge rejected, as
ill-founded, the view that a municipal officer or a municipal official cannot
be charged under s. 103 of the Code. In the result, the appeal of the
Crown was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Appellate Division[4].

The Crown then sought leave to appeal from this
decision to this Court on the grounds that the Appellate Division erred in
failing to hold that the judgment of Riley J. was a judgment or verdict of
acquittal and that the indictment disclosed a good and valid charge against the
accused. Respondent opposed this application, on the basis that this Court had
no jurisdiction in the matter. The Court granted leave, reserving the question
of jurisdiction to be decided by the tribunal hearing the appeal.

Dealing with the question of jurisdiction:—If
the judgment quashing the indictment in this case is “a judgment or verdict of
acquittal” on a question of law alone, then the Attorney General had a right of
appeal de piano from this judgment to the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court, pursuant to s. 584(1)(a) and, from the judgment of the
latter Court dismissing his appeal, he now has a right of appeal de piano to
this Court on the question of law on which Kane, J.A., dissented and, with
leave of this Court, a right of appeal on any other question of law; the whole,
as provided by the relevant parts of s. 598 of the Code, enacting that:

598. (1) Where a judgment of a court of
appeal… dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of
subsection (1) …of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on
which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

[Page 618]

(b) on any question of law,
if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada…

As to the nature of the judgment of Riley J., I
must say, with deference to the opinion expressed by the majority in the
Appellate Division, that I am in respectful agreement with the conclusion
reached by Kane, J.A. The grounds upon which Riley J. proceeded to maintain the
motion to quash are not founded on procedural or technical defects in the indictment,
such as duplicity and misjoinder or the omission of an essential allegation. On
the contrary, his judgment is predicated on the interpretation he gave to the
provisions of s. 103  under which respondent was charged. Thus, in his
view, the accused—who, as indicated in the judgment of first instance, was
conceded to be an elected municipal official,—could not, as such, be validy
charged under these provisions which, properly interpreted, are referable only
to an office involved with either the Federal or a Provincial Government.

In my opinion, this case is governed by the
decision in Lattoni and Corbo, supra, where this Court unanimously
agreed with the Court of Appeal of the province of Quebec, that the judgment
quashing the indictment, in that case, was a judgment or verdict of acquittal
because it rested upon the ground that criminal proceedings against the accused
were prescribed.

The situation in the Kipp case, supra, is
quite different. Indeed, as it appears from the reasons of Judson J., who
delivered the judgment for the majority, the Court proceeded on the basis that
the objection of counsel for the accused was to “the form of the indictment”,
and that the indictment was quashed by the County Court judge “on the sole
ground that it was void for duplicity”. This Court, having then found the
judgment of the County Court judge to be erroneous and having noted that it was
common ground that there was no right of appeal from that decision, held that
it was proper, in the circumstances, to issue a writ of mandamus directing the
County Court judge to proceed with the trial.

[Page 619]

In my view, the judgment of Riley J., is, in
essence, tantamount to a judgment rendered in a case tried on the merits and I
am clearly of opinion that, were respondent charged subsequently for the same
offence as the one embodied in the indictment, a plea of autrefois acquit would
Me. Being thus a final judgment or verdict of acquittal resting on a question
of law alone, the Attorney General could, as he did, appeal to the Appellate
Division and, consequential to the dismissal of his appeal, further appeal to
this Court.

I would add that the difficulty on this point
appears to have arisen because of a loose use of language. On the view taken by
Riley J., the accused should have been acquitted or the charge against him
should have been dismissed.

Dealing with the merits of the appeal:—The issue
is whether respondent,—who was conceded, in first instance, to be an elected
municipal official,—is an official holding an office, within the meaning of
s. 103 of Part III of the Code and, as such, subject to the provisions of
that section.

The words “official” and “office” are referred
to in s. 99, the definition section of Part III, entitled “Offences
against the administration of law and justice”, and are defined as follows:

99. In this Part,

(e) “official” means a person
who

(i) holds an office, or

(ii) is appointed to discharge a public
duty;

* *
*

(d) “office” includes

(i) an office or appointment under the
government,

(ii) a civil or military commission, and

(iii) a position or employment in a public
department;

According to recognized rules of interpretation,
the expression “means”, used in s. 99(e) with respect to the word
“official”, is of an explanatory and restrictive nature and, in
contradistinction, the expression “includes”, used in s. 99(d) with
respect to the word “office”, is of an extensive nature. The definition of
official in s. 99(e)(i) being, as it is, governed by the definition
of office

[Page 620]

in s. 99(d), it follows that
an official is a person who holds an office either within the meaning of
sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (d) of
section 99 or within the usual meaning of the word office which, validly
ascertainable by reference to dictionaries, means, in part, as noted in the
dissent of Kane, J.A., “a position of duty, trust or authority, esp. in the
public service or in some corporation, society or the like” (cf. The New
Century Dictionary) or “a position to which certain duties are attached, esp. a
place of trust, authority or service under constituted authority” (cf. The
Shorter Oxford Dictionary).

It goes without saying that the position held by
a member of a council of a county is a position of duty, trust or authority in
the public service or is a service under constituted authority. Hence,
respondent may be held to be an official holding an office, within the meaning
of s. 99(e)(i).

A like conclusion obtains on the basis of the
text of s. 99(e)(ii), for it is equally obvious that a member of a
council of county “is appointed to discharge a public duty”.

In support of the contention that respondent is
not an official holding an office, within the meaning of s. 103 , under
which he was charged, it is argued (a) that the case of a municipal official is
dealt with exhaustively in s. 104; (b) that respondent is not an official
under s. 99(e)(i), because he is not holding an office within the
description of s. 99(d)(i), (ii) and (iii) and that s. 99(d)
does not apply to a municipal official; (c) that he is not an official
under s. 99(e)(ii), because he is not a person appointed but a
person elected to discharge a public duty.

For reasons hereafter stated, I am unable to
accept these submissions.

[Page 621]

As to the first:—The fact that a person may,
because of an act or omission, be subject to prosecution under two statutory
provisions, is not per se a decisive criterion of interpretation of
either one. Above all, it must be noted that s. 103  and s. 104  are
dealing with two different offences. The former deals with a breach of trust by
every official and such an offence is one that may be committed by the action
or omission of a single person. The latter deals with municipal corruption and
the influencing of municipal officials, which are two offences in respect to
which at least two persons must necessarily be concerned. And it may finally be
observed that s. 104 makes no reference whatever to a breach of trust simpliciter
and it follows that, if respondent’s first contention were entitled to
prevail, a municipal official could, in contradistinction with other officials,
commit with impunity a breach of trust within the meaning of s. 103 .

As to the second submission:—I have already
stated my views with regard to the extensive meaning and effect of the word “includes”
in s. 99(d), and only wish to make a few comments on the decision
of this Court in Belzberg v. The Queen[5].
In that case, the accused was charged, under s. 104, with offering
bribes to the Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary. Whether such an
inspector was a “municipal official”, within the meaning of s. 104(3),
was, as stated by Ritchie J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, an issue
of which the solution depended on the meaning to be ascribed to the word
“office” as used in s. 104(3). In considering the matter, reference was
made to s. 99 in the last paragraph of page 258. It is respondent’s
contention that what was there said supports the proposition that s. 99(d)
does not apply, in a case under s. 103 , to an office under a municipal
government. It appears to me, from the context of that case, that this
reference to the provisions of s. 99 must be confined to the application
of subsection (d)(i), (ii) and (iii) of s. 99 to an office
under a municipal government within the meaning of s. 104(3) and cannot be
extended to

[Page 622]

a case under s. 103 of which the opening
words are “every official …”

With respect to the last submission:—It must be
recognized that the word “appointed” is often contrasted with the word
“elected”. However, in this particular case, I fail to see any reason why this
distinction should obtain or to perceive any intent of Parliament to
discriminate on the basis of the method by which one accedes to a public
office. A like distinction was rejected by this Court in the case of Martineau
v. The Queen,[6] where
the accused, appointed to the Legislative Council of the province of Quebec
pursuant to an order-in-council, was prosecuted under s. 102 (1)(a)(ii)(iii).
Relying on the comments made in the first paragraph of page 108, Kane, J.A.,
rejected, and in my respectful view rightly so, a like distinction made by
respondent in this case.

For all these reasons, I would allow the appeal,
quash the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
and direct that the record be returned to the Supreme Court of Alberta in order
that the trial judge of that court proceed to try the respondent on the
indictment as preferred.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Care and control of
motor vehicle while ability to drive impaired—Accused found in driver’s
seat—Statutory presumption—Degree of proof required to rebut presumption—Reasonable
doubt or proof on balance of probabilities—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, ss. 222, 224A(1)(a).

Civil rights—Care and control of motor
vehicle while ability to drive impaired—Statutory presumption—Onus on accused
to rebut presumption—Onus not incompatible with Canadian Bill of
Rights——Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 222, 224A(1)(a)—Canadian Bill
of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, s. 2(f).

The respondent, a taxi driver, was charged
with having the care and control of a motor vehicle while his ability to drive
was impaired by alcohol or a drug contrary to s. 222  of the Criminal
Code . It is admitted that he was in an impaired condition and was seated in
the front seat of his taxi at the time of his arrest. He sought to rebut the
presumption under s. 224A(1)(a) of the Code by testifying that he
entered the driver’s seat of the taxi to use the radio to summon a wrecker,
rather than for the purpose of driving the vehicle. The trial judge entered a
conviction on the basis that although the evidence raised a reasonable doubt in
his mind, he was not satisfied that the respondent had established by a a
preponderance of evidence or by a balance of probabilities “that he did not
enter or mount the motor vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion”. On
an appeal by way of stated case, the judge quashed the conviction on the ground
that, to rebut the presumption, the accused was not obliged to do more than
raise a reasonable doubt. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to
whether the Court of Appeal erred in

[Page 304]

holding that the degree or standard of proof
required to rebut the statutory presumption created by s. 224A(1)(a)
is not proof by the balance of probabilities but only proof raising a
reasonable doubt.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.:
Section 224A(1)(a) imposes a burden of proof on an accused by a
preponderance of evidence or by a balance of probabilities, and it is not
enough merely to raise a reasonable doubt. There is no distinction between the
word “establishes” as used in the section and the word “proves” as used in
other sections of the Criminal Code . When a statute imposes an onus
upon an accused person to establish or to prove an essential fact that burden
of proof is fulfilled by satisfying the obligation which rests upon the party
in a civil action to prove by a preponderance of evidence or by a balance of
probabilities the allegation of which proof is required. If it is enough, to
rebut the presumption, for the accused to raise a reasonable doubt as to
whether or not he entered the motor vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion,
then it would follow that if the Crown has established the basis of the
presumption beyond a reasonable doubt, it must also give similar proof of the
facts which the statute deems to exist and expressly requires the accused to
negate. Such a construction would make the statutory presumption ineffective
and the section meaningless.

There is nothing in this procedure which
deprives the accused of the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law within the meaning of Woolmington v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462, and s. 2(f) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights.

Per Hall and
Laskin JJ.: The effect of s. 224A(1)(a) of the Code is to
oblige the accused to do more than raise a reasonable doubt. A burden is cast
upon him to adduce negating evidence that would carry proof on a balance of
probabilities.

This statutory onus is compatible with
s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights which prescribes that
“no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a person charged
with a criminal

[Page 305]

offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law.” The “right to be presumed innocent” is a
way of expressing the fact that the Crown has the ultimate burden of
establishing guilt. The presumption does not preclude any statutory or
non-statutory burden upon an accused to adduce evidence to neutralize, or
counter on a balance of probabilities, the effect of evidence presented by the
Crown. The test for the invocation of s. 2(f) is whether the
enactment against which it is measured calls for a finding of guilt of the
accused when, at the conclusion of the case, and upon the evidence, if any,
adduced by Crown and by accused, who have also satisfied any intermediate
burden of adducing evidence, there is reasonable doubt of culpability. Section
224A(1)(a) is not of this character.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
affirming a judgment of Dohm J. on an appeal by way of stated case. Appeal
allowed.

G.L. Murray, Q.C., for the appellant.

C.R. Maclean, for the respondent.

Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Hall,
Spence and Pigeon JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought pursuant to
leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia[2]
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from an order made by Mr. Justice Dohm
whereby he gave answer to the question posed in a case stated by Provincial
Judge H.M. Ellis by holding that the Provincial Judge was wrong in ruling that
the standard of proof required to rebut the statutory presumption created by
s. 224A(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  is proof by a
preponderance of evidence or by a balance of probabilities.

The sole question of law upon which leave to
appeal to this Court was granted was:

That the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia erred in holding that the degree or standard of proof re-

[Page 306]

quired to rebut the statutory presumption
created by section 224A(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  is not proof by
the balance of probabilities but only proof raising a reasonable doubt?

The present respondent was charged with having
care and control of a motor vehicle while his ability to drive was impaired by
alcohol or a drug contrary to s. 222  of the Criminal Code , and as
it appears to be admitted on all sides that he was indeed in an impaired
condition at the relevant time, the only question left at issue is whether or
not he had the care and control of the taxi in the front seat of which he was
seated at the time of his arrest. In proof of this latter element of the
offence, the Crown relied on the statutory presumption created by
s. 224A(1) (a) which reads as follows:

224A. (1) In any proceedings under
section 222  or 224 ,

(a) where it is proved that the
accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle,
he shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the vehicle unless he
establishes that he did not enter or mount the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion;…

The preamble to the case which was stated by the
learned Provincial Judge at the request of the respondent, includes the
folowing:

3. Evidence upon the proceedings questioned
was heard before me on the 9th day of March, A.D. 1970, and I reserved decision
until the 15th day of April, A.D. 1970, whereupon I found the said William F.
Appleby guilty, as charged.

4. The relevant facts as found are:

(a) That the Defendant sought to rebut the
presumption under Section 224A(1) (a) by testifying that he entered the
driver’s seat of the taxi to use the radio to summon a wrecker, rather than for
the purpose of driving the vehicle and, although this evidence was unsupported
by any other witness, it did raise a reasonable doubt in my mind.

(b) I made a ruling upon the points of law
relevant to the question raised, relying on the Judgment of Munro, J., in the
case of R. Vs McRae (1969) 4 CCC 374 which dealt with Section 224(2)  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada,

[Page 307]

As will hereafter appear from a further
consideration of the McRae[3]
case, it seems to me that it must be concluded that the learned Provincial
Judge entered the conviction on the basis that although he was in doubt as to
the respondent’s evidence, he was not satisfied that he had established by a
preponderance of evidence or by a balance of probabilities “that he did not
enter or mount the motor vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion.”

In the course of the reasons for judgment which
he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia in the present case, Mr. Justice Tysoe appears to me to have
adopted the view that if an accused’s evidence leaves the court in doubt as to
his purpose in entering the driver’s seat of a motor vehicle, he thereby “establishes
that he did not enter or mount the motor vehicle for the purpose of setting
it in motion” within the meaning of s. 224A(1) (a). In
reaching this conclusion Mr. Justice Tysoe adopted the decision of
Mr. Justice Lord in R. v. Sokalski[4],
and in commenting on that decision he said:

It is my view that the dictum that ‘if the
accused raises a reasonable doubt as to what was his intention, that is as far
as he need go in rebutting the presumption’ was not mere obiter, but was part
of the ratio of the decision. I think we are bound by the judgment in that
respect. Whether that be so or not, while freely admitting that the question is
a close one, in my respectful opinion the dictum correctly describes the nature
and extent of the onus which rests upon the accused in order to rebut the presumption
of care or control created by section 224A(1) (a).

The main argument before this Court turned on
the meaning to be attached to the word “establishes” as it occurs in
s. 224A(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . It will be seen that the
Court of Appeal treated this word as being equivalent to “raises a reasonable
doubt”, but with the greatest respect, I am unable to distinguish between the
word “establishes” as used in s. 224A(1) (a) and the word “proves”
as used in other sections of the Criminal Code . In the case of Clark
v.

[Page 308]

The King[5], Mr. Justice Anglin (as he then was) had to consider
the provisions of s. 19(3) of the Code with respect to insanity which then
read as follows:

Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omtting to do any act until the contrary is proved.

In the course of his reasons for judgment at
page 625, he had this to say:

‘Proved’ is not a word of art. Aaron’s
Reefs v. Twiss 1896 A.C. 273 at 282. It may have different shades of
meaning varying according to the subject matter in connection with, and the
context in which, it is used. ‘Tested’ or ‘made good’ or ‘established’ are its
ordinary equivalents…. Here I find nothing to warrant requiring evidence of
greater weight than would ordinarily satisfy a jury in a civil case that a
burden of proof had been discharged—that, balancing the probabilities upon the
whole case, there was such a preponderance of evidence as would warrant them as
reasonable men in concluding that it had been established that the accused when
he committed the act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality,
or if he did know it, did not know that he was doing what was wrong. That I
believe to be the law of Canada, as it appears to be that of most of the states
of the American Union.

This standard of proof was reaffirmed in this
Court in Smythe v. His Majesty the King[6],
in the reasons for judgment of Sir Lyman Duff at page 17, which were in
turn followed in the reasons for judgment of Fauteux J. (as he then was) in Latour
v. The King[7],
where he said of the defence of insanity:

So, there is, in such case, an obligation
to prove or to establish the defence of insanity even if it need not be established
beyond reasonable doubt but only to the reasonable satisfaction of the
jury. (The italics are my own).

In light of these authorities I am of opinion
that the same considerations apply in rebutting the presumption created by
s. 224A(1) (a) as those

[Page 309]

which apply in the case of an accused charged
with having possession of housebreaking instruments contrary to s. 295(1).

Section 295(1) reads, in part, as follows:

295. (1) Every one who without lawful
excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession…

and in the course of the reasons for judgment
delivered on behalf of the majority of this Court in Tupper v. The Queen[8], Mr. Justice
Judson described the nature of the burden resting on the accused in the
following language:

Once possession of an instrument capable of
being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused
to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for
possession of the instrument at the time and place in question. (The italics
are my own).

Following a decision delivered by Lord Reading
in Rex v. Ward[9],
a considerable body of case law developed in British Columbia and elsewhere
to the effect that the onus of disproof of an essential ingredient of an
offence imposed upon an accused by statute could be discharged by the accused
giving evidence which raised a reasonable doubt in the mind of the court. This
was the attitude adopted by Bird J.A. (as he then was) in Rex v. Hoy[10] and by Sheppard J.A.,
who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Reg.
v. Jones[11].

The case of Rex v. Ward was, however,
repudiated in a judgment of Parker L.C.J., in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex
v. Patterson[12],
where the accused was charged with having possession of housebreaking
instruments and Lord Parker, after saying that the Ward case “ought not
to be followed” went on to say:

Once possession of such an implement has
been shown the burden shifts onto the prisoner to prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that there was lawful

[Page 310]

excuse for his possession of the implement
at the time and place in question.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in Rex
v. McRae, supra, upon which the learned Provincial Judge relied in the
stated case, Mr. Justice Munro, after making general reference to the
above authorities, proceeded to say:

I do not find it necessary to review such
authorities since the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Tupper v.
The Queen and the judgment of the British Columbia Court in Reg. v.
McCoole, 1968 65 W.W.R. 427. It is my opinion that it is now settled law in
Canada that when a statute imposes an onus upon an accused person to establish
or to prove an essential fact that burden of proof is fulfilled by satisfying
the obligation which rests upon the party in a civil action to prove by a
preponderance of evidence or by a balance of probability the allegations of
which proof is required by the party so asserting.

I adopt this as an accurate statement of the
law, and as Mr. Justice Bull states in his reasons for judgment in the
present case, it will be found that the leading authorities in the House of
Lords, the Privy Council and other Commonwealth Courts of Appeal are to the
same effect. In this regard, the language used by Lord Diplock in Public
Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj[13]
appears to me to be particularly pertinent. He there said:

Generally speaking, no onus lies upon a
defendant in criminal proceedings to prove or disprove any fact: it is
sufficient for his acquittal if any of the facts which, if they existed, would
constitute the offence with which he is charged are “not proved.” But exceptionally,
as in the present case, an enactment creating an offence expressly provides
that if other facts are proved, a particular fact, the existence of which is a
necessary factual ingredient of the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to
exist ‘unless the contrary is proved.’ In such a case the consequence of
finding that that particular fact is ‘disproved’ will be an acquittal, whereas
the absence of such a finding will have the consequence of a conviction. Where
this is the consequence of a fact’s being ‘disproved’ there can be no grounds
in public policy for requiring that exceptional degree of certainty as excludes
all reasonable doubt that that

[Page 311]

fact does not exist. In their Lordships’
opinion the general rule applies in such a case and it is sufficient if the
court considers that upon the evidence before it it is more likely than not
that the fact does not exist. The test is the same as that applied in civil
proceedings: the balance of probabilities.

The exceptional provisions relating to proof in
proceedings under ss. 222  and 224 , which are contained in s. 224A(1) (a),
are in my opinion well described in the above-quoted language of Lord Diplock
where he refers to an enactment which “expressly provides that if other facts
are proved, a particular fact the existence of which is a necessary factual
ingredient to the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to exist ‘unless the
contrary is proved.’ ”

With all respect, it appears to me that if the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia were correct in holding that it is enough,
to rebut the presumption created by the words “shall be deemed” as they occur
in s. 224A(1) (a), for the accused to raise a reasonable
doubt as to whether or not he entered the motor vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion, then it would, in my view follow, that if the Crown has
established the basis of the presumption beyond a reasonable doubt, it must
also give similar proof of the facts which the statute deems to exist and
expressly requires the accused to negate. This is exactly the burden which the
Crown would have to discharge if the section had not been enacted, and in
my view such a construction makes the statutory presumption ineffective and the
section meaningless.

I have accordingly concluded that
s. 224A(1) (a) imposed a burden of proof on the respondent by
a preponderance of evidence or by a balance of probabilities and that it is not
enough for an accused merely to raise a reasonable doubt.

In the course of the argument before us,
however, counsel for the respondent contended that this construction of the
section ran contrary to the provisions of s. 2(f) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, in that if
s. 224A(1) (a) were so construed or applied it would “deprive
a person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law…”. The relevant por-

[Page 312]

tions of s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of
Rights read as follows:

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgement or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to…

(f) deprive a person charged with a
criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without just cause;…

Although no argument was presented in the court
below in relation to the Bill of Rights, I think it desirable to deal
with the contention made in this Court because the case of Reg. v. Silk[14], was made the
subject of comment in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Tysoe, and
because it appears to represent the final opinion of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia on this question.

Reg. v. Silk was
a case under the Food and Drugs Act , 1952-53 (Can.), c. 38 (as amended)
where the onus placed on the accused by s. 33(2)  (b) was
limited to cases where “the court finds that the accused was in possession of a
controlled drug” and it is then provided that “… he shall be given an
opportunity of establishing… (b) that he was not in possession of the
controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking”. In the course of his reasons
for judgment in this case Mr. Justice Tysoe said:

First of all I wish to say that in my view Regina
v. Silk, supra, is not conclusive of the question now before us. That case
dealt with the meaning to be given to the word ‘establishes’ appearing in an
entirely different section to Code section 224A(1)(a) and used
in a wholly dissimilar context. For the

[Page 313]

same reasons, I do not find Tupper v.
The Queen, supra, helpful. Moreover, in Regina v. Silk some reliance
was placed on the provisions of section 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. In the case before us that section was not referred to in
argument by either counsel, both of whom are experienced members of the Bar.
Accordingly, I give no consideration to the question of applicability of its
provisions.

Mr. Justice Tysoe, however, concluded his
reasons for judgment by saying:

I would repeat what I said in Regina v.
Silk, supra, at the foot of p. 284 and apply it to
section 224A(1)(a):

When interpreting a provision such as
s. 33, the fundamental right of an accused as expressed by Lord Sankey
L.C. in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, (1935)
A.C. 462,… must be kept in mind and an interpretation which destroys that
fundamental right should not be adopted unless the words used permit of no
other interpretation. Any doubt as to the meaning should be resolved in favour
of an accused.

In presenting the argument concerning the Bill
of Rights, the respondent’s counsel in the present case did little more
than adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Tysoe in the Silk case
where he said at page 496:

If parliament has imposed on an accused the
onus of establishing by placing beyond dispute or by a preponderance of
evidence or on a balance of probabilities that he has not had possession for
the purpose of trafficking, it has deprived him of the benefit of a reasonable
doubt as to the purpose of his possession, and it has in effect imposed upon
him the burden of disproving a positive averment of an integral part of the
offence charged against him. It is difficult for me to believe that parliament
intended to do this. Had parliament said that one accused of this particular
offence or, for that matter, any other offence, has the onus of proving he is
not guilty, I venture to think that no one would disagree with the proposition
that it had deprived the accused of the right to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty according to law. It is my view that the same result follows if
parliament imposes on an accused the burden of disproving a positive averment
of an im-

[Page 314]

portant integral part of the offence of
having possession for the purpose of trafficking.

In the same case the same learned judge said, at
page 497:

It is one thing to impose an onus on an
accused to disprove a negative averment and quite another to require him to
disprove a postive averment of an integral part of an offence. Clearly, when
parliament enacted sec. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, it intended to assure that so fundamental and well established a
principle of our law as the presumption of innocence should be preserved. In my
opinion, the section provides protection against the possibility of the
enactment of a statute declaring that a person shall be deemed guilty of a
criminal offence unless he establishes his innocence. I think it also has
reference and application to a statute which purports to require an accused to
disprove by a preponderance of evidence or on a balance of probabilities a
positive averment of an integral part of the offence charged against him, and I
so interpret the section.

On this branch of the case I should say at the
outset that in my respectful opinion this reasoning is based on a
misunderstanding of the law as stated by Lord Sankey in Woolmington v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[15]
and this seems to me to be made apparent in the reasons for judgment of
Nemetz J.A. in the Silk case where he says:

There is no doubt, in my mind, that the Canadian
Bill of Rights in sec. 2(f) gives express statutory
approval to Lord Sankey’s memorable words in Woolmington v. Director of
Public Prosecutions (supra). The golden thread as he described it, which
runs through the web of English Criminal law, was clearly identified by Martin,
J.A., in Rex v. Lee Fong Shee, [1933] 60 C.C.C. 73, and by Davey,
C.J.B.C., in Reg. v. Hartley and McCallum, (1968) 2 C.C.C. 183. In my
respectful view, sec. 2(f) does nothing more than restate
the common law by providing that the primordial burden of proving the guilt of
an accused beyond a reasonable doubt is always on the crown.

[Page 315]

In the case of Hartley and McCallum[16], as in the Silk
case, the Court was considering the statutory onus created by s. 33(2) 
(b) of the Food and Drugs Act , and the passage from Chief Justice
Davey’s judgment to which Mr. Justice Nemetz refers reads as follows:

…if the prisoner by argument or evidence or
cross-examination of the Crown’s witnesses establishes a reasonable doubt as to
whether he had possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking he
must be acquitted of the particular offence… and in the result he ought to be
convicted only of ordinary possession.

If section 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights is to be taken as giving statutory approval to what Lord
Sankey said in Woolmington’s case, it seems to me to be proper to quote
the whole of the sentence to which Mr. Justice Nemetz refers. What Lord
Sankey actually said, after having dealt with the defence of insanity was:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal
Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the
prosecution to prove the prisoner’s guilt subject to what I have already said
as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. (The
italics are my own).

The Silk case and the argument advanced
on behalf of the respondent in this case, appear to me to proceed on the
assumption that Lord Sankey’s famous dictum in some fashion established that
the onus resting on an accused person to rebut a statutory presumption could be
discharged by evidence which did nothing more than raise a reasonable doubt. In
my view, however, when Lord Sankey used the words “subject also to any
statutory exception” in relation to the burden of proof in criminal cases, he
must be taken to have been referring to those statutory exceptions which
reverse the ordinary onus of proof with respect to facts forming one or more
ingredients of a criminal offence. This was the case in Public Prosecutor v.
Yuvaraj, supra, and it is the case here. It seems to me, therefore, that if
Woolmington’s

[Page 316]

case is to be accepted, the words “presumed
innocent until proved guilty according to law…” as they appear in s. 2(f)
of the Bill of Rights, must be taken to envisage a law which
recognizes the existence of statutory exceptions reversing the onus of proof
with respect to one or more ingredients of an offence in cases where certain
specific facts have been proved by the Crown in relation to such ingredients.

In giving effect to the statutory presumption
created by s. 224A(1)(a) in relation to a charge under s. 222 ,
the position is that if it is proved that the accused was impaired by alcohol
or a drug, and it is further proved that he was, at the relevant time, occuping
the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, he shall be deemed to have had the
care or control of the vehicle, but the accused has the opportunity of
rebutting this presumption if he “establishes” by the balance of probabilities
“that he did not enter or mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in
motion”.

If the accused cannot so satisfy the court then
the statutory presumption prevails and he is guilty of an offence under
s. 222 , but, if he is able to provide the requisite evidence he must be
acquitted. There is in my view nothing in this procedure which deprives the
accused of the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law within the meaning of Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
supra, and s. 2(f) of the Bill of Rights.

For all these reasons I am of opinion that the
learned Provincial Judge came to the correct decision on the point of law which
was questioned by the stated case. I would accordingly allow this appeal and restore
the conviction of the respondent.

Hall J. concurred with the judgment delivered by

LASKIN J.—I agree with my brother Ritchie that
the effect of s. 224A(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  is to
oblige the accused, in the stated circumstances, to do more than raise a
reasonable

[Page 317]

doubt. A burden is cast upon him to adduce
negating evidence that would carry proof on a balance of probabilities.

The question that remains is whether this
statutory onus is compatible with s. 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights which, so far as relevant, prescribes that in the absence of
a statute expressly excluding the Canadian Bill of Rights (and there is
none here), “no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a
person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law”. It was not contended that there was any
problem with respect to the “due process of law” provision of s. 1(a)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Certainly, it cannot be said that no
rational connection exists between the fact to be deemed and the fact required
to be proved: see Regina v. Sharpe[17].

I do not construe s. 2(f) as
self-defeating because of the phrase “according to law” which appears therein.
Hence, it would be offensive to s. 2(f) for a federal
criminal enactment to place upon the accused the ultimate burden of
establishing his innocence with respect to any element of the offence charged.
The “right to be presumed innocent”, of which s. 2(f) speaks,
is, in popular terms, a way of expressing the fact that the Crown has the
ultimate burden of establishing guilt; if there is any reasonable doubt at the
conclusion of the case on any element of the offence charged, an accused person
must be acquitted. In a more refined sense, the presumption of innocence gives
an accused the initial benefit of a right of silence and the ultimate benefit
(after the Crown’s evidence is in and as well any evidence tendered on behalf
of the accused) of any reasonable doubt: see Coffin v. U.S.[18]

What I have termed the initial benefit of a
right of silence may be lost when evidence is adduced by the Crown which calls
for a reply. This does not mean that the reply must necessarily be by the
accused himself. However, if he

[Page 318]

alone can make it, he is competent to do so as a
witness in his own behalf; and I see nothing in this that destroys the
presumption of innocence. It would be strange, indeed, if the presumption of
innocence was viewed as entitling an accused to refuse to make any answer to
the evidence against him without accepting the consequences in a possible
finding of guilt against him. The presumption does not preclude either any
statutory or non-statutory burden upon an accused to adduce evidence to
neutralize, or counter on a balance of probabilities, the effect of evidence
presented by the Crown. Hence, I do not regard s. 2(f) as
addressed to a burden of adducing evidence, arising upon proof of certain facts
by the Crown, even though the result of a failure to adduce it would entitle
the trier of fact to find the accused guilty.

In my opinion, the test for the invocation of
s. 2(f) is whether the enactment against which it is
measured calls for a finding of guilt of the accused when, at the conclusion of
the case, and upon the evidence, if any, adduced by Crown and by accused, who
have also satisfied any intermediate burden of adducing evidence, there is
reasonable doubt of culpability. Section 224A(1) (a) is not of
this character.

I may observe that what is true of
s. 224A(1) (a) is also true of the insanity provisions of the
Criminal Code . The presumption of sanity, expressed in s. 16(4) ,
may be overcome by the accused on a balance of probabilities: see The Queen
v. Borg[19].
I note that it has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States that
the due process clause of its Constitution is not offended by a State
requirement that an accused prove the defence of insanity beyond a reasonable
doubt: see Leland v. Oregon[20].
That is not an issue which arises under our formulation of the law.

[Page 319]

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and
restore the conviction.

Appeal allowed and conviction
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Charge of theft—Averment of
essential ingredients—Evidence of failure to account—Charge complies with
Code—Criminal Code , 1953‑54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 269, 276, 280, 492, 497.

The respondent was employed to drive one of
his employer’s taxis upon terms which entitled him to retain 45 per cent of the
daily receipts and required him to account for the balance, less the cost of
gasoline and oil, to his employer. In accounting for a trip in which he picked
up five passengers bound for different addresses, he only recorded one trip for
one passenger. He was charged that he “…did commit theft of the approximate sum
of $16.50 the property of Dominic Louis Christian contrary to the form of the
statute in such case made and provided.” He was convicted of theft by the trial
judge, but acquitted by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. That Court
expressed the view that this form of charge lacked any averment of the
essential ingredients of an offence under s. 276(1)  of the Criminal
Code . The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

The provisions of s. 492(2) (b)
are to be read disjointly and envisage two alternative methods in which an
indictment may be phrased so that a charge may be laid either “in the words of
the enactment that describe the offence” or those of the enactment which
“declares the matters charged to be an indictable offence”. The charge in the
present case complied with the Criminal Code  in that it was in the words
of s. 280  which declares “theft” to be an indictable offence. The
respondent’s failure to account to his employer was “theft” within the meaning
of s. 276(1) . If there had been any doubt as to the conduct to which the
charge related, further particulars describing the means by which the offence
was

[Page 410]

alleged to have been committed could have
been sought under s. 497(1) (f).

The argument that the money misappropriated
belonged to the passengers and not to the taxi owner must be rejected, because
if the respondent overcharged a passenger he did so as the taxi owner’s
employee and as such he was accountable to him for all the moneys he collected
in the course of his employment for the use of the cab.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent for theft. Appeal allowed.

G.L. Murray, Q.C., for the appellant.

M.R.V. Storrow, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought by the
Attorney-General of British Columbia pursuant to the provisions of
s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal1 of that Province, (Davey C.J. dissenting) which set
aside the conviction of the respondent for theft and directed his acquittal.

On the night of March 30-31st, 1970, the
respondent, who is a taxi driver, was employed by Dominic Louis Christian to
drive one of his taxis upon terms which entitled the respondent to retain 45
per cent of the daily receipts and required him to account for the balance and
to pay 55 per cent of the total receipts, less the cost of gasoline, to his
employer. The accounting was carried out by means of what has been referred to
as a “trip sheet” on which is recorded the starting point, destination and fare
charged for each trip, and a record is also made of the amount retained by the
driver, which is referred to as “wages”, the amount paid for gas and oil and
the “net cash” due to the owner.

At about 3:30 on the morning of March 31st, the
respondent had driven Christian’s car to the airport where he picked up five
passengers, two of whom were destined for addresses in the City of

[Page 411]

Vancouver, two for West Vancouver and one for
North Vancouver. The two Vancouver passengers were charged $4.50 and $4.75
respectively, and the West Vancouver passengers were charged $8.55 and $9.50.
The North Vancouver passenger, who was dropped last did not give evidence, but
I think the learned trial judge was justified in expressing the hope “that she
had a good purse full of money with her.”

In accounting for the 3:30 A.M. trip from the
airport, the respondent only recorded one trip for one passenger with a total
cash fare of $6.35. It is quite apparent that, without giving any consideration
to the North Vancouver passenger, the respondent received cash charges of at
least $26.95 for the use of Christian’s car in making this trip and I agree
with the learned Provincial Judge that the evidence supports the conclusion
that the respondent failed to account for or pay approximately $16.00 dollars
and fifty cents to his employer for which he was required to account under the
terms of his employment.

The respondent was charged that he:

At the City of Vancouver, on the 31st day
of March, A.D. 1970, unlawfully did commit theft of the approximate sum of
$16.50 the property of Dominic Louis Christian contrary to the form of the
statute in such case made and provided.

Mr. Justice Tysoe in the course of the
reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court
of Appeal expressed the view that this form of charge lacks any averment of the
essential ingredients of an offence under s. 276(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and he concluded by saying:

My opinion is that it does not charge an
offence under section 276 and a conviction for such an offence cannot rest
upon it. The fact is the appellant was not charged with the offence of which
the evidence shows that he might perhaps have been guilty.

In so holding the majority of the Court of
Appeal gave effect to the contention, made on behalf of the respondent, that in
the case of “theft”, which is described in one way in s. 269 and another
in s. 276, an indictment or information is invalid as failing to comply
with s. 492(3)

[Page 412]

unless it contains an averment of all the
essential ingredients contained in the section of the Code describing the
offence disclosed by the evidence.

In my opinion the evidence in the present case
discloses the commission of an offence under s. 276(1)  which reads as
follows:

276(1). Everyone commits theft who, having
received anything from any person on terms that required him to account for or
pay it or the proceeds of it or a part of the proceeds to that person or
another person, fraudulently fails to account for or pay it or the proceeds of
it or the part of the proceeds of it accordingly.

The effect of the judgment of the Court of
Appeal is that although the information alleges “theft” in the City of
Vancouver at a specified date from a named person, it lacks any averment of
fraudulent failure to account and is therefore invalid by reason of the
following provisions of s. 492(3):

492(3). A count shall contain sufficient
circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable
information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to
identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.

In the course of his dissenting reasons for
judgment, Davey C.J. pointed out that theft is not the only offence which is
capable of being committed in more ways than one under the provisions of the Criminal
Code , and he referred to s. 135  describing four different kinds of
behaviour which may constitute the crime of “rape”. In this latter regard he
cited the as yet unreported case of Regina v. LeBlanc where the
indictment charged that at a certain time and place he, LeBlanc “did rape (a
named woman) contrary to the form of statute in such cases made and provided”
and Mr. Justice Lord, speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia said:

Counsel has referred to section 135 of
the Code which is the section dealing with rape and submits that inasmuch
as the section describes more than one form of sexual intercourse with a
female person

[Page 413]

which would constitute rape, that there
should have been an averment in the charge as to the manner in which the
accused is alleged to have committed the offence. Was it by impersonating her
husband or by fear of bodily harm or in any other of the ways in which rape can
be an offence. As my brother Branca pointed out in the course of the argument,
surely this is a matter for particulars.

In approving this passage as being relevant to
the main question raised in the present case, Davey C.J. stated:

In my respectful opinion that method of
pleading is as applicable to a charge of theft as to a charge of rape, and the
fact that the several ways in which theft may be committed are defined by
separate sections of the Code instead of by several clauses of the same
section, is a mere variation in detail and does not affect the principle.

I agree with this statement of the law and it
follows, as will be seen, that in my view the decision of this Court in The
Queen v. Harder[2],
has a direct bearing on the question of the validity of the present charge.

In order to appreciate the argument now advanced
on behalf of the appellant it is necessary to consider the provisions of
s. 492(1) and (2) which read as follows:

492(1). Each count of an indictment shall
in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if
it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable
offence therein specified.

(2) The statement referred to in
subsection (1) may be:

(a) in popular language
without technical averment or allegation of matters that are not essential to
be proved,

(b) in the words of the
enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be
an indictable offence,…
(the italics are my own).

In brief, the contention advanced on behalf of
the appellant is that the provisions of s. 492(b) are to be read
disjunctively and that they envisage two alternative methods in which an
indictment may be phrased so that a charge may be laid

[Page 414]

either “in the words of the enactment that
describe the offence” or those of the enactment which “declares the matters
charged to be an indictable offence”.

The offence described in s. 276(1)  is
characterized as “theft” by that section itself and the words of the
enactment declaring theft to be an indictable offence are those of s. 280
which reads as follows:

280. Except where otherwise prescribed by
law, everyone who commits theft is guilty of an indictable offence…

In the case of The Queen v. Harder, to
which I have already referred, the accused was charged with having had carnal
knowledge of a woman not his wife “without her consent against the form of the
statute in such case made and provided”. The evidence disclosed that while the
accused had not had carnal knowledge of the woman, he had aided another person
in so doing and was therefore guilty of the offence by virtue of the provisions
of the then s. 69 (now s. 21 (2)) of the Code, and Harder was
convicted at trial. The majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was
however of opinion that as there was no averment of his having aided another in
committing the offence, the indictment must be held to have charged Harder as
having himself physically raped the complainant; and there being no evidence to
support the indictment as so construed, an acquittal should be entered.

The dissent upon which the appeal was taken to
this Court is described in the following terms by Kellock J. at page 499:

That the indictment charging the accused as
a principal was sufficient notwithstanding that it did not aver that the
accused aided and abetted Kie Singh to assault the woman criminally.

This Court allowed the appeal in accordance with
this dissenting view and Mr. Justice Fauteux (as he then was), who spoke also
for Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. (as he then was) had this to say of the
indictment at page 492:

The indictment. An indictment cannot
properly be construed without regard to the substantive and pro-

[Page 415]

cedural provisions of the criminal law related
to its substance and its form. As stated by Willes J., with the concurrence of
all the Judges who advised the House of Lords, and with the approval of the
latter, in the case of Mulcahey v. The Queen (1868) L.R. 3
H.L. 306 at 321:

…an indictment only states the legal
character of the offence and does not profess to furnish the details and
particulars. These are supplied by the depositions, and the practice of
informing the prisoner or his counsel of any additional evidence not in the
depositions, which it may be intended to produce at the trial. To make the
indictment more particular would only encourage formal objections upon the
ground of variance, which have of late been justly discouraged by the
Legislature

I am of opinion that the charge in the present
case complies with the Criminal Code  in that it is in the words of
s. 280  which declares “theft” to be an indictable offence and the
respondent’s failure to account to his employer was, in my opinion, “theft”
within the meaning of s. 276(1) . It follows that I agree with the
dissenting view expressed by Davey C.J. that this “was a good charge of theft
under that section”.

If there had been any genuine doubt as to the
conduct to which the charge related, further particulars describing the means
by which the offence was alleged to have been committed could have been sought
under s. 497(1) (f) of the Code, but this was not the course which
was followed.

What happened was that on arraignment the
respondent, who was unrepresented by counsel, pleaded not guilty and conducted
his own defence for the first day of the trial when three of the passengers
were called by the Crown. The case was then adjourned for more than a month and
at the adjourned hearing Mr. Storrow appeared as counsel for the
respondent and at once asked “to be informed of the section under which
this charge is laid?” Upon Mr. Bendrodt, the Crown counsel replying that
he was proceeding on the

[Page 416]

charge of theft as contained in the information,
the following exchange took place:

Mr. STORROW: All I want to know is
what section we are dealing with. It is a common law offence. I presume my
friend had laid it under the Criminal Code  and I merely want to know what
section.

Mr. BENDRODT: All my friend has to do
is to look on the information that is before him. Is my learned friend saying
the information is no good? Is he saying that the information has not got the
particularity required by law? Is he moving beyond it? What is he doing? Is my
learned friend saying he hasn’t had enough particulars? He has a transcript
that has been provided and as I recall it I have given him not only particulars
of that evidence that has not yet been called, but in fact I have given him as
best I have been able the evidence which I expect to produce let alone particulars.

Mr. STORROW: Everything that my friend
says is correct, but my question is rather simple and all I want to know is the
section number unless it is a common law offence.

The information which he sought was not
forthcoming from the Crown and the learned Provincial Judge declined to order
it but there can, in my view, be no doubt that the respondent and his counsel
were fully aware of the circumstances which gave rise to the charge and Mr.
Storrow must have appreciated that the question at issue was whether or not
those circumstances constituted theft under the Criminal Code .

In allowing this appeal in the Court of Appeal,
Mr. Justice Tysoe relied on a line of cases such as Regina v. LeClair[3], The King v. Connors[4], The King v. Fraser[5] and Regina v. Trapoortan[6]. In each of
these cases the charge was framed “in the words of the enactment that describes
the

[Page 417]

offence” and failure to allege some essential
ingredient of the offence so charged was found to be fatal. As I have
indicated, different considerations apply to a case such as the present one
where the charge is framed in the words declaring the matter charged to be an
indictable offence. I accordingly share the opinion of Davey C.J. that the
cases last referred to are clearly distinguishable and have no application to
the question here raised.

I should observe also that there is a
fundamental difference between the present case and that of Brodie and
Barnett v. The King[7],
upon which much reliance was placed by the respondent’s counsel. That was a
case in which the charge alleged that the two accused “were party to a
seditious conspiracy in conspiring” with certain named persons
and with persons unknown, but there was no allegation of what the conspirators
had conspired to do. At page 199, Mr. Justice Rinfret (as he then was),
speaking on behalf of the Court said:

…although conspiracy to commit a crime,
being in itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone in an indictment
and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it does not follow
that the count charging conspiracy alone, without the setting out of any overt
act, must not describe it in such a way as to contain in substance the
fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is charged, or, in
other words, in such a way as to specify, in substance, the specific
transaction intended to be brought against the accused.

This was the ground on which the charge was
found to be insufficient and it cannot, in my view, be seriously contended in
the present case that the charge did not specify the specific transaction
intended to be brought against McKenzie or that he could have been in any doubt
as to what the complaint was.

In the course of his dissenting reasons for
judgment, Davey C.J. referred to the argument which had been advanced by the
present respon-

[Page 418]

dent that the proof of an offence under
s. 276(1)  was deficient because it showed that the money misappropriated
belonged to the passengers and not to the taxi owner from whom it was alleged
to have been stolen.

This argument is based on the existence of a
City of Vancouver “Vehicles-for-Hire” by-law which provides that:

No driver of a taxi-cab shall convey any
person or persons other than the person or persons first engaging the taxi-cab.
The carrying of passengers for separate fares is prohibited.

The respondent’s submission in this regard is
that any contract which required the taxi driver to account to his employer for
monies obtained by carrying passengers for separate fares is illegal and void
as being in contravention of the by-law and that the monies so collected were
therefore not monies for which McKenzie was required to account to Christian.

As to this contention, I agree with Chief
Justice Davey when he says:

If McKenzie overcharged a passenger he did so
as Christian’s employee, and as such he was accountable to Christian for all
monies he collected in the course of his employment for the use of the cab.
Christian, as McKenzie’s employer, would be obliged to refund to the passengers
through the Yellow Cab all overcharges collected by McKenzie. So in law… the
overcharges were money for which McKenzie was required to account to him. The
proof of the offence charged was complete.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal
and restore the conviction entered by the learned Provincial Judge.

Appeal allowed and conviction
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft of a telecommunication
service—Definition of “telecommunication”—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 287.

During a labour dispute, appellants took over
a radio station to air their grievances. They were charged with mischief and
with theft of a telecommunication service. At trial, they were convicted of
mischief but acquitted of the theft charges. The Court of Appeal unanimously
upheld the guilty verdicts on the mischief charges and, by majority decision,
entered convictions on the charges of theft of a telecommunication service. The
appeals to the Supreme Court concerned the definition of the word
“telecommunication”.

Broadcasts by the radio station were carried
by wire from the station to a transmitting tower and thence by Hertzian waves
to the receiving sets of listeners. The majority on the Court of Appeal held
that transmission partly by wire or cable was enough to make s. 287  of the
Criminal Code  applicable.

Held: The
appeals should be allowed.

Section 287  of the Criminal Code  (as
it was worded at the time of the alleged offences) extends only to transmission
by wire or cable (such as telephone, telegraph or cablevision transmissions),
but not to transmission by Hertzian waves, as in radio. The accused are
consequently acquitted of the charge of theft of a telecommunication service.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Quebec[1] in which the
accused were convicted of theft of a telecommunication service. Appeals
allowed: acquittal.

[Page 442]

Guy Bertrand, for appellants.

Rémi Bouchard, for respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The accused were charged with
fraudulently, maliciously or without colour of right illegally obtaining a
telecommunication service on May 15, 1972, committing thereby a theft of the
value of $400, contrary to s. 287  of the Criminal Code . The narrow
legal question before the courts of Quebec and before this Court is whether the accused could be said to have
obtained a “telecommunication service”, as defined in s. 287(1) (b)
at the material time. Section 287(1) (b) then read:

(1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

(b) uses any
telecommunication wire or cable or obtains any telecommunication service.

The word “telecommunication” was then defined in
s. 287(2) in these words:

(2) In this section, “telecommunication”
means any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing,
images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire or cable.

The point taken on behalf of the accused, which
found favour in the court of first instance and in the dissenting judgment in
the Court of Appeal, is that transmission of signals by a radio station is not
transmission “by wire or cable.”

The facts are bizarre. In May, 1972, during the
strike of the Common Front, the accused, all of whom are teachers, were minded
to take over a radio station and, literally, to air their grievances. To that
end they, and others like-minded, assembled outside radio station C.F.L.S. at
Lévis at four o’clock one
afternoon. At that hour the station was closed to the public. At about
five o’clock a door at the rear of the premises was opened to admit two station
employees; seven or eight persons took advantage of this opportunity to enter;
about thirty other persons followed shortly thereafter. Some of the entrants
surrounded the manager of the station. They told him they wanted to take over
the air waves. They then spread throughout the building to the reception area,
to the studio, to the news

[Page 443]

room and to the discothèque. At the time of
entry the station was functioning in a regular manner. An announcer was on duty
at the microphone in the studio. The intruders, however, relieved him of the
microphone. One of their number seated himself at the microphone and regaled
the listening audience with propaganda in support of the strike and with
criticism of sundry politicians. The proceedings were enlivened by musical
selections. At the end of two hours the arrival of police brought an end to the
extempore programme and put to flight most of the mischief-makers. A number
were apprehended, including the appellants.

Radio station C.F.L.S. is a commercial
enterprise, operating under licence from the Canadian Radio-Television and
Telecommunications Commission. Broadcasts are carried by wire from the station
to a transmitting tower, a mile distant, and thence by Hertzian waves to the
radio receiving sets of listeners in homes, automobiles and elsewhere. None of
these receiving sets is connected by wire or cable to the radio station.

The accused were charged not only with theft but
also with creating a mischief. At trial the theft charges were dismissed and a
guilty verdict entered on the mischief counts. On appeal the latter verdicts
were upheld but a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Casey and Mayrand
JJ.A., Bernier J.A. dissenting) reversed the “not guilty” verdicts on the theft
counts and entered convictions. Mayrand J.A. held that a wire or cable between
the station and the transmitting tower was sufficient to support conviction. He said: “A mon avis, il y a eu émission et transmission de sons par
fil sur une certaine distance et cela suffit.” With
respect, I have come to a different conclusion.

The word “telecommunication” can be widely
defined. In Robert, Dictionnaire de la langue
française, 1964, T.VI, at p. 675, it is defined as “l’ensemble des
procédés de transmission d’informations à distance”. The
word “tele” in Greek means “far”. Telecommunications systems, in a

[Page 444]

general sense, are devices and techniques
employed for the transmission of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds or
data of any nature by wire, radio or other electromagnetic equipment.
Parliament in s. 287(2)  of the Criminal Code  has defined the word
“telecommunication” more narrowly.

The forerunner to s. 287(1)(b) was
s. 273(b) of the 1959 Criminal Code  which read:

Every one commits theft who fraudulently or
maliciously

(b) uses a telephone or telegraph
line or obtains telephone or telegraph service.

The obvious intent of that section was to
stigmatize as criminal any act whereby a person through tapping a line or like
means was enabled to obtain telephone or telegraphic service without payment.
The growth of community television services using coaxial cable would appear to
have occasioned a 1960-61 amendment of the Criminal Code  (1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 6) which adopted
the present wording quoted earlier in these reasons. The effect of the amendment
was to extend the section not only to telephone and telegraph service but
to any telecommunication service transmitting or emitting by wire or cable. The
effect was also to exclude any transmission by air waves. “Telecommunication
service” as defined, in my opinion, extends to telephone, telegraph or
cablevision transmission, but not to radio transmission.

Radio is the radiation and detection of signals
propagated through space as electromagnetic waves. The definition
contained in s. 287  implicitly makes a distinction between two means of
transmission (i) wire or cable and (ii) Hertzian waves. The same distinction
appears in the definition of “telecommunication” found in the Canadian
Overseas Telecommunication Corporation Act, R.S.C. 1970,c.C-11,s. 2:

…“telecommunication” means any
transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images or
sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other
electromagnetic system.

[Page 445]

and in almost the same language in the Radio
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R-1, s. 2. It might be observed in passing
that ss. 287(1) (b) and 287(2)  of the Criminal Code  were
further modified and enlarged in 1975 to read as follows:

(1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

(b) uses any
telecommunication facility or obtains any telecommunication service.

(2) In this section and in
section 287.1, “telecommunication” means any transmission, emission or
reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds or intelligence of any
nature by radio, visual, electronic or other electromagnetic system.

It is helpful also, I think, to refer to the Broadcasting
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-11 in conformity with which radio station
C.F.L.S. operates. In that Act at s. 2 “radiocommunication” is defined as:

…“radiocommunication” means any
transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds
or intelligence of any nature by means of electromagnetic waves of frequencies
lower than 3,000 Gigacycles per second propagated in space without artificial
guide;

In defining “telecommunication” for the purposes
of s. 287  of the Criminal Code  in a manner limiting transmission to
wire and cable, Parliament, I think, must be taken to have excluded
transmission by electromagnetic waves through space without artificial guide,
that is to say, to have excluded radio transmission.

Contrary to the majority view in the Quebec
Court of Appeal, s. 287 of the Code in my opinion does not sustain
a distinction between transmissions which are partly by wire or cable and those
which are entirely by wire or cable, a subtlety too recondite for recognition
by the criminal law. The section is concerned with a more fundamental
distinction between transmission or emission of signals utilizing wire and cable
and transmission or emission of signals by means other than wire or cable, that
is to say, by the Hertzian waves of radio. The transmission service of radio
station

[Page 446]

C.F.L.S., being by Hertzian waves, was not a
telecommunication service as defined in s. 287(2)  of the Criminal Code .

I would allow the appeals, set aside the
convictions on the theft charges and direct verdicts of acquittal on those
charges.

Appeals allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft—Embezzlement—Funds held
pursuant to a direction—Securities business—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 292.

Respondent, a securities broker and president
and general manager of, inter alia, the L… firm, was convicted at trial
and subsequently acquitted in the Court of Appeal on a charge of theft by
embezzlement of funds held pursuant to a direction.

The facts that led to this charge are as
follows: the accused concluded a contract to purchase an issue of bonds from
the A… Seminary and a contract of sale of some of these bonds to the B…
Sisters. A written agreement between the Sisters and the L. firm was reached,
according to which the firm undertook to deliver the said securities on the day
on which they were issued. The accused immediately cashed the cheques received
from the Sisters for this purpose, and used the funds in a manner that made it
impossible for the L. firm to fulfill its obligations and deliver the
securities, pledged to the bank. The civil debt was extinguished by means of a
settlement between the Sisters and the L… firm, resulting in cancellation of
the contract.

The trial judge held that the accused was the
Sisters’ mandatary and that, as such, the money received from them could only
be applied to the purchase of bonds from the Seminary. The accused was
therefore convicted.

The Court of Appeal unanimously acquitted the
accused. It held that the contract between the L… firm and the Sisters was a
simple sale, not a mandate. Once the money had been received for the purchase
of securities to be delivered at a later date, and not for the purchase of
securities to be acquired as mandatary of the Sisters, the L… firm became
merely a debtor and s. 292  of the Criminal Code  did not apply.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Martland and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

[Page 276]

Per Judson,
Ritchie, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: There is no need to analyse the operation from
the point of view of civil law in order to decide the criminal law in question.
The extinguishing of the civil debt and the nature of the contract are not
important. Section 292  of the Criminal Code  is aimed at the substance of
the operation rather than at the legal form that it may have been given. The
expression “direction” is used—an expression that is not specifically related
to any particular kind of contract. All that may serve to specify the nature of
the legal relations contemplated by the provision is in subs. 2, which excludes
cases involving only a current account, if there was no direction in writing.
This is irreconcilable with the nature of the operation in question and with
the written agreement stipulating that these were funds advanced, not to be
applied to the credit of the Sisters’ account, but to be used for a particular
purpose.

It cannot nowadays be maintained that the
obligation to keep a sum of money received for a particular purpose means that
the actual specie received must be kept. Not only is money a fungible thing
(except in numismatics), but the ordinary way of keeping it is to deposit it in
a bank or similar institution, such deposit really being a loan. There is no
need to consider whether by thus keeping the funds received in order to be able
to apply them to the payment of the bonds on the day of issue the L… firm would
be able to earn an amount of interest equivalent to that it was allowing to the
Sisters, any more than there is any need to consider whether the difference
between the price paid to the Seminary and the one agreed upon with the Sisters
represented a reasonable commission. Profit or loss on the market has nothing
to do with the nature of the L… firm’s obligations.

The Court of Appeal erred in failing to see
that the payment to the L… firm was not a payment of an advance or a sum to be
credited to the account of the Sisters, but rather an amount that was to be
used for a particular purpose, namely to pay for the bonds of the Seminary on
the day they were issued, if they were in fact issued, which implied that if
they were not issued the sum was to be returned immediately. Although the trial
judge was in error in saying that the relationship was one of mandate, he did
not err in considering that the receipt of the funds in the circumstances in
which it took place implied, by the very terms of the written confirmation, a
direction to apply the sum to a particular purpose. There is no need to
determine how the receipt of the purchase price of a thing to be delivered at a
later date should be viewed in the case of dealings

[Page 277]

other than in securities. Since our criminal
law is codified, it is the letter of the Code that must be applied.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland and Spence JJ., dissenting: The Court of Appeal
was correct in holding that the case involved the sale of securities rather
than a mandate. The circumstances of the transaction and the subsequent
settlement leave at least a reasonable doubt on the issue of fraudulent intent.
Essentially factual questions are involved in this appeal.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is a
Crown appeal from an acquittal of the accused, by a unanimous judgment of the
Quebec Court of Appeal, of an offence under s. 292  of the Criminal
Code , of which he had been convicted by Sessions Court Judge Potvin. Leave
to appeal, limited of course to questions of law, was given by this Court in
general terms. Two issues lie at the base of this case. First, in the words of
s. 292 , did the accused receive money from La Communauté des Sœurs de
Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil de Chicoutimi to be applied to a particular purpose and, second, if so, was it
fraudulently applied to another purpose?

[Page 278]

I am satisfied that the Quebec Court of Appeal
correctly assessed the transaction between the Company, of which the accused
was president, and La Communauté as one of sale of securities by the Company on
its own account to La Communauté, and that neither the Company nor the accused
was an agent of La Communauté, receiving money in that character. There was an
outright sale and purchase and nothing more. Again, the circumstances of the purchase
and the subsequent agreement of the Company, through the accused, to cancel the
sale as requested by La Communauté raise at least a reasonable doubt on the
issue of fraudulent intent. It cannot be that, upon the rescission of a
contract of sale by mutual consent, the failure of the vendor to return
immediately the purchase money received from the purchaser (it was in this case
repaid by a promissory note which was honoured by the company of which the
accused was president) results in an attribution of prior fraudulent intent in
the consummation of the contract of sale. Indeed, essentially factual questions
are involved in this appeal and I am not persuaded that any question of law is
raised by the Crown in respect of the crucial issue of fraudulent intent.

For the reasons given by the three judges of the
Quebec Court of Appeal I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal.

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and
Beetz JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This is an appeal by the Crown,
brought by leave of this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec setting aside the conviction of
appellant by Cyrille Potvin J. sitting without a jury, the accused having
elected to be so tried.

The essential facts of the case are as follows.
The accused is a broker and is president and general manager of Jacques Légaré
& Cie Limitée, the Société de Prêts et Placements de Québec and over twenty
other financial concerns.

On July 1, 1966, in his capacity as manager of a
syndicate of securities dealers, or brokers, he concluded a contract to
purchase an issue of bonds

[Page 279]

from the St-Augustin Seminary in the amount of
$2,600,000. These bonds were to bear interest at six per cent from July 1 and
were purchased for 93.50 per cent of their face value plus accrued interest to
the date of delivery.

Some of these bonds were immediately offered by
the accused to the Sœurs de Notre‑Dame‑du-Bon-Conseil de
Chicoutimi, whom he had previously contacted in this connection. On July 25 a
written confirmation of the sale to the Sisters of $250,000 St‑Augustin
Seminary bonds at $97 plus accrued interest, was sent to the Sisters. On July
28 the latter delivered to a representative of the firm three cheques payable
to the order of Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée, and the following day, July
29, 1966, a second confirmation was sent in the following terms:

[TRANSLATION] We have the honour to confirm
our SALE to you of the
following securities:

$250,000 ST-AUGUSTIN SEMINARY


 
  
  6% Bonds
  Maturity: July 1, 1976
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  Price: 97.00
  
  
  $242,500.00
  
 
 
  
  Interest from
  July 1 to
  July 28 (28 days)
  
  
  1,150.00
  
 
 
  
  250 x 1,000.-
  
  
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
  Total
  
  
  $243,650.00
  
 


Delivery—Subject to the usual conditions
for a new issue, on or about August 8 next.

The cheques were cashed immediately; the issue
of the bonds, which was to take place on or about August 8, was effected on
August 15, but on that day the bonds in the amount of $250,000 destined for the
Sisters remained at the bank because Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée did not
have the necessary funds to redeem them. On or about August 24, the accused
offered to deliver bonds in the amount of $100,000 immediately, and the balance
on or about September 3. The Sisters refused this offer, cancelled the purchase
of the bonds and received from Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée a promissory
note in the amount of $243,650 dated July 28, 1966 payable in a year with
interest at seven per cent. As to this point, Mayrand J.A. observed:

[Page 280]

[TRANSLATION] The fact that the contract
between the Sisters and the company was thus cancelled by consent of the
parties, that a settlement was reached following the charge laid against
Jacques Légaré, and that the debt contracted by promissory note to the Sisters
has been extinguished, as was pointed out at the hearing, in no way alters the
problem submitted to this Court. The issue is whether Jacques Légaré had
previously committed the theft of which he is accused.

It should be added that the charge laid by the
Crown is based on what was then s. 278  of the Criminal Code , now
s. 292 . It is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] JACQUES LÉGARÉ is charged
with having, during the period between May 1, 1966 and December 1, 1966, at
Quebec City, district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec, while
he was president of Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée, after receiving from the
Congrégation des Sœurs de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil de Chicoutimi a sum of
$243,650.00, with instructions to apply this sum to the purchase of bonds from
the St-Augustin Seminary in the amount of $250,000.00, unlawfully, fraudulently
and in contravention of the instructions received, applied this money to other
purposes, thereby committing the theft of a sum of $243,650.00, the property of
the Congrégation des Sœurs de Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil de Chicoutimi, the
whole contrary to ss. 278 , 269 , 280  and 21  of the Criminal Code .

The former s. 278 , now s. 292 , reads
as follows:

292. (1)
Every one commits theft who having received, either solely or jointly with
another person, money or valuable security or a power of attorney for the sale
of real or personal property, with a direction that the money or a part of it,
or the proceeds or a part of the proceeds of the security or the property shall
be applied to a purpose or paid to a person specified in the direction,
fraudulently and contrary to the direction applies to any other purpose or pays
to any other person the money or proceeds or any part of it.

(2) This section does not apply where
a person who receives anything mentioned in subsection (1) and the person
from whom he receives it deal with each other on such terms that all money paid
to the former would, in the absence of any such direction, be properly treated
as an item in a debtor and creditor account between them, unless the direction
is in writing.

[Page 281]

After a very lengthy trial at which the movement
of the funds in the numerous companies controlled by the accused was analysed,
the trial judge said:

[TRANSLATION]… Jacques Légaré & Cie
Limitée received from the Sisters a sum of $243,650.00, which was to be applied
specifically to the purchase of bonds from the St‑Augustin Seminary
through the accused, who was first and foremost the Sisters’ mandatary.

This sum of $243,650.00 was converted from
its intended purpose, since it was used, with the accused’s approval, to pay
other liabilities of the company, including a sum of $98,000.00 applied to
another bank account. Furthermore, the bonds that were to be delivered on August 15, 1966 at the latest were not in fact
delivered until the day of the cancellation of the sale, at the end of August,
and of the agreement to treat the $243,650.00 as a loan to Jacques Légaré &
Cie Limitée,…

The Court of Appeal correctly pointed out that
the Sisters had not dealt with Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée as a mandatary,
but as a vendor. There is no doubt that it was on its own account that the
syndicate had bought the issue, and that it was on its own account that the
Légaré firm had sold a portion to the Sisters. This does not dispose of the
matter, however, since neither the indictment nor the section of the Criminal
Code  on which it is based presupposes the existence of a mandate.

In my opinion there is no need in the case at
bar to analyse the operation from the point of view of civil law in order to
decide the criminal law question. Moreover, the situation at civil law is not in
doubt. It is clear that Jacques Légaré & Cie Limitée failed to fulfil its
obligation. Having received the full price with accrued interest for $250,000
in bonds of the St-Augustin Seminary subject to the usual conditions for a new
issue, the company’s obligation was to deliver these securities on the day on
which they were actually issued, namely August 15. Since this was a commercial
transaction, the company was put in default by the very fact of not having
delivered on that day (art. 1069 C.C.). Having received payment
in advance, it seriously contravened its obligation toward the Sisters by
pledging the securities to the bank, so

[Page 282]

that it could pay the St-Augustin Seminary for
them, whereas its obligation was to deliver them completely unencumbered.

This situation was entirely due to the fault of
the accused who had used the funds received from the Sisters for the purposes
of his commerical companies, instead of keeping those funds available for the
purpose for which he had received them. It was not as a result of unforeseen
events occurring without its fault that the accused’s firm found itself unable
to meet its obligations toward the Sisters on the day the bonds were issued. It
has been clearly established that this failure was due to the fact that, under
the direction of the accused, the funds received from the Sisters were used in
a manner that made it impossible for the firm to fulfil its obligations.

From the civil point of view there was thus a
conscious failure to meet an obligation. As we have seen, this was subsequently
settled, but this settlement leaves unsolved the question whether or not there
was a criminal act. The contention of the accused, which was accepted by the
Court of Appeal, is essentially that once the money had been received for the
purchase of securities to be delivered at a later date, and not for the
purchase of securities to be acquired as mandatory of the Sisters, the Légaré
firm became merely a debtor and s. 292  of the Criminal Code  did not
apply.

It is important to note that s. 292 does
not tie the definition of the offence to the kind of contract concluded between
the accused and the person from whom he has received money or valuable
securities. It is further on, under the heading “Offences Resembling Theft”,
that one finds in s. 296 (formerly 282) a provision concerning a
person who, “being a trustee of anything… converts, with intent to defraud and
in violation of his trust, that thing or any part of it to a use that is not
authorized by the trust”. “Trustee” is defined in s. 2, by reference inter
alia to the law of the province. In section 292, as in s. 290,
however, there is nothing specifying the nature of the agreement under which
the money may have been received. The section speaks of a “direction”, an
expression that is not specifically related to any particular kind of contract.
The only words that

[Page 283]

may serve to specify the nature of the legal
relations contemplated are in subs. 2, which excludes cases involving only a
current account, if there was no direction in writing. Here the direction was
shown by the confirmation, which was issued at the very moment the cheques were
received.

The accused is maintaining in essence that
although the funds had been given to pay the price of the bonds in question on
the day of their eventual issue, the Légaré firm was merely indebted for them
and could use them in its discretion. He points out in this connection that
interest had ceased to accrue on July 28, whereas the Légaré firm was obliged
to pay interest to the Seminary until the day of delivery, which was scheduled
for August 8, but in fact took place on August 15. This implies, it is said,
that the firm could use the funds in the interval.

In my opinion this objection is no more valid
than the one based on the fact that the Légaré firm was obliged to deliver the
bonds at a fixed price, and not on a commission basis. The days are long time
past when it was held that a person to whom money was entrusted for a
particular purpose was guilty of conversion only if he was required to return
or use the actual specie he had received. This ancient rule was set aside by
s. 355 of the old Criminal Code  (corresponding to s. 290 of
the present Code), the first paragraph of which read as follows:

355. Every
one commits theft who, having received money or valuable security or other
thing whatsoever, on terms requiring him to account for or pay the same, or the
proceeds thereof, or any part of such proceeds, to any other person, though
not requiring him to deliver over in specie the identical money, valuable
security or other thing received, fraudulently omits to account for or pay the
same or any part thereof, or to account for or pay such proceeds or any part
thereof, which he was required to account for or pay as aforesaid.

(Emphasis added.)

In my opinion it cannot nowadays be maintained
that the obligation to keep a sum of money

[Page 284]

received for a particular purpose until the time
it is to be used for that purpose means that the actual specie received must be
kept. Not only is money a fungible thing (except in numismatics), but the
ordinary way of keeping it is to deposit it in a bank or similar institution,
such deposit really being a loan. There is no need to consider whether by thus
keeping the funds received in order to be able to apply them to the payment of
the bonds on the day of issue the Légaré firm would be able to earn an amount
of interest equivalent to that it was allowing to the Sisters, any more than
there is any need to consider whether the difference between the price paid to
St-Augustin Seminary and the one agreed upon with the Sisters represented a
reasonable commission. Profit or loss on the market has nothing to do with the
nature of the Légaré firm’s obligations.

One of the most interesting of the few cases on
this point is the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v.
Manley[2]. A
broker had been charged with theft without the indictment specifying how the
theft was committed. In effect he was charged with having, without authority,
pledged the securities of a client. Sloan J.A. stated the question as follows
(at pp. 491-492):

The appellant admitted at the trial that he
had, without authority, hypothecated Dawson’s shares. He set up, as a defence,
that Dawson’s account with him was a cash account in which from time to time
there would be debit and credit balance and that when he received the Dawson
shares from the vendor broker on the Stock Exchange these shares were credited
in his books as items in the debtor and creditor account between himself and
Dawson; that Dawson relied upon his personal liability in respect thereto and
in consequence, because of the provisions of s-ss. (2) and (3) of s. 355 
of the Criminal Code , there had been no fraudulent conversion of the
shares. The learned trial Judge refused to charge the jury on s. 355 
holding that it had no application. It is not for us to say whether or not such
a defence has any merit. That is a question of fact for the jury. The question
for determination by us, as I see it, is whether or not s. 355  can have
application to the facts of this case.

[Page 285]

After a review of the authorities, he concluded
(at p. 495):

In my opinion it is clear from the
foregoing authorities that the absence of any direction to the appellant from
the person from whom he received the shares of Dawson is immaterial. His
obligation to account to Dawson arose from his relationship to him, i.e.,
as brokers to customer. I would say therefore that he falls within s. 355 .

In my opinion there are only inconsequential
differences between the former s. 355  (now s. 290) and s. 292,
on which the charge in the case at bar is based. In effect the offence charged
is essentially the same. The Légaré firm obtained from the St-Augustin Seminary
the bonds it had undertaken to deliver to the Sisters. If it did not deliver
them to the latter, this was because instead of paying for them with the funds
received from the Sisters for this purpose, it paid with money obtained from
the bank to which the securities were pledged.

Mayrand J.A. cited the decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Tepoorten[3]. The principle of the earlier decision in Manley
was not questioned. All that was decided is stated in the following
sentence (at p. 303):

Here, there is no evidence of any terms on
which Tepoorten received Meester’s cheque, and no evidence of any relationship
between Tepoorten and Meester that would impose any duty on Tepoorten to
account to Meester for the money.

After citing this decision, Mayrand J.A. said:

[TRANSLATION] The Sisters did not give the
company “a direction that the money or a part of it… shall be applied to a
purpose or paid to a person specified in the direction”, in accordance with the
terms of s. 278  (now 292) of the Criminal Code . The sum of $243,650
was given and received in payment for the bonds purchased from the company. The
purchaser did not restrict the freedom the vendor had to dispose of the sum
collected as it wished.

In my opinion the error in this reasoning
consists in failing to see that the payment to the Légaré firm was not a
payment of an advance or a

[Page 286]

sum to be credited to the account to the Sisters
generally, but rather an amount that was to be used for a particular purpose,
namely to pay for $250,000 in bonds of the St-Augustin Seminary on the day they
were issued, if they were in fact issued, which implied that if they were not
issued the sum was to be returned immediately. Although the trial judge was in
error in saying that the relationship was one of mandate, he did not err in
considering that the receipt of the funds in the circumstances in which it took
place implied, by the very terms of the confirmation, a direction to apply the
sum to a particular purpose. It appears quite clear to me that the Sisters did
not intend to allow the Légaré firm to invest the funds in other enterprises so
as to be unable to use them to pay for the bonds from the St-Augustin Seminary
when they were issued.

There is no need to determine how the receipt of
the purchase price of a thing to be delivered at a later date should be viewed
in the case of dealings other than in securities. This is why I shall make no
comment on R. v. Brown[4], cited
by Mayrand J.A., a case involving a travel agent who was said not to be a
mandatary.

Subsection 2 of s. 292, like subs. 2
of s. 290, provides a helpful indication and serves to interpret the main
provision, of which it is the corollary. Can the money received be looked upon
merely as a current account item? In this case, this appears to me to be
completely irreconcilable with the nature of the operation and with the
agreement stipulating that these were funds advanced not to be applied to the
credit of the Sisters’ account, but to be used for a particular purpose.

If this section of the Criminal Code  had
been intended to apply only to the case of funds entrusted to a mandatary, it
would have said so. The use of words that do not refer to any particular civil
contract shows that the substance of the operation, not its particular legal
form, was aimed at. This is made even more evident by comparison with related
sections where expressions specifying

[Page 287]

a particular kind of contract are used. I have
already mentioned the word “trustee” in s. 296. It seems proper to note
that mandataries are contemplated in s. 286, where the words “factor or
agent” are used as follows:

286. A
factor or agent does not commit theft by pledging or giving a lien on goods or
documents of title to goods that are entrusted to him for the purpose of sale
or for any other purpose, if the pledge or lien is for an amount that does not
exceed the sum of

(a) the amount due to him from his
principal at the time the goods or documents are pledged or the lien is given,
and

(b) the amount of any bill of
exchange that he has accepted for or on account of his principal.

As for R. v. Wolfe[5]. I fail to see how it can be relied
on in defence of this accused. It was a case where the accused obviously was
under an obligation to render an account. He had been instructed to sell a car
and had collected the purchase money, but he had not given it to his client
because he had deposited it in an overdrawn bank account. He was acquitted on
the ground that this was negligence, not dishonesty. It seems to me that scant
consideration was given to the duty of the person who receives money for the
account of a third party: s. 285 exonerates the bailee only if his failure
to produce and deliver the thing “is not the result of a wilful act or omission
by him”; why should it be otherwise when it is a question of returning the
purchase money rather than the thing itself? Anyway, there is nothing of the
kind in the case at bar. The accused is an experienced businessman, and it was
with full knowledge of the situation that he disposed of the funds as he did.

At the end of his reasons, Gagnon J.A. cited
three decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The most recent of these
appears to me to be the only one requiring consideration: It is R. v. Hughes[6] fully summarized as follows:

[Page 288]

The facts proved at the trial were that H.
was a builder who was asked by one C. to put in a shop front and to do some
repairs to a small property. H. asked C. to advance him £50 to buy materials,
and C. did advance that sum together with a further £100 for the same purpose.
H. did not use the money for the purpose of buying materials but he paid off
his own debts and spent some of the money on repairs to his motor-car. H.
appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his conviction on the ground
that the jury were misdirected, and against his sentence.

Held, dismissing
the appeal, that this court could find no fault in the summing-up. It was
clearly laid down in R. v. Bryce (1956) Crim. L.R. 122 that the three
necessary ingredients in the offence of fraudulent conversion were (i) that the
money was entrusted to the accused for a particular purpose; (ii) that the
accused used the money for some other purpose; and (iii) that the accused was
acting fraudulently. In the present case the money was paid over for a
particular purpose and not generally on account, and the summing-up put the
three ingredients of the offence with great clarity.

Applying these principles to the case at bar, I
cannot see how the conclusion can be anything but that the accused is guilty. I
wish to point out, however, that although I do not see any major difference in
this respect between the Larceny Act and our present Criminal Code , it
should not be forgotten that our criminal law is codified. The provisions of
the Code must be applied as they are, irrespective of former niceties
that have been set aside for good: The Queen v. Hemingway[7], The Queen v. Maroney[8].

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal, restore the conviction and remit the case to the Quebec
Court of Appeal for fixing the sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law —Evidence —Accomplice —Corroboration—Accomplice
and accessory after the fact.

On a charge of attempted murder appellant was
acquitted by a jury verdict. On appeal by the Crown, a majority decision of the
Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the grounds that although the trial
judge had properly left it to the jury to decide whether a witness should be
considered an accomplice, he had erred in law in his instructions to the jury by
not distinguishing between an accomplice and an accessory after the fact with
respect to the danger of convicting without corroboration, leading the jury to
believe that the testimony of an accessory after the fact also required
corroboration.

Held: The appeal
should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Ritchie and Beetz JJ.: They disagree with the view expressed
by the Court of Appeal on the issue, and hold that the same rule of caution
that must be applied to the testimony of an accomplice must also be applied to
the testimony of an accessory after the fact. The verdict of acquittal should
therefore be reinstated.

Per Pigeon,
Spence and de Grandpré JJ.: The rule of caution should not be applied in the
case of an accessory after the fact. In the case at bar, however, the jury
could not conclude, on the basis of the evidence presented, that the witness
was an accessory after the fact without concluding that he was also an
accomplice. The trial judge was therefore bound in any case to apply the rule
of caution and warn the jury regarding the uncorroborated testimony of an
accomplice.

[Page 265]

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] setting aside a
verdict of acquittal of attempted murder and ordering a new trial. Appeal
allowed: acquittal reinstated.

Alain Brabant, for the appellant.

Fernand Côté, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Ritchie and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—I am in agreement with the
disposition of this appeal as proposed by my brother Pigeon. I agree that, on
the facts of this case, the jury could not have come to the conclusion that
St-Onge was an accessory after the fact but not otherwise an accomplice. This conclusion
makes it unnecessary to decide whether the Court of Appeal was right in
reaching the decision that the trial judge had erred in law in instructing the
jury as he did on the matter of corroboration of the evidence of an accessory
after the fact.

I am not, however, prepared to accept the view
expressed by the Court of Appeal on that issue. The Court approved the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick in R. v. Gratton[2].
In the later case of R. v. Riezebos[3],
the Court of Appeal for Ontario did not agree with the conclusion reached
in the Gratton case, and preferred to adopt the definition of the term
“accomplice” stated by Lord Simonds, L.C., in Davies v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[4], at
p. 400, which was accepted by my brother Ritchie and by me in Horsburgh
v. The Queen[5], at
pp. 768 and 756. I am not persuaded that we were wrong in so doing.

The judgment of Spence, Pigeon and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—On a charge of attempted murder
appellant was acquitted by a jury verdict. On appeal by the Crown, a majority
decision ordered

[Page 266]

a new trial for the reason [TRANSLATION] “that
there was an error of law in the instructions to the jury that the testimony of
an accessory after the fact was subject to the rules of corroboration”.

Having stated the grounds of appeal, Dubé J.A.
set out the facts as follows:

[TRANSLATION]… the trial judge is
criticized for having left it to the jury to decide whether the witness St-Onge
was an accomplice or an accessory after the fact, “when nothing in the evidence
allowed the jury to make such a finding”.

The evidence revealed that St-Onge met the
accused, Jeannette Paradis, on the evening of the crime, along with two other
persons, Robert Toussaint and Joseph Gasparo, at the Café Belhumeur, in
Montreal North. The four young people left the Café Belhumeur together, with
the intention of going to eat; Michel St-Onge took Jeannette Paradis and Robert
Toussaint in his car; Joseph Gasparo followed behind in his own car. The four
young people stopped in front of a restaurant, and after some discussion
Jeannette Paradis and Robert Toussaint got out of Michel St-Onge’s car.

At that point, the car driven by Gasparo
went about two hundred feet away and stopped again so that Robert Toussaint
could accost the victim Gérard Juteau, who was walking about in the area in a
rather advanced state of inebriation; Juteau approached the car and Jeannette
Paradis made certain indecent propositions to him, involving the payment of
money; Robert Toussaint realized that Juteau had no money, and told him to get
away; as he walked away from the car, Jeannette Paradis ran after him and
stabbed him several times with a bayonet she had picked up from the floor of
Gasparo’s car.

Michel St-Onge stated that seeing this
crime being committed, he drove off and left the area, but after some time he
returned to the Café Belhumeur; Jeannette Paradis was there; she asked him to
drive her home, since she had no money, and he agreed to drive her.

It is possible that these facts, taken literally,
could not serve as evidence that St-Onge was an accomplice: it would appear
that the crime had in no way been discussed in his presence, and was committed
after Jeannette Paradis and her two companions were separated from St-Onge;
however, I am of the opinion that the trial judge was nevertheless correct
in submitting the above facts to the jury, so that they could themselves

[Page 267]

decide whether St-Onge really
participated in the crime. It is the responsibility
of the jury to decide whether a witness is an accomplice, and the judge should
limit himself to explaining the factors required by the law for a witness to be
considered an accomplice; as a result, when a witness is intimately involved in
the activities immediately preceding a crime, as in the case of St-Onge, it is
preferable that the jury be informed of the possibility that this witness could
be considered an accomplice.

This rule is even more applicable in the
case at bar with respect to the possibility that St‑Onge be considered an
accessory after the fact…

I have underlined the opinion expressed by Dubé
J.A. that the trial judge had properly left it to the jury to decide whether
the witness St-Onge should be considered an accomplice. He held nevertheless,
Crête J.A. concurring, that a new trial should be ordered, because the trial
judge had erroneously instructed the jury that no distinction was to be made
with respect to the danger of convicting without corroboration, between a
witness who is an accomplice and one who is an accessory after the fact. In
arriving at this conclusion, he relied primarily on a decision of the Court of
Appeal of New Brunswick, R.
v. Gratton[6], where
one reads (at pp. 154 and 155):

There is no evidence nor argument advanced
that LeBlanc was in any way involved in the commission of the actual murder
charged. The contention of the appellant is that LeBlanc was, on his own story,
an accessory after the fact of the alleged murder and therefore an accomplice.

English precedents typified by Davies v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954] A.C. 378 at p. 379, are to the
effect that an accessory after the fact is an accomplice for the purpose of the
rule of practice that a jury should be warned of the danger of convicting on
the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.

These decisions advance no reasons as to
why the rule should be extended to an accessory after the fact; they simply
make the unsupported statement that an accessory after the fact is an
accomplice. These statements are also in conflict with some Canadian decisions
particularly with that of our own Court in R. v. Robichaud, 70
C.C.C. 365 at p. 373 et seq., (1938) 3 D.L.R. 768, 13

[Page 268]

M.P.R. 23 (C.A.). R. v. Kellen et al (1927),
33 O.W.N. 153 (C.A.), also supports the same view.

The reason for the origin of the rule of
practice, which has obtained such universal acceptance that it is regarded as
mandatory and of the same effect as if it was a rule of law and not of
practice, is because of the danger, implicit in the evidence of an accomplice
that he may try to fasten the blame on someone else to mitigate his own
involvement. Such reasoning does not apply to an accessory after the fact. By
testifying against the perpetrator of the crime he is giving evidence against
his own interest, he cannot be convicted as an accessory unless the person he
aids or assists in escaping detection be found guilty.

The trial judge relied mainly on what was said
in this Court in Horsburgh v. The Queen[7].
In my opinion, Dubé J.A. was correct in saying that this decision is not
conclusive on the point, because it dealt with real accomplices of the offences
charged. The Court did not have to decide whether the rule of caution in
question applies also to accessories after the fact. It was said that it
applies, citing what was said by Lord Simonds in Davies v. Director of
Public Prosecutions[8], at
p. 400. However, there again the point was not in issue, any more than in
the decisions cited in that case.

Counsel for the accused relied primarily in
support of his appeal on the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in R. v. Riezebos[9]. In the reasons given by Lacourcière
J.A., the conclusion on the point (at p. 11) is as follows:

Mr. Watt’s submission was that
although an accessory after the fact may technically be particeps criminis, he
would be more likely to try to exculpate the accused than to try to exculpate
himself at his expense. Thus the justification for the rule, said to be the
danger of purchasing “impunity by falsely accusing others” (words of Wigmore
on Evidence, 3rd ed., vol. VII (1940), s. 2057, p. 322, quoted by
Ritchie, J., in Davies, supra at p. 310 C.C.C., p. 719
D.L.R.), does not exist and the maxim cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa
lex (Co. Litt. 70b) applies.

[Page 269]

With great respect, we are unable to agree
with this submission or with the conclusion of the Court in R. v. Gratton,
supra, and the other cases referred to. Logically, the evidence of an
accessory after the fact should be regarded as untrustworthy because of his
desire “to purchase lenient treatment for himself at the expense of the accused
by co-operating with the authorities” per Ritchie, J. in Horsburgh, supra, at
p. 310 C.C.C., p. 719 D.L.R. It seems to us that the question whether
an accessory after the fact should be treated as an accomplice has been
answered affirmatively by the highest Court in the land in the Horsburgh case,
supra, so that it is concluded and may be regarded as settled law in Canada.

First, it must be noted that the passage quoted
from the dissenting reasons of Ritchie J. is in no way related to an accessory
after the fact. On the contrary, it comes (at S.C.R. p. 767, C.C.C.
p. 310, D.L.R. p. 719) immediately after the following quotation from
Cross on Evidence (2nd ed., at p. 172):

The danger the accomplice will minimize his
role in the crime and exaggerate that of the accused is the usual justification
for the requirement.

Only on the next page does Ritchie J. adopt the
definition of “accomplice” given by Lord Simonds, quoted by Martland J. in the
majority reasons. He then goes on to say that the witnesses in that case were
not accessories after the fact. It is clear that the majority did not think
otherwise. The ratio decidendi was stated by Martland J. (at S.C.R.
p. 757, C.C.C. p. 299, D.L.R. p. 709) as follows:

In any event, the situation in this case is
that all the material evidence tendered to establish that the appellant aided
and abetted at the commission of delinquencies was given by persons who had
knowingly and wilfully committed those very delinquencies, or, as in the case
of Best, had been guilty of aiding and abetting. In the circumstances of this
case, in my opinion they were particeps criminis and were accomplices.

I am persuaded that if it had been necessary in Horsburgh
to consider the case of accessories after the fact, the Court would not
have failed to take into consideration what appears in Tremeear’s Annotated
Criminal Code, 6th ed. (1964), at p. 1020:

[Page 270]

The better opinion seems to be that an
accessory after the fact is not an accomplice within the meaning of the rule as
to corroboration: R. v. Kellen; R. v. Goldhar; R. v. Goldman (1927)
33 O.W.N. 153 (C.A.); R. v. Robichaud, 13 M.P.R. 23, 70 C.C.C. 365 (N.B.
C.A.); see R. v. Dumont (1921) 49 O.L.R. 222, 37 C.C.C. 166, 64
D.L.R. 128 (C.A.); R. v. George (1935) 1 W.W.R. 145, 49 B.C.R.
345, 63 C.C.C. 225, (1935) 2 D.L.R. 516 (C.A.). In R. v. Robichaud,
supra, it was pointed out that the rule was based upon the danger that an
accomplice might himself have been guilty of the offence, and be trying to
escape by fastening the guilt on another, and that this consideration was
inapplicable in the case of an accessory after the fact, whose connection began
only after the offence was complete. The case was therefore one for the
application of the maxim cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex.

The Horsburgh record shows that nothing
was said of all this in the parties’ factums and there was no reference to
accessories after the fact. It should be noted that in the dissenting reasons
in the Court of Appeal of Ontario, the conclusion of which was later adopted by the majority of this
Court, Laskin J.A. gave a definition of an accomplice which did not include
accessories after the fact (R. v. Horsburgh[10], at p. 757):

On the first of the two issues detailed
above, it is necessary to determine whether any of the Crown witnesses were
accomplices upon whose evidence any of the convictions herein rested. An
accomplice in a loose sense is a person who is particeps criminis, but
the more ample definition generally given is that an accomplice is one who
could himself have been convicted of the offence charged, either as a principal
(including in this term an accessory at or before the fact) or an aider or
abettor. This definition, in my opinion, is still deficient if it would, as in Davies
v. D.P.P., [1954] A.C. 378, exclude as accomplices persons who are parties
to a crime arising out of the same transaction although not parties to the
crime charged against the accused. The definition should be a reflection of the
policy which underlies the vulnerability of an accomplice’s evidence, and I
prefer the view expressed in R. v. Sneesby, [1951] St. R. Qd. 26. I refer also to the
broader view of accomplices, expressed by this Court in R. v. Gauthier, [1954]
O.W.N. 428 at p. 429, 108 C.C.C. 390 at pp. 391-2, 18 C.R. 282,
adopting the statement of Chisholm, J., in R. v. Morrison (1917), 29
C.C.C. 6, 38 D.L.R. 568, 51 N.S.R. 253, that “An accomplice is one

[Page 271]

who is concerned with another or others in
committing or attempting to commit any criminal offence”.

In my view, Crête J.A. was correct in saying:

[TRANSLATION] In the case at bar, I share
the opinion of Dubé J. and I subscribe to the principles which this Court again
stated in Poupart v. The Queen, [1969] Que. Q.B. 197, and Moran
v. The Queen, [1969] Que. Q.B. 310, that the rules of caution
required for the evaluation of the testimony of an accomplice do not apply to
an accessory after the fact.

Moreover, apart from their divergent
interest with relation to the guilt or innocence of the accused, the accomplice
and the accessory after the fact are in totally different situations.

Pigeon J. of the Supreme Court of Canada
appears to have expressed the doctrine in this manner, in The Queen v.
Vinette (decision of May 27, 1974, as yet unreported) [since published,
[1975] 2 S.C.R. 222], when he said, speaking for the majority:

The situation is quite different when a
charge of having been an accessory after the fact is involved. In such a case
the principal and the accessory are not charged with the same offence, the
charge against the accessory being that of having assisted the other party to
escape justice. This offence is therefore subsequent to the principal crime. By
its very nature it is subject to special rules.

I think therefore that the Court of Appeal was
not in error in regarding the decision of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick
in Gratton as correct. However, an important distinction must be made.
As the passage which I have quoted from it shows, there was no question there
of participants in the crime, but only of accessories after the fact. In the
case at bar, on the contrary, Dubé J.A. came to the conclusion “that the trial
judge was …correct in submitting the …facts to the jury, so that they could
themselves decide whether St-Onge really participated in the crime”. This means
that according to the view of the majority on appeal itself, there was evidence
from which a jury could have found that the witness St-Onge was an accomplice.
Therefore the trial judge was in any case bound to warn the jury, as required
in the case of testimony of a person who is likely to be considered an
accomplice in the crime.

[Page 272]

In such conditions, could the Court of Appeal
find that the Crown had discharged the burden of showing that had the error in
law not occurred, the verdict would not necessarily have been the same (The
Queen v. Vézeau[11])? Dubé
J.A.’s reasons on that point are as follows:

[TRANSLATION] …I would therefore say that
appellant properly complains that there was an error of law in the instructions
to the jury that the testimony of an accessory after the fact was subject to
the rules of corroboration; in a case such as this, the consequences are very
serious: in view of the uncontradicted evidence submitted by the Crown that it
was Jeannette Paradis who stabbed the victim, this question of corroboration
was probably the stumbling-block of the verdict; if the jury found that St-Onge
was an accessory after the fact, they were then bound to accept the
instructions that it was not safe to return a verdict of guilty on the basis of
the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. Accordingly, I am convinced that
the verdict might have been different if the jury had been correctly instructed
that the testimony of an accessory after the fact did not need corroboration,
and that on the contrary this testimony could be used, moreover, to corroborate
the testimony of the two other accomplice witnesses.

With respect, I must point out, that this was
said as if the witness could only be an accessory after the fact. That is not
the case. As Dubé J.A. noted in a passage quoted earlier, the witness St-Onge
was “intimately involved in the activities immediately preceding the crime”.
However, the only evidence tending to make him an accessory after the fact was
that he drove the accused home, not right after the crime, but must later, when
the café closed, and some time after the police officiers had left. I cannot
see how the weight of the warning could have depended on the instruction to put
on the same footing an accomplice and an accessory after the fact.

With respect to the actions of the witness
St-Onge before the crime, it should be noted that it was he who took the
accused in his car when the group left the café. He related the conversation
which took place when the accused was in his car before she went to Gasparo’s
as follows:

[Page 273]

[TRANSLATION] Q. What did she say, Miss
Paradis, in her own words?

A. She said that she wanted to get someone
for revenge, because she had just missed her chance with some man I didn’t
know.

Q. She wanted to get someone, were those
the words she used?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you know what that is, to get
someone?

A. What I understood was that she wanted to
rob someone or something like that.

In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge
said:

[TRANSLATION] AS accomplices, you can ask
yourselves whether Toussaint, and Gasparo primarily, and St-Onge, Toussaint and
Gasparo were in the car, were aware of the crime which Jeannette Paradis was
going to commit before she committed it, according to the evidence which is
before you. Then, if these persons, in your view, were aware in advance and
participated in the commission of the crime, then, at that time, you can decide
whether they were accomplices.

As to what could make him an accessory after the
fact, the instruction given regarding St-Onge was as follows:

[TRANSLATION] With respect to St-Onge, he
said that after the evening, he drove Jeannette Paradis home, at St-Laurent and
St-Viateur, because she allegedly said that she had no money for other means of
transportation.

Again, you can examine s. 23 and ask
yourselves whether Michel St-Onge can be considered an accessory after the
fact, because he received, comforted or assisted her for the purpose of
enabling her to escape. This is very important.

Being a witness to a crime is not
everything: the fact of witnessing a crime does not automatically make a
witness an accomplice or an accessory after the fact. The witness must come
within the scope of s. 23; beyond knowing that someone committed a crime,
he must have received or comforted or assisted that person for the purpose of
enabling that person to escape. To escape, means to escape justice, not to
escape by running or in some other way.

I do not see in this case how the jury could
possibly have come to the conclusion that St‑Onge was an accessory after
the fact but not an accom-

[Page 274]

plice. To set aside the acquittal, the Court of
Appeal had to consider not only the importance of the warning, but also the
possibility that the distinction between an accomplice and an accessory after
the fact could, in the case at bar, have had a decisive practical result on the
verdict. This is what I cannot see.

For this reason I would allow the appeal, set
aside judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal.

Appeal allowed, verdict of aquittal restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Illegal search—Certiorari—Order
for return with the exception of documents required as evidence—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 443.

Appellants applied for a writ of certiorari
to quash a search warrant that did not comply with s. 443 Cr. C because
it was too general. The warrant was quashed in the Superior Court and the
correctness of that decision was not challenged. It was also admitted that the
power to order the return of documents illegally seized inhered in the courts
as incidental to their jurisdiction to quash a search warrant on certiorari.
The appeal to this Court is based very specifically on the order made by
the Superior Court judge and affirmed by the Court of Appeal, giving an
opportunity to the Crown to indicate, within five days, documents required by
it as evidence to be exempted from the order for return.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Appellants’ objection to leaving it to the
police to decide which documents should be retained as evidence when there is
an order for return of documents illegally seized is sound. In the case at bar
the Court is not called on, however, to pass on whether a judge who quashes a
search warrant on certiorari and who must make an order for return may
himself choose to exclude certain documents from his order for return on the
grounds that they are required as evidence.

Black v. The Queen (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 446, distinguished; Ghani v. Jones, [1969]
3 All E.R. 1700, referred to.

[Page 244]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a
judgment of the Superior Court, criminal side, recognizing the validity of an
order for return of documents illegally seized with the exception of certain
documents. Appeal allowed and return of all the documents directed.

Bruno Pateras, Q.C., for the appellants.

Guy Lafrance and Serge Authier, for the
respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this appeal is a
narrow one. Certiorari was brought to quash a search warrant for
non-compliance with s. 443  of the Criminal Code . The warrant,
issued by a justice of the peace, was directed to the seizure, at named
premises, of various documents, described only by class (e.g. invoices,
correspondence, books of account, cheques, handwritten notes and a list of
names) and connected with the financial affairs of the Quebec Association for
the Deaf. Although fraud was alleged, neither the perpetrator nor the victim
nor the object of the fraud was identified. There was no indication whether the
premises to be searched were those of the Association or of the perpetrator or
of the victim of the alleged fraud which itself was left completely vague.

Rothman J. quashed the search warrant, and the
correctness of that decision was not challenged on appeal, nor is it challenged
here. However, the search warrant had been executed, and certain documents
claimed by the appellants were seized thereunder, before proceedings were taken
to quash it. Although a question was raised as to the power of the Court to
order the return of documents thus illegally seized, it was common ground in
the Courts below that this power inhered in the Courts as incidental to their
jurisdiction to quash a search warrant on certiorari.

What has brought this case here is the order
made by Rothman J. and affirmed by the Court of

[Page 245]

Appeal, giving an opportunity to the Crown to
indicate, within five days, which of the documents were required by it as
evidence and specifying them precisely. In making this order, the judge of
first instance founded himself on the judgment of Berger J. of the British
Columbia Supreme Court in Black v. The Queen[2]. Without passing on the correctness
of that decision, it is clear that it can have no application here. The reason
why the search warrant was quashed in the Black case was because the person
signing it did not indicate beneath his signature that he was a justice of the
peace or indicate in any other way that he was authorized to issue the warrant.
None of the fatal frailties in the body of the search warrant in the present
case were evident in the Black case. In the circumstances of that case,
Berger J. gave a qualified order for the return of the articles illegally
seized, permitting the Crown to file a letter stating, if that was the case,
that they were required as evidence on a prosecution.

In the present case, it cannot be said that
there is any chargeable offence to which the seized documents could be
relevant. On what basis, therefore, can the trial judge have left it to the
police to determine which of the documents they wish to retain as evidence? It
is true that in his prayer for relief and in his argument before this Court
counsel for the appellants indicated that he had no objection to the trial
judge himself exercising the power to order the return of the illegally seized
documents to the extent that it not be established before him that they were
required as evidence of a criminal offence. His objection was that Roth-man J.
had left it to the police to decide what should be retained. I think this
objection is a sound one.

In the present case, I need not pass on the
question whether, in circumstances such as those present here, a judge may
direct that notwithstanding a fatal defect of substance in a search warrant
which has been executed, the documents seized should be retained subject to his
order and that they may be turned over to the police as he

[Page 246]

may direct. The order in appeal here is not of
that kind.

Ghani v. Jones[3] is of no assistance to the Crown in this case. Apart from the fact
that there is no general statutory authority in England as there is here to
issue search warrants, and that, accordingly, common law rules determine in
most cases whether documents seized by the police in the course of their
investigation of a criminal offence may be retained as evidence, it is apparent
from the reasons of Lord Denning that it is the Courts and not the police who
determine whether adequate grounds exist for retaining seized documents. Those
grounds as set out by Lord Denning are largely involved in the regularity and
validity of a search warrant under s. 443 . Since they have not been met in
this case, as indeed they were not met in Ghani v. Jones, there is no
reason to involve the Court in any sorting of the seized materials.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, set aside
the order in appeal and direct that all the documents seized under the illegal
warrant and all extracts and copies be returned to the appellants.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Constitutional law — Provincial statute providing for a public
inquiry into organized crime — Witnesses refusing to testify sentenced for
contempt of court — Distribution of powers — Administration of justice and
criminal procedure — Police Act, 1968 (Que.), c. 17, s. 19 — Public Inquiry
Commission Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 11, s. 1 — British North America Act, ss. 91,
92, 96 and 101 — Code of Civil Procedure, art. 51.

Criminal law — Evidence — Witnesses before a provincial
inquiry commission — Protection against self-incrimination — Habeas corpus jurisdiction,
civil or criminal — Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 5 - Code of
Civil Procedure, arts. 309 and 851.

Appellants were found guilty of contempt for having
refused to testify at an inquiry before the Quebec Police Commission and
sentenced to one year in jail, this being the maximum provided under art. 51 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. The inquiry was requested by the Lieu­tenant-Governor
in Council pursuant to s. 19 of the Police Act, which authorizes the
holding of an inquiry into organized crime. Appellants appealed from their
sentence by petitions for writs of habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. These petitions were dismissed by the

[Page 153]

Court of Queen's Bench, Crown side, and by the Court
of Appeal of the province of Quebec, and appellants appealed to this Court. They
challenged the validity of the Order in Council and of s. 19 of the Police
Act on constitutional grounds. Consequently, this Court con­sidered the
constitutional question, namely, whether the Order in Council and s. 19 (and
other provisions which were really attacked only as related to s. 19) were ultra
vires the provincial legislature. Appellants, supported by the Attorney
General for Canada, contended that this is criminal law legislation, which
under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act is within the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada. The respondent and the mis en cause,
supported by the Attorneys General for the intervening provinces, claimed that
under s. 92(14) the provinces have jurisdiction to legislate in relation to the
administration of justice in the province, including the administration of
justice in criminal proceedings.

Held (Laskin C.J. and de Grandpré J.
dissenting): The constitutional question should be answered in the negative and
the appeal dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.:
The scope of ""Criminal Law"" and ""Procedure in Criminal
Matters"" in s. 91(27) B.N.A. Act is narrowed by the allocation to
the provinces of jurisdiction over the ""Administration of Justice"" in
all matters civil and criminal, which has consistently been held to include the
detection of criminal activities.

In an examination of the procedure at a coroner's
inquiry, this Court recently held in Faber v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R.
9, that when a person is not charged, the provincial statute requiring him to
testify and making him liable to punishment for contempt of court in the event
of refusal was valid. The conclusion affirmed by the majority in this Court was
that this procedure was not ""a procedure in a criminal matter"". This
was said in a case where, after an open verdict of death due to a crime by a
person or persons unknown, the coroner resumed the inquest for the sole purpose
of ascertaining who might be charged with such crime. If an inquest carried out
with a view to such a consequence can be said not to be a ""procedure in a
criminal matter"", it appears to me that the same must a fortiori
be said of an inquiry in conclusion of which no more can be done than the
making of a report to the provincial Attorney General. There is no reason to
take a different view where the object of the inquiry, instead of being the
gathering of information sufficient to lay a charge for criminally causing the
death of another person, is the gathering of information identifying persons
engaged in organized crime and describing their activities.

[Page 154]

If appellants testify, they will have the benefit of
the protection contemplated in the Canada Evidence Act , s. 5(2) of which
states that this protection is granted to a witness forced to reply under an
Act of any provincial legislature.

The fact that appellants were sentenced to one year
in jail does not support appellants' submission that the matter was
""criminal"". Provincial legislatures are empowered to inflict
punishment by fine or imprisonment for violation of provincial laws. In the
present case, the sentence was handed down under art. 51 of the Code of
Civil Procedure and was coercive not punitive.

Finally, appellants would not be without redress if
the legislation was unconstitutional as they contend. Because they were
committed under provincial legisla­tion, they should apply to the courts of
civil jurisdiction, that is, the Superior Court, by habeas corpus under
art. 851 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence and
Dick-son JJ.: Section 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act, which gives the
provinces power over ""Administration of Justice within the Province"",
cannot be interpreted as meaning the administration of civil justice alone.
Canadian legis­lative history, as well as the development of legal institu­tions
within the provinces since Confederation, do not support such a restrictive
interpretation. Implicit in the grant to the provinces of exclusive legislative
authority in respect of administration of justice and in the grant to the
federal government of exclusive legislative authority in respect of criminal
law and procedure is an accept-ance of a certain degree of overlapping.
However, in the case at bar the Inquiry does not act as a criminal court or
exercise criminal jurisdiction: its function is merely to investigate and
report. The legislation under attack is based solely on the province's
jurisdiction in the ""Administration of Justice"". This is an
independent source of provincial power which does not need to rely on some
other head of power.

The exact scope of s. 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act has
never been dealt with by this Court. The constitutional question raised by the
case at bar touched upon directly only in In re Public Inquiries Act.' In re
Clement [1919] 3 W.W.R. 115, where it was held that a province could make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws since the ferreting out of crime
and the identification of criminals was one of the functions under the
administra­tion of justice, and during such an inquiry could compel a witness
to give evidence which might tend to incrimi­nate him. As is the case with a
coroner's inquest, which

[Page 155]

in Faber v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 9, was
held not to be a matter of criminal law, the Quebec Crime Inquiry deals with
broad social interests and there is no lis or accused; the concern is
the gathering of informa­tion, not adjudication.

In light of the provisions of the Canada Evidence
Act , s. 5(2)  and the Code of Civil Procedure, art. 309, it cannot be
maintained that the Crime Commission's powers of subpoena and imprisonment for
contempt interfered with a citizen's right to protection against
self-incrimination. This right, which originated in common law, has been
abolished in Canada. However, a person who appears before a provincial inquiry
commis­sion is a ""witness"" within the meaning of s. 5 and benefits
from the protection given by subs. (2). Whether or not one agrees with a result
which may force a person to assist in an investigation of his criminal
activity, Canadian laws, both federal and provincial, compel such a result.
Quebec's Crime Inquiry introduces no new and insidious form of investigation
into our judicial system and there is no evidence before the Court that it is a
colourable attempt to evade the procedural provisions of the Criminal Code .

Per Beetz J.: Before Confederation, the
provinces were in charge of the administration of justice, including criminal
justice. Section 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act gave exclusive
legislative authority in criminal law, substan­tive and procedural, to the
Parliament of Canada. But subject to this provision and to the paramountcy of
federal law enacted under primary or ancillary federal jurisdiction, the
provinces were to remain responsible in principle for the enforcement of
criminal law and to retain such power as they had before with respect to the
administration of criminal justice. Section 92(14) of the B.N.A. Act does
not distinguish between civil and crimi­nal justice: the natural meaning of the
expression ""the administration of justice"" is broad enough to
encompass both. As for the power given to Parliament under subs. (27), it was
described by this Court in A.G. Que. v. A.G. Can., [1945] S.C.R. 600,
as the power to determine what shall or what shall not be
""criminal"", and to determine the steps to be taken in prosecutions
and other criminal proceedings before the courts. Section 19 of the Police
Act does not correspond to this description, and must therefore be
construed as being a provision

[Page 156]

bearing on the administration of criminal justice.

The penalties imposed under the impugned legislation
in cases where witnesses refuse to testify are of a coercive nature. Even if
they are punitive, s. 92(15) would suffice to insure their constitutionality
unless they be used as a colourable device to create new crimes, or to punish
old ones otherwise than under the Criminal Code .

Per Laskin C.J. and de Grandpré J., dissenting:
If one accepts the argument that it is open to a province to authorize a
provincially-established tribunal to conduct an inquiry, with supporting
sanctions to compel appearance and testimony, into crime and into crime in all
its ramifications, the provinces would then have this power in respect of any
matter which falls with exclusive federal competence, such as bankruptcy,
insolvency and so on. In support of the constitutionality of s. 19 of the Police
Act, the provinces purport to find in the legisla­tive power in relation to
""the administration of justice in the Province"" ample competence to
authorize inquiries which do not involve accusations or charges and do not
involve prosecutions for offences. This argument rests on a distinction, which
does not seem proper, between a coercive inquiry into criminality and a
coercive inquiry into other fields where there is exclusive federal legisla­ture
power.

Although it is recognized that s. 92(14) of the B.N.A.
Act gives the provinces a source of authority that enables them to blend
with exercises of federal power when the latter is used to invest provincially-established
Courts with jurisdiction in matters within exclusive fed­eral competence,
federal overriding authority is always in reserve. Thus, although the
Parliament of Canada has designated the provincial courts to administer
criminal law, they have to do so according to procedures which under s. 91(27)
of the B.N.A. Act, are within exclusive federal competence.

None of the cases cited really decided the constitu­tional
question raised in the case at bar. The ancillary questions which they dealt
with have no influence on the validity of the challenged provision, namely, s.
19 of the Police Act. Although a province may establish provin­cial or
local police forces, it cannot invest its police

[Page 157]

officers with some fresh power if no such power was
conferred by the existing federal criminal law. To the extent to which
enforcement of the criminal law is left with these police forces, it is there
by virtue of federal law or by the continuation of pre-confederation powers. A
province may not establish an inquiry commission which, by stopping at
investigation and detection and avoiding entry or possible entry into
prosecution, would take over this large area of the criminal law, save for the
minimal restraint of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act . Such an inquiry
into crime has nothing to do with the administration of justice and is a direct
invasion of exclusive federal competence. It is not possible, by pre-scribing a
different procedure for enforcing the criminal law than what Parliament
ordains, for example, by doing ""wholesale"" what is done under the Criminal
Code  by ""retail"", to change the distribution of exclusive
legislative authority in the field of criminal law and criminal procedure.

Since Parliament could authorize an inquiry into the
same subjects as those covered by the challenged legisla­tion, the B.N.A.
Act should be construed as far as possible to preclude both levels of
governmental author­ity from being entitled to converge on an individual for
the same purpose and possibly even at the same time.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had the advantage of seeing
the reasons in this appeal prepared by my brother Pigeon before embarking on my
own. A constitutional issue of far-reaching significance is raised here which
does not appear to have been faced as directly in any previous decision

[Page 159]

as it must be faced here. The issue, in short, is this. Since the
Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority in relation to the
criminal law including procedure in criminal matters (and I shall refer later
to the judicially recognized scope of this power), is it open to a province to
authorize a provincially-established tribunal to conduct an inquiry, with
supporting sanctions to compel appearance and testimony, into crime and into
crime in all its ramifications, including the organi­zations and persons
involved? And if a province has this power in respect of crime, would it not
have it also in respect of bankruptcy and insolven­cy, indeed in respect of any
matter which falls with exclusive federal competence, as do the matters just
enumerated, and this simply because an aspect of the question might be said to
be within s. 92? To take another example, akin in legislative sub­ject matter
to that covered by the inquiry in the present case, would it not also be open
to the province to authorize a full-scale inquiry into monopoly and other
anti-competitive practices which have been dealt with by the Parliament of
Canada, with judicial approval, under its criminal law power?

The need, the desirability of an inquiry such as that put on foot
by Order-in-Council No. 2821-72 issued by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of
Quebec under s. 19 of the Police Act, 1968 (Que.), c. 17, as amended, is
beside the point. We are not concerned here with some private inquiry, with a
piece of research by a scholar, with a journalistic investigation, but with a
state-sanctioned inquiry by a public tribunal with compulsory and punitive
powers against those refusing to cooperate in its proceedings.

The provincial case, supported by four other provinces and
opposed by the Government of Canada, is founded on the legislative power con­ferred
on the provincial Legislatures by s. 92(14) of the British North America
Act, assisted by the provisions for sanctions found in s. 92(15). I need
not dwell on s. 92(15) in this case. If the Province of Quebec has validly
established the inquiry I would not question the grant of authority to the
tribunal conducting it to punish for contempt

[Page 160]

recalcitrant witnesses or persons properly subpoe­naed who refuse
to be sworn.

Section 92(14) of the British North America Act confers
the following legislative power upon provincial Legislatures:

92....

14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including
the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of
Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction and including Proce­dure in Civil Matters in
those Courts.

A number of issues raised by the relation of this power to other
prescriptions of the British North America Act, such as ss. 96 and 101,
and of course, the prescriptions respecting federal legisla­tive power under s.
91, may be quickly laid to rest. A province may establish Courts or tribunals
to administer matters falling within its legislative power, provided that the
limitations as to the character and stature of the courts or tribunals arising
under s. 96 are observed: see Labour Rela­tions Board of Saskatchewan v.
John East Iron Works Ltd.[2]; Tomko
v. Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia[3]'; and
see also Dupont v. Inglis[4]. A province
may establish Courts and endow them with a jurisdictional capacity to administer
even federal legislation, subject to the power of the Parliament of Canada to
repose exclusive jurisdic­tion in such matters in a Court of its own creation
under s. 101: see Board v. Board[5]; cf.
Hellens v. Densmore[6]; and
see Reference re Divorce Court

Act (P.E.I.)[7];
Pringle v. Fraser[8]. Where
a province

establishes such a Court, the substantive law administered
therein, being in relation to matters falling within exclusive federal
competence, would have to come from federal enactments; cf Attorney

[Page 161]

General of British Columbia v. McKenzie[9].
The Parliament of Canada could and has, in some cases, fortified this
exercise of federal jurisdiction by provincial courts by designating them to be
the judicial enforcement agencies. The commonest illustration of this is, of
course, in the federal provisions for enforcement of the criminal law.

A provincial Court which administers federal law, be it a
superior court or not, may do so through its own procedures unless the federal
legislation prescribes the procedure to be followed. An example of this is
found in the field of bank­ruptcy. There is one important qualification to
provincial court resort to its own procedure and that is where the procedure is
in a criminal matter. This, under s. 91(27) of the British North America
Act, is within exclusive federal competence: see In re Storgoff[10]
and cf Minister of National Reve­nue v. Lafleur[11].

The submissions on behalf of the Attorney Gen­eral of Quebec and
of the supporting provincial Attorneys General do not, as I appreciate their
force, deny the foregoing propositions but rather distinguish them by
purporting to find in the legis­lative power in relation to ""the
administration of justice in the Province"" ample competence to authorize
inquiries which do not involve accusa­tions or charges and do not involve
prosecutions for offences. The fact that, consequentially, charges may result,
or that remedial legislation may be called for which only the Parliament of
Canada may enact, is not, according to the provin­cial contentions, sufficient
to deny provincial au­thority to establish the inquiry. We are thus brought to
consider not what s. 92(14) does not cover but rather what it embraces.

[Page 162]

The argument before this Court, as advanced by the proponents of
the validity of this inquiry, appeared to me to rest, to some degree at least,
on a distinction between a coercive inquiry into crimi­nality and a coercive
inquiry into other fields where there is exclusive federal legislative power.
The one is said to relate to the administration of justice in the Province; the
others, apparently, not so. I fail to see the distinction. A coercive inquiry,
say into the operation of bankruptcy laws, or practices relating to bankruptcy
and insolvency is as much an inquiry into the administration of justice, civil
justice in fact, as an inquiry into crime and criminality; and if the latter is
validly open to a Province, so must be the former; and so must be any coercive
inquiry which a Province may wish to mount into fields where exclusive
legislative power rests with the Parliament of Canada. Why not, to take another
example, an inquiry into penitentiary operations which are within exclusive
federal power under s. 91(28) of the British North America Act, on the
ground that under s. 92(6) public and reformatory prisons are within provincial
jurisdiction? No doubt, the Prov­ince would not claim power to authorize its
tri­bunal to require the presence of penitentiary inmates at the inquiry, any
more than it could require their attendance in the present case but, apart from
that, former inmates and anyone else whom the inquiry tribunal wished to hear
could be compelled, if the provincial contention is correct.

It seems to be quite plain that if ""administration of
justice in the Province"", within s. 92(14), extends to civil and criminal
justice without limita­tion (and this is the contention here of the Prov­inces),
it must extend to any area of civil law or public law or criminal law,
regardless of where the legislative power resides substantively in those
various fields. True enough, areas other than the criminal law area are not
before us, but they can hardly be ignored when an assertion as commanding

[Page 163]

as the one made by the Provinces is presented.

""Administration of justice in the Province"" within s.
92(14) is not a head of power which has hitherto been closely examined in the
case law. It has been regarded, and properly so, as supporting provincial
appointment of judicial officers and Judges other than those covered by s. 96: see,
for example, Regina v. Bush[12].
It certainly envisages the provision of facilities through which Courts
and like tribunals can carry out their functions, and also, I would say, the
appointment of support staff and enforcement officials necessary to assist in
the judicial process. In Valin v. Langlois[13], the
Supreme Court of Canada took s. 92(14) to relate to the organization of courts
of justice for the Province and Henry J. expanded on this to say (at p. 67)
that ""administration of justice in the Prov­ince"" means ""the
power of legislating for the administration of justice in the Province in
regard to the subjects given by the [British North Ameri­ca] Act and, to
that extent only, to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization
of pro­vincial Courts, including the procedure necessary for the administration
of justice in reference to those and kindred subjects"". I do not put Valin
v. Langlois forward as a case that has any direct affinity with the present
one, especially when it was concerned with the validity of a federal statute
imposing duties on provincial Superior Courts and not, as here, with a
provincial statute and Order­in-Council whose validity has to be considered in
the absence of competing federal legislation. It is, however, indicative of a
view of s. 92(14) which, in my opinion, pays due regard to the scheme of
distribution of legislative power and to the limita­tions on provincial
competence that arise out of the catalogue of exclusive federal powers.

Although, like other heads of provincial power, s. 92(14) cannot
be used to invade exclusive feder­al powers, it does nonetheless give the
Province a

[Page 164]

source of authority that enables it to blend with exercises of
federal power when the latter is used to invest provincially-established Courts
with jurisdiction in matters within exclusive federal compe­tence. Federal
overriding authority is in reserve, however, in respect of those matters.

It is unnecessary for a Province to rely on s. 92(14) if it would
authorize an inquiry into an industry or an activity that is within provincial
competence. The Province can rely for this on other heads of power in s. 92
which embrace the industry or the activity within their scope. It would, of
course, rely on s. 92(14) if the inquiry was directed to the operation of
provincial Courts or of other tribunals that determine rights and liabilities.
What is involved here, however, is not of that order.

I do not think that what was said by Duff C.J. in Reference re
the Adoption Act[14], at
p. 403, as quoted by my brother Pigeon assists the provincial contentions in
this case. The learned Chief Justice was speaking principally of the
administrative enforcement of the substantive criminal law enacted by
Parliament, enforcement by municipal or provincial police forces; and if the
generality of his words as to ""the suppression of crime and disor­der""
and as to ""social conditions having a tenden­cy to encourage vice and
crime"" might suggest a so-called preventive scope for provincial
legislation in the field of crime or its incipient conditions, they must be
read today as qualified by later decisions of this Court, such as those in Johnson
v. Attorney General of Alberta[15],
and Switzman v. Elbling and the Attorney General of Quebec[16].
I may refer also in this connection to the statement of the Privy
Council in Attorney General of Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation[17],
at p. 207, that ""to legislate for prevention appears to be

[Page 165]

on the same basis as legislation for cure"".

Bédard v. Dawson and Attorney General of Quebec[18],
which is the authority usually relied on to support provincial power to
pass legislation (in the words of Duff J., as he then was, in that case)
""aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of
crime rather than at the punishment of crime"" (at p. 684), is a case where
the Province could claim constitutional support because it was dealing with the
use and occupation of property, albeit for purposes prohibited by the Criminal
Code . That was the view of this Court in its cautious treatment of the Bédard
case in the Switzman case, supra. I know of no case,
certainly none in the Privy Council or in this Court, which has recognized an untrammelled
right of the Prov­ince to legislate, as it has done here in relation to the
criminal law, without even any pretence of some constitutional anchor in
substantive provin­cial legislative authority, such as was evident in the
recent inquiry by the Cliche Commission, in Quebec, into violence in the
construction industry, and in the recent Waisberg Inquiry in Ontario into
practices, including unlawful activities, in the building industry.

It is, I think, important to remember in assess­ing the scope of
provincial competence under s. 92(14) that this is not a ""non obstante""
power. Rather, it is federal competence, both in respect of the matters
enumerated in s. 91 and in respect of the powers conferred by s. 101, that is
conferred ""notwithstanding anything in this Act"".

Had the Parliament of Canada established an inquiry such as the
one in question here, and with

[Page 166]

the same scope, there would be no doubt of its power to do so,
nor of its power to designate a provincial tribunal to carry it out: see In
re Vancini[19];
Prince Edward Island Marketing Board v. H. B. Willis Inc.[20];
cf Coughlin v. Ontario Highway Transport Board[21];
Registrar of Motor Vehicles v. Canadian American Transfer Ltd.[22]
It would certainly be entitled to assert its pre-emi­nence in relation to
criminal law and procedure in criminal matters. I understood counsel for the
Attorney General of Ontario to deny that the Parliament of Canada may exercise
such author­ity, and if I am right in that understanding, I am unable to agree
with this submission. It appears to be founded on the history of
pre-confederation and post-confederation legislation respecting public in­quiries
(see 1844-46 (Can.), c. 38; C.S.C. 1859, c. 13, s. 1; 1868 (Can.), c. 38, ss. 1
and 2), and the exclusion from post-confederation federal legisla­tion of the
words ""the administration of justice therein"", which were included in
the pre-confeder­ation inquiries legislation. This, in my opinion, begs the
question because it does not give an answer to the scope of the power in
relation to ""the administration of justice in the Province"" in the
context of the British North America Act.

Admittedly, prosecution of crime, be it through
provincially-organized courts or not, must be based on substantive law and
procedure enacted and prescribed by the Parliament of Canada. The pro­vincial
contention is that this limitation does not apply if for prosecution of
particular charges in particular cases there is substituted a general com­mission
of inquiry, an administrative or quasi-judi­cial investigation into crime,
though surrounded by sanctions against witnesses and potential witnesses of a
kind similar to those available in prosecutions.

Section 19 of the Quebec Police Act, as enacted in 1968,
and amended by 1971 (Que.), c. 16, s. 4 and 1972 (Que.), c. 16, s. 1 is a new
provision introduced into a new embracing Act respecting

[Page 167]

police forces in Quebec, and I regard it as of some significance
that s. 19 exists side by side with s. 1 of the Public Inquiry Commission
Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 11, as amended. I set out these two provisions in
parallel paragraphs, as follows:

19. The Commission shall make an inquiry, whenever requested
to do so by the Lieutenant-Gov­ernor in Council, respect­ing any aspect of
crime which he indicates.

The Commission shall also make an inquiry into the
activities of an organi­zation or system, its ramifications and the per-sons
involved, to the extent prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
whenever he has reason to believe that in the fight against organ­ized crime or
terrorism and subversion, it is in the public interest to order such an inquiry
to be held.

1. Whenever the Lieu-tenant Governor in Coun­cil deems it
expedient to cause inquiry to be made into and concerning any matter connected
with the good government of the Province, the conduct of any part of the public
business, the administra­tion of justice or any matter of importance relating
to public health, or to the welfare of the population, he may, by a commission
issued to that effect, appoint one or more commissioners by whom such inquiry
shall be conducted.

Section 1 of the Public Inquiry Commission Act goes back,
in substance, to s. 1 of 1869 (Que.), c. 8. I notice that both the original and
the present s. 1 authorize inquiries to be directed into any matter connected
with the good government of the prov­ince and the administration of justice. It
is emi­nently arguable that if the contentions of the provincial Attorneys
General as to the scope of the authority conferred by the words
""administration of justice"" is as broad as they allege, it would have
been unnecessary to introduce the particular provi­sion as to crime
investigations found in s. 19 of the Police Act. As I read s. 1 of the Public
Inquiry Commission Act, it is broad enough to authorize the designation of
the Quebec Police Commission as an inquiry tribunal under s. 1 and, certainly,
its members could be so designated and appointed. The enactment of s. 19, in
short, suggests that

[Page 168]

something more than what ""the administration of justice in
the Province"" connotes was introduced, unless it is simply a case of
special reference to underline the serious view taken by the Legislature of the
matters covered by s. 19.

The competing contentions of counsel brought to the fore a number
of cases which call for examination on the constitutional issue in this case. They
are, respectively, Regina v. Coote[23];
In re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement[24];
Batary v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan[25];
and Faber v. The Queen[26].

Regina v. Coote is relied upon for the proposi­tion that a
provincial Legislature may provide for an inquiry by a provincially constituted
and appointed tribunal into matter that involve or relate to the criminal law,
and which therefore are, substantively within exclusive federal legislative
jurisdiction. I do not think that the Privy Council's decision says this. The
case came to the Privy Council on the question of the admissibility, on a trial
for arson, of depositions of the accused taken at a fire marshal's inquiry
authorized by provincial legislation. Under this legislation, the fire marshal
was required, whenever any building or property was damaged by fire, to
institute an inquiry into the cause or origin of the fire, and, in that connec­tion,
to ascertain whether it was kindled by design or was the result of negligence
or accident. Power to summon witnesses to give information or evi­dence was
conferred upon the fire marshal who also was empowered to commit for contempt
for refusal to testify. The Privy Council held, on the main point before it,
that the depositions were admissible against the accused, save as to answers to
question to which he objected as tending to criminate him but which he was
improperly com­pelled to answer. On the issue allegedly germane

[Page 169]

to the present case the Privy Council said only this (at p. 605):

... It was held by the whole Court [the Quebec Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side] (in their Lordships' opinion rightly) that the
constitution of the Court of the ""Fire Marshal"", with the powers
given to it, was within the competency of the Provincial legislature; …

This observation has been regarded as going to a s. 96 question,
namely, whether the fire marshal as a provincial appointee was given powers
exercis­able only by a superior or county Court Judge or powers analogous
thereto: see Reference re the Adoption Act[27]. Moreover,
having had the advan­tage of seeing the reasons for judgment of the various
members of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, which heard Coote's
appeal from a judgment on a reserved question as to the admissibility of the
depositions (by a majority of three to two it held them inadmissible), I find
that they do not support the unanimous conclusion attributed to the Quebec
Court by the Privy Council.

It is true that in his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice
Drummond, one of the five Quebec judges who sat on the appeal, referred to the
objection that the legislation respecting inquiries by fire marshals was
invalid as encroaching on federal legislative power in respect of criminal
matters, and then asserted that ""as to this objection all the Judges here
agreed that the local Act in question gave to the fire marshals power of
investigation or inquiry only and did not interfere with the author­ity of the
Federal Legislature in criminal matters"". However, Chief Justice Duval
concluded his reasons by saying that ""I make no remarks on the
constitutionality of the Act . . . limited as it is in its provisions, as no
doubt was expressed on the sub­ject"". Mr. Justice Caron said that it was
unneces­sary to decide the constitutional question and he did not propose to
deal with it. Mr. Justice Badgley,

[Page 170]

who had reserved the question of the admissi­bility of the
depositions for the opinion of the Court, concluded that the fire marshal
inquiry legislation was valid provincial legislation which did not encroach on
the federal criminal law power in giving authority to inquire into the cause
and origin of fires. Mr. Justice Monk concerned him-self with the propriety of
reserving the evidence question and did not touch the constitutional point.

Apart altogether from any issue as to whether the Privy Council
correctly appreciated the views of the members of the Quebec Court of Queen's
Bench on the validity of the fire marshal inquiry legislation, there is a vast
difference between the enactment under discussion in the Coote case and
s. 19 of the Quebec Police Act. The Coote legisla­tion had only
an incidental connection with the criminal law; it was rather concerned with
the introduction of a procedure for determining the cause and origin of fires,
which would go to ques­tions of safety and prevention of accidents, arising
through negligence or otherwise, and in that con­nection embracing also inquiry
into whether a fire was deliberately set. In contradistinction to the Coote legislation,
s. 19 of the Police Act has a direct and unqualified thrust into the
substantive criminal law. The Commission has no other man-date than to inquire
into the existence of crime, in all its ramifications, and it is not expressly
limited to what is defined in the federal Criminal Code . Yet it cannot
be doubted that only the federal Parliament can prescribe what is criminal in
Canada for all of Canada.

Re Public Inquiries Act: re Clement arose out of a
reference to the British Columbia Court of Appeal as to the validity of the
provincial Public Inquiries Act and as to whether it was within the
powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under that Act to establish an
inquiry to determine

[Page 171]

(1) whether intoxicating liquor had been unlawful­ly imported
into the province since the passing of a federal Order-in-Council prohibiting
any such importation and (2) whether sales of intoxicating liquor had been made
in the province contrary to a provincial prohibition statute.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal deter-mined, easily enough,
that the Public Inquiries Act was valid provincial legislation. On its
face it provided (and it was common provincial legisla­tion) for inquiries
into, inter alia, the good government of the province, the conduct of
public busi­ness and the administration of justice. Again, there was no doubt
of the power of the provincial Gov­ernment under this legislation to inquire
into breaches of provincial law. What troubled the Court was whether the
provincial inquiry could lawfully reach into breaches of the criminal law. That
law was involved, in the view of the Court, because of the federal
Order-in-Council, which was passed on December 22, 1917, at the instance of the
War Committee of the Privy Council, pro­hibiting the importation of liquor into
Canada until one year after the end of the war: see 51 Can. Gaz., at p.
2182. I may note here that this policy was put on a more permanent basis on a
provin­cial-support level by an amendment to the Canada Temperance Act by
1919 (Can. 2nd sess.), c. 8 which provided that upon provincial instigation a
vote could be taken to prohibit the importation of liquor into any province in
which its sale for beverage purposes was prohibited: see Gold Seal Ltd. v.
Dominion Express Co. and Attorney-Gen­eral of Alberta[28].
British Columbia, like other provinces at that time, had a prohibition
statute and thus it was that the federal legislation and the earlier federal
Order-in-Council were (in the words of one of the judges in this British
Columbia reference) ""merely supplementary to the local law and the effect
has not been to displace the local law"" (at p. 124 of 33 C.C.C.). This was
of a piece with other instances where the federal temperance statute was
construed to make allowance for valid provincial legislation: see Attorney-General

Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[29].

The characterization of the federal Order-in-Council as involving
criminal law may be suspect in view of the judicial history of federal
temperance legislation: see Russell v. The Queen[30];
Attorney-General of Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation[31].
However, I am prepared to assume that the British Columbia Court's decision
would have been the same, that it would have sustained the reach of the inquiry
whatever might have been the characterization of the federal prohibitory
provisions. The basis of the judgment was reliance on the words
""administration of jus­tice in the Province"" in s. 92(14)
of the British North America Act and in the provincial Public
Inquiries Act. The matter was dealt with by Mac­donald C.J.A. in a passage
that has been heavily relied on by the Provinces in the present case. He said
this (at pp. 121-2 of 33 C.C.C.):

Under its powers in respect of administration of jus­tice
when crime has been committed, the Province puts the machinery of the criminal
law in motion. This undoubtedly is one branch of the administration of justice,
but the discovery of crime when it is merely suspected may, I think, also fall
into that category. Provincial peace officers are charged with that duty
amongst others. A provincial detective force might, I think, be organized under
provincial laws for the very purpose for which the commissioner was appointed.
Now, if I am right in thinking that investigations, extra-judicially, into the
commission of crime for the purpose of discovering if and by whom committed are
within the subject matters assigned to the Province under the words
""administration of justice,"" is there anything to prevent the
Province from making the inves­tigation effective by imposing on individuals an
obliga­tion to give evidence under penalty for refusal. I think not. Such a
power is not inconsistent, but consistent, with the jurisdiction of the
Province to legislate concern­ing property and civil rights.

[Page 173]

No doubt to concede the power to the Province to make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws would appear at first blush to be
an anomaly, and it might well be argued that the powers conferred upon the
Province in respect of the administration of justice ought to be interpreted as
conferring merely the duty or obligation to put the machinery of the Courts in
motion, and to take the requisite steps to prosecute persons accused of crime.
That narrow construction would, I think, preclude what has been generally recognised
as one of the functions of government in the administration of justice, namely,
the ferreting out of crime and iden­tification of criminals. There is nothing
novel in com­pelling a witness to give evidence which may tend to incriminate
him. That is done in the civil Courts and is the practice in one of the oldest
criminal Courts of the Realm, the Coroner's Inquest. With the justice or
expediency of inquiries into crime by an extra-judicial provincial commission I
have not to concern myself. The power to appoint such rests somewhere. It is
either with the Dominion or the Province, or with each, and hence it is idle to
urge as a reason against the validity of the order-in-council that it is
inimical to the rights of the subject.

I am of the opinion that the foregoing passage goes much beyond
the necessity of the occasion. The fact that a Superior Court judge was
appointed to conduct the inquiry did not appear to be a material consideration
for the British Columbia Court of Appeal and, in my opinion, rightly so. What
appears to me however to have been the focus of the inquiry was the concern
with the effectiveness of the provincial prohibition statute and, hence, as in
the Coote case, I would regard the concern with the unlawful importation
of liquor into the province as merely incidental to the issue of effective
enforcement within the province of its temperance law.

I do not think that either Batary v. Attorney-General of
Saskatchewan, supra, or Faber v. The Queen, supra, go to the point
which I have been considering. Both were concerned with certain pro­ceedings
before coroners under provincial coroners' legislation in Saskatchewan and
Quebec. In neither case was the validity of the Coroners Act per se called
into question. In Batary, a section of the Coroners Act, making a
person charged with a criminal offence arising out of a death a compellable

[Page 174]

witness at an inquest directed into the cause of the death, was
held to be ultra vires the provin­cial legislature notwithstanding that
the chal­lenged provision gave the person the protection of s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  if it was invoked in respect of any question put to him which
might tend to criminate him. In Faber, the question for decision was
whether the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side) had jurisdiction to issue
prohibition to a coroner in respect of an inquest at which Faber had refused to
testify with the result that there were a number of committals for contempt.
The question of jurisdiction, whether it resided in the Superior Court or in
the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side), turned on whether the prohi­bition
proceedings were in a criminal matter, within federal jurisdiction, or were
subject to pro­vincial procedures. This Court held, by a majority of five to
four, that jurisdiction lay with the Quebec Superior Court.

In my opinion, the fact that contempt issues arising out of
statutory compellability to give evi­dence (and thus raising questions touching
the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10 and especially s. 5 
thereof) may call for decision is peripheral to the larger question in this
case, namely, whether s. 19 of the Police Act is invalid as a whole. As
both Batary and Faber show, such peripheral issues may be decided
without touching the larger question. I am prepared to consider all the
supporting provisions in this case as to compellability and contempt, and
enforcement thereof by imprisonment, as neutral provisions which could be found
in valid provincial legislation as well as in valid federal legislation. The
matter then is s. 19 itself and not any ancillary provisions.

In the course of argument it was contended on behalf of the
Provinces that even a police officer could be invested by the Province with
authority to carry on an inquiry under s. 19. Although such an officer would
then be acting in other than his

[Page 175]

traditional capacity, the submission underlines the close
relation between the ordinary functions of the police in the investigation and
detection of crime and in assistance in the prosecution of crime, and the
function assumed by the Police Commis­sion under the Order-in-Council herein
made in pursuance of s. 19. Indeed, it appeared that it was in the functions of
police officers and police forces, constituted under provincial legislation,
that the Provinces found support for their contention that s. 92(14) embraced
coercive investigation into crime and hence, by analogy, an investigation with
coer­cive power such as that provided for under s. 19 of the Quebec Police
Act. In my view, this is the critical submission in support of s. 19, and I
wish to examine it in depth.

The power of a Province, or of a municipality by delegation from
a Province, to establish provincial or local police forces is unquestioned,
just as is the power of Provinces to establish provincial Courts (subject to
the appointing power conferred by s. 96). The mere establishment of a police
force, and even the endowment of the police officers with statutory powers
under provincial legislation, does not, ipso facto, give them authority
to exercise those powers if such exercise would take them into the field of
criminal law enforcement as contrasted with the enforcement of municipal
by-laws or pro­vincial penal laws. A similar situation prevails where a
Province endows its Courts with authority to administer criminal law or
bankruptcy law. I have already pointed out that this is simply to give them a
capacity which must be fed by federal legislation. In fact, it is open to the
federal Parlia­ment to invest provincial functionaries or courts with federal
functions under federal legislation, regardless of whether they are endowed
with capacity by provincial legislation: see In re Van­cini, supra.

What I have said as to police officers and police forces must be
placed in historical context, and must take account of pre-confederation common
law powers and pre-confederation legislation which survived Confederation.
Section 129 of the British North America Act provided for the con­tinuation,
except as otherwise provided, of all laws in force in the federating Provinces,
all Courts and

[Page 176]

all legal commissions, powers and authorities and all officers,
judicial, administrative and ministeri­al, subject however to be repealed,
abolished or altered by Parliament or a provincial Legislature according to the
distribution of power under the Act. It is plain, therefore, that police forces
and police officers continued to exercise their pre-confederation authority,
even in relation to what after Confederation were criminal law matters within
exclusive federal competence, subject to those powers being taken away or
altered by Parliament.

It is simply not arguable that a Province could invest one of its
police officers with, for example, some fresh power to arrest for a criminal
offence if no such power was conferred by the federal crimi­nal law. The Criminal
Code  defines a ""peace officer"" very broadly, and municipal or
provincial police officers now exercise powers of arrest or of search, in
connection with the enforcement of the criminal law, under federal legislation
and, espe­cially, under the Criminal Code . If there are still some
vestigial common law or pre-confederation statute law powers extant, which have
not been overtaken or supplanted by federal legislation, they do not affect
what I have stated; rather do they support the propositions herein.

In my opinion, the suggestion that there is some independent
authority in provincial or municipal police forces, independent that is of
federal legisla­tion, to enforce the criminal law, and that this independent
authority is fed by s. 92(14) is simply untenable, and there is no basis for
finding in the existence of provincial or municipal police forces any
analogical support for the validity of the inqui­ry established under s. 19 of
the Quebec Police Act. To the extent to which enforcement of the
criminal law is left with provincial or municipal police forces, it is there by
virtue of federal law or by the continuation of pre-confederation powers left
untouched by federal law.

[Page 177]

We are asked to agree that a Province could authorize provincial
or local police to engage in an inquiry into the criminal law and, for example,
in connection therewith to require any citizen under investigation to answer
inquiries on pain of liabili­ty to incarceration for contempt. Assuming that,
whatever be the nature of the inquiry, a citizen may invoke s. 5 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10 and thus protect himself in respect of
criminating questions (assuming also he is a witness within s. 5), nonetheless
he would be disentitled to refuse to answer questions incriminating others. The
scope of the inquiry can be heedless of rules of evidence that operate under
federal law applicable to criminal matters. On the submissions made by the
Provinces, it is only necessary to say that the inquiry is not directed to
possible prosecution for a criminal offence; and what the federal Parliament,
endowed with exclu­sive power in relation to criminal law and proce­dure in
criminal matters, has not done the Prov­ince may do, riding roughshod over
citizens in the process. I am not in the least concerned that only those of
allegedly unsavoury character have been or will be interrogated. They are as
much entitled to rely on the distribution of legislative power under the British
North America Act, and on the safeguards prescribed by the Parliament of
Canada when crime is being investigated, as are the most unblemished of our
citizens.

If the inquiry or investigation were put on foot by the Province
with a view to possible prosecu­tion, is there any doubt but that it would
amount to an invasion of the federal criminal law power? What we have here is
an inquisitorial process, more draconian than what Parliament has pre-scribed
in relation to the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime; and yet
it is contended that by stopping at investigation and detection (under the
inquiry) and avoiding entry or possible entry into prosecution, the Province
may constitu­tionally take over this large area of the criminal law, save for
the minimal restraint of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act . This, to me,
is not only a colourable invasion but a direct invasion of exclu­sive federal
competence. An administrative, quasi-judicial

[Page 178]

coercive investigation at large into crime has nothing to do with
the ""administration of justice in the Province"".

Those words have never been interpreted to reach into ends which
are beyond provincial au­thority, unless we are to say that an inquiry, however
coercive, is an end in itself, and is in relation to ""administration of
justice"", though no charges are involved against particular persons, no
courts are involved and no consequences are involved, save as to those who
refuse to cooperate in the enterprise.

It has been said time and again, both by the Privy Council when
it was Canada's highest Court and by this Court, that the federal criminal law
power endowed the Parliament of Canada with that authority in its widest sense.
The proposition began with Attorney General of Ontario v. Hamil­ton Street
Railway[32], at
p. 529. In my opinion, this view of the power embraces not only the substan­tive
criminal law but also ""procedure in criminal matters"" which is part
of s. 91(27). In Reference re Validity of the Combines Investigation Act and
of s. 498 of the Criminal Code[33], Duff
J., as he then was, speaking for himself and for Rinfret and Smith JJ. said (at
p. 418) that ""the authority in relation to the criminal law and criminal
proce­dure given by s. 91(27) would appear to confer upon the Dominion, not
as an incidental power merely, but as an essential part of it, the
power to provide for investigation into crime, actual and potential"".
(The emphasis is mine.) The learned judge, as Chief Justice, touched this theme
again in Provincial Secretary of P.E.I. v. Egan[34],
at p. 401, where he said that ""the subject of criminal law entrusted
to the Parliament of Canada is necessarily an expanding field by reason of the
authority of the Parliament to create crimes, impose punishment for such
crimes, and to deal with criminal procedure"". I point out also that
whereas in the grant of authority to the Provinces under s. 92(14) of the British
North America Act

[Page 179]

""procedure in civil matters"" is associated with the
phrase ""in those Courts"", there is no such qualifi­cation in the
reference to ""procedure in criminal matters"" in s. 91(27).

What is urged upon this Court by the Provinces represented in
this case is that it should construe the federal power in relation to criminal
procedure in the same way as ""procedure"" is dealt with in s. 92(14),
that is that it should be limited only to what goes into procedure in the
prosecution of offences in the courts. The corollary of this sub-mission is
that any other mode of inquiry into the operation of the criminal law belongs
to the Prov­inces as falling within the ""administration of jus­tice in the
Province"" under s. 92(14). I do not think that it could be argued
successfully that a Province could prescribe a different procedure (or indeed
any procedure) for enforcing the criminal law than what Parliament ordains.
Merely to change the tribunal of inquiry and to do ""whole-sale"" what,
so to speak, is done under the federal Criminal Code  by
""retail"" cannot, in my view, change the distribution of exclusive
legislative au­thority in the field of criminal law and criminal procedure. We
would be as unjustified in freezing our understanding of what is ""criminal
procedure"" as of 1867 as we have held it to be unjustified to freeze the
meaning of ""criminal law"" according to what was criminal in 1867, and
this whether we refer to the substantive criminal law, to investiga­tive
procedures, that may or may not be followed by prosecution, or to penalties or
sanctions that may be imposed upon a conviction: see Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen[35], at
p. 308. The comprehensive scope of the criminal law power under s. 91(27)  is
also shown by Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Smith[36].

[Page 180]

What is presented here under s. 19 of the Police Act is a
provincial adoption of a new form of procedure for inquiring into crime, a
procedure in a criminal matter, within s. 91(27), and although there is no
direct attempt under s. 19 and under the implementing Order-in-Council to
change the existing criminal law, a different method of exam­ining its
operation is prescribed from the method laid out in the Criminal Code  and
in allied federal legislation. As I have already noted, Parliament could
authorize a wholesale inquiry of that kind in addition to the individualized
enforcement that has been traditional with us. For the Province to do it,
however, is for it to provide a type of supplemen­tary administration which, in
my opinion, is beyond its powers. I borrow and adapt the words of Rand J. in Johnson
v. Attorney-General of Alberta[37], at
p. 138 where, speaking it is true in another context, he said that ""any
local legislation of a supplementary nature that would tend to weaken or
confuse [the] enforcement [of the criminal law] would be an interference with
the exclusive power of Parliament"".

It is evident from the submissions of the Prov­inces that they
would read s. 92(14) as if the words in it were ""administration of
criminal justice as well as of civil justice"". I am satisfied on such
authorities as there are, as well as on the scheme of the British North
America Act, that adminis­tration of criminal justice, whatever be the form
that it takes, is for Parliament alone to prescribe. The sweeping nature of the
inquiry power into crime and criminality, conferred by s. 19, is under-lined
not only by its terms, already quoted, but as well by the terms of
Order-in-Council No. 2821-72. I set them out here because they emphasize why,
in my view, the federal power in relation to criminal law and procedure in
criminal matters is usurped by what has been prescribed under provin­cial
authority.

The relevant provisions of the Order-in-Council are as follows:

[Page 181]

 [TRANSLATION] Upon the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

THAT in the fight against organized crime, the Quebec Police
Commission shall make an inquiry into the activities of any organizations or
systems, including their ramifications and the persons involved, where such
organizations or systems operate in illegal gaming and betting, usurious loans
practices (shylocking), extorsion, illegal trafficking in drugs and narcotics,
counterfeiting, commercial fraud, fraudulent bankruptcies, arson, fraudulent
stock manipulation or promotion, fraudulent dealings of corporations, illegal
pressure on businessmen or officers or members of associations or corporations
to control them or to extort from them money or property, theft of bonds, theft
of stamps and precious metals, theft and dismantling of automobiles, sale of
stolen goods, prostitution, illegal stills and distribution of adulterated
liquor, illegal consumers exploitation, blackmail, intimi­dation and
corruption, and illegal or fraudulent obten­tion of any permits issued by or
decisions made by any public body.

THAT the Quebec Police Commission shall submit to the
Attorney General, on or before December 31, 1975, ""the written report
setting forth the findings"" which it will have made, and that the
Commission shall be authorized to submit, in its discretion, to the Attorney
General, written reports whenever the Commission deems it appropriate.

The foregoing terms point to another consider­ation that to me is
decidedly relevant. Public com­missions of inquiry, launched by a particular
level of Government, are normally designed to bring to light facts and issues
upon which the particular Government can propose curative or protective
legislation to the Legislature to which it is accountable, if the report of the
inquiry justifies the introduction of such legislation. That would not be
possible here when it is conceded that only Parliament can enact criminal law
and prescribe criminal procedure, and when it is clear from the terms of the
Order-in-Council that they point to , issues that are, substantively, beyond
provincial competence. Moreover, if governmental powers are to be exercised
coercively against individuals, the latter are entitled to have at least such
protection

[Page 182]

as is provided by the distribution of legislative power under the
British North America Act, in the sense that the Act should be
construed as far as possible to preclude both levels of governmental authority
from being entitled to converge on an individual for the same purpose and
possibly even at the same time.

The convenience of having a local inquiry, if there is a serious
problem of crime, whether organ­ized or not, in the Province can easily be met
by federal intervention to direct it. And if there are extra-provincial
ramifications or, indeed, other Provinces or areas therein where there are such
problems, it is not difficult to enlarge the terms of reference or to prescribe
similar inquiries to be undertaken by other tribunals.

For the reasons I have given, I would allow the appeal and
declare that s. 19 of the Police Act is ultra vires the
Legislature of Quebec, that Order-in-Council No. 2821-72 falls with it and that
the appellants are entitled to the relief sought by them. Since the issue of
constitutional validity was posed directly to this Court under a question
formulated by Beetz J., there is no need to remit the case to a provincial
court to make the declaration of invalid­ity and to give the consequential
relief sought by the appellants.

Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. concurred with reasons delivered
by

PIGEON J.—Di Iorio and Fontaine appeal from the judgments of the
Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirming the judgments of the Court
of Queen's Bench, Crown side, dismissing their petitions for writs of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid. The appellants had been called as
witnesses to testify before the Quebec Police Com­mission at an enquiry into
organized criminal activities. This enquiry was requested by the Lieu­tenant-Governor
in Council pursuant to s. 19 of the Police Act (S.Q. 1968, c. 17 as
amended). The

[Page 183]

appellants having refused to testify were found guilty of
contempt by the commissioners holding the enquiry namely, the mis en cause Rhéal
Brunet, Marc Cordeau and Roméo Courtemanche. They were both sentenced to one
year in jail, this being the maximum provided under art. 51 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. The principal ground on which they attack the validity of
their committal is a challenge of the Order-in-Council and of s. 19 of the Police
Act on. constitutional grounds. In fact, notice of such challenge was at
the outset given to the Attorney general of Canada and to the Attor­ney general
of Quebec.

In this Court, notice of the constitutional ques­tion was given
to all attorneys general. The Attor­ney general of Canada has intervened to
support the challenge against s. 19. The attorneys general of Ontario, New
Brunswick, British Columbia and Alberta have intervened to support the
submissions of the Attorney general of Quebec in favour of the validity of the
impugned enactment. Although several provisions other than s. 19 were attacked
by the appellants, these are only accessory enact­ments which are really
attacked only as related to s. 19. Consequently, it seems unnecessary to con­sider
those subordinate provisions. Section 19 as amended reads:

19. The Commission shall make an inquiry, whenever requested
to do so by the Lieutenant-Governor in Coun­cil, respecting any aspect of crime
which he indicates.

The Commission shall also make an inquiry into the
activities of an organization or system, its ramifications and the persons
involved, to the extent prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,
whenever he has reason to believe that in the fight against organized crime or
terrorism and subversion, it is in the public interest to order such an inquiry
to be held.

The conclusions of the Order-in-Council requesting the Commission
to make the enquiry are in the following terms:

[TRANSLATION] Upon the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

THAT in the fight against organized crime, the Quebec Police
Commission shall make an inquiry into the activities of any organisations or
systems, including

[Page 184]

their ramifications and the persons involved, where such organisations
or systems operate in illegal gaming and betting, usurious loans practices (shylocking),
extorsion, illegal trafficking in drugs and narcotics, counterfeiting,
commercial fraud, fraudulent bankruptcies, arson, fraudulent stock manipulation
or promotion, fraudulent dealings of corporations, illegal pressure on
businessmen or officers or members of associations or corporations to control
them or to extort from them money or property, theft of bonds, theft of stamps
and precious metals, theft and dismantling of automobiles, sale of stolen
goods, prostitution, illegal stills and distribution of adulterated liquor,
illegal consumers exploitation, blackmail, intimi­dation and corruption, and
illegal or fraudulent obten­tion of any permits issued by or decisions made by
any public body.

THAT the Quebec Police Commission shall submit to the
Attorney General, on or before December 31, 1975, ""the written report
setting forth the findings"" which it will have made, and that the
Commission shall be authorized to submit, in its discretion, to the Attorney
General, written reports whenever the Commission deems it appropriate.

The constitutional basis of appellants' conten­tions is that, by
s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act it is declared ""that notwithstanding
anything in this Act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Par­liament
of Canada extends to ...""

27. The Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of
Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.

The constitutional provisions relied on by the Attorney general
for Quebec and for the interven­ing provinces are heads 14 and 15 of s. 92:

14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including
the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organiza­tion of Provincial Courts, both of
Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in
those Courts.

15. The Imposition of Punishment by Fine, Penalty, or
Imprisonment for enforcing any Law of the Province made in relation to any
Matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section.

[Page 185]

It is noteworthy that the first Canadian consti­tutional case (Reg.
v. Coote[38]) heard
by the Privy Council after the enactment of the B.N.A. Act (this was
before the establishment of this Court), had reference to a Quebec statute
concerning public enquiries, The Fire Marshal's Act of 1868 (31 Vict.,
c. 32). Coote had been convicted of arson. Depositions taken of him at an
enquiry before a fire marshal had been admitted in evi­dence at his trial
although objected to. On appeal, a new trial had been ordered on the basis that
although The Fire Marshal's Act was constitution-ally valid, the
deposition had been improperly admitted in evidence because the accused had not
been cautioned that whatever he said might be given in evidence against him.
The Privy Council restored the conviction holding that depositions so taken are
admissible evidence on a subsequent trial of the witness except those to which
objection has been made by the witness as tending to criminate him. The Privy
Council explicitly approved (at p. 605) the opinion expressed by the Court of
Appeal ""that the constitution of the Court of the ""Fire Marshal""
with the powers given to it was within the competency of the provincial
legislature"". Sec­tions 3 and 4 of the statute under consideration in that
case were in the following terms:

3. Whenever any fire has occurred in such cities, whereby
any house or other building, or any property whatever therein, has been or is
exposed to be wholly or in part consumed or injured by such fire, it shall be
the duty of the fire marshal to institute an enquiry into the cause or origin
of such fire, and whether it was kindled by design or was the result of
negligence or accident, and in so far as the same is practicable, either in
person or by some competent person employed by him for that purpose.

4. The fire marshal shall ex officio possess all the
power, authority and jurisdiction of any judge of ses­sions, recorder or
coroner for all purposes connected with the said enquiry, and shall have power
to summon before him all persons whom he deems capable of giving information or
evidence touching or concerning such fire.

[Page 186]

In 1919, the British Columbia Court of Appeal had to consider the
validity of a provincial Order-in-Council passed under The Public Inquiries
Act (R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 110) directing the enquiry into the importation of
liquor prohibited by an order of the Governor general in council.
The Court was unanimous in holding the Act and the Order-in-Council valid (In
Re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement[39].
Macdonald C.J.A. said (at pp. 238-240):

... The inquiry in this respect is not I think one connected
with good government, or the conduct of public business, and must be supported,
if at all, as being connected with the administration of justice in the
Province, as that phrase is used in No. 14 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act. The
making of the criminal laws of Canada is assigned exclusively to the Dominion,
so is the regula­tion of procedure in criminal matters. ""Criminal mat­ters""
are, in my opinion, proceedings in the criminal Courts, and ""procedure""
means the steps to be taken in prosecutions or other criminal proceedings in
such Courts. The commission in question here is extra-judi­cial. The
commissioner is not a Court, and his proceedings are not proceedings in a
criminal matter, or in any matter in the legal sense of the term. Provincial
legisla­tion authorizing his appointment is therefore not in conflict with the
exclusive legislative authority assigned to the Dominion Parliament by s. 91,
No. 27 of the B.N.A. Act... .

No doubt to concede the power to the Province to make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws would appear at first blush to be
an anomaly, and it might well be argued that the powers conferred upon the
Province in respect of the administration of justice ought to be interpreted as
conferring merely the duty or obligation to put the machinery of the Courts in
motion, and to take the requisite steps to prosecute persons accused of crime.
That narrow construction would, I think, preclude what has been generally recognised
as one of the functions of government in the administration of justice, namely,
the ferreting out of crime and iden­tification of criminals. There is nothing
novel in com­pelling a witness to give evidence which may tend to incriminate
him.

[Page 187]

In 1938, in Reference re the Adoption Act[40],
Duff C.J. stating the reasons for the answers given by all the judges
who participated in the decision, said (at p. 403):

The responsibility of the state for the care of people in
distress (including neglected children and deserted wives) and for the proper
education and training of youth, rests upon the province; .. .

Moreover, while, as subject matter of legislation, the
criminal law is entrusted to the Dominion Parliament, responsibility for the
administration of justice and, broadly speaking, for the policing of the
country, the execution of the criminal law, the suppression of crime and
disorder, has from the beginning of Confederation been recognized as the
responsibility of the provinces and has been discharged at great cost to the
people; so also, the provinces, sometimes acting directly, sometimes through
the municipalities, have assumed responsibility for controlling social
conditions having a tendency to encourage vice and crime.

Ten years ago, in Batary v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan[41]
this Court had to consider the constitutional validity of a provision in
the Coro­ners’ Act of Saskatchewan purporting to compel a person charged
with murder to testify at an enqui­ry over the death of his alleged victim.
Although the statute provided that such person would, if he objected to answer,
be entitled to the protection afforded by s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , this
Court held with a single dissent that the legislation was ineffective in such
situation. The conclusions expressed by Cartwright J. (as he then was) are as
follows (at p. 478):

I think the conclusion inescapable that by enacting s. 15 in
its present form the legislature intended to change the law and to render a
person charged with murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the
body of his alleged victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed
in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare which has been described (by
Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott, 169 E.R. 909) as ""a maxim of our law
as settled, as important and as wise as almost any other in it."" This rule
has long formed part of the criminal law of England and of this country. With
great respect for the contrary view expressed in the Court of Appeal, I am of

opinion that any legislation, purporting to make the change
in the law referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph or to abrogate
or alter the existing rules which protect a person charged with crime from
being compelled to testify against himself, is legislation in relation to the
Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal Matters and so within the
exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under head 27 of s.
91 of the British North America Act.

In 1968, the courts of British Columbia were called upon to
decide whether the principle estab­lished in Batary is applicable to a
person who may be, but has not been, charged with an offence under the Criminal
Code . The reluctant witness was the driver of an automobile which collided
with pedestrians. A child was killed in the mishap. At the coroner's inquest,
it was contended that the unfortunate driver was not compellable because he was
a person who might be charged with the commission of an offence related to the
child's death. A writ of prohibition was granted by Munroe J. (R. v. Coroner
of Langley[42]). On
appeal, the writ was quashed it being held that a coroner’s court is not a
criminal court in the sense of a court administering ""the Criminal
Law"" or dealing with ""Criminal Matters"" within the mean­ing of
s. 91 (27) of the B.N.A. Act (Reg. v. McDonald[43]
)

Very recently, a similar question came before this Court in a
case where the person who refused to testify at a coroner’s inquest held under
the Coroners’ Act of Quebec was not a person charged with murder of the
deceased (Faber v. The Queen[44]). The
appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal[45]
affirming the refusal of a writ of prohibition was dismissed. In the Court of
Appeal in the present case, Montgomery J.A. noted that it is only after our
judgment in Faber was rendered that the judgments herein were pro­nounced,
saying:

[Page 189]

At the hearing before this court, it was pointed out that
our court had recently, in the case of Faber v. R., 1969 Q.B. 1017,
confirmed a decision of a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown Side)
holding that only the Superior Court had jurisdiction to restrain by writ of
prohibition proceedings before a coroner. This decision had been appealed to
the Supreme Court and was then pending. It was decided that it would be
desirable to await the decision of the Supreme Court, which was rendered on
26th March 1975. By a majority of 5 to 4, the Supreme Court confirmed the
decision of this court.

While the question is obviously not free from difficul­ty,
in view of the dissents in the Supreme Court, the fact remains that the
unanimous decision of five judges of this court, holding that only the Superior
Court has a right of supervision and control over a coroner conduct­ing an
inquest under the Coroners Act (115-16 Eliz. II c. 19), has been confirmed by
the Supreme Court. The remaining question is therefore whether there is a dis­tinction
to be made between an inquest under the Coroners Act and an inquiry under the
Police Act. It has not been suggested to us that, for the present purposes,
there is any such distinction, and I see no reason to make one.

I can see no reason for disagreeing with this conclusion. It is
clear that in Faber, as in Coote, the enquiry was essentially
directed to the purpose of finding who was the author of a crime that had been
committed. Before resuming the inquest in Faber, the coroner had earlier
stated the death to be, in his opinion, due to a crime. His open verdict dated
January 8, 1969, read:

[TRANSLATION] That, in my opinion, a crime was com­mitted,
that the facts of that crime are those described above and that an unknown
person or unknown persons should be held responsible. Recommendation to the
Police to investigate further and to file a report at the proper time.

It is at the resumption of the inquest, some two months later,
that Faber was for the last time, committed for contempt in refusing to
testify. Thereupon he applied for a writ of prohibition to the Court of Queen's
Bench, Crown side. In the reasons for the majority of this Court upholding the
denial of the writ, the following pronouncement by Bull J.A. in McDonald (at
p. 305) was quoted and adopted:

[Page 190]

I therefore conclude that the very nature of the inquiry held by
the Coroner in Canada, which is not a trial and at which there is no party or
person accused and the function of which is to investigate many other matters
than to find that murder or manslaughter has been committed, is such that this
Court cannot fairly be said to be a 'Court of Criminal Jurisdiction' whose
proce­dures before such a verdict, if any, are with respect to 'Criminal
Matters' or 'criminal law' in order to come under the exclusive authority of
Parliament.

Similarly, the following opinion expressed by McFarlane J.A. (at
p. 308) following a quotation from Wolfe v. Robinson[46]
was also quoted and endorsed:

To this apt description I would add that that at a Coroner's
inquest, under the Act, there is no lis, no accused and no charge. The
statute does not purport to confer jurisdiction to try any person accused of
any wrongful act, to acquit, convict or punish. Where the jury's verdict is
that the deceased came to his death by murder or manslaughter their inquisition
shall certify the persons (if any) guilty of the murder or man-slaughter or of
being accessories before the fact of such murder (s. 15). This is an incidental
or ancillary func­tion and does not of itself set the criminal law in motion.
Coroners are also required to hold inquests in many cases where there is no
suggestion or suspicion of wrong-doing. It may be said fairly that one of the
salutary results of inquests is to allay suspicions and remove doubts.

In my opinion the legislation in its pith and substance is
enacted in relation to the administration of justice in the Province, thus
being within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Province under head
14 of s. 92.

It must be observed that in Faber, the only question
considered in the Court of Appeal and in this Court was the jurisdiction of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Crown side. The conclusion affirmed by the majority in
this Court was that the coroner’s inquest is not ""a procedure in a
criminal matter"". This was said in a case where, after an open verdict of
death due to a crime by a person or persons unknown, the coroner resumed
the inquest for the sole purpose of ascertaining who might be

[Page 191]

charged with such crime. This could not be con­sidered incidental
only, the only reason for the continuation of the enquiry was the gathering of
evidence which would make it possible for the coroner to render a further
verdict alleging that a named person had committed murder or man-slaughter,
whereupon it would become the coron­er's duty, under s. 462  of the Criminal
Code , to direct that such person be taken into custody or enter into a
recognizance to appear before a jus­tice. If an inquest carried out with a view
to such a consequence can be said not to be a ""procedure in a criminal
matter"", it appears to me that the same must a fortiori be said of
an enquiry in conclusion of which no more can be done than the making of a
report to the provincial attorney general who may then, either have charges
laid or take the exceptional step of laying a preferred indictment.

That in many cases a coroner's inquest is not concerned with any
criminal aspect may be of some importance in considering the general character
of the office of coroner and of the procedure at inquests. It cannot, however,
be a material consideration in appreciating the nature of the conclusion
reached in Faber. What was there sub­mitted by the appellant, as by the
present appel­lants, was essentially that the matter was one coming within the
description of ""procedure in a criminal matter"" because it was an
enquiry into allegedly criminal activities. If it must be said that such an
enquiry prior to any charge being laid under the Criminal Code  comes
within the description of ""Administration of Justice in the
Province"", not of ""Procedure in a Criminal Mat-ter"", I cannot
appreciate how one may take a different view where the object of the enquiry,
instead of being the gathering of information suffi­cient to lay a charge for
criminally causing the death of a person, is the gathering of information
identifying persons engaged in organized crime and describing their activities.

Thus, although the constitutional question was not raised in Faber,
the decision rendered on

[Page 192]

forensic jurisdiction is equally conclusive on the constitutional
issue because the division of jurisdiction between the Court of Queen's Bench,
Crown side, and the Superior Court of the Prov­ince of Quebec follows the
constitutional division of authority between ""Criminal Law and Proce­dure
in Criminal Matters"" and all other matters. It is now firmly established
that extraordinary remedies by habeas corpus, certiorari and prohibi­tion
are to be classified from every jurisdictional point of view in this same way
by reference to the matter to which they relate (Minister of National
Revenue v. Lafleur[47];
In re Storgoff[48]).

In my view, the decision in Faber is conclusive against
appellants’ contention that the matter is ""criminal"" because the
enquiry was concerned with criminal activities. It is obvious that, in s.
91(27) B.N.A. Act, the scope of ""Criminal Law"" and
""Procedure in Criminal Matters"" is narrowed by the allocation to the
provinces of jurisdiction over the ""Administration of Justice"" in all
matters civil and criminal, which has consistently been held to include the
detection of criminal activities. The judgment in Batary shows that once
a charge is laid under the Criminal Code  an accused may be said to be
subject to criminal proceedings, but Faber and the other cases cited
show that a person who is merely exposed to a charge is not in the same
situation. The conclusion reached in Faber cannot be viewed as proceeding
on the basis that the detection of crime was not the principal object of the
coroner's inquest. The fact is that this was the sole object of the inquest at
the particular time when the proceedings were initiated.

Appellants contended that if they were com­pelled to testify at
the enquiry, they would not have the benefit of the protection contemplated in
the Canada Evidence Act  (R.S.C. c. E-10) because s. 2 under the heading
""PART I, Application"", reads:

[Page 193]

2. This Part applies to all criminal proceedings, and all
civil proceedings and other matters whatever respect­ing which the Parliament
of Canada has jurisdiction in this behalf.

Little need be said against this submission beyond quoting the
section granting the protection, namely, s. 5 :

5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any
question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate
him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the
instance of the Crown or of any person.

(2) Where with respect to any question a witness objects to
answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend
to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial
legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such
ques­tion, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of
such provincial Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used
or receiv­able in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for
perjury in the giving of such evidence.

It would be absurd to suppose that when Parlia­ment, in subs. 2,
made reference to the ""Act of any provincial legislature"", it
intended that those words be devoid of any application. They can be given full
meaning without doing violence to the wording of s. 2; it is only necessary to
construe it as meaning that the application of Part I is intended to control
the admissibility of evidence only in matters of federal jurisdiction.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the refer­ence to provincial
legislation in s. 5  was introduced in 1901 that is after s. 2 which dates from
1893. If there was any conflict, s. 5  would therefore govern. However, a look
at the legislation as originally enacted shows that the intention was
completely unequivocal. Section 5  as re-enacted in 1898 (61 Vict., c. 53) read:

5. No witness shall be excused from answering any question
upon the ground that the answer to such ques­tion may tend to criminate him, or
may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of
the

[Page 194]

Crown or of any person; provided, however, that if with
respect to any question the witness objects to answer upon the ground that his
answer may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for
this section the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such
ques­tion, then, although the witness shall be compelled to answer yet the
answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any
criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place
other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such evidence.

The provision making this rule applicable to the case where a
witness was compelled to answer by virtue of provincial legislation was
originally enacted as follows by c. 36 of the statutes of 1901:

1. Section 5  of The Canada Evidence Act , 1893, as
that section is enacted by chapter 53 of the statutes of 1898, is hereby
amended by adding thereto the following subsection:

2. The proviso to subsection 1 of this section shall in like
manner apply to the answer of a witness to any question which pursuant to an
enactment of the legisla­ture of a province such witness is compelled to answer
after having objected so to do upon any ground men­tioned in the said
subsection, and which, but for that enactment, he would upon such ground have
been excused from answering.

The appellants also submitted that the matter was
""criminal"" because they were sentenced to a year in jail. On this
point, it should be noted first that provincial legislatures are empowered to
inflict punishment by fine or imprisonment for violation of provincial laws,
Such punishment is unrestricted and is not ""criminal"" in the constitu­tional
sense (Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley[49]). In
the present case, the sentence was explicitly based on provincial enactments,
namely: the Order-in-Council directing the inquiry, the Police Act (Statutes
of Quebec 1968, c. 17), the Public Inquiry Commission Act (R.S.Q. 1964,
c. 11), and the Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 49-54. It is immaterial
that there are provisions in the Criminal Code  respecting criminal
contempt of court. Even if these provisions were susceptible of

[Page 195]

application, it is clear in the present case that they have not
been applied. The sentences passed against the appellants are based exclusively
on enactments of the provincial legislature and they cannot possibly be
supported by reference to Criminal Code  provisions because the tribunal
that passed those sentences does not have jurisdic­tion under the Criminal
Code .

Thus, the situation is completely unlike that which obtained in Re
Poje[50]. In
that case, civil proceedings for an injunction and other relief had been
settled and the plaintiff had agreed to aban­don its application for contempt
by violation of the injunction. It was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of British Columbia who, being a judge of a superior court of general
jurisdiction civil and criminal, decided to enquire into the contempt and to
punish the guilty parties. Under those circum­stances, this Court held that
those proceedings were to be considered as proceedings for a criminal contempt
and as purely punitive. In the present case, the proceedings before the Police
Commis­sion were not completed but continuing when the appellants were
sentenced and the appellants' com­mitment was coercive not punitive. It was
ordered under art. 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads:

51. Except where otherwise provided, anyone who is guilty of
contempt of court is liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or to
imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year.

Imprisonment for refusal to obey any process or order may be
repeatedly inflicted until the person condemned obeys.

Although this is not explicitly stated in the Code, it
appears to me that the principle enunciated by Vaughan Williams J. in Re
Armstrong[51], (cited
in Poje, at p. 518) would be applicable and the imprisonment would
determine ex debito justitiae as soon as the person committed yielded
obedience to the order of the tribunal, just as it could be

[Page 196]

inflicted again and again if the contempt was persisted in.

This does not mean that the appellants would be without redress
if the legislation was unconstitu­tional as they contend, but, because they
were committed under provincial legislation, such pro­vincial legislation, even
when it deals with the infliction of penalties by fine or imprisonment, is not
""criminal"" in the constitutional sense nor in the sense in which the
jurisdiction of courts is defined in the Criminal Code . As is established
by the judgment in Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley, the procedure in
respect of the infliction of such penalties falls within the scope of
""Procedure in Civil Matters"" before provincial courts that is to say,
within provincial jurisdiction. Assuming the provincial legislation was
constitutionally invalid because it really dealt with a criminal matter, it
would nevertheless be for the provincial court of civil jurisdiction to declare
it invalid as was held in Birks v. City of Montreal[52]
and Switzman v. Elbling[53]. A
provincial statute can never be a criminal law in the constitutional sense. If,
in fact, it deals with criminal law, it is totally void and is no law at all.
Therefore, the appellants are not restrained of their liberty for ""some
criminal or supposed criminal matter"" and their remedy by habeas corpus
is before the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec under art. 851 of
the Code of Civil Procedure:

851. Any person who is confined or otherwise restrained of
his liberty except under an order in civil matters granted by a court or a
judge having jurisdic­tion, or for some criminal or supposed criminal matter,
or any other person on his behalf, may apply to a judge of the Superior Court
to obtain a writ of habeas corpus ordering the person under whose custody he is
detained to bring him forthwith before a judge of the court and to show the
cause of his detention, so that it may be decided whether such detention is
justified.

The demand is made by motion supported by an affidavit
affirming the truth of the facts on which it is based.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 197]

Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. con­curred with reasons
delivered by

DICKSON J.—

I

This appeal, in my opinion, must be dismissed, essentially for
two reasons. First, I cannot sub-scribe to the view that administration of
criminal justice is for Parliament alone to prescribe. Section 92(14) of the British
North America Act, 1867 gives the provinces power over ""Administration
of Justice within the Province."" To confine the mean­ing of
""Justice"" to civil justice alone is to give to s. 92(14) a strained
and truncated effect at war with the plain words of the section and with what
would appear to have been the clear intent of the Fathers of Confederation.
Secondly, as to the contempt power, from earliest times coroners inquiring into
deaths occurring from other than natural causes, fire marshals inquiring into
mysterious fires and countless commissioners holding public inquiries pursuant
to federal or provincial Public Inquiries Acts have had power to summon
witnesses, to require them to give evidence on oath and to punish them for
contempt for refusal to be sworn. The Quebec Inquiry Commission into Organized
Crime has the same powers, no more and no less. There is nothing in the record
to sustain the view that in the exercise of those powers the Inquiry Commission
has acted in any way differently from coroners, fire marshals or commissioners
holding public inquiries in the past.

This case arises out of the Quebec Inquiry into Organized Crime
established in 1972 pursuant to the Police Act, S.Q. 1968, c. 17.
Section 19 of that Act requires the Quebec Police Commission to make an
inquiry, whenever requested to do so by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council,
respecting any aspect of crime. The section also makes provi­sion for an
inquiry into the activities of an organi­zation or system, its ramifications
and the persons involved, to the extent prescribed, whenever there is reason to
believe that in the fight against organized

[Page 198]

crime or terrorism and subversion it is in the public interest to
order such an inquiry.

The Inquiry was established by Order in Coun­cil No. 2821/72,
dated September 27, 1972, the relevant portions of which read:

[TRANSLATION] Upon the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:

THAT in the fight against organized crime, the Quebec Police
Commission shall make an inquiry into the activities of any organizations or
systems, including their ramifications and the persons involved, where such
organizations or systems operate in illegal gaming and betting, usurious loans
practices (shylocking), extortion, illegal trafficking in drugs and narcotics,
counterfeiting, commercial fraud, fraudulent bankruptcies, arson, fraudulent
stock manipulation or promotion, fraudulent dealings of corporations, illegal
pressure on businessmen or officers or members of associations or corporations
to control them or to extort from them money or property, theft of bonds, theft
of stamps and precious metals, theft and dismantling of automobiles, sale of
stolen goods, prostitution, illegal stills and distribution of adulterated
liquor, illegal consumers exploitation, blackmail, intimi­dation and corruption,
and illegal or fraudulent obten­tion of any permits issued by or decisions made
by any public body.

THAT the Quebec Police Commission shall submit to the
Attorney General, on or before December 31, 1975, ""the written report
setting forth the findings"" which it will have made, and that the
Commission shall be authorized to submit, in its discretion, to the Attorney
General, written reports whenever the Commission deems it appropriate.

The immediate question is whether s. 19 of the Police Act and
the Order in Council are beyond the constitutional competence of the Province
of Quebec to enact. At issue also is a question of more profound implication,
namely, whether the conduct of inquiries, unconnected with specific criminal
proceedings, into the state of public order within a province is beyond the
competence of provincial authority.

[Page 199]

In each province, the Legislature may ""exclu­sively""
make laws in relation to the ""Administra­tion of Justice in the
Province."" Section 92(14) of the British North America Act, 1867, in
part so provides. This plenary power is plainly very wide, but subtracted therefrom,
by s. 91(27), in favour of federal authority, is ""The Criminal Law, except
the Constitution of the Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the
Procedure in Criminal Matters"".

The scheme of the Act under ss. 91(27) and 92(14)
contemplates that jurisdiction over the Administration of Justice in a Province
will remain with the provinces; the provinces are invested with a plenitude of
powers in this area but subject to the reservation of criminal law and
procedure as an exception to the general principle.

Establishment of provincial superior, district or county courts
is a co-operative matter between federal and provincial authority. Section
92(14), which gives the provinces exclusive legislative power over ""The
Administration of Justice in the Province"", continues ""including the
Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil
and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those
Courts."" Section 96 provides for the appointment by the Governor General
of the Judges of the Superior, District and County Courts in each Province.
Thus procedure in criminal matters rests with the federal authority whereas,
generally speaking, procedure in civil matters in provincial courts, as well as
the constitution, maintenance and organization of these courts, falls under pro­vincial
jurisdiction.

The question in the present case is whether the words ""The
Administration of Justice in the Prov­ince"" are to be given a fair, large
and liberal construction or, whether by reason of the abstrac­tion of criminal
law and criminal procedure, they must receive such attenuated interpretation as
would confine ""administration of justice"" to noth­ing more than
""administration of civil justice"". In my opinion, Canadian
legislative history, as well as the development of legal institutions within
the Provinces since Confederation, favour the broader

[Page 200]

construction as do, by and large, the authorities, admittedly few
in number, which touch upon the subject under consideration.

II

Since Confederation, the provincial departments of the Attorney
General have in practice ""adminis­tered justice"" in the broadest
sense, at great expense to the taxpayers, and irrespective of whether the laws
being administered fell legisla­tively within the purview of provincial
legislatures or the federal Parliament. This is reflected in the provision of
police services and other enforcement agencies responsible to the provincial
Attorneys General for the investigation, detection and control of crime within
the respective provinces and in the maintenance of staffs for the prosecution
of all types of infractions whether within the purview of provincial
legislatures or the federal Parliament. In this way the provinces have
perpetuated since Confederation the comprehensive powers in the administration
of justice which they enjoyed and exercised in pre-Confederation times and
which the framers of the B.N.A. Act would seem to have intended them to
continue to have. Explaining the British North America Bill in the British
Parlia­ment, the Earl of Carnarvon stated on February 19, 1867:

To the Central Parliament will also be assigned the
enactment of criminal law. The administration of it indeed is vested in the
local authorities; but the power of general legislation is very properly
reserved for the Central Parliament.

It is a well-recognized rule of construction that if words in a
statute are fairly susceptible of two constructions of which one will result in
the statute being intra vires and the other will have the con­trary
result the former is to be adopted: McKay et al. v. The Queen[54],
at p. 804. We should not lightly decide that enabling legislation is beyond
the constitutional competence of the enacting body.

The fight against organized crime has been a responsibility of
the law enforcement agencies of the Province of Quebec. Although the tentacles
of organized crime reach far beyond provincial or

[Page 201]

even national boundaries, the Inquiry is bona fide directed
against acts done within the Province of Quebec where escalating levels of
crime and vio­lence have taken an increasing toll of lives and property.

The Inquiry by its terms is directed into the activities of
organizations and systems and to the ramifications of those organizations and
systems and the persons involved, to the extent that those organizations or
systems operate in areas notori­ously inviting to organized crime, such as
illegal gambling, extortion, shylocking, drug traffic, pros­titution and
corruption.

The Inquiry does not act as a criminal court or exercise criminal
jurisdiction. The conduct of the Inquiry is not part of a criminal prosecution
under the Criminal Code  nor is it an investigation into a particular
crime or transaction which later might be the subject of a criminal charge. We
are not here concerned with a criminal trial, structured as a dispute between
two sides, the Crown and the accused. The function of the Inquiry is merely to
investigate and report; no person is accused; those who appear do so as
witnesses; there is no lis; there is no attempt to alter criminal
procedure. The proceedings of the Commission are not criminal proceedings in
the sense that punishment is their aim. The legislation under attack
establishes an inquiry into the nature and prevalence of certain types of
illegal conduct within the Province of Quebec but does not seek to create new
crimes or to alter old ones.

III

There is nothing new in a province setting up a body to enquire
into matters connected with the public business, with the power of summoning
witnesses and compelling those witnesses to give evidence on oath and to
produce such documents as might be requisite. In the Statutes of the Prov­ince
of Canada (1846), 9 Viet., c. 38 one finds just such legislation. The striking
similarity between

[Page 202]

that Act and the legislation by which the Province of Quebec
established the Inquiry into Organized Crime warrants recital of the 1846 Act:

Whereas it frequently becomes necessary for the Executive
Government to institute inquiries on certain matters connected with the good
government of this Province; And whereas the power of procuring evidence under
oath in such cases would greatly tend to the public advantage as well as to
afford protection to Her Majesty's subjects from false and malicious testimony
or representations: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and of
the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, constituted and assembled
by virtue of and under the authority of an Act passed in the Parliament of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and intituled, An Act to
re-unite the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the Government of
Canada, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That
whenever the Gover­nor, Lieutenant Governor or person administering the
Government of this Province, acting by and with the advice of the Executive
Council thereof, shall cause injury to be made into and concerning any matter
connected with the good government of this Province, or the conduct of any part
of the public business thereof, or the administration of justice therein,
and such inquiry shall not be regulated by any special Act, it shall be lawful
for the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or person administering the Government
as aforesaid, by the Commission to confer upon the Commissioners or per-sons by
whom such inquiry is to be conducted, the power of summoning before them any
party or witnesses, and of requiring them to give evidence on oath, orally
or in writing, (or on solemn affirmation if they be parties entitled to affirm
in civil matters), and to produce such documents and things, as such
Commissioners shall deem requisite to the full investigation of the matters
into which they are appointed to examine, and the Commissioner shall then have
the same power to enforce the attendance of such witnesses and to compel
them to give evidence, as is vested in any Court of Law in civil cases; And
any wilfully false statement made by any such witness on oath or solemn
affirmation, shall be a misdemeanor punishable in the same manner as wilful and
corrupt perjury: Provided always, that no such party or witness shall be
compelled to answer any question, by his answer to which he might render
himself liable to a criminal prosecution. (Emphasis added.)

It will be noted (1) that the Inquiry for which the 1846 Act provides
is directed to ""any matter

[Page 203]

connected with the good government of this prov­ince or the
conduct of any part of the public business thereof or the administration of
justice therein."" At that epoch, the distribution of legisla­tive powers
was not an issue, but the use of the phrase ""administration of
justice"" is significant as obviously embracing much more than mere estab­lishment
of, or regulation of proceedings in, the Courts. (2) The concluding sentence of
the Act allays a concern expressed in the present case, that a compelled answer
might render the witness liable to criminal prosecution. I shall advert to this
later. I wish at the moment only to emphasize that many early statutes of
Canada dealt with Administration of Justice, in connection with both civil and
crimi­nal matters. Reference to some of these will be found in the judgment of
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Pelletier[55],
at p. 684: (1843), 7 Vict., c. 16; (1846), 9 Vict., c. 29; (1853), 16 Vict.,
c. 176; (1857), 20 Vict., c. 60; (1860), 23 Vict., c. 57.

An Act respecting Inquiries concerning Public Matters and
Official Notices, Consolidated Stat­utes of Canada, 1859, 22 Vict., c. 13,
a pre-Confederation statute, empowered the Governor in Council to make
inquiries concerning ""any matter connected with the good government of
this Prov­ince, or the conduct of any part of the public business thereof, or
the administration of justice therein"". The legislative history of The
Inquiries Act  of Canada indicates that the Governor Gener­al in Council
following Confederation continued to have the power to cause inquiries to be
made, but no longer the power to order inquiries into matters connected with
the administration of justice. During the year following Confederation, an Act
respecting Inquiries concerning Public Matters, S.C. 1868, 31 Vict., c. 38,
was enacted which empowered the Governor in Council to cause inquiry to be made
concerning ""any matters con­nected with the good government of Canada, or
the conduct of any part of the Public business thereof', the words ""or the
administration of jus­tice therein"" appearing in the earlier acts having
been dropped. The same limited phraseology is to

[Page 204]

be found in the federal Inquiries Acts of 1886, 1906, 1927, 1952
and in the present Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-13.

Before Confederation, the Provinces exercised untrammeled powers
in respect of the Administra­tion of Justice, both civil and criminal. The
preamble to the Quebec Act 1774 refers to Ordi­nances ""relative to
Civil Government and Administration of Justice in the said Province."" That
Act provided also that the criminal law of England, of course then uncodified,
would be observed as law in the Province of Quebec. Follow­ing Confederation,
criminal law and criminal procedure fell under federal power but ""justice""
continued to mean ""criminal justice"" as well as ""civil justice.""

Provincial Public Inquiries Acts since Confed­eration have
reserved to the provincial authority the power to order inquiries into matters
connected with the Administration of Justice in the Provinces and associated
therewith the power to compel wit­nesses to give evidence under oath.

If it had been the intention of the Parliament at Westminster to
confine ""administration of justice"" in s. 92(14) to establishment and
constitution of courts it would have been a simple matter to have used the
language which that Parliament had adopted two years earlier in the Colonial
Laws Validity Act (1865), 28-29 Viet., c. 63, s. 5.:

Every Colonial Legislature shall have, and be deemed at all
Times to have had, full power within its Jurisdic­tion to establish Courts of
Judicature, and to abolish and reconstruct the same, and to alter the
Constitution thereof, and to make provision for the Administration of Justice
therein . .

We would do well to compare that language with the language of s.
92(14).

The words ""administration of justice"" in s. 92(14) are
intended to have wide meaning. They include, but are not limited to, the
constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts of civil and
criminal jurisdiction and they include procedure in civil matters. Any
interpretation

[Page 205]

which would limit s. 92(14) to the setting up of the courts
ignores the plain meaning of the words in the section and the plain meaning of
the order in which those words appear as well as history and legislative
intent. The use of the word ""including"" in s. 92(14) is no more
intended to confine the ""Administration of Justice"" to ""the
constitution, maintenance and organization of the Courts"" than the use of
the same word ""including"" in s. 91(27) is intended to limit ""The
Criminal Law"" to ""procedure in criminal matters."" As Mr. Justice
Estey observed in R. v. Pelletier, supra, at p. 685, the words following
""including"" in s. 92(14) seek to amplify rather than restrict.

IV

Both the federal and provincial governments have accepted for
over a century the status of the provincial governments to administer criminal
jus­tice within their respective boundaries. The provin­cial mandate in that
field has consistently been recognized as part and parcel of the responsibility
of a provincial government for public order within the province.

Under head 92(14) of our Constitution, as I understand it, law
enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the Province and in all
provinces the Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the
Crown. He has broad responsibilities for most aspects of the Administration of
Justice. Among these within the field of criminal justice, are the court
system, the police, criminal investiga­tion and prosecutions, and corrections.
The provin­cial police are answerable only to the Attorney General as are the
provincial Crown Attorneys who conduct the great majority of criminal pros­ecutions
in Canada.

At the federal level one finds a prosecution service answerable
to the Attorney General of Canada, but s. 2  of the Criminal Code , defining
""Attorney General"", limits the authority of such service to the
Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory and to proceedings instituted at
the instance of the Government of Canada in respect of a violation of any act
or regulation of

[Page 206]

the Parliament of Canada other than the Criminal Code . Tremeear
(1964-1975 Supplement) and Crankshaw (1959-1971 Permanent
Supplement) both speak of the ""broadening"" in the role of the
Attorney General of Canada reflected in the re-enactment of this definition in 1968-69,
c. 38, s. 2(1) . It is also interesting to observe that the learned author
of Tremeear (6th ed. p. 14) refers to the position of the Attorney
General of Canada in these words:

Since the statement in R. v. St. Louis (1897), 6 Que.
Q.B. 389, 1 C.C.C. 141 by the late Mr. Justice Wurtele:

As the conduct or supervision of criminal prosecutions
before the Courts devolves upon the provincial law officers, the Attorney General
of Canada has no ministerial duties or official legal functions to perform in
that connection, and consequently, when he, with the consent of a judge or
under an order of the Court, prefers a bill of indictment, and conducts a
prosecu­tion before the petit jury in which the Government of the Dominion is
interested he occupies a position which is analogous to that of a private
prosecutor,

the Attorney General of Canada has been given explicit
status in Code ss. 54, 100, 229, 420, 601, 679, 720, 724 and 743.

It seems late in the day to strip the provinces of jurisdiction
in respect of criminal justice which they have exercised without challenge for
well over one hundred years. That is not to say that jurisdic­tion in the
strict sense can come through consent or laches; however, history and
governmental atti­tudes can be helpful guides to interpretation. As Lord Atkin
said in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. A-G. Can.[56],
at 317:

Both the Act and the section have a legislative histo­ry,
which is relevant to the discussion. Their Lordships entertain no doubt that
time alone will not validate an Act which when challenged is found to be ultra
vires; nor will a history of a gradual series of advances till this
boundary is finally crossed avail to protect the ultimate encroachment. But one
of the questions to be considered is always whether in substance the
legislation falls within an enumerated class of subject, or whether on the
contrary in the guise of an enumerated class it is an encroachment on an excluded
class. On this issue the

[Page 207]

legislative history may have evidential value. V

Implicit in the grant to the provinces of exclu­sive
legislative authority in respect of Administra­tion of Justice and in
the grant to the federal government of exclusive legislative authority in
respect of criminal law and procedure is an acceptance of a certain degree of
overlapping. One should not expect to be able to draw a fine line between the
two heads of power nor should one attempt to do so. Time and again the courts
have given effect to what was said by Duff C.J. in Reference re Validity of
the Combines Investiga­tion Act and of s. 498 of the Criminal Code[57],
at p. 413:

Matters, however, which in one aspect and for one purpose
fall within the jurisdiction of a province over the subjects designated by one
or more of the heads of s. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose,
be proper subjects of legislation under s. 91, and in particu­lar under head 27.

Thus, a matter which for some purpose may fall within the scope
of the federal power over criminal law and criminal procedure may also fall
within the legitimate concern of the provinces as pertain­ing to the
Administration of Justice. An argument has been advanced to the effect that if
a province can inquire into what is said to be criminal law, it could equally
inquire into other fields of exclusive federal jurisdiction such as banking or
postal service or penitentiaries. In these proceedings, it is unnecessary to
express any concluded view on the right of a provincial government to inquire
into some subject of local concern, other than criminal law, touching upon one
of the subjects of exclusive federal authority. It should not, however, be
over-looked that a provincial inquiry into some aspect of exclusive federal
power, such as banking, may not be on the same footing as an inquiry into some
aspect of criminal activity, for in the latter inquiry the Province has a
special source of exclusive power, administration of justice, upon which it can

[Page 208]

draw, which may not be available to it in other inquiries.

VI

The Order in Council establishing the Commis­sion of Inquiry
requires the Commission only to inquire and report to the Attorney General. The
action taken will rest with the Attorney General. It could take the form of
establishing new and differ­ent techniques or organization within the bodies
charged with law enforcement. It could take the form of prosecutions, subject
to the protection afforded witnesses by the Canada Evidence Act . Changes
to the Police Act or other provincial legislation might be required in
which the provin­cial government could act within its constitutional capacity.
A provincial commission of inquiry, inquiring into any subject, might
submit a report in which it appeared that changes in federal laws would be
desirable. There is nothing novel in this. Changes to the Criminal Code  might
seem war-ranted in which event one would expect the Attor­ney General to act in
liaison with the federal government, as is done daily. There are only two
questions to engage our attention: (1) Is the estab­lishment of the Inquiry
within the constitutional competence of the Province of Quebec? (2) Are the
constitutional rights against self-incrimination of any witness appearing
before the Inquiry infringed or likely to be infringed? The wisdom of the
Inquiry is not our concern. The novelty of the approach taken by the Province
does not affect constitutional validity and the approach taken was no doubt
considered by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec to be warranted to meet
the new and malign menace presented by organized crime.

VII

The phrase ""criminal procedure"" does not lend itself to
precise definition. In one sense, it is concerned

[Page 209]

with proceedings in the criminal courts and such matters as
conduct within the courtroom, the competency of witnesses, oaths and
affirmations, and the presentation of evidence. Some cases have defined
procedure even more narrowly in finding that it embraces the three technical
terms—plead­ing, evidence and practice. In a broad sense, it encompasses such
things as the rules by which, according to the Criminal Code , police
powers are exercised, the right to counsel, search warrants, interim release,
procuring attendance of witnesses.

The words of Mr. Justice Taschereau, as he then was, in A. G.
Que. v. A. G. Can.[58], at
p. 603 would suggest that the narrow construction is the more appropriate:

The power given to the federal Parliament to legislate in
criminal law and criminal procedure is the power to determine what shall or
what shall not be ""criminal"", and to determine the steps to be taken
in prosecutions and other criminal proceedings before the courts.""

Macdonald, C.J.A. in In re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement[59],
at p. 117 wrote to the same effect:

The making of the criminal laws of Canada is assigned
exclusively to the Dominion, so is the regula­tion of procedure in criminal
matters. ""Criminal mat­ters"" are, in my opinion, proceedings in the
criminal Courts, and ""procedure"" means the steps to be taken in
prosecutions or other criminal proceedings in such Courts.

It is not necessary and perhaps impossible, to find a
satisfactory definition of ""criminal proce­dure."" Although I would
reject the view which would confine criminal procedure to that which takes
place within the courtroom on a prosecution, I am equally of the opinion that
""criminal proce­dure"" is not co-extensive with ""criminal
justice"" or that the phrase ""criminal procedure"" as used in the B.N.A.
Act can drain from the words ""administration of justice"" in s.
92(14) that which

[Page 210]

gives those words much of their substance—the element of
""criminal justice.""

The courts have long distinguished between procedure and
substantive law, and it would be wrong to take the form for the substance.

It would also seem that a valid distinction can be made between
criminal procedure and an inqui­ry into criminal acts. What is in issue here is
an inquiry into specific matters encompassed by the term, Administration of
Justice in the Province. The Inquiry possesses purposes and functions which are
separate and distinct from the proce­dures which accompany the investigation
and pros­ecution in a criminal matter. Accepting that police investigation of
an individual must comply with federal standards of criminal procedure, it is
not immediately apparent why an investigative over-view of crime on a
collective basis should be open to constitutional attack.

It has been argued that ""Administration of Jus­tice""
relates only to administration in respect of heads of exclusive provincial
power. I cannot accept that view. The phrase ""administration of
justice"" is free standing and an independent source of provincial power
which would be shorn of mean­ing if reliance had to be placed always on some
other head of power to give it effect.

VIII

None of the cases to which the Court has been referred save In
re Public Inquiries Act: In re Clement, supra, touches directly upon the
consti­tutional question which we face. Practically all of the cases can be
distinguished for one reason or another, but several of those cited are helpful
as reflecting the opinions held by jurists in the past as to the scope of the
criminal law power or the Administration of Justice power. The first in time is
R. v. Coote[60] in
which the Privy Council held to be intra vires provincial legislation
empowering provincially appointed Fire Commissioners to compel the attendance
of witnesses, to examine

[Page 211]

witnesses under oath, and to commit to prison any witness
refusing to answer without just cause.

It has been said that the Privy Council was mistaken in stating
that all members of the Court from which the appeal was taken, the Court of
Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec, held that the constitution of the
Court of the Fire Marshal was within the competency of the provin­cial
Legislature. Even if the Board erred in this view, the important thing is that
the Board enter­tained no doubt as to the provincial competence to enact the
impugned legislation.

In one of the early cases, In re Prohibitory Liquor Laws[61],
Mr. Justice Sedgewick considered the jurisdictional basis of the right or
duty of maintaining peace and order and of seeing that law, whether of federal
or local origin, was enforced and obeyed. The learned judge is reported as
having said, at p. 248:

But it is argued that what is called ""the police
power"" is possessed by the provinces under ""municipal institu­tions"",
and that the right in question is a mere incident of the ""police
power"". Now, if by ""police power"" is meant the right or duty of
maintaining peace and order and of seeing that law, all law whether of
imperial, federal or local origin is enforced and obeyed, then I agree that
that power is wholly with the provinces. But it is with them, however, not
because it specially belongs to ""municipal institutions"" but because
they are charged with the ""administration of justice."" The
legislatures may delegate this duty to municipal functionaries, but the mode of
administration is purely a matter of provin­cial concern.

I can find little of assistance in Valin v. Langlois[62].
The issue in that case was the capacity of the federal Parliament to confer
authority on provincial Superior Courts and the judges thereof to try controverted
elections of Members of the House of Commons. In coming to the unanimous
decision that the statute was intra vires, the judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada considered inter alla the scope of s. 92(14) of the B.N.A.
Act. They

[Page 212]

were agreed that the provincial authority to legislate with
regard to the administration of justice and civil procedure did not derogate
from federal power to legislate regarding procedure in matters over which it
had exclusive legislative jurisdiction. (See Ritchie C.J. at pp. 15 & 22;
Henry J. at p. 67; Taschereau J. at p. 81). Parliament thus has the power to
legislate regarding procedure in mat­ters over which it has exclusive
jurisdiction, such as criminal law (although that power is specified in s.
91(27) regarding criminal procedure) and bankruptcy. Such a holding does not
affect the present case unless the Crime Inquiry is character­ized as a matter
of criminal law or criminal proce­dure-the very issue in controversy.

The appellants argue that ""criminal law"" must be
interpreted in its ""widest sense"" adopting those words from the decision
of the Privy Council in A.G. Ont. v. Hamilton Street Railway Company[63],
at p. 529. It would be well, however, to recall that Duff J., in Reference
re Validity of Combines Investigation Act and of s. 498 of the Criminal Code[64],
stated at p. 411 after commenting upon the Hamilton Street Railway
Company judgment:

Nevertheless, some limitation upon the general words of s.
91(27) is necessarily implied by (I) the fact itself that co-ordinate exclusive
authority in respect of a varie­ty of subjects is vested in the provincial
legislatures, and executive authority of the same order in the provincial
governments, and (2) character of the enactments of s. 92.

Reliance is also placed by appellants on a statement of Locke J.
in Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. The Queen[65],
at p. 308.

The power to legislate in relation to criminal law is not
restricted, in my opinion, to defining offences and providing penalties for
their commission. The power of Parliament extends to legislation designed for
the pre­vention of crime as well as to punishing crime.

While Locke J. does say that the federal government has powers to
prevent crime, his words must

[Page 213]

be read in context. The issue was the power to create prohibitory
orders under the Combines Investigation Act to prevent repeated
violations. The issue was not crime investigation.

The respondent and provincial intervenants can equally cite
Supreme Court authorities for provin­cial authority to legislate to prevent
crime. The provincial authority, derived from s. 92(14), over policing and the
suppression of crime, was the subject of comment by Duff C.J. in the case of Reference
re the Adoption Act[66], at
p. 403:

Moreover, while, as subject matter of legislation, the
criminal law is entrusted to the Dominion Parliament, responsibility for the
administration of justice and, broadly speaking, for the policing of the
country, the execution of the criminal law, the suppression of crime and
disorder, has from the beginning of Confederation been recognized as the
responsibility of the provinces and has been discharged at great cost to the
people; so also, the provinces, sometimes acting directly, sometimes through
the municipalities, have assumed responsibility for controlling social
conditions having a tendency to encourage vice and crime.

The next case which might be mentioned is Kalick v. The King[67],
in which one finds language supportive of the provincial position. The
issue was whether a bribe given in order to induce a police officer not to
proceed against a party for violation of The Saskatchewan Temperance Act was
given with intent to interfere with the ""administration of justice""
under s. 157  of the Criminal Code . Duff J. said at p. 182:

It seems clear that giving a bribe to prevent prosecu­tion
for an offence is prima facie an interference with the administration of
justice.

Later in the argument, after adverting to the argument that the
application of the section was limited to offenders suspected of offending the
criminal law strictly so-called, that is to say,

[Page 214]

against the criminal law as falling within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, the learned judge said:

While the word ""crime"" in the Criminal Code  gener­ally
speaking applies only to crimes strictly so-called and probably has that
restricted meaning in this section, I think there is nothing requiring us to
limit the meaning of the words administration of justice in the way suggested.

At p. 186 Brodeur J. said:

The work which the police officer was carrying out was
authorized by the law and was absolutely necessary to put the wheels of justice
in motion.

I am of opinion that the ""administration of
justice"" mentioned in section 157  of the Criminal Code  should not be
restricted to what takes place after an informa­tion had been laid; but it includes
the taking of neces­sary steps to have a person who has committed an offence
brought before the proper tribunal, and pun­ished for his offence. It is a very
wide term covering the detection, prosecution and punishment of offenders.

In Bédard v. Dawson[68], the
question was whether a Quebec statute authorizing a judge to order the closing
of a disorderly house was intra vires, the argument against validity
being that the statute dealt with criminal law by aiming at the punishment of a
crime. The Court held the statute to be intra vires the provincial
Legislature. Idington J. said, at p. 684:

... in a very wide sense it is the duty of the legislature
to do the utmost it can within its power to anticipate and remove, so far as
practicable, whatever is likely to tend to produce crime; ..

and on the same page Duff J. delivered the follow­ing brief
judgment:

The legislation impugned seems to be aimed at sup-pressing
conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the
punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the
provinces seem to be free to legislate. I think the legislation is not invalid.

The final case I would touch upon before going on to deal with
what might be termed the ""coron­er"" cases, is In re Public
Inquiries Act: In re

[Page 215]

Clement, supra, a decision of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia. Mr. Justice Clement had been appointed a Commissioner to
inquire whether intoxicating liquor had been unlawfully imported into the
Province. The appointment was made pursuant to the Public Inquiries Act, R.S.B.C.
1911, c. 110 which empowered the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to appoint a
Commissioner to inquire into matters connected with the good gov­ernment of the
Province, the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in
the Province. The Court was unanimous in upholding the appointment. Chief
Justice Macdonald, early in his judgment, said, at p. 117:

I may say, at the outset that I have no doubt his
appointment for the purpose of inquiring into breaches of the British
Columbia Prohibition Act is not open to objection, and to that extent at
least the order in council appointing him is valid; but is that valid which
directed him to inquire into breaches of the criminal law of Canada? The
inquiry in this respect is not I think one connected with good government, or
the conduct of public business, and must be supported, if at all, as being
connected with the administration of justice in the province, as that phrase is
used in No. 14 of sec. 92 of the B.N.A. Act.

Later Chief Justice Macdonald said, at p. 118:

Under its powers in respect of administration of jus­tice
when crime has been committed, the province puts the machinery of the criminal
law in motion. This undoubtedly is one branch of the administration of justice,
but the discovery of crime when it is merely suspected may, I think, also fall
into that category. Provincial peace officers are charged with that duty
amongst others. A provincial detective force might, I think, be organized under
provincial laws for the very purpose for which the commissioner was appointed.
Now, if I am right in thinking that investigations, extra-judicially, into the
commission of crime for the purpose of discovering if and by whom committed are
within the subject-matters assigned to the province under the words,
""administration of justice,"" is there anything to prevent the
province from making the inves­tigation effective by imposing on individuals an
obliga­tion to give evidence under penalty for refusal? I think not. Such a
power is not inconsistent, but consistent with the jurisdiction of the province
to legislate concerning property and civil rights.

[Page 216]

and then continued with these words, which bear cogently:

No doubt to concede the power to the province to make
investigations into breaches of Dominion laws would appear at first blush to be
an anomaly, and it might well be argued that the powers conferred upon the
province in respect of the administration of justice ought to be interpreted as
conferring merely the duty or obligation to put the machinery of the Courts in
motion, and to take the requisite steps to prosecute persons accused of crime.
That narrow construction would, I think, preclude what has been generally
recognized as one of the functions of government in the administration of
justice, namely, the ferreting out of crime and iden­tification of criminals.
There is nothing novel in com­pelling a witness to give evidence which may tend
to incriminate him. That is done in the civil Courts and is the practice in one
of the oldest criminal Courts of the realm, the coroner's inquest. With the
justice or expe­diency of inquiries into crime by an extra-judicial pro­vincial
commission I have not to concern myself. The power to appoint such rests
somewhere. It is either with the Dominion or the province, or with each, and
hence it is idle to urge as a reason against the validity of the order in
council that it is inimical to the rights of the subject.

The other members of the Court expressed them-selves in a similar
vein.

There is little enlightenment, as to the scope of provincial
legislative power under s. 92(14), to be drawn from cases dealing with the
Coroners' Acts. Neither of the Supreme Court of Canada cases, Batary v. A.G.
Sask.[69], and
Faber v. The Queen[70] deals
with the constitutionality, in general, of such legislation.

The Batary case is of assistance in the present appeal
only on the issue of compellability of wit­nesses. In that case, a majority of
the Supreme Court (Fauteux J. dissenting) held that s. 15 of the Saskatchewan Coroners'
Act, which purported to compel the appellant, charged with non-capital
murder, to testify at the inquest into the death of his alleged victim, was ultra
vires. Batary is of little use to the appellants here, for they have not
been charged with any crime. Although one might

[Page 217]

argue that the protection against self-incrimina­tion extended to
those who might be charged with a crime, this contention was rejected by
the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Re Wilson Inquest[71],
and by a majority of this Court in Faber, supra.

Faber is more helpful to this case, but it, too, is only
peripherally so. In that case, the sole issue before this Court was the
jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown side) to grant a writ of
prohibition to a coroner who had sentenced the appellant for contempt for
refusing to testify at an inquest. The hearing had been ajourned after the
coroner held that death had been caused by crime perpetrated by unknown
persons. The proceedings were resumed two months later to determine their
identity.

Although constitutionality of the Coroners’ Act of Quebec
was clearly not in issue, Mr. Justice de Grandpré did discuss the criminal
nature of the inquest so as to decide the proper court for judicial review. One
should not unquestioningly transfer comments on ""criminal law"" in
this context to criminal law in the constitutional context, although they can
be of assistance.

Mr. Justice de Grandpré (writing on behalf of a majority of the
Court), held that a coroner's inquest was not a matter of criminal law. While
an ancillary or incidental result of the inquest might be a finding that a
crime was committed and that a specified individual was responsible, this was
not the sole or primary aim of the inquest. Thus the coroner's role is not
restricted to criminal matters, but extends to broader social questions such as
the determination of general trends endangering the public interest and the
reassurance to the public that the state is concerned with the danger and doing
something about it. Broad social interests underline the establishment of the
Quebec Crime Inquiry.

[Page 218]

Mr. Justice de Grandpré also analyzed the organization of the
coroners' inquest to show that it was not a matter of criminal law. There is,
as in the present case, no accused, no lis, and no adjudi­cation of
rights or guilt. If one applies Faber to the present case, one can argue
that the Inquiry does not deal with criminal law. Again there is no lis, no
accused; the concern is the gathering of infor­mation, not adjudication. One
might seek to distin­guish Faber with the argument that the multi-pur­pose
nature of the coroners’ inquest has no counterpart in the Crime Inquiry where
the sole concern is to identify the scope and operation of organized crime.
Arguably that is a federal matter either because a province cannot inquire into
a subject of federal jurisdiction (criminal law) or because it is a colourable
attempt to legislate regarding criminal procedure but in my opinion neither of
these grounds is tenable.

The Wilson Inquest case, supra, is the only one
which deals with the constitutionality of the Coroners' Act. A majority
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal found the Act constitutional as
relating to the administration of justice, largely for the reasons enumerated
by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in Faber. The Wilson Inquest case aids
in showing that an inquiry which deals to some degree with criminal matters is
not a matter of ""criminal law.""

IX

The committal of appellants for contempt was based upon a refusal
to be sworn and to testify, not upon a refusal to answer questions for fear of
self-incrimination. Notwithstanding, concern was voiced during the appeal that
the Crime Commis­sion's powers of subpoena and imprisonment for contempt
interfered with a citizen's right to pro­tection against self-incrimination. In
my view, there is little to justify this assertion in light of the provisions
of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 5(2) and the Code
of Civil Procedure, art. 309.

[Page 219]

By s. 5(1) of the Canada Evidence Act , the common law
right of a witness to refuse to answer a question on the ground that his answer
might tend to incriminate him was abolished. Section 5(2)  was enacted to
protect the witness against the use of his statements in subsequent legal
proceedings. These sections read:

5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any
question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate
him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the
instance of the Crown or of any person.

(2) Where with respect to any question a witness objects to
answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend
to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial
legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such
ques­tion, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of
such provincial Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used
or receiv­able in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for
perjury in the giving of such evidence.

A similar provision is found in art. 309, C.C.P., which is made
applicable to the proceedings of a Commission of Inquiry. Article 309 reads:

309. A witness cannot refuse to answer for the reason that his
reply might tend to incriminate him or to expose him to a legal proceeding of
any kind; but if he objects on that ground, his reply cannot be used against
him in any penal proceedings instituted under any law of this province.

It was suggested in argument that the Canada Evidence Act  has
no effect in a provincial inquiry, as s. 2  reads:

2. This Part applies to all criminal proceedings, and to all
civil proceedings and other matters whatever respecting which the Parliament of
Canada has jurisdic­tion in this behalf.

With respect, I would disagree. The provisions in s. 5  prohibit
the use of incriminating statements

[Page 220]

by a witness in proceedings subsequent to that in which the
evidence is given. Section 2  has the effect of preventing the use of the statements
in all criminal proceedings and in all civil proceedings and other matters
subject to the legislative author­ity of the federal Parliament. The
protections pro­vided by the Act do not affect the provincial inquiry’s
operation, but subsequent proceedings.

In an exhaustive study of the subject of self-incrimination
(""Is there a Right against Self-Incrimination in Canada?"" (1973), 19 McG.L.J.
1) Professor Ed Ratushny observed, at p. 55:

The exclusion allowed by section 5(2) expressly extends to
statements made under the compulsion of provincial statutes. There are a great
number of provin­cial statutes under which witnesses may be compulsorily
examined. Although the federal government has legisla­tive jurisdiction over
Criminal Law and Procedure, under our distribution of powers, the legislatures
have exclusive jurisdiction over the Administration of Justice in their
respective provinces. As a result, the same persons are often involved in
dealing with both criminal matters and matters arising under provincial
legislation. The opportunity therefore arises for a provincial statute
authorizing the examination of witnesses, to be used to advance an
investigation with respect to a criminal offence.

The incriminating consequences to an accused of such a procedure
are obvious, even if the testimony itself cannot be used at the criminal trial.
The matter has received considerable judicial attention with respect to
coroners' inquests.

There may be some concern that a person appearing before a
commission of inquiry is not a ""witness"" in terms of s. 5 . Although
some cases have held that a party examined on discovery is not a ""witness""
for purposes of the Evidence Acts (Harrison v. The King[72]
(Alta. C.A.); Webster & Kirkness v. Solloway Mills & Co., Ltd.[73]
(Alta. C.A.); Staples v. Isaacs[74] (B.C. C.A.) ),
I would

[Page 221]

agree with Rand J. in Klein v. Bell[75],
that the word ""witness"" should be broadly interpreted. He said at
p. 317:

A witness, in a broad sense, is one who, in the course of
juridical processes, attests to matters of fact .. .

A person appearing before a provincial inquiry and testifying
under oath or on affirmation is a wit­ness, for he or she is presenting
evidence to the inquiry. Therefore, I am of the view that a person subpoenaed
by the Commission can claim the pro­tection of s. 5(2).

There has also been expressed concern that the Commission of
Inquiry instituted a new method of crime investigation—at a
""wholesale"" rather than ""retail"" level. Although a person
cannot be forced to answer police questions at common law, it is argued that
the Inquiry now forces him to do so, and so restricts common law rights.
Professor Ratushny in the article mentioned above notes (at p. 64) that there
is:

... little evidence of a general common law right against
self-incrimination operative in Canada today. Section 5 (of the Canada
Evidence Act ) has eliminated the common law privilege of witnesses to
refuse to testify in certain circumstances. It also allows the Crown to compel
the accused to assist in advancing the prosecu­tion against himself in a number
of situations.

The Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections, Toward
Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections (The Ouimet Report) commented on
this limited protection, at p. 68:

A searching examination may . . . elicit facts or clues
which enable the case to be independently proved. Thus the abolition of the
privilege of a witness to refuse to answer on the ground that his answer may
tend to incriminate him places an additional and powerful weapon in the hands
of law enforcement.

[Page 222]

Whether or not one agrees with a result which may force a person
to assist in an investigation of his criminal activity, the provisions of s. 5 
of the Canada Evidence Act  and both federal and provin­cial Inquiries
Act  compel such a result. Quebec's Crime Inquiry introduces no new and
insidious form of investigation into our judicial system and there is no
evidence before the Court that it is a colourable attempt to evade the
procedural provi­sions of the Criminal Code .

On July 22, 1975, Mr. Justice Beetz granted an order summarizing
the constitutional issue raised by the appellants in these appeals as follows:

Are Order in Council No. 2821-72 issued September 27th 1972, by
the Lieutenant-Governor in-Council for the Province of Quebec, as well as
sections 19, 21, 21a, 21-b, 21-c, 21-d, 21-e, 22, 22-b, 22-c, 22-d, 24 and 25
of the Police Act (Q.S. 1968, ch. 17 and amendments), sections 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12 and 16 of the Public Inquiry Commission Act (R.S.Q. 1964, ch. 11 and
amend­ments), and sections 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 284 of the Code of Civil Procedure
of the Province of Quebec, ultra vires or otherwise anti-constitutional
or inopera­tive?""

I would answer the question in the negative and dismiss the
appeals.

BEETZ J.—I agree in substance with Mr. Justice Pigeon and Mr.
Justice Dickson.

The purpose of s. 19 of the Police Act (Que. 1968,
c. 17 as amended) and accessory enactments is to uncover crime and organized
crime. The means are those of an inquest. They include coer­cion. Witnesses
summoned before the Police Com­mission may be examined under oath or affirma­tion
and must answer all questions put to them under pain of being found in contempt
and fined or incarcerated.

In my view, such a statute cannot be character­ized otherwise
than as a law relating to the administration of criminal justice and is within

[Page 223]

provincial legislative competence under s. 92(14) of the British
North America Act, 1867.

Before Confederation, the provinces were in charge of the
administration of justice, including criminal justice. It was contemplated by
s. 91(27) of the British North America Act, 1867, that criminal law,
substantive and procedural, would come under the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada. But subject to this provision and to the
paramountcy of federal law enacted under primary or ancillary federal
jurisdiction, the provinces were to remain responsible in principle for the
enforcement of criminal law and to retain such power as they had before with
respect to the administration of criminal justice. They continued in fact to
police their respective territories, to investigate crime, to gather and to
keep records and informations relating to crime, to prosecute criminals and to
supervise police forces, sheriffs, coroners, fire commissioners, officers of
justice, the summoning of juries, recognizances in criminal cases, and the
like. Pertaining to such functions is the power to make laws relating to public
and reformatory prisons, expressed in s. 92(6) of the Constitution. Some of
those respon­sibilities are executive in nature; but to carry them required
instrumentalities which had to be regulat­ed, financed, abolished and
reconstituted and the jurisdiction and powers of which had to be defined by
legislation. Such legislation could not have been enacted unless the power to
make laws for the administration of criminal justice was vested in the
provincial legislatures. That is why s. 92(14) of the Constitution does not
distinguish between civil and criminal justice: the natural meaning of the
expression ""the administration of justice"" is broad enough to
encompass both; indeed, it is so broad that it would have enabled the
provincial legisla­tures to make laws relating to matters covered by ss. 96 to
100 of the Constitution, were they not prevented to do so by these very
sections. That the expression ""the administration of justice"" was
understood to have the widest scope is illustrated by s. 2 of the North-West
Territories Act, 1869, 32-33 Viet., c. 3 (Can.), where it is found in
conjunction with the expression generally used to

[Page 224]

confer, in terms of subject matters, the totality of legislative
powers:

2. It shall be lawful for the Governor, by any Order or
Orders, to be by him from time to time made, with the advice of the Privy
Council (and subject to such conditions and restrictions as to him shall seem
meet), to authorize and empower such Officer as he may from time to time
appoint as Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, to make
provision for the administration of Justice therein, and generally to
make, ordain, and establish all such Laws, Institutions and Ordinances
as may be necessary for the Peace, Order and good Government of Her
Majesty's subjects and others therein; provided that all such Orders
in Council, and all Laws and Ordinances, so to be made as afore-said, shall be
laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as conveniently may be after the
making and enactment thereof respectively.

This Act was confirmed by the British North America
Act, 1871, s. 5 .

Similarly, the Quebec Act, 1774, 14 Geo. III c. 83,
repealed the Royal Proclamation, 1763, so far as it related to the Province of
Quebec, ""and all and every the Ordinance and Ordinances made by the
Governor and Council of Quebec for the Time being, relative to the Civil
Government and Administration of Justice in the said Province ..."". The
intent of this enactement was to repeal all ordinances relating to any matter
whatever.

The Quebec Act re-introduced French Law with respect to
""Property and Civil Rights"", while it decreed the continuance of the
Criminal Law of England in the following terms:

""... That the same ""(Criminal Law of
England)"" shall continue to be administered and shall be observed
as law in the province of Quebec, as well in the description and quality
of the offence as in the method of prosecution and trial; and
the punishment and forfeitures thereby inflicted to the exclusion
of every other rule of criminal law, or mode of proceeding thereon,
which did or might prevail in the said Province before the Year of our Lord One
thousand seven hundred and sixty-four; subject nevertheless to such Alterations
and Amendments as the

[Page 225]

Governor . . ., by and with the Advice and Consent of the
Legislative Council of the said Province ... shall, from time to time, cause to
be made therein ..."".

These terms are at once detailed and all-embrac­ing, one reason
for such thoroughness being to stress the abolition of judicial torture which
was possible under French law. It is significant how-ever that while the
expression ""property and civil rights"" was repeated verbatim in s.
92(13) of the Constitution, the wording of s. 91(27) in no way approaches that
used in the Quebec Act, with respect to criminal law. Should any such
language be found in s. 91(27), it would leave no doubt that the Parliament of
Canada was solely empowered to make laws for the administration of criminal
justice. But the intent was to avoid this result. That is why s. 91(27) ought
not to be construed so as to leave to the provinces no legislative jurisdic­tion
over the administration of criminal justice. The natural meaning of s. 91(27)
and the basic jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under that heading have
been most appropriately described by Taschereau J., as he then was, in A.G.
Que. v. A.G. Can.[76], at
p. 603:

""The power given to the Federal Parliament to legislate
in criminal law and criminal procedure, is the power to determine what shall or
what shall not be 'criminal', and to determine the steps to be taken in
prosecutions and other criminal proceedings before the Courts"".

Section 19 of the Police Act does not correspond to that
description.

It should be kept in mind that we are concerned in this case with
a provincial statute and with provincial jurisdiction, not with the ultimate
limits of federal jurisdiction nor with the extent to which provincial
legislation would remain operative should the Parliament of Canada decide to
enter and regulate the field of criminal investigation. Given the ancillary
powers of the Parliament of Canada and the interrelated aspects of criminal
justice, one is likely to find room for overlapping

[Page 226]

legislation in this area. In Proprietary Articles Trade
Association v. A.G. for Canada[77], the
Com­bines Investigation Act, (R.S.C. 1927, c. 26) and s. 498  of the Criminal
Code  were found intra vires of the Parliament of Canada: the main
part of the legislation was criminal law; the rest could be supported
under s. 91(3) and 91(22) of the Consti­tution. Provision was also made in the
legislation for the appointment of a registrar and of commis­sioners and for
the holding of inquiries. The Judi­cial Committee had this to say on the latter
point:

If then the legislation in question is authorized under one
or other of the heads specifically enumerated in s. 91, it is not to the
purpose to say that it affects property and civil rights in the Provinces. Most
of the specific subjects in s. 91 do affect property and civil rights but so
far as the legislation of Parliament in pith and substance is operating within
the enumerated powers there is constitutional authority to interfere with
property and civil rights. The same principle would apply to s. 92, head
14, ""the administration of justice in the Province"", even if
the legislation did, as in the present case it does not, in any way
interfere with the administration of justice. Nor is there any
ground for suggesting that the Dominion may not employ its own executive
officers for the purpose of carrying out legislation which is within its
constitutional authority, as it does regularly in the case of revenue officials
and other matters which need not be enumerated (at pp. 326, 327).

The statement that the legislation in question did not
""interfere"" with the administration of jus­tice, whatever that means,
can be considered as an obiter: the legislation would have remained
valid even if it did trench upon the provincial power over the administration
of justice, as was expressly recognized by the Judicial Committee, and wheth­er
it had been enacted under the primary or the ancillary power of the Parliament
of Canada. The result would have been identical had the Judicial Committee
endorsed the submission of Counsel for the A.G. for Canada—which in my
view presented a better approach-to the effect that:

[Page 227]

""the primary intention and effect is to make certain
acts, when they are to the public detriment, offences; the provisions as to
investigations being reasonably neces­sary for carrying out that primary
intention. If any of those provisions are not directly within s. 91 head 27,
they nevertheless are valid as being ancillary provisions to carry out the
scheme of legislation ..."". [1931] A.C. 310, at p. 314.

I do not find it necessary to express an opinion as to whether
matters such as the issuance of search warrants upon a sworn information (Part
XIII of the Criminal Code ) or compelling the appearance of an accused
person before a justice, by way of arrest or otherwise, (Part XIV of the Criminal
Code ) fall under primary or ancillary federal jurisdiction. They would
appear to be relat­ed to specific crimes, already uncovered, and to the
gathering of evidence necessary for the prosecution of such crimes rather than
to an investigation of unknown criminal acts, of criminal practices and of
crime as an organized system. If this hypothesis is correct, then those parts
of the Criminal Code  are perhaps essential elements of the criminal law,
but they differ substantially from the impugned provincial statute. If on the
other hand those enactments can be said to overflow into the field of criminal
investigation, all that need be asked is whether they conflict with the Police
Act. I see no such conflict.

We are not called upon to judge the wisdom of the impugned
legislation. There is no doubt that the power to establish a commission of
enquiry can be abused. This is true of almost any power, as has been said
repeatedly, and does not make it of federal rather than of provincial concern.
The issue whether there was abuse in the administra­tion of the Police Act does
not arise in the case at bar where the ground for contempt is the refusal by
appellants to be sworn in as witnesses and to answer questions put to them, on
the sole basis of the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute under which
the Commission was established.

The penalties imposed under the impugned legislation in cases where
witnesses refuse to testify

[Page 228]

are of a coercive nature. Even if they are punitive, s. 92(15) of
the Constitution would suf­fice to insure their constitutionality unless they
be used as a colourable device to create new crimes, or to punish old ones
otherwise than under the Criminal Code . This has been pleaded but not
established.

Of great importance in this case, is the principle against
self-incrimination. This criminal law prin­ciple would supersede provincial
law: witnesses called before the Police Commission could not be compelled to
give answers which might tend to incriminate them. This might impair the
inquest although it would not affect the constitutionality of s. 19 of the Police
Act nor improve the position of appellants: they have not declined to
answer questions which might tend to incriminate them; they have refused to
answer any question.

However, the principle against self-incrimina­tion has been
altered by s. 5 of the Canada Evi­dence Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10)
insofar as the right to be excused from answering incriminating questions has
been replaced by the inadmissibility of self-incriminating answers obtained
under legal compulsion.

I agree entirely with the reasons given by Mr. Justice Pigeon and
Mr. Justice Dickson for hold­ing that the protection contemplated by s. 5  was
available to appellants.

I would answer the constitutional question in the negative and
dismiss the appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Rape — Drunkenness as a defence — Distinction
between crimes of specific intent and crimes of general intent — Whether rape
crime of general intent — Miscarriage of justice — Criminal Code , s.
613(1) (b)(iii).

The accused, who did not give evidence or call wit­nesses
at his trial, made a voluntary statement to the police in which he confirmed
that intercourse had taken place but said that it had occurred with the complai­nant's
consent and without the use of force or threats on his part. This statement was
put in evidence at the trial. The accused now appeals on the grounds that the
trial judge erred in law in directing the jury that drunkenness was not a
defence to a charge of rape.

Held (Laskin C.J., Spence and Dickson JJ.
dissent­ing): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ.: Four points arise: 1. The distinction between crimes of
specific intent and crimes of general intent; 2. Rape as an offence of general
intent; 3. Whether there was evidence that the accused was so intoxicated that
he could not form a criminal intent; 4. Whether there was a miscarriage of
justice. With regard to the first question, the distinction as stated in this
Court in The Queen v. George, [1960] S.C.R. 871, was unanimously upheld
in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Majewski, [1976] 2 All E.R. 142.
With regard to the second question, rape is to be considered a crime of general
intent and therefore the defence of drunkenness can have no application. With
regard to the third ques­tion, there was no evidence that the appellant was
drunk to such an extent as to be incapable of forming an intention to commit
rape. With regard to the fourth question, the accused having submitted a
defence of consent, could not at the same time claim that he was too drunk to
know what he was doing. Having chosen not to raise a weak alternative defence
at his trial so as not to prejudice his main defence, the accused cannot now
claim that he ought to be given a new trial for the

[Page 30]          

purpose of making it possible for him to raise the
alternative defence.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissent­ing:
Drunkenness as such is not a defence to a charge of rape, but evidence of
drunkenness may be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether
the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the mens rea required to
constitute the crime. In order to prove rape, the Crown must prove the intention
to force intercourse and a realization by the accused that his conduct may lead
to non-consensual intercourse. It is not enough to say that because the accused
committed a physical act without the woman's consent, he must be taken to have
intended intercourse without consent. Evidence of intoxication would be
relevant in determin­ing the presence of the requisite mental element; the
state of mind of the accused being in issue, the Court should ask what was his
actual state of mind at the time of the alleged offence. The attempt to
distinguish be­tween specific intent and general intent is neither mean­ingful
nor intelligible and is, in practice, impossible to apply when mens rea is a
requisite element of a crime. If the accused was drunk, but it is proved that
he acted intentionally or recklessly, it is irrelevant that but for the
drinking he would not have done the act. But the fact that a man ingests a
substance that causes him to cast off the restraints of reason does not mean
that his conduct must be branded as reckless enough to support the crime
charged. Whether the act of drinking consti­tutes recklessness is a question of
fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case and not by application
of an irrebutable presumption against the accused. Recklessness, in the legal
sense, imports foresight and must have reference to the consequences of a
particular act. Finally, in the case at bar there was a possibility of a
miscarriage of justice since a properly charged jury might have cause for reasonable
doubt that the accused had the necessary mens rea.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia[1],
dismissing appel­lant’s appeal from his conviction for rape. Appeal dismissed,
Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson J.J. dissenting.

K. S. Fawcus, for the appellant.

G. S. Cumming, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The appellant, Allan Henry Patrick
Leary, was convicted of rape before Meredith J. and a jury at the City of
Nelson in British Columbia. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia was dismissed and he has now appealed, by leave, to this Court on the
following question of law: ""That the learned trial judge erred in law in
directing the jury that drunk­enness was not a defence to a charge of
rape.""

I

The complainant testified that Leary, in a drun­ken condition,
forced her at knife point to submit to coition and other acts of sexual
humiliation. The defence was consent. After instructing the jury that the only
issue was whether or not the complai­nant had consented to sexual intercourse,
Mr.

[Page 32]

Justice Meredith said: ""I should add too at this point,
drunkenness is not a defence to a charge of this sort."" The issue in this
appeal is whether that is a correct statement of law.

The issue presented is an important one, requir­ing consideration
of basic criminal law principles of mens rea, and elaboration of the
defence of drunkenness in relation to criminal responsibility. One might have
thought that the effect of drunk­enness upon legal responsibility would have
been well settled by now but despite the legal scholar-ship and copious amount
of literature devoted to the subject, many underlying problems remain
unresolved and the subject of controversy. The confusion and uncertainty which
prevails is attributable, no doubt, in part to (a) the use throughout the
cases, and in the legal literature generally, of two chameleon-like phrases, mens
rea and ""specific intent,"" each with several distinct meanings
(see Smith & Hogan Criminal Law, 3rd. ed. p. 47); (b) the impact of
the proposition that drunkenness is no excuse for crime upon the fun­damental
principle that, generally speaking, guilt depends upon proof by the Crown that
the accused intended to do the acts with which he is charged, an intention
which may be entirely lacking in a state of advanced drunkenness; (c) failure
to dis­tinguish between (i) the effect of drunkenness on capacity to form the
requisite intent and (ii) intent in fact.

II

The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Vandervoort[2]
held that drunkenness constitutes a valid defence to crimes in which
specific intent is an essential ingredient and that rape is a crime of specific
intent. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Boucher[3]
refused to follow the Vandervoort decision and held that rape was a
crime of general intent only and, therefore, drunkenness

[Page 33]

could not validly be pleaded in defence. In the present
proceedings the Court of Appeal for British Columbia relied upon its earlier
decision in Boucher in dismissing the appeal. There would seem to be
good reason not to perpetuate the jural conflict between two appellate Courts,
as a result of which a person accused of rape in Ontario has the
""defence"" of drunkenness open to him, but not if the charge is laid
in British Columbia.

Although the expression ""defence of drunken­ness"" is
often used, more precisely the defence is that the accused, by reason of
drunkenness, lacked the capacity to form the requisite intent or lacked the
intent in fact or that he had a positive though mistaken belief in consent.

III

I would answer the question of law posed in this appeal in this
manner—drunkenness, as such, is not a defence to a charge of rape but evidence
of drunkenness may be considered by the jury, to­gether with all other relevant
evidence, in deter-mining whether the prosecution has proved beyond a
reasonable doubt the mens rea required to con­stitute the crime.

 

IV

There are certain quasi-criminal strict liability offences—as affecting
public health or safety—where an absolute offence is created and a person may
be subjected to punishment even though he had no intention of contravening the
law. Duress, provocation, and mental abnormality also bear upon criminal
responsibility. In what follows, I should like to leave all of these matters
aside and consider basic principles as to which there can surely be little
question or cavil. The first of these is the presumption that mens rea is an
essential ingredient in every offence. This principle was enunciated by Wright
J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen[4] and
has since been repeated in countless cases. The concept of mens rea, that
the prohibited act must be accompanied by a certain mental element, has been
authoritatively established by this Court in

[Page 34]

such cases as The Queen v. Rees[5];
Beaver v. The Queen[6]; and
The Queen v. King[7]. In
the most recent of these decisions, Taschereau J., as he then was, said at
749:

It is my view that there can be no actus reus unless it
is the result of a willing mind at liberty to make a definite choice or
decision . .

The notion that a court should not find a person guilty of an
offence against the criminal law unless he has a blameworthy state of mind is
common to all civilized penal systems. It is founded upon respect for the
person and for the freedom of human will. A person is accountable for what he
wills. When, in the exercise of the power of free choice, a member of society
chooses to engage in harmful or otherwise undesirable conduct pros­cribed by
the criminal law, he must accept the sanctions which that law has provided for
the purpose of discouraging such conduct. Justice demands no less. But, to be
criminal, the wrong-doing must have been consciously committed. To subject the
offender to punishment, a mental ele­ment as well as a physical element is an
essential concomitant of the crime. The mental state basic to criminal
liability consists in most crimes in either (a) an intention to cause the actus
reus of the crime, i.e. an intention to do the act which constitutes
the crime in question, or (b) foresight or realization on the part of the
person that his conduct will probably cause or may cause the actus reus, together
with assumption of or indiffer­ence to a risk, which in all of the
circumstances is substantial or unjustifiable. This latter mental ele­ment is
sometimes characterized as recklessness.

The burden of proving all of the elements in the definition of
the crime charged, including the mental element, is always upon the Crown. The
presence or absence of evidence of intoxication in no way affects that burden.

The nature of the mental element varies with the definition of
the crime and it may be expressly

[Page 35]

spelled out in the definition, or it may be implied. By
definition, a male person commits rape when he has sexual intercourse with a
female person without her consent. That is the actus reus of the crime.
Parliament, as is often the case, has left unexpressed the mental element but
it would seem clear that in order to constitute the crime the Crown must prove,
beyond reasonable doubt, intercourse without consent, together with (a) an
intention to force intercourse notwithstanding absence of consent, or (b) a
realization that the conduct may lead to non-consensual intercourse and a
recklessness or indifference to that conse­quence ensuing. It will not do
simply to say that because the accused committed the physical act and the woman
did not consent, he must be taken to have intended to have intercourse without
consent.

 

Parenthetically, when the risk is substantial and unjustifiable,
proof of recklessness necessary to constitute the mental element essential to
criminal responsibility may be readily satisfied. This is exemplified in the
crime of rape. The harm to be anticipated from acting upon the mistaken belief
that the woman is consenting is very great whereas that which may be lost in
failing to act is slight. The risk then is both substantial and unjustifiable.
The conscious creation of risk in these circum­stances in acting with
indifference to the possibili­ty of non-consent is compatible with recklessness
constituting mens rea.

 

On principle, it would seem that evidence of intoxication should
be relevant in determining the presence of the requisite mental element,
inasmuch as intoxication undoubtedly affects a person's abil­ity to appreciate
the possible consequences or cir­cumstances. Consumption of alcohol affects
mental state. The state of mind of the accused being in issue it would seem
reasonable to ask—what was his actual state of mind at the time? If the
evidence in the case discloses some degree of intoxication, one might think,
consistent with fun­damental principles of criminal responsibility, that such
evidence would be relevant to any consider­ation of the mental state of the
alleged offender.

[Page 36]

But such, it is said, is not the case. The argument, of course,
is that Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[8]
drew a distinction between crimes of specific intent and those of general
intent; that rape is a crime of general intent only and therefore drunkenness is
no defence. This Court decided in McAskill v. The King[9]
and repeated in Perrault v. The Queen[10] that
the rules of law for determining the validity of a defence of drunkenness to a
charge of murder were as stated in Lord Birken­head's second and third propositions
in Beard's case.

V

In earliest times, the settled rule in England was that voluntary
drunkenness would not excuse the commission of any crime. This law is found in Reniger
v. Fogossa[11], argued
in 1551 (see also Beverley's Case[12].
The principle that no one should be privileged to escape culpability for
crime com­mitted while in a state of self-induced intoxication is found in the
writings of Coke (1 Inst. 247a), Blackstone (4 Commentaries 26) Hawkins
(1 P.C. c. 1, s. 6) and Hale (1 Hale 31).

In the nineteenth century, the old rule was gradually relaxed by
judicial decisions (see R. U. Singh, ""History of Drunkenness in English
Crimi­nal Law"" (1933), 49 L.Q. R. 528 at p. 536). In R. v. Grindley[13],
Holyroyd J. held that the fact of a person being intoxicated could be taken
into account where on a charge such as a murder the material question was
whether the act was pre-meditated. This view was later rejected by Park J. in R.
v. Carroll[14].

In Regina v. Monkhouse[15], counsel
for the

[Page 37]

defence cited Regina v. Cruse[16],
in which the accused was charged with attempt to murder a child and Patteson
J. had instructed the jury to this effect:

... you must be satisfied that when he inflicted the
violence he had in mind a positive intention of murder­ing that child. Even if
he did it under circumstances which would have amounted to murder if death had
ensued, that will not be sufficient, unless he actually intended to commit
murder ... It appears that both these persons were drunk, and although
drunkenness is no excuse for any crime whatever, yet it is often of very great
importance in cases where it is a question of intention. A person may be so
drunk as to be utterly unable to form any intention at all, and yet he may be
guilty of a very great violence.

 

Coleridge J. in Monkhouse said that he agreed with the
substance of what Patteson J. was reported to have said in Cruse's case, but he
expressed himself as not so clear as to the propriety of adopting the very
words. Coleridge J. went on to say, at 56:

Drunkenness is ordinarily neither a defence nor excuse for
crime, and where it is available as a partial answer to a charge, it rests on
the prisoner to prove it, and it is not enough that he was excited or rendered
more irritable, unless the intoxication was such as to prevent his restraining
himself from committing the act in question, or to take away from him the power
of forming any specific intention.

The direction is of interest in that it recognizes drunkenness as
a ""partial answer to a charge and the phrase ""specific
intention,"" source of such confusion since Beard, was used for the
first time in a jury charge. There is nothing to suggest that the phrase was
there used in any technical sense, or as a term of art in contrast to basic or
general intent,

In R. v. Moore[17], the
prisoner was indicted for a misdemeanor in attempting to commit suicide when
after a violent quarrel with her husband she threw herself into a garden well,
thirty-eight feet deep. Fortunately, assistance was at hand and she

[Page 38]

was rescued, we are told, without much injury. The witness who
proved these facts also stated that at the time the prisoner was so drunk as
not to know what she was about. Jervis C.J. charged the jury in these words:

If the prisoner was so drunk as not to know what she was
about, how can you say that she intended to destroy herself?

In R. v. Doherty[18]', a
case of murder, tried in 1887, Stephen J. instructed the jury that the gen­eral
rule as to intention was that a man intends the natural consequences of his
acts but that this was not a necessary inference and in drawing it one had to
consider whether the prisoner was drunk or sober. He continued, at p. 308:

It is almost trivial for me to observe that a man is not
excused from crime by reason of his drunkenness. If it were so, you might as
well at once shut up the criminal courts, because drink is the occasion of a
large propor­tion of the crime which is committed; but, although you cannot
take drunkenness as any excuse for crime, yet when the crime is such that the
intention of the party committing it is one of its constituent elements, you
may look at the fact that a man was in drink in considering whether he formed
the intention necessary to constitute the crime.

The only other major case pre-Beard is R. v. Meade[19].
This was an appeal by a prisoner against conviction on a charge of
murder. Darling J., on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal, set forth the
following rule for determining whether the jury would be justified in returning
a verdict of man-slaughter on the ground of the voluntary drunken­ness of the
accused:

A man is taken to intend the natural consequences of his
acts. This presumption may be rebutted—(1.) in the case of a sober man, in many
ways: (2.) it may also be rebutted in the case of a man who is drunk, by shewing
his mind to have been so affected by the drink he had taken that he was
incapable of knowing that what he was doing was dangerous, i.e., likely to
inflict serious injury. If this be proved, the presumption that he intended to
do grievous bodily harm is rebutted.

[Page 39]

Coming then to Beard’s case: After reviewing at some
length the earlier cases, Lord Birkenhead L.C. listed under three heads the
conclusions which he considered could be drawn therefrom:

1. That insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or
otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged. The dis­tinction between the
defence of insanity in the true sense caused by excessive drinking, and the
defence of drunk­enness which produces a condition such that the drunk-en man's
mind becomes incapable of forming a specific intention, has been preserved
throughout the cases. The insane person cannot be convicted of a crime: Felstead
v. The King [1914] A.C. 534; but, upon a verdict of insanity, is
ordered to be detained during His Majesty's pleasure. The law takes no note of
the cause of the insanity. If actual insanity in fact supervenes, as the result
of alcoholic excess, it furnishes as complete an answer to a criminal charge as
insanity induced by any other cause.

 

2. That evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused
incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime
should be taken into consider­ation with the other facts proved in order to
determine whether or not he had this intent.

3. That evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved
incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime,
and merely establish­ing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more
readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a
man intends the natural conse­quences of his acts.

The third head has undergone change. Since Woolmington v.
D.P.P.[20]. proof
of incapacity has not rested upon the accused, and since Hosegood v. Hosegood[21]
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his
acts is now regarded as a proposition of good sense rather than a proposition
of law.

 

VI

It is the second head of Beard which particular­ly
concerns us. The notion that drunkenness might negative an intent integral to a
more serious

[Page 40]

charge, such as murder, and permit conviction of a lesser charge,
such as manslaughter, of which the intent was not a constituent element, was
con­ceived in response to humanitarian urgings which sought to distinguish
between the homicide com­mitted in cold blood by a sober person and one
committed by a drunken person. Capital punishment or deportation was considered
on occasion to be unduly severe treatment for the inebriated offender. Although
the motivation was under­standable and the legal mechanism by which the graver
offence could be read down to the lesser offence seemed soundly conceived, the
irrational ""specific intent—basic intent"" dichotomy has pre­sented
difficulty ever since, for there are not, and have never been, any legally adequate
criteria for distinguishing the one group of crimes from the other. Indeed, the
question is often asked as to whether Lord Birkenhead intended any such
dichotomy. Certain well-known dicta found later in the judgment would
suggest the contrary, and leave the answer to the question far from clear. The dicta
have been thought by some to accept the principle that drunkenness may
negative mens rea in any and every crime.

The words used by Lord Birkenhead were these, at p. 504: ""I
do not think that the proposition of law deduced from these earlier cases is an
excep­tional rule applicable only to cases in which it is necessary to prove a
specific intent in order to constitute the graver crime .. It is true that in
such cases the specific intent must be proved to constitute the particular
crime, but this is, on ultimate analysis, only in accordance with the ordinary
law applicable to crime, for, speaking generally (and apart from certain
special offences) a person cannot be convicted of a crime unless the mens was rea.""

Great difficulty has been experienced by the Courts in seeking to
clarify what is meant by the phrase crimes of specific intent."" This is
under­standable for a person may have an intent which is specific but how does
one identify a ""specific intent"" as distinguished from a ""basic
intent"" or ""general intent"" or ""ulterior intent."" The
phrase

[Page 41]

""specific intent"" is not a concept known to psy­chology.
The expression is not contained in the Criminal Code . How a juryman can
be expected to recognize such an elusive cerebration in the mind of an accused
is obscure. The attempts made to distinguish, in the cases, between so-called
""specif­ic intent"" crimes and ""general intent"" crimes serve
only to confirm the difficulty of the task. It has been said that such words as
""with intent to,"" ""for a fraudulent purpose,""
""corruptly,"" ""wilfully"" [sic], ""knowingly,"" and
the like, contained in the defini­tion of the charge, identify crimes of
specific intent. Why this should be so is not self-evident as there is no
specificity to such words as ""intentionally"" or
""knowingly."" And it is conceded that the definition of the crime is
not exhaustive, as a specific intention may sometimes be embodied by
implication. None of this is very helpful to judge or jury, as many
distinguished scholars have taken pains to point out. It is understandable that
aca­demic discussion should have focused primarily upon the illogicality of
distinguishing between crimes of so-called specific intent from those of
general intent, with heavy emphasis upon the vio­lence said to be done to
fundamental principles of criminal law in attributing to an accused person a
mental state and an intent, which by reason of drunkenness, ex hypothesi he
does not have. The argument is made that if a person is so drunk as to be
incapable of forming the intent required, or in fact lacked that intent, he
should not be convicted of a crime which is committed only if that intent be
present and proven. The argument is com­pelling.

Consider the position of the jury. The members of the jury will
have heard all of the evidence as to drunkenness and are then, in effect, told
to excise it from their minds. The result is that either (a) the Crown, because
the accused was intoxicated, is relieved of the burden of proving a requisite
mental state which would have had to be proven if the accused had been sober,
(placing the intoxicat­ed offender in a worse position than the sober offender—the
antithesis of the policy sought to be implemented by the nineteenth century
jurists), or (b) in the alternative, the jury is required to examine the mental
state of the accused, notionally

[Page 42]

absent the alcohol, an impossible task and, in the case of a
general intent crime and a very drunk man, to find a fictional non-existing
mental state as an ingredient of guilt. The jury is expected to consider only
that part of the behaviour which had its genesis in considerations other than
drunken­ness. All of this suggests that the distinction sought to be made
between specific intent and general intent is neither meaningful nor intel­ligible.

VII

There seems little reason for retaining in the criminal law—which
should be characterized by clarity, simplicity, and certainty—a concept as
difficult of comprehension and application as ""spe­cific intention"".
If ""with intent"" crimes are regarded as crimes of specific intent, it
is apparent that many of these are as grave or graver crimes than those of
so-called basic intent, such as common assault; drunkenness can absolve in
respect of the graver crimes, yet not in respect of the lesser. Intent in
respect of robbery can be negatived by drink but not the intent for rape or
assault. Another incongruity lies in the fact that crimes of specific intent
are also crimes of basic or general intent.

 

In R. v. George[22], this
Court added a gloss to Beard. The Court of Appeal for Ontario in R.
v. Vandervoort, supra, had regard to these two authorities in reaching the
conclusion that rape was a crime of specific intent. Upon the same authorities
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in R. v. Boucher, supra, concluded
that rape was not a crime of specific intent and thus, drunkenness was no
defence. This diversity reflects the difficulty in the practical application of
Beard. The judgments in George appear to recognize the
possibility of drunkenness negating general intent if a person were so drunk
that he had no knowl­edge of what he was doing and, on principle, there is no
reason why intoxication should not negative

[Page 43]

mens rea in crimes of basic or general intent.

Whatever utility the concept of ""specific intent"" may
have had in the past, it is very doubtful whether any good purpose is served by
its reten­tion, having regard to the difficulties to which I have referred and,
since Beard, to the greater knowledge of the nature of intoxication and
alcoholism and the increasing emphasis on mental state as an element of
criminal responsibility. Society and the law have moved away from the primitive
response of punishment for the actus reus alone. The doctrine of mens
rea has increas­ingly emerged as an essential element of criminal
accountability. The effect of the second proposi­tion in Beard's case is
to hold the accused to account, not for his self-induced drunkenness, but for
whatever harm he may have done, without intending to do so, while in that
state. There is much to be said for the view that drunkenness should not be
regarded as standing alone but rather as possibly contributing to some
condition inconsistent with criminal responsibility. Thus, insanity caused by
excessive drinking affords an answer to a criminal charge but it is the
insanity to which attention is directed and the cause of the insanity is
irrelevant. The law has always distin­guished intoxication, however gross, from
insanity, permanent or temporary, induced by intoxication; psychiatry draws no
such distinction.

VIII

When an accused, in answer to a criminal charge, says that he was
so sodden as to be virtual­ly an automaton, incapable of knowing what he was
about, his defence is not drunkenness but an absence of voluntariness caused by
excessive drink­ing. The question then is whether the act was voluntary.
Likewise, when the offence with which he is charged includes a mental element
which must be established by the Crown, such as inten­tion or recklessness, it
should be open to an accused to contend that upon all of the evidence the Crown
has failed to establish the requisite mental element. The law should take no
note of the inducing cause which led to the incapacity or

[Page 44]

lack of intent. On the other hand, it is generally recognized
that the usual effect of drinking is merely to remove self-restraints and
inhibitions and induce a sense of self-confidence and, perhaps, aggressiveness.
If the accused was drunk at the time of the alleged offence but it is proved
that he did the act intentionally or recklessly, it is irrele­vant that but for
the drinking he would never have done the act. The intent or recklessness,
constitut­ing the necessary mental element, is present and the fact that, by reason
of drink, his judgment and control relaxed so that he more readily gave way to
his instinctual drives, avails him nothing.

 

I return then to the charge facing the present appellant, that of
rape. Cases where a man will have had intercourse without intending to do so
must be rare; cases where an accused, notwith­standing resistance on the part
of the woman, is under a drink-induced mistaken belief that the woman has
consented must be rarer. Speaking generally, rape is committed by persons who
intend to have intercourse with a woman knowing she has not consented, or who
are indifferent to her wishes. Intent is present. What is lacking is control.
This extends to the grossly intoxicated. Rape cannot be committed by accident.
Inter-course is an act normally consented to and if there is little or no
obvious resistance, ""half-won argu­ments of couples in parked cars,""
there would seem to be no principle precluding a defence of belief in consent,
though mistaken, and though alcohol be a contributing factor. Drunkenness is
simply a piece of evidence relevant to the determi­nation of the presence of
the requisite mental element. Drunkenness will not assist in exculpating an
accused if he got drunk in order to get courage to commit the crime or to aid
in his defence.

The present law is an uneasy and, if I may venture to say so, an
indefensible compromise between two other positions which might be taken. The
first, that drunkenness can never excuse; the second, that drunkenness can
excuse in all crimes except those of strict liability. The compromise was
adopted for the reason I have mentioned, to

[Page 45]

permit a reading down in cases of murder or other violent crime,
but it can only be justified at present on historical grounds.

 

IX

It is sometimes said that public policy demands retention of the
""specific intent"" concept no matter how illogical or difficult of
application that concept may be; see Director of Public Prosecu­tions v. Majewski[23],
at pp. 167-8. The point is made that a basic function of the criminal law
is protection of the public from unprovoked violence and that to depart from
the rule in Beard's case would leave no protection where such violence
is consequent upon the taking of drink or drugs; (id. at p. 152). I have
grave doubt that the rule in Beard deters or is capable of deterring the
intox­icated offender. Such an offender only has an excuse if he acted in
circumstances where he was incapable of forming an intent, or without an intent
in fact. Certainly when that state is reached, no prohibitive rule could deter.
But it is said (Austin, Jurisprudence, 5th ed. vol. I p. 496), that such
a state is voluntarily reached by an accused only at his peril, and that he
will be presumed to have intended any actus reus he commits as the
result of voluntary intoxication. Austin’s point is that voluntarily ingesting
an alcoholic substance to the point where one is incapacitated to form an
intent is recklessness sufficient to support a finding of mens rea. The
same point is made by Lord Elwyn-Jones L.C. and by Lord Russell in Majew­ski’s
case at pp. 151 and 171.

With great respect for those of another view, I think it is wrong
to say that merely because a man voluntarily ingests a substance which causes
him to cast off the restraints of reason, such conduct must inevitably be
branded as reckless enough to support the crime charged, whatever that crime
may be. There will be circumstances, no doubt, in which such will be the case.
A good example is Attorney General for Northern Ireland v.

[Page 46]

Gallagher[24], at
p. 382, where Lord Denning observed that a man may not form an intention and
voluntarily, by drink, obliterate his will in order to give himself the Dutch
courage to act in furtherance of that intention. But it is equally true that
there are circumstances where the ingestion of drugs or drink is not reckless
in the relevant sense. An example would be an inexperienced youth drinking with
older companions at their instigation for the first time. Such an offender, who
finds himself having committed a criminal actus reus while incapable of
forming any intent, highlights the artificiality and possible injustice of
presuming intention from the act of ingestion. This becomes clear when one
considers that drinking, as such, is not prohibited nor socially stigmatized in
contem­porary Canadian society. It may well be that an accused knows, or ought
to have known, that drink or drugs makes him prone to certain kinds of conduct.
A man who becomes violent when drunk, or a drug-taker who has reason to believe
he will obliterate his will and hence become a danger to others may be reckless
in the relevant sense. That is a question of fact to be determined in the
circumstances of each particular case and not by the application of what is, in
effect, an irrebuttable presumption against an accused.

Recklessness in a legal sense imports foresight. Recklessness
cannot exist in the air; it must have reference to the consequences of a
particular act. In the circumstances of a particular case, the ingestion of
alcohol may be sufficiently connected to the consequences as to constitute
recklessness in a legal sense with respect to the occurrence of the prohibited
act. But to say that everyone who gets drunk is thereby reckless and therefore
account-able is to use the word ""reckless"" in a non-legal sense and,
in effect, in the case of an intoxicated offender, to convert any crime into
one of absolute or strict liability.

If sanctions against drinking to excess be thought necessary
then, in my view, they ought to

[Page 47]

be introduced by legislation—as in a crime of being drunk and
dangerous—and not by the adop­tion of a legal fiction which cuts across
fundamen­tal criminal law precepts and has the effect of making the law both
uncertain and inconstant. If the point is deterrence from drink then such deter­rence
ought to be specific and precise, in the form of a legislative command.

X

For the reasons which I have sought to express, I have concluded
that it is no longer necessary nor desirable to maintain the fiction of
""specific intent"" and ""general intent"" crimes. From the
acts and statements of the accused and all of the other evidence adduced, the
jury should be entitled to draw inferences as to the mental state of the
accused. The concern is with the mental state of the accused in fact, and not
merely his capacity to have the necessary mental state. Intoxication is one
factor which, with all of the other attendant circumstances, should be taken
into account in determining the presence or absence of the requi­site mental
element. If that element is absent, the fact that it was absent due to
intoxication is no more relevant than the fact of intoxication giving rise to a
state of insanity. The jury should be instructed that it is open to them to
convict if they find that the accused intended to force intercourse
notwithstanding absence of consent, or that he was reckless, in the sense I
have indicated, as to wheth­er she consented or not. If the necessary intent or
recklessness is there, the fact that he acted in a way in which he would not have
acted had he been sober does not assist him at all (see R. v. Sheehan[25],
at p. 312). The jury should also be instructed that if they are not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the intent or
recklessness required by law, he should be acquitted. In deciding this
question, they should have regard to all of the evidence including the ages and
background of the accused and the woman, the time and place and circumstances
of the encounter, the conduct and statements at the time and following the
event, the sobriety of each,

[Page 48]

and should draw such inferences therefrom as appear proper in the
circumstances. In the case of an intoxicated or drugged accused, the jury may
have little difficulty in drawing an inference of intent or recklessness in the
relevant sense, but that remains an issue of fact for the jury to determine in
each particular case.

In my opinion, it was wrong for the trial judge in the present
case to withdraw from the jury any consideration of drunkenness. Such evidence
was open for consideration by the jury, as going not to defence but to the
establishment by the Crown of the mental element requisite to a finding of
guilt.

The question remains as to whether the curative provision of s.
613 (1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should be applied. The appellant’s
degree of intoxi­cation would not appear to have been excessive but there can
be no doubt, as Mr. Justice Bull of the Court of Appeal observed, that he was
intoxicated. The complainant testified that he was ""pretty drunk"" and
midway through the acts alleged ""started to fall asleep."" The degree
of drunkenness and its effect upon the mental state of the accused is a
question of fact, determination of which rests with the jury. I am unable to
say that a properly charged jury could have no reasonable doubt that the
accused, at the critical time, had the mental element essential to culpability.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the convinction [sic]
and direct a new trial.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.-At a jury trial the appellant was convicted of rape and
his appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was dismissed unani­mously.
This appeal is by leave of this Court on the following question of law:

That the learned trial judge erred in law in directing the
jury that drunkenness was not a defence to a charge of rape.

[Page 49]

The course of the trial was summarized as follows by Bull J.A.:

It was common ground at the trial, and the jury was properly
so told, that the only real issue was whether or not the sexual intercourse
that admittedly took place was with or without the consent of the complainant,
and whether or not any consent was extorted by threats of fear of bodily harm.
The complainant testified that the coition took place against her will and
objections and only after and because the appellant had threatened her with
bodily harm with a knife. The appellant did not give evidence nor call
witnesses. However, he made a voluntary statement to the police on the Monday,
March 18, 1974, in which he confirmed generally the complai­nant’s recital of
the events which led up to the inter-course, but said that it took place with
her consent and no knife or threats were used. Hence the principal task for the
jury was to determine whether to accept or reject the sworn evidence of the
complainant in the light of the appellant's unsworn allegation of consent and
his denial of force or compulsion.

On the matter of drunkenness, the learned trial judge included in
his charge to the jury this one sentence:

""I should add too at this point, drunkenness is no
defence to a charge of this sort.""

The Court of Appeal considered itself bound by its previous
judgment in Regina v. Boucher[26],
although noting that the view taken in the courts of Ontario seems to be
different (Regina v. Vandervoort[27];
Regina v. Schmidt & Gole)[28].

As it is clearly desirable to settle this conflict of opinion, I
will deal with the points arising out of the main question in the following
order:

1. The distinction between crimes of specific intent and offences
of general or basic intent;

2. Rape as an offence of general intent;

3. Whether there was evidence that the accused was so intoxicated
that he could not form a crimi­nal intent;

4. Whether there was a miscarriage of justice.

[Page 50]

In The Queen v. George[29], Fauteux
J. (as he then was) said (at p. 877):

In considering the question of mens rea, a
distinction is to be made between (i) intention as applied to acts considered
in relation to their purposes and (ii) intention as applied to acts considered
apart from their purposes. A general intent attending the commission of an act
is, in some cases, the only intent required to constitute the crime while, in
others, there must be, in addition to that general intent, a specific intent
attending the purpose for the commission of the act.

Ritchie J. adopted the following passage from Kenny’s Outlines
of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 58, para. 42 (at p. 891):

... in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920]
A.C. 479 ... it was laid down that evidence of such drunkenness as
""renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent, essential
to constitute the crime, should be taken into consideration, with the other
facts proved, in order to determine whether or not he had this intent"". In
such a case the drunkenness, if it negatives the existence of the indispensable
mental ele­ment of the crime ""negatives the commission of that
crime"". Thus a drunken man's inability to form an intention to kill, or to
do grievous bodily harm involving the risk of killing, at the time of
committing a homicide, may reduce his offence from murder to manslaughter
(which latter crime requires no more than a realization that some bodily harm
may be caused). Drunkenness may likewise show that a supposed burglar had no
intention of stealing, or that wounds were inflicted without any ""intent
to do grievous bodily harm"", or that a false pretence was made with no
""intent to defraud"". But it must be remembered that a man may be so
drunk as not to form an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm while yet
in sufficient control of his senses to be able to contemplate some harm and so
to be guilty of manslaughter or of an unlawful wounding.

I find it unnecessary to review the numerous authorities
available on the point seeing that they have just been fully dealt with by a
unanimous seven-member House of Lords in Director of

[Page 51]

Public Prosecutions v. Majewski[30].
The facts of the case and the question raised are stated as follows by Lord
Elwyn-Jones, L.C. (at pp. 144-5):

The appellant's case was that when the assaults were
committed he was acting under the influence of a com­bination of drugs (not
medically prescribed) and alcohol, to such an extent that he did not know what
he was doing and that he remembered nothing of the incidents that had occurred.
After medical evidence had been called by the defence as to the effect of the
drugs and drink the appellant had taken, the learned judge, in the absence of
the jury, ruled that he would direct the jury in due course that on the charges
of assault or assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the question whether he
had taken drink or drugs was immaterial. The learned judge directed the jury
that in relation to an offence not requiring a specific intent, the fact that a
man has induced in himself a state in which he is under the influence of drink
and drugs, is no defence. Since the counts for assault did not require proof of
any specific intent, the fact that the accused might have taken drink or drugs
was irrelevant, provided the jury was satisfied that the state which he was in
as a result of drink and drugs or a combination of both was self-induced.

…

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction
but granted leave to appeal to your Lord-ships' House certifying that the
following point of law of general public importance was involved:

""Whether a defendant may properly be convicted of
assault notwithstanding that, by reason of his self-induced intoxication, he
did not intend to do the act alleged to constitute the assault.""

Here are now some key passages of the speech with which Lord Diplock,
Lord Simon and Lord Kilbrandon agreed: (at pp. 149-50):

In Attorney-General for Northern Ireland v. Gal­lagher ([1963]
A.C. 349 at p. 380), Lord Denning spoke of

""the general principle of English law that, subject to
very limited exceptions, drunkenness is no defence to a criminal charge nor is
a defect of reason produced by drunkenness ..."".

Gallagher's case was followed by Bratty v. Attorney-General
for Northern Ireland ([1963] A.C. 386), Lord Denning (at p. 410) said:

[Page 52]

"", .. If the drunken man is so drunk that he does not
know what he is doing, he has a defence to any charge, such as murder or
wounding with intent, in which a specific intent is essential, but he is still
liable to be convicted of manslaughter or unlawful wound­ing for which no
specific intent is necessary, see Beard's case ([1920] A.C. 479).""

The seal of approval is clearly set on the passage of the Beard
(at p. 499) decision. In no case has the general principle of English law
as described by Lord Denning in Gallagher's case and exposed again in Bratty's
case been overruled in this House and the question now to be determined is
whether it should be.

I do not for my part regard that general principle as either
unethical or contrary to the principles of natural justice. If a man of his own
volition takes a substance which causes him to cast off the restraints of
reason and conscience, no wrong is done to him by holding him answerable
criminally for any injury he may do while in that condition. His course of
conduct in reducing him-self by drugs and drink to that condition in my view
supplies the evidence of mens rea, of guilty mind cer­tainly sufficient for
crimes of basic intent.

At p. 154, Lord Simon said of what I have quoted above from Fauteux
J.’s judgment in George, that it was ""the best description of
specific intent in this sense that I know"". None of the other Law Lords
sitting differed. I find Lord Edmund-Davies saying (at pp. 167-8):

The undeviating application of logic leads inexorably to the
conclusion that a man behaving even as Lipman [R. v. Lipman, [1970] 1
Q.B. 152] unquestionably did must be completely discharged from all criminal
liability for the dreadful consequences of his conduct. It was, as I recall,
submissions of this startling character which led my noble and learned friend,
Lord Simon of Glaisdale, to comment trenchantly to appellant's counsel:
""It is all right to say 'Let justice be done though the heavens fall'. But
you ask us to say, `Let logic be done even though public order be threatened',
which is something very different"".

Are the claims of logic, then, so compelling that a man
behaving as the Crown witnesses testified the appellant did must be cleared of
criminal responsibility? As to this, Lawton LJ ([1975] 3 All E.R. 296 at p,
305) rightly said:

[Page 53]

""Although there was much reforming zeal and activity in
the 19th century, Parliament never once considered whether self-induced
intoxication should be a defence generally to a criminal charge. It
would have been a strange result if the merciful relaxation of a strict rule of
law has ended, without any Parliamen­tary intervention, by wittling it away to
such an extent that the more drunk a man became, provided he stopped short of
making himself insane, the better chance he had of an acquittal.""

If such be the inescapable result of the strict applica­tion
of logic in this branch of the law, it is indeed not surprising that
illogicality has long reigned, and the prospect of its dethronement must be
regarded as alarming.

II

As previously noted, the view taken by the Court below following
its previous judgment in Boucher differs from the view taken by the
Court of Appeal of Ontario in Vandervoort. In that case, after reviewing
the course of the trial, Aylesworth J.A. said for the Court (at pp. 384-5):

It is clear that one of the essential elements demand­ing
proof in a charge of rape is a specific intent by the accused to have
intercourse without the woman's con-sent. This has been established in a long
line of notable authority; it will be sufficient to refer to one or two cases
only.

In Regina v. Wright (1866), 4 F. & F. 967, 176 E.R.
869, Channell B. charged the jury that rape ""required an intention on his
(accused's) part to commit the act by force against her will"". And see Regina
v. Stanton (1844), 1 Car. & K. 415, 174 E.R. 872. In Rex v. Lloyd (1836),
7 C. & P. 318, 173 E.R. 141, the jury were told by Patteson J. ""In
order to find the prisoner guilty of an assault to commit a rape, you must be
satisfied that the prisoner, when he laid hold of the prosecutrix, not only
desired to gratify his passions upon her person, but that he intended to do so
at all events, and notwithstanding any resistance on her part.""

In my opinion, Aylesworth J.A. erred in saying that a
""specific intent by the accused to have intercourse without the woman’s
consent"" is one of the essential elements demanding proof in a charge of
rape. The three early English cases on which he relied, antedate Beard by
many years. None of

[Page 54]

them was referred to in Beard and drunkenness was not an
issue in any of them. In the earliest, R. v. Lloyd, the charge was not
rape but assault with intent to commit a rape and Patteson J. told the jury
that in order to find the prisoner guilty ""you must be satisfied that the
prisoner, when he laid hold of the prosecutrix, not only desired to gratify his
passions upon her person, but that he intended to do so at all events, and
notwithstanding any resistance on her part."" In the second, R. v.
Stan-ton, again the charge was not rape but assault with intent to commit a
rape and Coleridge J. instructed the jury that the intent required was intent
to have a connexion by force. In the third case, R. v. Wright, Channell
J. charged the jury that rape ""required an intention on his (accused’s)
part to commit the act by force against her will."" I do not consider that
any of these cases is helpful in determining whether rape is a crime of
specific intent, as distinguished from general intent, in the context of
drunkenness.

Aylesworth J.A. then quoted the following pas-sage from Lord
Birkenhead’s judgment in Beard, at p. 504:

""Drunkenness, rendering a person incapable of the
intent, would be an answer, as it is for example in a charge of
attempted suicide. In Reg. v. Moore ((1852), 3 C. & K. 319, 175 E.R.
571) drunkenness was held to negative the intent in such a case and Jervis C.J.
said: 'If the prisoner was so drunk as not to know what she was about how can
you say that she intended to destroy herself?' My Lords, drunkenness in this
case could be no defence unless it could be established that Beard at the time
of committing the rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent
to commit it, which was not in fact, and manifestly, having regard to the
evidence, could not be contended.""

Aylesworth J.A. then observed:

The ""intent to commit it"" referred to by the Lord
Chancellor is, of course, the intent to commit rape and

[Page 55]

rape imports a specific intent to have intercourse with-out
the woman's consent.

The words from Beard quoted by Mr. Justice Aylesworth were
part of a longer passage in which Lord Birkenhead also said:

For in the present case the death resulted from two acts or
from a succession of acts, the rape and act of violence causing suffocation.
These acts cannot be regarded sepa­rately and independently of each other. The
capacity of the mind of the prisoner to form the felonious intent which murder
involves is in other words to be explored in relation to the ravishment; and
not in relation merely to the violent acts which gave effect to the ravishment.

 

Lord Russell of Killowen, in Majewski, con­sidered the
entire passage and another short pas-sage from Beard reading at p. 507: ""There
was certainly no evidence that he was too drunk to form the intent of
committing rape"" and then said (at p. 172):

In my opinion these passages do not indicate an opinion that
rape is a crime of special intent. All that is meant is that conscious rape is
required to supply ""the felonious intent which murder involves"". For
the crime of murder special or particular intent is always required for the
necessary malice aforethought. This may be intent to kill or intent to cause
grievous bodily harm: or in a case such as Beard of constructive malice,
this, required the special intent consciously to commit the
violent felony of rape in the course and furtherance of which the act of
violence causing death took place. Beard, therefore, in my opinion does
not suggest that rape is a crime of special or particular intent.

Mr. Justice Aylesworth referred also to the deci­sion of the
Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, in R. v. Hornbuckle[31].
In that case, on a charge of rape, MacFarlan J. held:

... a specific intention to commit the crime of rape is, in
my opinion, an essential element or ingredient of the crime of attempting to
commit rape within the meaning of the judgment of the House of Lords in Beard's
Case.

[Page 56]

Lowe and Martin JJ. were of the same opinion. They relied upon
the two passages from Beard which Lord Russell considered in Majewski
and upon the fact that the Crimes Act 1928, s. 456, permitted
the jury to bring in a verdict on the included charge of not guilty of rape but
guilty of an assault with intent to commit rape. Lowe and Martin JJ. found a
possible anomaly in denying the defence of drunkenness to an attempt which
succeeded but in making it available where the crime remained in the attempt.
The judges resolved the anomaly in the following passage:

Analysis of the crime of rape involves at least these
elements, (a) an indecent assault, (b) an intent to have intercourse with the
female without her consent, and (c) the intended assault completed by the
having of inter-course. To hold that knowledge that the act of inter-course was
occurring sufficiently establishes the intent, because the man who knows he is
committing the act must intend it, even if prima facie warranted,
seems to us to fail to distinguish ""intent to have intercourse without the
consent of the female"". Once it is appreciat­ed that the above elements
are involved, the alternative verdict of assault with intent (now specifically
author­ized by the Crimes Act) follows naturally and any basis for the
suggested anomaly disappears.

Canadian law no longer knows of a crime of assault with intent to
commit rape; therefore the possible anomaly which gave Lowe and Martin JJ.
pause need not concern us.

I do not propose to analyze the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia in R. v. Boucher, supra, in which the Court
concluded that it is no defence to a charge of rape that the accused was too
drunk to know that the complai­nant was not consenting. There are passages in
the judgment which one might question, such as Shep­pard J.A.'s reference to
the failure of the accused to prove that drunkenness resulted in that
degree of incapacity necessary to rebut the presumption of intent (see Woolmington
v. D.P.P.[32]) I
agree, however, with the conclusion reached in Boucher.

[Page 57]

In my view, rape is a crime involving only a general intention as
distinguished from a specific intention and is therefore a crime in which the
defence of drunkenness can have no application.

 

In R. v. Resener[33], the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia held that a specific intent to act
indecently was not an essential ingredient on a charge of indecent assault.
This comports with the English decision in R. v. Burns to which I
referred earlier. In Resener's case, after reference to Boucher and
Vandervoort and to what had been said by Fauteux and Ritchie JJ. in George,
Davey C.J.B.C. said:

Without attempting an exhaustive analysis of their judg­ments,
I consider it follows from them that a specific intent to assault indecently is
not an essential ingredient of the crime of indecent assault, as distinguished
from mens rea, which may be established, among other ways, by a general
intent to assault.

 

R. v. Schmidt & Gole[34] merely
followed Vander­voort but see Bolton v. Crawley[35],
where it was held that the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily
harm did not need a specific intent and that intoxication due to drugs could
not afford a defence.

In R. v. King[36], the
question was whether mens rea was a necessary element of the offence of
driving a motor vehicle while ability to do so is impaired by a drug. The Court
gave an affirmative answer to this question but in the course of a judgment
with which Martland J. agreed, Ritchie J. said (at p. 763):

If the driver's lack of appreciation when he undertook to drive
was induced by voluntary consumption of alcohol or of a drug which he knew or
had any reason-able ground for believing might cause him to be impaired, then
he cannot, of course, avoid the conse­quences of the impairment which results
by saying that he did not intend to get into such a condition, but if the
impairment has been brought about without any act of

[Page 58]

his own will, then, in my view, the offence created by s.
223 cannot be said to have been committed.

The existence of a rebuttable presumption that a man intends
the natural consequences of his own conduct is a part of our law, but its
application to any particular situation involves a consideration of what
consequences a man might be reasonably expected to foresee under the
circumstances.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan[37],
the House of Lords considered whether in order to constitute a defence to a
charge of rape an errone­ous belief that the woman was consenting required not
only to be honestly held but also to be reason-able. In a controversial
decision, a three to two division, the majority expressed the opinion that an
honest belief in consent was a defence whether or not that belief was based on
reasonable grounds. All were, however, unanimous in holding that no miscarriage
of justice had occurred because as Lord Cross put it (at p. 353): "".. .
the only real issue in the case was whether what took place in the Morgan's
house that night was a multiple rape or a sexual orgy"". Lord Simon, who
dissented, saw fit to consider, although the others did not, wheth­er rape was
an offence of specific intent. He said (at p. 365):

This brings me to the fourth question, namely wheth­er rape
is a crime of basic or ulterior intent. Does it involve an intent going beyond
the actus reus? Smith and Hogan (Criminal Law (3rd Edn, 1973), p. 47) say No. I
respectfully agree. The actus reus is sexual inter-course with a woman who is
not in fact consenting to such intercourse. The mens rea is knowledge that the
woman is not consenting or recklessness as to whether she is consenting or not.

On the whole, I conclude that the British Columbia Court of
Appeal was correct in differing from the view taken by the Ontario Court of
Appeal that rape is an offence of specific intent.

III

I must now point out that while there is high authority for the
proposition that in some circum­stances it is desirable to express an opinion
on an

[Page 59]

important point of law although it is doubtful whether it can be
said to emerge at all on the facts of the case, I know of no authority holding
that it is ever proper, after dealing with the question of law in itself, to
dispose of the case without pro­ceeding to consider whether on the facts it is
material and if in the event, there is a miscarriage of justice.

In Beard, supra, the question of law was decided adversely
to the accused and, therefore, the convic­tion was restored. However, in Morgan,
as previ­ously noted, the decision was unanimous that, although the trial
judge's direction that belief in consent had to be reasonable was erroneous,
never­theless on the facts as presented by the accused, an honest belief in
consent was inconceivable and there had been no miscarriage of justice.

In rape cases, some consideration should be given to the plight
of a complainant and she must not be subjected to the humiliation of having to
testify again unless justice makes it imperative. Therefore, in the
circumstances, although it is not strictly necessary in view of my conclusion
on the question of law, I wish to say that, even if I held a different view, I
would have to hold that in the instant case there was no evidence that the
accused was drunk to such a degree as to be incapable of forming the intent to
commit rape. Here is what Bull J.A. said:

The evidence was clear that the appellant was intox­icated
(as was the boy friend Lesley) but there was no suggestion that he was in such
a drunken condition either that he did not know what he was doing or that he
would not appreciate that his menacing use of the knife, combined with this insistence
on sexual intercourse, extorted submission or consent to the act. The appel­lant's
position, as voluntarily made to the police, was merely that he ""started
petting"" with her, removed her tampax for her and had intercourse. The
whole statement was clear and concise as to event and details and negated any such
drunken condition.

I do not think that the trial judge’s remark indicates that he
thought there was some evidence of drunkenness going to the extent of an
inability

[Page 60]

to form a criminal intent. (Assuming this is at all possible in a
rape case, see Glanville L. Williams, The Mental Element in Crime (1965), p.
47.) In my opinion, the trial judge merely wanted to guard against the
erroneous view that mere drunken condition could be a defence.

IV

Even if it could be considered that there was some slight
evidence of absence of intent due to impairment of the mind by drink, I would
never­theless hold in this case that there was no miscar­riage of justice. It
is clear that the accused deliber­ately chose to submit to the jury a defence
of consent based on his statement to the police in which he admitted the fact
of intercourse. An accused cannot very well at the same time ask the jury to
believe his statement that the complainant did consent if, at the same time, he
says he was so drunk as not to know what he was doing. In Morgan, the
conclusion was unanimous that the accused could not at the same time ask the
jury to accept that they honestly believed the complainant was consenting in
spite of her resistance when they were also saying that, after initial
resistance, she had indulged in an orgy with them.

I am not unmindful of the rule that it is the duty of a trial
judge to put to the jury every defence available to the accused. However, when
the latter, with the advice of competent counsel, chooses not to raise a weak
alternative defence so as not to prejudice his main defence, it would not in my
view be consistent with the proper administration of justice to allow a new
trial for the purpose of making it possible to raise the alternative ground of
defence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Hearsay—Accused electing to
stand mute—Admissibility of evidence of polygraph expert as to operation of
polygraph machine and veracity of accused—Applicability of s. 613 (1) (b)(iii)
of Criminal Code .

The appellant P is accused of having murdered
R in August, 1967. He was arrested thereafter but released when R’s wife, who
had seen her husband’s assailant immediately before the murder, was unable to
identify him from photographs or in person. In 1972, P told a friend that he
had stabbed R and subsequently described the course of events to the police.
His confession was admitted in evidence as were the opinions of a psychiatrist
and a psychologist called by the defence to prove that P had a tendency to
invent and to present himself in the worst possible light in order to attract
attention. The psychiatrist’s opinion was based in part on the results of a
polygraph test during which the accused said that he had lied to the police.
The accused himself declined to give evidence and called the polygraphist to
attest to his veracity at the time of the test, which was some two weeks after
the trial began. The trial judge refused to admit the evidence of the polygiraphist
and the accused was found guilty of non-capital murder. The Court of Appeal for
Ontario dismissed his appeal
from that verdict and this appeal was brought with leave of the Supreme Court
on the following question of law: Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the trial judge did not err in refusing to permit the polygraph
expert to testify?

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J.: There may be circumstances where such evidence would be
admissible, but in the present case such evidence was certainly inadmissible.
If there were any doubt as to its admissibility, it would be proper to apply
the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . The
jury rejected

[Page 19]

the psychological evidence, which was based
in part on the results of the polygraph test, and it is therefore not likely
that they would have given any weight to the evidence of the polygraph expert
alone.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: It is well established
that second hand evidence is not admissible when the purpose of introducing it
is to establish its truth, although evidence as to statements made to
psychological experts is often admitted for the limited purpose of showing the
basis for the expert opinion, the polygraph expert however had neither the
qualifications nor the opportunity to form a mature opinion of the accused’s
personality. If the statements had been made to the polygraphist alone they
would be clearly inadmissible and the mere presence of a polygraph machine
which the polygraphist was experienced in using is not enough to make them
admissible. If it were otherwise an accused would be able to elect not to deny
his crime under oath and to substitute for his own evidence the results of a
test administered by a mechanical device.

1 W.L.R. 965 followed; R. v. Dietrich (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 49; State
of Arizona v. Bowen, 449 P. 2d 603 (1969) referred to; R. v. Wong,
[1977] 1 W.W.R. 1 overruled.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming a
judgment of Van Camp J. Appeal dismissed.

D. Crane, Q.C., for the appellant.

J.D. Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

SPENCE J.—I have had the opportunity of perusing
with considerable care the reasons for judgment which are being delivered by
Mr. Justice Ritchie. Since those reasons contain a detailed analysis of the
facts and issues in the present appeal, I need not repeat them.

The polygraph expert John Reid was presented to
give evidence on behalf of the accused, who had not testified in his own
defence, and to give his opinion that this accused, when examined by him during
the course of the trial and with the aid of the polygraph equipment, was telling
the truth when he stated that he had lied earlier in his statement to the
police. I am ready to agree that

[Page 20]

such eidence under those circumstances was not
admissible. I reserve my view as to whether, under other circumstances,
evidence given by an operator of a polygraph apparatus could ever be
admissible. There may be circumstances where such evidence should be admitted
but certainly the evidence proposed to be given by Mr. Reid in this appeal was
hearsay evidence of the worst self-serving type.

Were I in any doubt as to the correctness of the
view which I have expressed, I would certainly be of the opinion that it would
be proper to apply the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

The defence was permitted to adduce the evidence
of Dr. Julio Arboleda, a duly qualified medical practitioner specializing in
the field of psychiatry. After a lengthy voir dire, Dr. Arboleda
was permitted to give his opinion based on two psychiatric interviews he had
with the appellant, on certain psychological tests which had been given to the
appellant by a Dr. Michael Girodo who also testified for the appellant, and
upon the results of the polygraph tests taken by John Reid. Therefore, the
result attributed by the expert defence witness to the polygraph tests was
already before the jury and, in my view, before that jury in a much more
persuasive fashion that it could ever have been put by a non-medical witness.
It is very evident that the jury refused to accept the opinions expressed by
Dr. Arboleda and Dr. Girodo and one could not therefore have expected them to
have had any regard for the polygraph results which were only one of the
materials upon which the expert witness Dr. Arboleda based his opinion.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the
verdict of guilty of non-capital murder entered against the appellant after a
trial before Madam

[Page 21]

Justice Van Camp sitting with a jury. Leave was
granted on the following question of law:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the trial judge did not err in refusing, especially in the
particular circumstances, to permit the polygraph expert to testify about the
operation of the polygraph machine and to give his opinion as to the accused’s
veracity when he confessed to the murder.

The circumstances giving rise to this
prosecution are somewhat singular in that the alleged murder was committed on
August 9, 1967, whereas the trial was not held until November, 1972.

The murdered man, Léopold Roy, was the
superintendent of an apartment house at 275 Friel
 Street in Ottawa and was also employed by the City of Ottawa as a fireman. In the afternoon of August 9, 1967, his wife, who had been
engaged in housework in the apartment house, observed a suspicious man lurking
in the corridor and, as she thought, attempting to enter one of the apartments.
She noticed that the man was holding an alligator wallet which raised her
suspicion and she called out to her husband who was working in the basement.
The prowler appeared to be nervous and didn’t move, but when she called out to
her husband a second time and could hear him coming upstairs, the man ran
through the hallway to the back stairs, jumped over the railings to the landing
and Mr. Roy caught him and shoved him back into a corner and called out to his
wife “You know what to do”. Mrs. Roy then went down to her apartment and left
her husband holding the man on the stairway. The next thing she heard was a
call from her husband saying: “Don’t call the police, call a doctor”.

The next person to see Roy was Mr. Herbert, the oil burner serviceman who had come to clean
the furnace and who had been talking to Roy when his wife first called out to him. After finishing his work
this man found Roy lying on the
basement stairs covered with blood and with a knife wound immediately below his
heart. Herbert went outside to his truck and radioed his company to send the

[Page 22]

police but Roy was dead by the time the first
policeman arrived.

Shortly after these events, Mrs. Roy, who had
seen the prowler’s face three times, made several attempts to identify him in
“line-ups” where the appellant was present and in photographs, but she was
unable to make any positive identification and the appellant was released.

It was not until January, 1972, that the
appellant told his friend, Neil Miller, that he had stabbed the superintendent
in the apartment house on Friel Street in 1967 with a knife which he had taken from the kitchen of an
apartment that he had broken into. Neil Miller took this story to the police
and on January 11th and 12th, 1972, the appellant was interviewed by the
police, and after having been duly cautioned, made a statement as to his
actions on the afternoon of August 9, 1967. The learned trial judge found this
confession to be admissible after having conducted a voir dire concerning
the circumstances under which it was made, and it will be seen that the
appellant’s actions on the afternoon in question as recounted to Miller and to
the police, bear a striking resemblance to the actions of the “prowler” in the
apartment building as described by Mrs. Roy, as is illustrated by the following
brief excerpt from the appellant’s confession to the police:

…then I drove around, looking for an
apartment that I could go into, to steal. I got into one apartment on Friel Street, looked around inside, in
which I did not find any money. I had taken a knife from the kitchen of that
apartment. Going down the back stairs, I notice a man and a woman. The man
started coming down at me, I stabbed him. From there I ran to my car…

In any event, there is no denial of the fact
that the appellant’s statements related to the murder at 275 Friel Street on August 9, 1967. The
appellant elected to give no evidence, but in lieu thereof expert witnesses
were called for the defence, including a psychiatrist and a psychologist whose
evidence was directed to showing that the appellant had a deranged personality
and particularly that he would have a tendency to invent and attest

[Page 23]

to circumstances which never happened in order
to satisfy his desire to attract attention to himself. These witnesses,
together with John Edward Reid, an experienced polygraph examiner, were
obviously called to support the contention that the appellant had been lying
when he confessed to the police; this was the opinion expressed by the latter
at trial on the basis of his interpretation of recordings shown on the
polygraph machine when he administered a polygraph test to the appellant and it
is this evidence which was excluded by the learned trial judge.

The evidence of Dr. Girodo, a clinical
psychologist from the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Ottawa, was to
the effect that he had subjected the appellant to a number of standard tests,
no one of which is ever 100 per cent reliable, and as a result of these tests
he had formed the opinion that the appellant was psychologically unstable and
had a tendency to present himself in the worst possible light.

Dr. Arboleda, who is a specialist in psychiatry,
based his opinion on two psychiatric interviews which he had personally had
with the appellant, in one of which the appellant had been given some sodium
amytol, sometimes loosely referred to as a truth drug. The witness also
considered the psychological tests administered by Dr. Girodo and the results
of the polygraph test. Dr. Arboleda testified that the results of Mr. Reid’s
test with Mr. Phillion indicated that he had lied to the police when he
confessed to the offence in question and he expressed his opinion in the
following terms:

From the results of the two tests given him,
I would say they support to the idea that he was actually lying to the police.
That is all I can. (sic)

The evidence of both these medical witnesses was
admitted by the learned trial judge in reliance on such cases as The Queen v.
Lupien[1],
Wilband v. The Queen[2],
Toohey v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner[3], and R. v. Rosik[4]. No appeal was

[Page 24]

asserted from this ruling and any issues which
it may raise form no part of the question upon which leave to appeal was
granted in the present case.

It is well settled that second hand evidence is
not admissible when the object of calling it is to establish its truth. This
was clearly stated in the Privy Council in the case of Subramaniam v. Public
Prosecutor[5], where
it was said, at p. 970:

Evidence of a statement made to a witness
by a person who is not himself called as a witness may or may not be hearsay.
It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish
the truth of what is contained in the statement. It is not hearsay and is admissible
when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the
statement, but the fact that it was made.

Statements made to psychiatrists and
psychologists are sometimes admitted in criminal cases and when this is so it
is because they have qualified as experts in diagnosing the behavioural
symptoms of individuals and have formed an opinion which the trial judge deems
to be relevant to the case, but the statements on which such opinions are based
are not admissible in proof of their truth but rather as indicating the basis
upon which the medical opinion was formed in accordance with recognized
professional procedures.

Entirely different considerations, however,
apply to the evidence of Mr. Reid who was neither a psychiatrist nor a
psychologist and does not appear to have had any other medical training. The
evidence indicates that he only saw the accused on the occasion when he
administered the polygraph test which was the day before he gave his evidence.
This means that the appellant was subjected to the test on the 3rd of November 1972, during the closing days
of his trial for murder which was opened on the 16th of October.

The polygraph evidence which was sought to be
introduced is accurately recorded in the judgment of the Court of Appeal as
follows:

Q. Mr. Reid, on the basis of your
experience and the recordings that you made of Mr. Phillion, during

[Page 25]

the course of the polygraph test, did you
form an opinion as to whether he was telling the truth when he answered no to
the relevant questions?

A. I am of the opinion that he is telling
the truth when he answered no to the relevant questions.

Among the relevant questions were the following:

‘Did you stab Léopold Roy on August 9th, 1967?

Did you kill Léopold Roy on August 9th, 1967?’

In my view, Mr. Reid had neither the
qualifications nor the opportunity to form a mature opinion of the propensity
of the man he was subjecting to the test either as to truthfulness or
otherwise. His opinion, however, was not based on the statements made by the
appellant, but on his own expertise in interpreting the recordings of the
machine. If the statements had been made to Mr. Reid alone, there is in my
opinion no doubt that they would have been inadmissible as self-serving, second
hand evidence tendered in proof of its truth on behalf of an accused who did
not see fit to testify and I am not prepared to hold on the evidence of this
case that the presence of the polygraph machine or the expertise of its
operator made them admissible. The admission of such evidence would mean that
any accused person who had made a confession could elect not to deny its truth
under oath and substitute for his own evidence the results produced by a
mechanical device in the hands of a skilled operator relying exclusively on its
efficacy as a test of veracity.

The elementary right of an accused not to give
evidence is in no way at issue here, but that right having been exercised, it
appears to me to run contrary to the basic rules of evidence to permit the
substitution of the opinion of a polygraph technician for the evidence which
could have been given by the appellant himself. I do not consider that this
view conflicts in any way with that expressed by Gale, C.J.O., in R. v. Dietrich[6], at p. 65, but if I thought
otherwise I would have to say,

[Page 26]

with great respect, that that case, was to that
extent, wrongly decided.

For these reasons alone I am satisfied that the
learned trial judge was correct in excluding the results of the polygraph test.

I should not leave this matter, however, without
indicating that I have had an opportunity to read a great many American
authorities on the subject of the reliability and hence the admissibility of
such answers given in the course of polygraph examinations. I find that in the
vast majority of cases the American courts have excluded this type of evidence
except in cases where both parties to the proceeding have stipulated that they
are prepared to have the anwers accepted.

There can be no doubt that improved polygraph
techniques have been developed over the years, but this does not appear to have
altered the attitude of the American courts. I cite in this regard the case of State
v. Bowen[7], a
decision of the Court of Appeals of Arizona where the then current position with respect to polygraph evidence
was characterized at p. 606 in the following terms:

There is no question but that evidence of,
or reference to, a polygraph test is in admissible for any reason. All
authorities are in accord. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86
S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed 2d 908 (1966); State v. McGee, 91 Ariz. 101, 370 P. 2d 261 (1962).

The present attitude of the American courts
towards the acceptance of polygraph evidence is discussed in the following
passage from the evidence of Mr. Reid:

Well, it has been admitted a number of
times over the objection of opposing counsel, but not a great number of times.
Now, I have had the experience of possibly three different cases where it was
admitted over the objection of opposing counsel, but most times it is done under
stipulation by both sides.

And he later said:

[Page 27]

Well, it appears that the attitude of the
Courts of our country is greatly changing. True, up until the present time it
was hardly even considered by stipulation. I don’t know what number of cases it
is accepted at the present time under stipulation, it might be five or six.

These are the opinions expressed by a polygraph
examiner from the United States
with thirty‑two and one half years’ experience who was presented to the
court as a definitive authority on the operation of the polygraph machine and
its reliability and acceptability.

In the comparatively recent case of U.S. v.
Ridling[8], Mr.
Justice Joiner, District Judge of the U.S. District Court of Michigan, wrote a
lengthy opinion in which he finally concluded that polygraph evidence should be
admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule. In the course of rendering these
reasons, the learned judge said (at p. 93):

Judicial opinions pertaining to the
admission of polygraph testimony seem all to point toward exclusion.

and he proceeds to cite seventeen cases in
support of this statement. Finally, Mr. Justice Joiner deals with the hearsay
rule in connection with this kind of evidence and says of the polygraph expert
there called:

In another sense, he must report to the
jury the statements made by the subject so as to make his opinion relevant to
the issue in the case, and as a result of his expertise and the tests conducted
he must indicate his opinion of the truthfulness of the statement. In this sense
the statements supported by the opinion of the expert appear to be hearsay but
since the very purpose of the test is to determine truthfulness, the evidence
should be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule because of its high
degree of trustworthiness.

No such exception to the hearsay rule exists in
this country and notwithstanding the fact that I have had the benefit of
reading the exhaustive reasons

[Page 28]

for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Meredith
in the case of R. v. Wong[9], at
p. 1, I am nevertheless unable to agree with the view that polygraph evidence
should be admitted. As I am satisfied in the present case that the learned
trial judge was not in error in refusing to allow the polygraph expert to give
his opinion as to the accused’s veracity, it follows that his evidence about
the operation of the machine is irrelevant, and was also properly excluded.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law — Form of information — Whether accused
reasonably informed of allegation against him — Whether accused had opportunity
to adduce full defence on fair trial — Criminal Code , ss. 510 , 732(1)  and (3) 
and 755(4) .

The accused was charged with failing to provide a
breath sample contrary to s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code , the words ""without
reasonable excuse"" being omitted from the information. No objection was
made to this omission and a defence of reasonable excuse was tendered and
rejected by the magistrate. The accused appealed to the District Court on the
ground inter alia, that the magistrate erred in holding that he did not
have a reasonable excuse and a trial de novo was ordered. At the second
hearing the accused tendered the same defence and again made no objection to
the information as laid. The accused was convicted a second time and appealed
to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan on the ground that the judge erred in
holding that his excuse was not reasonable. At the hearing the Court of Appeal
gave the accused leave to add the ground that the information was incomplete
and on that basis quashed his conviction. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
was granted on the question of law whether the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan
erred in failing to consider the application of ss. 732(1) and (3) and 755(4)
of the Code.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the
convic­tion restored.

Per Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ.: An accused must be reasonably informed of the charge
against him. In the case at bar the information complied with the requirements
of s. 510(5)  of the Criminal Code  in that all the relevant facts were
cited and were related to the offence defined in s. 235(2) of the Code. The
accused was clearly informed of the true nature of the charge and
therefore had the opportunity to adduce a full defence. Furthermore,

[Page 9]

in the case of The Queen
v. Major, decided by this Court fourteen months after the decision of the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, a similar situation, somewhat more favourable
to the accused, arose and it was held by this Court that if an essential
element that was omitted from a charge has been proved and there has been no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, a conviction should be confirmed.
In the case at bar the factual situation is so similar that the result must be
the same and the question of law defined in the order granting leave must be
answered in the affirmative: the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan erred in
failing to consider ss. 732(1) and (3) and 755(4) of the Code. Although
leave to appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal also erred in holding
that the words ""without reasonable excuse"" were required in the
information was refused, this does not mean that the views of the Court of
Appeal on that point are confirmed. Section 730  of the Criminal Code  might
lead to another conclusion.

Per Spence and Dickson JJ.: The information com­plied
with the requirements of s. 510(5)  of the Criminal Code , the accused was
reasonably informed of the charge against him and he had the opportunity to
adduce a full defence. The Queen v. Major [1977] 1 S.C.R. 826, referred
to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1],
allowing an appeal by the respondent from the dismissal of his appeal by way of
trial de novo following his conviction for refusing to provide a breath
sample contrary to s. 235(2)  of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed and
conviction restored.

 

E. G. Ewaschuk, for the appellant. Orest Rosowsky, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré
JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J.—The respondent was charged with the following
summary conviction offence:

THE INFORMANT SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable
grounds to believe and does believe that Wilfred James COTE, Carpenter of Kamsack,
Sas­katchewan, on or about the 20th day of SEPTEMBER A.D. 1973, at Canora in
the Province of Saskatchewan

[Page 10]

did refuse to comply with a demand by a peace officer to provide
a sample of breath suitable for analysis to determine if any, the proportion of
alcohol in his blood, contrary to Section 235(2)  of the Criminal Code .

The information, it will be seen, omits any refer­ence to the
words ""without reasonable excuse"" which are contained in s. 235,
subs. 2 of the Criminal Code . No objection was made to the information
by the respondent who tendered a defence of reasonable excuse, which was
rejected by the magistrate.

The respondent appealed his conviction to the District Court.
Several grounds were mentioned in the notice of appeal, the only relevant one
alleging error in the holding that Côté ""did not have a reasonable excuse
to refuse to comply with the demand"". At the trial de novo, the
respondent again made no objection to the information and again tendered the
same defence of reasonable excuse, which was rejected.

In the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan,
the only ground is stated in the following terms:

The learned Judge erred in holding that a person upon which
a demand for a sample of breath has been made does not have a reasonable excuse
to refuse to supply the sample even when he has affirmatively shown that he had
not been driving the motor vehicle nor had he been in care or control of the
motor vehicle.

Counsel informed us that only that point was argued before the
Court of Appeal, Côté not rais­ing the contention that the information did not
disclose an offence known to law. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal, without
calling upon the parties, granted leave to amend the notice of appeal so as to
raise this additional ground and quashed the conviction. The reasons for that
conclusion are contained in the following paragraph (21 C.C.C. (2d) 474 at p.
475):

It is to be noted that the information does not contain the
words ""without reasonable excuse"". The mere fail­ure or refusal to
comply with a demand made pursuant to s. 235(1) does not constitute an
offence under s. 235(2) ; to constitute an offence the failure or refusal
must be ""without reasonable excuse"". As the informa­tion does not
include this essential averment, it does not

[Page 11]

allege an offence under s. 235(2)  and therefore the
conviction thereon cannot stand.

It is indeed unfortunate that the Court of Appeal did not have
the benefit of the arguments in depth submitted to this Court and for which we
are indebted to counsel. As it is, we are left in the dark as to the views of
that Court on the question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted by
this Court:

Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to consider the
application of the provisions of subss. (1) and (3) of s. 732 and subs. (4) of
s. 755  of the Criminal Code  in the circumstances of the appeal to that
Court?

Subsections (1) and (3) of s. 732 and subs. (4) of s. 755  of the Criminal
Code  read:

732. (1) An objection to an information for a defect
apparent on its face shall be taken by motion to quash the information before
the defendant has pleaded, and thereafter only by leave of the summary
conviction court before which the trial takes place.

…

(3) A summary conviction court may, at any stage of the
trial, amend the information as may be necessary if it appears

(a) that the information has been laid

(i) under another Act of the Parliament of Canada instead of
this Act, or

(ii) under this Act instead of another Act of the Parliament
of Canada; or

(b) that the information

(i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is
requisite to constitute the offence,

(ii) does not negative an exception that should be negatived, or

(iii) is in any way defective in substance,

and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are
disclosed by the evidence taken on the trial; or

(c) that the information is in any way defective in form.

755. (4) The following provisions apply in respect of
appeals, namely,

[Page 12]

(a) where an appeal is based on an objection to an information
or any process, judgment shall not be given in favour of the appellant

(i) for any alleged defect therein in substance or in form, or

(ii) for any variance between the information or process and the
evidence adduced at the trial,

unless it is shown

(iii) that the objection was taken at the trial, and

(iv) that an adjournment of the trial was refused
notwithstanding that the variance referred to in subparagraph (ii) had deceived
or misled the appel­lant; and

(b) where an appeal is based on a defect in a convic­tion or
order, judgment shall not be given in favour of the appellant, but the court
shall make an order curing the defect.

In their present form, these texts were introduced by the
amendments of 1953-54 (the numbers were then ss. 704 and 727). The previous
enactments were somewhat different. For that reason, judg­ments rendered on the
prior legislation should be used with great care.

It is apparent that s. 732 is meant to be a replica in the case
of defective informations of s. 529 dealing with defective indictments.
Accordingly, both parties have referred us to practically every reported case
dealing with one or the other of these sections. It is unnecessary to make a
review of these cases; suffice it to say that, in my view, the judgments
applying the rule against duplicitous informations and indictments constitute a
class by themselves and cannot really help in the determi­nation of the case at
bar.

Of course, s. 732 comes into play only if there is a defect in
the information. Appellant submits that none exists, the words ""without
reasonable excuse"" being brought to the attention of the accused by the
specific reference to the section of the Crimi­nal Code creating
the offence. Appellant invokes subs. 5 of s. 510 , which also applies to infor­mations:

A count may refer to any section, subsection, paragraph or
subparagraph of the enactment that creates the offence charged, and for the
purpose of determining

[Page 13]

whether a count is sufficient, consideration shall be given
to any such reference.

I agree with that submission; the golden rule is for the accused
to be reasonably informed of the transaction alleged against him, thus giving
him the possibility of a full defence and a fair trial. When, as in the present
case, the information recites all the facts and relates them to a definite
offence identified by the relevant section of the Code, it is impossible
for the accused to be misled. To hold otherwise would be to revert to the
extreme technicality of the old procedure.

 

The foregoing is enough to dispose of the appeal. However, the
parties have studied in depth the question defined in the order for leave and I
feel bound to express my views on their submissions. Assuming a defect in the
information and given the silence of the accused as to that point both in the
Magistrate Court and in the District Court, was the Court of Appeal right in quashing
the conviction?

The judgment of the Court of Appeal was ren­dered on December 23,
1974. On February 25, 1976, in The Queen v. Major unreported[2],
this Court dealt with the question raised by this appeal, namely the
omission of an essential element of the offence in the information. In my
opinion, the factual situation in Major and that in the case at bar are
so similar that the result must be the same. It is even possible to hold that
in Major, the circumstances were more favourable to the accused. They
are to be found in the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia reported at 25 C.C.C. (2d) 62, particularly in the opinion of the
Chief Justice. For my purpose, it is sufficient to summarize them as follows:

1) the information was seriously defective omitting entirely
a vital averment (the information, instead of alleging failure to report to
anyone at the scene, alleged only failure to report to the other driver);

[Page 14]

2) no motion to quash was made before plea at the trial
before the magistrate or before the trial de novo in County Court;

3) the trial was conducted by both Crown and defence as if
the missing averment had been present.

On these facts, the Court of Appeal was unani­mously of the view
that the conviction should be affirmed if the absence of the averment had
caused no substantial wrong, nor miscarriage of justice, provided, however,
that this essential ele­ment of the offence omitted from the charge had been
proven. The majority of the Court of Appeal, Macdonald J.A. concurring, were of
the opinion that there was no such evidence whereas Cooper J.A., dissenting,
was of the view that there was enough evidence to support the conviction.

On appeal to this Court, the Crown, of course, had only one point
to submit, namely that Cooper J.A. was right in his dissenting opinion, the evi­dence
being sufficient to support a conviction. On the other hand, respondent, as was
undoubtedly his right, supported the conclusion of the majority as to the lack
of evidence and raised again with considerable vigour the defence that the
omission of an essential element of the offence in the infor­mation is fatal.
He developed the submission in his factum and referred to the major decisions
on the point, namely Brodie and Barrett v. The King[3];
R. v. Leclair[4], R.
v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt[5]; R.
v. Breland and George[6]; R.
v. Hunt, Nadeau and Paquette[7]. He
also referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. At the
conclu­sion of the submissions by appellant and by respondent, the Chief
Justice, speaking for the full bench, stated:

We do not need to hear you in reply, Mr. Gale. We agree with
Mr. Justice Cooper and, accordingly, this appeal is allowed, the judgment of
the Nova Scotia Appeal Division is set aside and the conviction is restored.

[Page 15]

In my view, this recent decision of our Court settles the matter
with the result that the question of law defined in the order granting leave
must be answered in the affirmative. It was an error on the part of the Court
of Appeal to fail to consider the application of the relevant provisions of s.
732  and s. 755  of the Criminal Code  in the circumstances of the case and
to hold that the information did not disclose an offence known to law.

Before leaving the matter, I wish to make two observations, both
related to our decision in Major.

First, the Court of Appeal in that case did not feel that the
reference in the information to the relevant section of the Criminal Code is
in itself sufficient to make an information complete when it does not in
words recite all the elements of the offence. In the context of that appeal,
this Court did not have to deal with that precise point, being of the opinion
that the conviction had been proper­ly entered, the information and the
evidence being sufficient for the purpose. In my view, for the reasons
mentioned above, particularly in the light of s. 510  of the Criminal Code , this
particular conclusion of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia does not truly
represent the law.

The second point. Cooper J.A., in his dissenting reasons,
concluded not only that the evidence was sufficient but also that the
information should be amended to include the omitted averment. In allowing the
appeal and restoring the conviction, we did not see the need of amending the
informa­tion. This is in accord with the text of s. 732 , subs. 1, of the Criminal
Code . Any information which omits words found in the relevant enactment
creat­ing the offence, contains a defect apparent on its face. If no objection
is taken by motion to quash before the defendant has pleaded, and if a defence
on the merits is tendered, the matter ends there and there is no need to amend
the information.

A further point. The respondent never alleged that he was
prejudiced by the omission of the words ""without reasonable excuse""
from the infor­mation and the Court of Appeal has made no

[Page 16]

finding of prejudice. The case at bar has been argued by
respondent on the basis that no valid proceedings could flow from an
information void ab initio. No question of miscarriage of justice was
raised.

Finally I must note that the Crown in its motion for leave had
also submitted that the Court of Appeal had erred in holding that the words
""without reasonable excuse"" were required to be set out in the
information. Leave was refused as to that point. This refusal does not amount
to a confirma­tion of the views of the Court of Appeal thereon. Section 730  of
the Criminal Code  might lead one to another conclusion. However, because
of this refusal, I have examined the question defined in the order granting
leave as if the words ""without reasonable excuse"" did not
amount to an ""excep­tion, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification
prescribed by law"", thus not entering upon an examination of s.
730 . I wish to make it clear, however, that in my mind this point is still
open.

I would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

The judgment of Spence and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—I have the privilege of reading the reasons to be
delivered by my brother de Grandpré and I am in agreement with his conclusion
that the appeal should be allowed. I do so for the reasons first outlined in
the judgment of my brother de Grandpré, namely, that the particular form of the
information in the present appeal complied with the provisions of s. 510  of the
Criminal Code  in that it referred to a section and subsection of the Criminal
Code  and also outlined all the facts. I am also in agreement that the
accused had been rea­sonably informed of the transaction alleged against him
and had the opportunity to adduce a full defence upon a fair trial. In my
opinion, as my brother de Grandpré points out, the above conclu­sion is
sufficient to dispose of the appeal.

Unlike my brother de Grandpré, I am not of the opinion that I
should deal with the other matters outlined in the question upon which leave to
appeal was granted.

[Page 17]

The Queen v. Major, a judgment rendered by this Court on
February 25, 1976, and apparently unreported[8], was an
oral judgment delivered after the argument and, in my view, dealt only with the
difference of opinion between the majority and minority in the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. That difference of opinion was, as my
brother de Grandpré pointed out, upon the question of whether there had been
sufficient evidence adduced to prove an essential element of the offence
charged. In allowing the appeal, this Court, in my view, dealt only with that
question of sufficiency of evidence so I am not ready in this appeal to express
any view upon the effects of ss. 732  and 755  of the Criminal Code .

As I have said, I would allow the appeal.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court

charge of rape was allowed and a new trial ordered as to the offences of
attempted rape and indecent assault. Appeal dismissed.

Alain Hepner, for the appellant.

Paul S. Chrumka, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The accused was tried and
acquitted of rape. The trial judge’s charge to the jury in respect of this
offence was unexceptionable. Although so requested by Crown counsel, he
refused, however, to charge the jury on the included offences of attempted rape
and indecent assault. After the jury had been out for about one hour and a
half, they returned to ask the following question:

The Crown prosecutor made the suggestion of
either guilty or innocent of rape, attempted rape or indecent assault. What
options if any do we have?

[Page 216]

The trial judge repeated to them what he had
said earlier to counsel, after the jury had retired, that it was a case of rape
or nothing.

The Crown appealed on the ground of error in law
in the trial judge’s refusal to charge on included offences and also sought an
order setting aside the acquittal and directing a new trial. The Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta concluded that there should be a new
trial limited to the offences of attempted rape and indecent assault. Leave was
later sought by the Crown from this Court to appeal the acquittal of rape but
it was refused. The case is here, therefore, only on the question whether the
Appellate Division was correct in ordering a new trial on attempted rape and
indecent assault.

There were, admittedly, two issues before the
jury on the charge of rape. One was whether intercourse had taken place, that
is whether there was penetration, and the second whether there was consent. The
trial judge placed considerable emphasis on the issue of consent as if that
made the case one of rape or nothing. However, it is clear that the jury may
have decided that there was no rape only because there was no proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that sexual intercourse had occurred. Want of proof of sexual
intercourse would not, of course, rule out attempted rape or indecent assault,
but they would be ruled out if there was consent to the accused’s advances.

I do not think that a trial judge has an
untrammelled discretion to choose or refuse to charge the jury on included
offences. He must be governed by the issues that are thrown up by the evidence.
There may be cases where evidence of an issue referable to an included offence
is so tenuous as to justify him in refusing to charge on it, and yet he would
not necessarily be in error if he did so charge. This case is not of that kind.
Here, having

[Page 217]

regard to the complainant’s evidence of what the
accused did and to the evidence of his physical disability in having
intercourse unless there was complete co-operation of the complainant and to
his denial of intercourse, both penetration and consent were in issue. The jury
by its verdict might have found that there was neither penetration nor consent,
and this would not exclude either attempted rape or indecent assault. In the
circumstances there was a duty on the trial judge to charge on these included
offences.

In Wright v. The King[2], which was also a case where the
trial judge told the jury that it was “rape or nothing”, it appears that the
only issue was consent. That was also the situation in Regina v. Wright[3], and there the Ontario Court of
Appeal held that it was wrong to leave indecent assault to the jury when
intercourse was not in issue, citing and following the judgment of the English
Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Touhey[4]. Aylesworth J.A. pointed out that if
there was sufficient separation in time, place and other circumstances
surrounding an alleged indecent assault from time, place and circumstances
leading to an alleged rape, then indecent assault should be the subject of a
separate count in the indictment, but, apart from this, it could not be an
included offence where penetration is admitted.

Those cases are distinguishable from the present
one, which called for the instruction requested by the Crown. I would,
accordingly, dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Extraordinary
remedies—Prohibition—Application for prohibition and motion to quash—Criminal
Rules requiring return of all documents—Failure of Provincial Court to make the
return—Right of Provincial Court to proceed further on failure to make
return—Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules 4-8—Criminal Code , s. 714 .

Appellant was charged on April 3, 1975, with
impaired driving and was brought before the Provincial
 Court on the same day. Problems arose with fixing a
date for trial. After new informations charging the same offences had been laid
on July 17, 1975, and the
accused appeared on September 12, 1975, the case was rewarded for a week. On
September 19 again no trial date was fixed and then on September 26, despite
objections by the defence, a further adjournment was directed “to set a date
for the trial”. On September 29, 1975, appellant moved to quash to order adjourning the case, to quash
the proceedings and to prohibit any Provincial Court Judge from proceeding with
the matter. The notice of motion was served on the Provincial Court Judge with
the endorsement prescribed by Rule 6 of the Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules requiring
him to make a return of the record to the Supreme Court. The motion to prohibit
was made returnable on October 10, 1975, in accordance with the Rules. However
on October 3 the Provincial Court Judge before whom the matter came directed
that the trial proceed on October 8. Counsel for appellant did not draw to the
Court’s attention that he had moved for prohibition. On October 8, on being
advised of the motion the case was set over to October 15 to set a new trial
date. Because the transcript of proceedings (Rule 8) was not ready there were
several consent adjournments of the motion eventually to December 5, 1975. Neither appellant nor his
counsel appeared before the Provincial Court on October 15. A different Provincial Court Judge presided and a
new Crown counsel appeared and asked for a bench warrant for the arrest of the
appellant. The arrest was made but

[Page 989]

appellant released on a recognizance of $500
with one surety. The case was then remanded for one week to December 11, 1975.
On December 5 a second notice of motion was brought seeking to quash the
warrant of arrest, set aside the order for a recognizance and the recognizance,
asking for prohibition and asking that the return required Rule 7 be made. Both
motions were then adjourned to December 12 and then to December 23. The remand
date of December 11 had intervened and, while neither appellant nor his counsel
appeared and the judge issued a bench warrant, counsel who had previously
appeared for him addressed the Court as amicus curiae and objected that
the Court had no jurisdiction to make any order in the matter before it. The
judge suggested that the execution of the warrant be postponed pending
termination of the prohibition proceedings. That same afternoon the case was
called again and an order sought and made for forfeiture of appellant’s bail.
This resulted in a third notice of motion for prohibition. All three motions
were dismissed on December 23 on the basis that the service of the notices of
motion to prohibit did not deprive, suspend or strip of jurisdiction the Provincial
Court Judge. The subsequent appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal without
reasons.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ.: The argument by the Crown that if the
effect of a motion for prohibition and for an order to quash is to suspend the
jurisdiction of the Provincial Court Judge pending disposal of the motion,
there would be a stultification of criminal proceedings in the Provincial
Courts, was not persuasive. Such an argument could equally apply to any
proceedings, civil or criminal, available to challenge the jurisdiction of an
inferior Court Judge, and Superior Courts are well able to control abuses of
process should they occur or recur. However the matter is regarded there must
be a suspension of jurisdiction when an application to quash or an application
to prohibit and to quash is served on an inferior court with the command, under
the rules, to make a return forthwith. The judge compelled to make the return
cannot go on with the matter before him until the application to the Superior
Court is disposed of. While not holding that there was any loss of jurisdiction
in the Provincial Court

[Page 990]

the unexplained delay by the Provincial Court
Judges to make the return forthwith had the same effect as if a return was
properly made whereupon jurisdiction was suspended. Hence the Provincial Court had no power to order the
arrest of the accused, no power to require that he enter into a recognizance of
bail and no power to order forfeiture of bail. Jurisdiction over the accused in
respect of the charges was not however lost by the Provincial
 Court.

Per Martland,
Richie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The main issue is the
effect of the service of a notice of motion for prohibition and to quash
proceedings pending in the Provincial Court on the jurisdiction of that Court,
in a case where the judge served with the notice has neglected to make the
return required by Rule 7 forthwith to the Registrar of the Supreme
Court. If the Provincial Judge complies with the mandatory direction in Rule 7
he is left with nothing on which to proceed with the case and can take no
further steps concerning it unless or until the order is refused in which event
the clerk of the court refusing the motion is authorized to return the matter
to the jurisdiction from which it was removed in terms of s. 714  of the Criminal
Code . Notwithstanding any differences which may exist between civil and
criminal proceedings by way of certiorari, s. 714  contemplates the subsistence
of the Provincial Court’s
jurisdiction between service of the notice and disposal of the motion by the
Supreme Court. The jurisdiction continues, though dormant, at least until such
time as the motion is granted. The failure of the Provincial Court Judges to
make the required return may well be the subject of other proceedings but could
not be treated as affecting the continued jurisdiction of that Court which is
recognized by the Criminal Code .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
reasons an appeal from a judgment of O’Driscoll J. dismissing three motions for
prohibition. Appeal allowed to the extent of setting aside the warrant of
arrest, the recognizance of bail and the forfeiture of bail.

[Page 991]

H.J. Keenan, for the appellant.

Jeff Casey, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This Court is concerned in
this appeal with the main ground on which the appellant has challenged the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal affirming, without written reasons, the
judgment of O’Driscoll J. dismissing three motions by the appellant for
prohibition directed to certain Provincial Court Judges and seeking also orders
quashing informations charging offences under ss. 234  and 236  of the Criminal
Code . That ground relates to the effect of service of such a motion as
aforesaid, made pursuant to Rules 4 and 5 of the Ontario Criminal Rules, upon
the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court Judge to proceed with pending charges,
and to the effect upon his jurisdiction of his failure to make a return
forthwith to the Registrar’s Office of the Supreme Court of Ontario, as
prescribed by Rule 7 of the Criminal Rules.

The appellant raised other issues in this
appeal, including a contention that a Provincial Court Judge was powerless to
grant more than one adjournment under s. 738(1)  of the Criminal Code , at
it stood at the time of the proceedings herein, but this Court did not call
upon the respondent Crown to deal with them, being unanimously of the opinion
that they were without merit in the present case. I would add, parenthetically,
that an amendment to the Criminal Code , enacted by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c.
93, s. 43  as s. 440.1 , and which came into force on April 26, 1976, after the
proceedings in this case commenced, now provides that there is no loss of
jurisdiction by a failure to comply with the provisions of the Criminal Code 
relating to adjournments or remands.

It is said by the Crown, on the point in issue
in this appeal, that if the appellant is correct in his submission that the
effect of service of a notice of motion for prohibition and for an order to
quash is to suspend the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court Judge, pending
disposition of the motion, there would be a stultification of criminal
proceedings in

[Page 992]

the Provincial Courts, a means of paralyzing
criminal process. This argument, of itself, is hardly persuasive and is an
argument, really in terrorem, which can be made with respect to any
proceedings, civil or criminal, which are available to challenge the
jurisdiction of an inferior Court Judge to proceed with a matter before him.
Superior Courts are well able to control abuses of process if they occur and if
they recur. The issue raised by the appellant must be dealt with on its merits,
and there is, apparently, a need to do so to provide guidance in this area of
the law.

There is no doubt, on the record herein, that
there were tactical moves involved in connection with the charges laid against
the accused, a jockeying or manoeuvering on adjournments that could easily have
been cut off if any one of the Provincial Court Judges before whom the
proceedings successively came had simply asserted his authority and given
peremptory directions for trial both to the Crown and to the accused. That,
unfortunately, was not done until the accused had been before the Court for
four successive weeks on the new informations sworn against him when those
first laid were declared nullities on a date fixed for trial thereon. Moreover,
it was not until the third notice of motion to prohibit and to quash was
brought that the Provincial Court Judge to whom it was directed made the return
required by Ontario
Criminal Rule 7. There was an interval of more than
two and one half months (from October 1, 1975 to December 18, 1975) between the launching of
the first and third motions.

I turn to the chronology of events in this case.
The accused was charged on April 3, 1975, was brought before the Provincial
Court on the same day, and, on indication by him that he wished to retain
counsel, the case was adjourned to April 17, 1975 (presumably by consent) to
set a date for trial. On the latter date, the accused appeared with counsel and
it was agreed that the trial would proceed on July 9, 1975. When the case then
came on before Judge Munro, objection was taken to the informations as being defective
on their face. Crown counsel it was who said they were nullities,

[Page 993]

and the informations were quashed accordingly.
Two new informations charging the same offences were laid on July 17, 1975 and the accused was summoned to
appear on September 12, 1975.

Counsel for the accused wished to proceed at
that time but Crown counsel stated that the case was “not marked for trial
today”, and he added “This is the first time up, and it is merely to set a date
for trial” and further (when defence counsel objected) “That is the standard
procedure”. Again defence counsel insisted on going on and appealed to the
Court for a ruling, adding that it was unfair to the accused to be put off
again and contending that in view of the previous proceedings September 12 must
be taken as a trial date. The Crown was not ready with any witnesses and the
trial judge, Judge Rennicks, said he would follow “the practice here... that on
the first time up he would be granted an adjournment”. It was of course “the
first time up” on the new informations but not the first time up for the
charges against the accused.

It is clear from the exchanges of counsel at the
time that defence counsel felt that the criminal process was being abused, but
when Crown counsel asked him if he had a trial date to suggest he said “no”,
and refused to consent to the Crown’s suggestion of November 18, 1975. It is obvious to me that
the proper course for the trial judge to have taken was to fix a trial date but
instead he remanded the matter to September 19, 1975 to set a date for trial.
Defence counsel then said “Might that be a date to commence trial?”, whereupon
Crown counsel said that his police officer witness was on holidays but “he’ll
be here in November”. Defence counsel objected and refused again to consent to
have the case go over to November 18, more than two months away. The Court then
said “Well then all I can do is to remand it for a week”. That, however, was
far from being all he could do.

[Page 994]

On September 19, 1975, the case came up again
before a third Provincial Court Judge, Judge Newall, and the Crown too was
represented by a third counsel. There was again a contention by the defence
that the trial should go on but the matter had been marked to set a date for
trial. The Crown, wishing to go on with other cases, asked that defence counsel
consent to trial on November 21, but when the latter refused Crown counsel said
“I am suggesting one week, September 26th to set a date”. Defence counsel asked
“Can we have a trial at some stage of these proceedings, Your Honour?” The
Court did not fix a date but simply accepted Crown counsel’s suggestion to put
the case over for a week, and the last entry on the transcript is Crown
counsel’s statement “To set a date for trial”. There is legitimate ground to
wonder who was in charge of the Court’s proceedings.

So the case came back on September 26, and
although this time the Judge was the same, a fourth counsel appeared for the
Crown. It seems to me that he misstated the position when he said, referring to
what occurred on September 19, “there was no consent to the adjournment last
time and we had to put it over till today”. What defence counsel wanted was a
trial date to be fixed by the Court and not another adjournment to fix a trial
date. During the proceedings on September 26, defence counsel referred again,
as he had on the earlier occasions, to an alleged representation to him by the
Crown that the charges would not be re-laid. Crown counsel said he knew nothing
of this and would check, and the matter was stood down temporarily to enable
him to do so. When it was called again after a recess, this is what the
transcript discloses:

MR. KRUPNIK [Crown Counsel]: Returning
to the matter of Fred Batchelor, Your Honour, I’ve tried to get in touch with
Mr. Applegath who is the acting Crown in the Scarborough
 Court, but he was in the process of proceeding with a
trial and could not get out to speak to me. I have therefore spoken to
Mr. Peter Rickaby of the Crown Attor-

[Page 995]

ney’s office of this Judicial District and
advised him of the facts. He in fact remembered speaking to Mr. Batchelor
and advised him that the Crown would be proceeding in this matter, and he also
advised Mr. Evans of that fact.

THE COURT: I am going to put this matter
over for obvious reasons and I think you know what they are Mr. Evans.

MR. EVANS: I would be obliged if you
would put it on the record for what reason you are putting it over. I might
indicate at this time I don’t see the point in putting it over.

THE COURT: I can’t deal with the matter for
obvious reasons.

MR. KRUPNIK: Your Honour, this is not
a trial date, this is just a date to set a date.

And so, again, despite objections by the
defence, and the Court not taking the matter in hand, an adjournment was
directed by Judge Newall to October 3, 1975, Crown counsel stating without any remark on the matter by the
Court that it was to set a date for trial. In his factum in this Court, counsel
for the Crown said that Judge Newall disqualified himself and adjourned the
matter accordingly, but I do not find this in the transcript of the particular
proceedings, although it appears from the subsequent proceedings on October 3
that Crown counsel had told the Judge on September 26 that the Crown wanted to
proceed against the accused because he had a record, and it was because of this
disclosure that Judge Newall said that he could not hear the matter.

Of course, the Judge was precluded by s. 738(1) 
of the Criminal Code  from adjourning the matter for more than eight days
unless there was consent for a more extended enlargement but a trial date could
have been indicated, and, lacking consent, there could be adjournments made
within the terms of s. 738(1)  to bring the parties to that date.

On September 29, 1975 the accused moved to quash
the order adjourning the case and to quash the proceedings, and also to
prohibit Judge Newall or any other Provincial Court Judge from proceeding with
the matter. The notice of motion questioned the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court to

[Page 996]

make repeated adjournments, the allegation being
that there was no proper exercise of judicial discretion in allowing the
adjournments and that there was undue hardship on the accused, amounting to a
denial of natural justice, when he had been ready on four successive occasions
to proceed to trial. The notice of motion contained the endorsement prescribed
by Rule 6 of the Ontario Criminal Rules, as follows:

By virtue of Rule 7 of Part I of the Rules
Respecting Criminal Proceedings of the Supreme Court of Ontario, you are, upon
receiving this notice, to return forthwith to the Registrar’s Office at
Toronto, the Orders herein referred to, together with the information, exhibits
and other papers or documents touching the matter, as fully and as entirely as
they remain in your custody, together with this notice and the certificate
prescribed in the said Rule.

An affidavit of service of the notice of motion
on Judge Newall on October 1, 1975 was sworn on October 2, 1975. The motion was made returnable on October 10, 1975, this being in accordance with
the Ontario Criminal
Rules.

It will be convenient to set out the relevant
Rules at this point, they being Rules 4 to 8 inclusive:

4. (1) Proceedings in criminal matters by
way certiorari, mandamus and prohibition shall be brought by originating
notice, and may include an application to quash a conviction, order, warrant or
inquisition, and an application for discharge of a person in custody.

(2) Such proceedings shall be brought
before a Judge of the High Court of Justice sitting in court.

5. Notice of a motion that includes an
application to quash shall be served within thirty days of the conviction,
order, warrant or inquisition sought to be quashed, shall be returnable within
ten days of service of the notice of motion, and shall be served at least seven
days before the return day thereof upon the judge, Provincial Judge, justice or
justices making the conviction or order, or issuing the warrant, or the coroner
making the inquisition, and upon the informant (if he is not a peace officer),
and upon the Attorney General (if he is not the applicant). The notice shall
specify the objections intended to be raised, and no other objections may be
raised save by leave of the Judge hearing the matter.

[Page 997]

(Note: as to other notices of motion, see
Rules 215-217 of Practice and Procedure.)

6. Upon a notice of motion under Rule 5
shall be endorsed a notice in the following form, addressed to the judge,
Provincial Judge, justice or justices, or coroner as the case may be:

“By virtue of Rule 7 of Part I of the Rules
Respecting Criminal Proceedings of the Supreme Court of Ontario, you are, upon
receiving this notice, to return forthwith to the Registrar’s Office, at
Toronto, the conviction (or as the case may be) herein referred to, together
with the information, exhibits and other papers or documents touching the
matter, as fully and as entirely as they remain in your custody, together with
this notice and the certificate prescribed in the said rule.

                                                     C.D.

                                                     Solicitor
for the Applicant

To: A.B.

                                                     Provincial
Judge at

                                                                              (or
as the case may be)”

7. Upon receiving the notice so endorsed,
the judge, Provincial Judge, justice or justices, or coroner shall forthwith
return to the Registrar’s Office at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, the conviction,
order, warrant or inquisition, together with the indictment, information,
exhibits and any other papers or documents touching the matter, and the notice
served upon him with a certificate attached thereto in the following form:

“Pursuant to the accompanying notice, I
herewith return to this Honourable Court the following:

“1. The indictment or information;

“2. The conviction (or as the case may be);

“3. The exhibits;

“4. Any other papers or documents touching
the matter.

“And I hereby certify to this Honourable
Court that I have above truly set forth all exhibits, papers and documents in
my custody or power relating to the matter set forth in the said notice of
motion.”

8. (1) The documents listed in the
certificate together with the transcript of the proceedings (if any be supplied
by the applicant) shall have the same effect as a return to a writ of
certiorari.

(2) The Judge hearing the application may
direct a further or amended return.

Before the return date of the motion, the
accused appeared again with counsel before the

[Page 998]

Provincial Court, this time before Judge McEwan,
on October 3, 1975. Again there were exchanges between counsel (the same Crown
counsel this time who had appeared on September 26 and the same counsel who had
appeared for the accused throughout) but the Judge took a stronger stand than
the Court had exhibited previously and directed, peremptory to the Crown, that
the trial proceed on October 8. Counsel for the accused did not disclose the
fact that he had moved for prohibition, a matter that ought certainly to have
been drawn to the Court’s attention.

When the case was called on October 8, the same
Crown counsel appeared but another counsel appeared for the accused, a partner
of accused’s previous counsel. Crown counsel immediately advised the Court, the
Judge being Judge Camblin, of the motion to quash and for prohibition
returnable on October 10, said he was ready to proceed but suggested that in
view of the motion the case should be adjourned to some day after the motion
was heard. Defence counsel contended that there was nothing the Provincial Court could do because the
record ought to have been returned to the Supreme Court and that Court would
decide whether the case would be returned to the Provincial
 Court for hearing. Judge Camblin feared that if he did
nothing jurisdiction might be lost and so he put the case over to October 15 to
set a new trial date.

The motion for prohibition came before the Weekly Court in Toronto on October 10, 1975
but was adjourned on consent to October 23 because the transcript of the
proceedings (referred to in Criminal Rule 8) was not ready. Successive
adjournments, apparently for the same reason, were made on consent on October
23 and November 13, the adjournment on the latter date being to December 5, 1975.

The accused did not appear before the Provincial Court on October 15 nor was
counsel there on his behalf. A different Provincial Judge presided and a new
Crown counsel appeared who asked immediately for a bench warrant for the arrest
of the accused. There was no reference to the motion for prohibition in the one
page transcript of the proceedings. The Judge directed issue of the war-

[Page 999]

rant. The accused was arrested on December 4, 1975 and taken before Judge Gardhouse
who, on the suggestion of Crown counsel, directed that the accused be released
on entering into a recognizance in the amount of $500 with one surety. Duty
counsel appeared for the accused and accepted this as satisfactory, and the
case was then remanded for a week to December 11, 1975.

On December 5, 1975, the adjourned date of the
first motion for prohibition a second notice of motion as of that date, was
brought before Osler J. seeking to quash the warrant of arrest and to set aside
the order for a recognizance and also the recognizance, asking for prohibition,
and also asking that Judge Newall or any other Provincial Judge make the return
required by Criminal Rule 7. This second notice of motion was served on the
agent of the Attorney‑General present at that time and also on Judge Gardhouse,
Osler J. having directed abridgement of the time for service on Judge
Gardhouse.

Osler J. adjourned both motions for prohibition
to December 12, 1975, noting on
the record that this was by reason of the failure of the Provincial Judge to
forward the record as required by Criminal Rule 7. On December 12, 1975, the
two motions for prohibition were further adjourned on consent to December 23, 1975.

In the meantime, the remand date of December 11
intervened, and Crown counsel who had appeared on September 26, October 3 and
October 8, informed Judge Bigelow, who was presiding in the Court, that
prohibition proceedings had been taken. Crown counsel had been advised by
counsel for the accused that it was not likely the accused would appear and so
Crown counsel intended to ask for a bench warrant. Judge Bigelow first
expressed doubt whether he could issue such a warrant in view of the fact that
the Supreme Court of Ontario
had prohibition proceedings before it. After being told that the accused was
supposed to appear so a trial date could be set, Judge Bigelow issued the
warrant, saying that was the only way jurisdiction could be retained. Although
the accused did not appear on December 11 nor was he represented, counsel who
had appeared for him on October 8 asked to address the Court as amicus

[Page 1000]

curiae and
thereupon objected that the Court had no jurisdiction to make any order in the
matter before it. Judge Bigelow was inclined to agree, but after hearing from
Crown counsel he suggested that execution of the bench warrant be postponed
pending termination of the prohibition proceedings and to be governed by the
outcome of the prohibition proceedings.

This seemed to be satisfactory but in the
afternoon of December 11 the accused’s case was called again and, he not
appearing, an order was sought and made that the bail he had given after being
arrested on December 4, 1975 be forfeited. On December 18, 1975, a third notice
of motion for prohibition, dated December 17, was served on Judge Bigelow and a
copy delivered to the Attorney-General, returnable on December 23, 1975. This notice of motion, in
addition to asking for an order of prohibition, asked that the warrant of
arrest and the estreat of bail be set aside and, as well, the recognizance of
bail entered into on December 4, 1975.

On December 23, 1975 the three motions for
prohibition came before O’Driscoll J. who dismissed all of them, stating that

The service of a notice of motion to
prohibit the Provincial Court
judge did not deprive, suspend or strip him of jurisdiction, although he may
have proceeded thereafter at his own peril.

In my view, there was nothing said, done or
happened in the Provincial Court that brought about any loss or lessening of
the jurisdiction of that court to hear the two outstanding charges against the
accused Applicant. Consequently, each of the three applications to prohibit
will be dismissed.

He refused to make an order as to costs because
of “the failure of those at the Provincial Court to carry out the terms of the Rules Respecting Criminal
Proceedings”. As to this failure, he remarked:

Under no circumstances could I, nor do I
wish to be taken as having placed any stamp of approval upon the actions of
those in the Provincial Court, Old City Hall, Toronto, who have chosen to
disregard or ignore the provisions of Rule 7 under Rules Respecting Criminal

[Page 1001]

Proceedings from October 1, 1975, until
approximately mid-December, 1975. On the hearings before me, Counsel for the
Attorney General was unable to give any reason, let alone any satisfactory
reason, for the lateness of the return, nor was he able to explain why the Provincial Court judges involved did not
sign the certificates as required by Rule 7 (supra).

However, he castigated counsel who had appeared
for the accused prior to October 8, 1975 as having acted in a way “designed and
intended to obfuscate the proceedings before the various Provincial Court
Judges”, a harsh assessment in my opinion if based on that counsel’s
unwillingness to consent to Crown counsel’s convenience as to a date for trial.
Further, he characterized the motions for prohibition as coming perilously
close to an abuse of process.

O’Driscoll J.’s short reasons contained no
exposition of the effect of service of a notice of motion for prohibition upon
the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court Judge, or of the effect on jurisdiction
of a Provincial Court Judge’s failure to make a return. The Court of Appeal saw
nothing in the case that warranted any reasons for judgment on these matters,
probably because a return had been made on or about December 22, (even if
irregular because the certificate was signed by a court clerk) and was before
O’Driscoll J. on December 23, 1975. In my opinion, the two matters deserve
consideration in the light of the law as it was when prohibition and certiorari
involved two-step procedures, and in light of the fact that there is now no
need to ask first for issue of a writ and, especially, in light of the terms of
Criminal Rule 8 providing that the return required by Rule 7 together with the
transcript of proceedings (if any be supplied by the applicant) shall have the
same effect as a return to a writ of certiorari.

The Rules of Practice of the Quebec Court of
Queen’s Bench (Crown Side), S1/74-53, effective June 1, 1974 take a clear and direct line
on the matters aforesaid. Section 19 of those Rules provides

[Page 1002]

Service of the motion suspends proceedings
in the inferior tribunal but the Judge may at any time, even on an ex parte application,
give an order permitting such proceedings to continue.

Section 20 of the Quebec Rules directs
transmission of the record of the case immediately after service of the motion
and, in this respect, is similar to Ontario Criminal Rule 7.

Although the Ontario Rules do not speak clearly on
whether or when prohibition and certiorari proceedings have a suspensive
effect on proceedings in the inferior Court, the obvious resort is to consider
what is the effect, in this connection, of a return to a writ of certiorari,
within the meaning of Ontario Criminal Rule 8. I note here that although
for convenience of reference, I have referred to the three motions brought on
behalf of the accused as motions for prohibition they each include applications
to quash, as is permitted by Ontario Criminal Rule 5, and were in conformity
with Rule 6, requiring the return of the record forthwith as is provided by
Rule 7.

I note too that the concern here is with
criminal not civil proceedings, and hence pronouncements in respect of civil
proceedings such as that made by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re Cedarvale
Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers’ International Union[1], at p. 49, are not applicable. In that
case, Arnup J.A. speaking for the Court said this, speaking of administrative
tribunals of an adjudicative character:

It is also clear law that such a tribunal
is not required to bring its proceedings to a halt merely because it has been
served with a notice of motion for an order of certiorari or
prohibition. It is entitled, if it thinks fit, to carry its pending proceedings
forward until such time as an order of the Court has actually been made
prohibiting its further activity or quashing some order already made by which
it assumed jurisdiction.

Arnup J.A. went on to refer to and to discuss Re
Holman and Rea[2], but
did not make any point of the fact that it concerned prohibition in respect of
criminal proceedings (a summary trial of the accused), the prohibition being
sought by the com-

[Page 1003]

plainant and not by the accused. He noted that
the Ontario Divisional Court, in the reasons of Middleton J. (the others
agreeing in the result), put the suspension of proceedings on a basis of
courtesy rather than on an obligatory basis where the magistrate purports to
proceed with the matter before him, although knowing his jurisdiction is
disputed and even after having been served with a notice of motion for
prohibition. This is a correct view since Middleton J. said, clearly enough
(after observing that it would have been more consistent with judicial dignity
to have enlarged the hearing until the question of jurisdiction had been
determined) that “there is no power in the Court to stay proceedings in an
inferior Court pending the hearing of the motion” (at p. 439). However,
Middleton J. cited in support In re Miron v. McCabe[3], which involved prohibition arising out of
a purely civil matter, a claim in a Division Court whose jurisdiction was disputed.

In his reasons in Re Holman and Rea Middleton
J. observed, at p. 438, that “counsel failed to point out any
section authorizing the adoption of the course pursued in this case. The
case, therefore, falls to be determined upon general principles”. At the time
that Re Holman and Rea was decided, prohibition was not within the Ontario
Criminal Rules, being introduced into them only on May 7, 1973 when the
present Rules were passed effective September 1, 1973. Although s. 533 of the Criminal
Code  of 1892 authorized the making of Rules respecting prohibition as well
as respecting other prerogative writs (the power is now found in s. 438  of the Criminal
Code ), the Ontario Rules, passed March 27, 1908 dealt only with motions to
quash. They included, however, the provisions which are now found in Ontario
Criminal Rules 5, 6, 7 and 8. In Re Holman and Rea, so far as appears,
the motion in that case did not include an application to quash, as is the case
here.

Notwithstanding the view taken in Re Holman
and Rea that an inferior court ought to desist as a matter of courtesy when
it is aware of the chal-

[Page 1004]

lenge to its jurisdiction brought before a
superior court, the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Hannon v. Eisler[4], a case dealing with custody proceedings,
said speaking through Coyne J.A. (at p. 195) that “as a general rule I think it
can be laid down that the inferior tribunal is bound to desist on application
for prohibition in the Queen’s Bench and while an appeal is pending in the
Court of Appeal from a decision thereon if the tribunal is aware of [the]
application or appeal because, among other reasons, such an appeal is ‘a step in
the cause or matter in which it is taken’: Court of Appeal Rule 1; and the
cause or matter is not complete until after the step, if undertaken is
completed”.

Arnup J.A. said in the Cedarvale case
that Re Holman and Rea was followed in Hannon v. Eisler. That was
so, but not on the point under discussion here. Middleton J. was followed only
in so far as the right to have prohibition was concerned, but he was not
followed on the question of the suspensive effect of service of a notice of
motion for prohibition on the proceedings in the inferior court. The two cases
clearly diverge on this question.

The Rules of the Alberta Supreme Court
respecting Crown Practice are similar to the present Ontario Criminal Rules. There is provision for moving by notice of motion without first
seeking a rule or an order nisi; there is provision for service and for
endorsing on the notice of motion a notice requiring a return forthwith of the
record, and there is a requirement that the magistrate or justice make the
return forthwith to the clerk of the Supreme Court with an endorsed certificate
in a prescribed form specifying what is in the return. The relevant Rules
conclude with Rule 866 which states that “the certificate shall have the same
effect as a return to a writ of certiorari”. In Frankel v. The Queen[5], the Alberta Appellate Division held that
an application for prohibition with certiorari in aid, directed to a
magistrate in respect of criminal proceedings before him, has the effect, upon
service of the application upon him, of

[Page 1005]

suspending the criminal proceedings but that the
Court, upon disposing of the application and dismissing it where it has no
merit, may make an order by way of procedendo and send the proceedings
back to the magistrate to continue with the matter that was before him.

It is clear from this judgment that the Alberta
Appellate Division, although concerned as its reasons disclosed, about possible
abuse in the resort by an accused to extraordinary remedies, felt that it was
obliged to respect the proceedings so taken by an accused but would deal with
them speedily to avoid undue delay in the carrying out of judicial processes.
It does not appear from the reasons whether the magistrate in the Frankel case
made the required return to the application for prohibition with certiorari in
aid. Ex facie, the Alberta Appellate Division’s reasons treat the mere
service of the notice of motion upon the magistrate as sufficient to suspend
his jurisdiction pending disposition of the motion; and if this is so, then, a
fortiori, is there a suspension upon the return of the record to the
superior court since there is nothing then left before the inferior court upon
which it can proceed.

The relevant inquiry is then whether the
inferior court can continue to exercise its jurisdiction by refusing or failing
to make the return which the Rules require to be made “forthwith”? That court
cannot be in a better position by non-compliance with a statutory duty than it
would be in if the duty had been carried out. O’Driscoll J.’s mild admonishment
of the inferior court in this case for ignoring the requirements of Criminal
Rule 7 for about two and one-half months was followed by his briefly stated
conclusion that service of the notice of motion for prohibition “did not deprive,
suspend or strip him of jurisdiction, although he may have proceeded thereafter
at his own peril”. I do not understand these concluding words unless they
relate to the eventual successful outcome of the accused’s application for
prohibition. Moreover, there is, in any event, no question of a complete loss
or deprivation of jurisdiction, but only of suspension while the prohibition
proceedings are on foot; and, if there is a suspensive effect,

[Page 1006]

the Provincial Court need be under no fear (as
Judge Camblin was) that it will lose jurisdiction if it does not keep bringing
the accused back within successive eight day periods; its jurisdiction can be
re‑asserted immediately upon the dismissal of the prohibition
proceedings.

This is provided by s. 714  of the Criminal
Code , which is in Part XXIII dealing with extraordinary remedies.
Section 714  is as follows:

714. Where a
motion to quash a conviction, order or other proceeding is refused, the order
of the court refusing the application is sufficient authority for the clerk of
the court forthwith to return the conviction, order or proceeding to the court
from which or the person from whom it was removed, and for proceedings to be
taken with respect thereto for the enforcement thereof.

Clearly, this section, which was in the original
Criminal Code  of 1892 as s. 895 , makes it unnecessary to invoke the old
procedure of a procedendo which the Alberta Appellate Division resorted
to, apparently ex abundanti cautela, in the Frankel case. Of
course, the fact that a procedendo was necessary under the old procedure
was indicative of the need for some affirmative direction by the superior court
to enable the inferior court to re-assert its jurisdiction.

I come, at long last, to consider what
significance is to be attached to Ontario Criminal Rule 8 providing that the
return under the certificate (prescribed by Rule 7) “shall have the same effect
as a return to a writ of certiorari”. At common law, a writ of certiorari
had to be authorized by an order of the Court upon an application for the
issue of the writ. The order having directed the issue of the writ, the
inferior court was directed by the writ to return the record of the challenged
proceedings together with the writ to the superior court. An order or rule nisi
followed requiring the Judge of the inferior court to show cause why the
application to quash should not succeed. Following a hearing on the matter, the
rule nisi would be discharged or made absolute in favour of the
applicant. Statutory and Rule modifications of the procedure were introduced
over the years. For example, in England, the application for the writ

[Page 1007]

to quash a summary conviction could be made ex
parte and an order nisi obtained requiring the inferior court to
show cause: see Short and Mellor, The Practice of the Crown Office (2nd
ed. 1908), pp. 49-57. Procedural changes in the Provinces of Canada resulted in
dispensing with the need for an order or rule nisi: see Tremeear, Criminal
Code  (6th ed. 1964), pp. 1286‑1289. An indication of the older
practice in Ontario before the introduction of the modern simplified procedure
may be gleaned from R. v. Cluff[6]; and
see also Daly, Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice (3rd ed. 1936),
pp. 405-421 (and especially the Forms at pp. 413-421).

The material point for present purposes is that
the common law was clear that upon the service of the writ of certiorari upon
the Judge of the inferior court the proceedings before him out of which they
arose were suspended: see 4 Blackstone, Commentaries (1st ed. reprint),
Book IV, c. 24, p. 315; Paley, Summary Convictions (9th ed. 1926), p.
835; Seager, Criminal Proceedings Before Magistrates (3rd ed. 1930), p.
451.

When the Ontario Judges adopted their Criminal
Rules of 1908 and provided therein for a simplified procedure in respect of
certiorari to quash which, upon a return being made, would be dealt with
on the merits by the superior court (and thus displace the elaborate procedure
of first seeking a writ of certiorari, to which, if issued, a return
would be made, and then going back for a hearing on the merits), a question was
raised in R. v. Titchmarsh[7],
whether the rule-making authorization in the Criminal Code  empowered the
Judges to abolish the writ of certiorari and to substitute the
simplified procedure of a notice of motion. The power to do so was upheld by
the Ontario Appellate Division. Riddell J., speaking for the Court, pointed out
that although the writ of certiorari was abolished, the remedy remained,
and it was the remedy that the Criminal Code  was concerned with. As he
put it, under the Rules “the remedy

[Page 1008]

exists; the manner of obtaining it is
different—that is all” (at p. 578).

As in criminal matters so too in civil matters,
the complex common law procedure, regulated though it was by Rules, was
displaced in Ontario (and
elsewhere in Canada) by the
simple notice of motion: see, now, The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.
228, s. 69. Accused persons and civil law litigants were thus empowered to
operate the machinery of the Court, without the Court’s prior intervention, and
to require the presiding Judge of the inferior court to make a return to
process issued unilaterally by them.

In the Frankel case, the Alberta
Appellate Division applied the common law rule to the simplified procedure that,
similar to that of Ontario, is
prescribed in the Alberta Rules on Crown Practice. In short, although there is
now no prior order of a Court for issue of a writ of prohibition with certiorari
in aid, the service of an authorized application for such a remedy was
given the same suspensive effect upon the proceedings in the inferior Court as
was given at common law upon service of a writ of certiorari granted by
order of the Court. An illustration of this result under the common law
practice a few years before the Ontario Criminal Rules of 1908 were
promulgated is seen in R. v. Foster[8].
There the accused was convicted of a liquor offence after a trial in his
absence, and a warrant of commitment was issued for his imprisonment pursuant
to the sentence imposed upon him. The day prior to the conviction and sentence,
a writ of certiorari for which the accused had obtained an order a few
days earlier was served on the Judge and Crown Attorney. There was apparently a
return to the writ and the discharge of the accused from custody was sought on
the return of a writ of habeas corpus. The discharge was ordered by
Street J. who said that “the proceedings against Robert Foster were removed
from the Court below by the certiorari issued on 30th January, 1903
and served on Judge Bell on the 2nd February, 1903 and that the subsequent
proceedings taken before him were void” (at p. 627). He

[Page 1009]

restated the principle at the conclusion of his
reasons, as follows (at p. 628):

...as there appears to have been no authority
in the Court below to issue the commitment under which the prisoner is held,
after the proceedings before it had been removed by certiorari, there must be
an order for his discharge from custody.

I am not aware of any other effect at common law
of a return to a writ of certiorari than that the inferior court, having
nothing before it, was powerless to continue with any proceedings against an
accused. The common law did not make suspension of inferior court proceedings
contingent upon a return to the writ but as following from mere service
thereof. There may have been some misunderstanding of the situation when the
1908 Rules were promulgated, these Rules having abolished the writ of certiorari
altogether, as noted in R. v. Titchmarsh; and it may have been
thought that by reason of the simplified procedure the direction for a return
of the record would make it abundantly clear that thereafter the inferior court
was powerless to proceed. As put by Létourneau, The Prerogative Writs in
Canadian Criminal Law and Procedure (1976), at p. 161:

...in criminal law, the transmission of the
record of the proceedings to the superior court, as required to be made
forthwith by most rules of court on an application for certiorari, in fact
operates as a stay of proceedings.

The author goes on to say that the inferior
court is deprived of its jurisdiction to resume the proceedings as, after the
removal, nothing is left before it. I think it more accurate to say that the
proceedings are merely suspended pending the outcome of the contest in the
superior court; jurisdiction will indeed be lost if the application to prohibit
and quash is successful but, if not, it survives.

It seems to me that, however the matter is
regarded, there must be a suspension of jurisdiction when an application to
quash or a combined application to prohibit and to quash is served on

[Page 1010]

the inferior court with the command, under the
Rules, to make a return forthwith. The Judge, compelled to make the return,
cannot, unless he risk disobedience with its attendant consequences, go on with
the matter before him until the application to the superior court is disposed
of by dismissal thereof.

The result to which I would come in this case
may be shortly stated. I do not hold that there was any loss of jurisdiction in
the Provincial Court, but it is
my opinion that the unexplained and seemingly flagrant disregard by Provincial
Court Judges of the obligation cast upon them to make a return forthwith had
the same effect as if a return was properly made whereupon jurisdiction was
suspended. Hence, there was no power to order the arrest of the accused, no
power to require that he enter into a recognizance of bail, no power to order
forfeiture of bail. I would, accordingly, allow the appeal to the extent of setting
aside the warrant of arrest, the recognizance of bail and the forfeiture of
bail. Otherwise, I do not subscribe to the contentions of counsel for the
appellant that jurisdiction over the accused in respect of the charges against
him has been lost. The record should accordingly be returned to the Provincial Court so that the charges may be
tried and, I hope, with some expedition. I would also direct that an order of
protection of the various Provincial Court Judges issue under Criminal Code ,
s. 717 .

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and de Grandpré JJ., in which Dickson J. also concurred, was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in which he has accurately
recounted the very complicated set of facts giving rise to this appeal and as
he has also reproduced Rules 4 to 8 inclusive of the Ontario Criminal Rules,
(hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”) it will be unnecessary for me to
recite them again in full.

The main issue in this appeal is the effect of
the service of an originating notice for prohibition and to quash certain
proceedings pending in the Pro-

[Page 1011]

vincial Court on the jurisdiction of that Court,
in a case where the judge upon whom the notice is served has neglected to ‘‘forthwith
return to the Registrar’s Office at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, the conviction,
order, warrant or inquisition together with the indictment, information,
exhibits and any other papers or documents touching the matter...” as he is
required to do by the terms of Rule 7.

There is no doubt in this case that the
necessary notice and endorsement were duly served on the Provincial Court
Judges in accordance with the requirement of Rule 6 and it follows that upon
receiving the notice so endorsed, the Judges were seized with the duty to
return the requisite documents forthwith to the Registrar under Rule 7.

It appears to me that if the Provincial Judge
complies with the mandatory direction contained in Rule 7 to return all papers
touching the matter before him forthwith on receipt of the notice, he is left
with nothing upon which to proceed with the case and, as a practical matter, he
can take no further steps concerning it unless or until the order is refused by
the Judge of the Supreme Court who hears the motion, in which event the clerk
of that Court is authorized to return the proceeding to the jurisdiction from
which it was removed in accordance with s. 714  of the Criminal Code  to
which the Chief Justice refers and which reads as follows:

714. Where a
motion to quash a conviction, order or other proceeding is refused, the order
of the court refusing the application is sufficient authority for the clerk of
the court forthwith to return the conviction, order or proceeding to the court
from which or the person from whom it was removed, and for proceedings to be
taken with respect thereto for the enforcement thereof.

Notwithstanding any differences which may exist
between civil and criminal proceedings by way of certiorari, and apart
from procedural problems which may arise in determining the effect to be given
to “a return of a writ of certiorari” under Rule 8, I am satisfied that s. 714 
contemplates the subsistance of the Provincial Court’s jurisdiction between the
service of the notice and the disposal of the motion by the Supreme Court. This
section

[Page 1012]

in my view constitutes recognition by the
Parliament of Canada of the
continuation of this jurisdiction, though dormant, at least until such time as
the motion is granted. If it were otherwise the provisions for return of the
proceedings in the event of the refusal of the application would be
meaningless.

The second question raised by this appeal is
whether the unjustified and unexplained conduct of the Provincial Court Judges
in failing to make a return as they were required to do by Rule 7 is to be
treated as extinguishing that Court’s jurisdiction. I cannot accept the
suggestion that a Judge can obliterate the jurisdiction of his Court by
disobeying mandatory rules governing his conduct. It may well be that mandamus
would lie to compel such an official to comply with his duty, but the
persistent disregard of that duty by Judges cannot affect the continued
jurisdiction of the Court which is recognized by the Criminal Code .

It has been suggested that if the service of a
notice to quash in accordance with the Criminal Rules has the effect of
suspending the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court until it is disposed of in
the Supreme Court, the result will be that an accused person by his own act
could interrupt the course of his trial and stultify the proceedings against
him. In my view this suggestion presupposes that the Rules will be disobeyed by
the Judges in that no return will be made in accordance with Rule 7. It is,
however, not to be lightly assumed that the direction contained in the notice
served under Rule 6 would be ignored by a Provincial Judge and the
circumstances which developed in the present case must be regarded as
exceptional. If the return is made forthwith, I think it may be taken that the
motion will be dealt with expeditiously in the Supreme Court. In my opinion,
the proceedings are not brought to a halt by service of the notice, and if the
rules are complied with, the period of interruption of the hearing before the
Provincial Judge will be minimal.

For these reasons I would dispose of this appeal
in the manner proposed by the Chief Justice.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Practice—Prosecution by
indictment—Precondition—Previous conviction—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, as amended by R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2,
ss. 133(3), 133(7), 591.

Section 133(3)  of the Criminal Code  provides
that a person who fails to comply with a condition of his undertaking or
recognizance “is guilty of (a) an indictable offence…, or (b)
an offence punishable on summary conviction”. However according to
s. 133(7)  “where an accused is charged with an offence under
subsection (3) …he shall not be prosecuted by indictment unless he has
previously been convicted of an offence under this section”. Here the Crown
proceeded by indictment but offered no proof of previous conviction. For this
reason, the trial Judge acquitted the appellant. The Court of Appeal quashed
the acquittal stating that the absence of a previous conviction did not
exculpate the accused. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

It is clear from the mandatory words of
s. 133(7) that proof of a previous conviction is a precondition of
proceeding by indictment and is jurisdictional in that respect. This does not
mean that proof of a previous conviction must be offered before the indictment
is laid but, rather, that the actual trial cannot proceed as the trial of an
indictable offence until the Crown had provided proof of a previous conviction
under s. 133.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec setting aside the
acquittal by the trial Judge. Appeal allowed.

Bernard Lamarche, for the appellant.

Louis-Guy Robichaud, for the respondent.

[Page 522]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—There is one short but
important point in this appeal. It is here as of right because the Quebec Court
of Appeal set aside the acquittal of the accused on two charges under Criminal
Code , s. 133(3) (a). The acquittal was based on the failure of the
Crown to establish, as being fundamental under s. 133(7)  to its right to
proceed by indictment, that the accused had previously been convicted of an
offence under s. 133 .

Section 133(3)  reads as follows:

133. …

…

(3) Every one who, being at large on his
undertaking or recognizance given to or entered into before a justice or a
judge and being bound to comply with a condition of that undertaking or
recognizance directed by a justice or a judge, fails, without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, to comply with that condition, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The charges against the accused were laid
expressly under s. 133(3) (a), hence exposing the accused to a
greater penalty than if the charges were laid as summary conviction offences.
Section 133(7), which is central to this appeal is in these terms:

133. …

…

(7) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where an accused is charged with an offence under subsection (3),
(4) or (5), he shall not be prosecuted by indictment unless he has previously
been convicted of an offence under this section.

The Crown offered no proof of a previous
conviction nor was an admission of such a conviction sought from the accused.
The Crown’s position was put as follows by Casey J.A., who accepted it

[Page 523]

in speaking for the Quebec Court of Appeal:

The Crown now argues that C.C. 133(3)
creates the offence leaving it to the Crown to proceed one way or the other,
that a previous conviction is not an essential element and that Respondent
should have raised the objection in limine. With this I agree. The absence of a
previous conviction does not exculpate Respondent; it merely entitles him to be
tried under Part XXIV which means, in this case, that the punishment cannot go
beyond 722. In this case we are dealing only with a matter of procedure and so
far Respondent has not been prejudiced. For these reasons I would quash the
acquittal.

Casey J.A. concluded by ordering that the record
be returned to the Court of first instance “placing the parties in the position
they were in when the Crown declared its case closed”.

The Crown’s position in this Court was not that
proof of a previous conviction was an element of the offence but that, although
it was a pre-condition, its existence was to be presumed from the mere laying
of the indictment and that it was for the accused to prove otherwise. I cannot
agree with this view. It is clear from the mandatory words of s. 133(7),
“he shall not be prosecuted by indictment unless” etc., that proof of a
previous conviction is a precondition of proceeding by indictment and is
jurisdictional in that respect. This does not mean that proof of a previous
conviction must be offered before the indictment is laid but, rather, that the
actual trial cannot proceed as the trial of an indictable offence until the
Crown has provided proof of a previous conviction under s. 133. The
situation here lies outside of Criminal Code , s. 591  which is concerned
with a reference to previous convictions in an indictment and not to an a
priori condition of trial if the Crown chooses to proceed by indictment.

It follows, therefore, that this appeal must be
allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside. The trial Judge,
strictly speaking, ought

[Page 524]

to have quashed the proceedings because of the
Crown’s failure to satisfy the condition upon which they depended. Since it
does not appear, however, that the Crown had any proof of a previous conviction
to support its choice of proceeding by indictment, I would not interfere at
this late date (the time for summary conviction proceedings having long ago
run) with the trial Judge’s disposition made on July 15, 1976 and,
consequently, I would restore his judgment of acquittal.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA, APPEAL
DIVISION

Criminal law — Evidence — Rights of the accused — Voir dire —
Extent of procedural safeguards neces­sary to have inadmissible statements
withheld from the trier of fact.

The appellant was alleged to have been part of a
large scale operation to traffic in hashish. The plan was that the hashish was
to be cached on the Cape La Have Islands, just off the coast of Nova Scotia,
and to be taken from there by helicopter to the mainland for packaging and
resale. The appellant was a passenger on one of these flights but there was no
direct evidence that he was aware of the nature of the cargo. Subsequent to the
flight, appellant and another passenger were ques­tioned by uniformed R.C.M.P.
officers and they and others were arrested shortly thereafter. During the time
they were in custody they were interviewed by two officers and according to the
evidence of one of these officers ""as a result of conversation with the
accused and with some of the co-accused"" they went to a cottage and
removed some articles (clothing and toiletries) which they brought to the jail.
Some of these were given to the accused ""because he requested them"".
It was clear that the trial judge regarded this evidence as important and he
commented that the acceptance of the clothing was unexplained and that the
cabin from which the clothes had been taken was where some 1765 1/4 lbs. of
cannabis resin had been found. Appellant was con­victed in the County Court Judges
Criminal Court, without a jury, on a charge of having in his possession
cannabis resin for the purposes of trafficking. The Appeal Division dismissed
his subsequent appeal.

The interview when the accused and the other passen­ger
were confronted by two uniformed R.C.M.P. officers was admitted into evidence
by the judge without a voir dire despite the objection of counsel. Only
one of the officers testified and the accused did not. That officer testified
that he and his colleague had merely been investigating complaints from a
person suspicious of what was going on. The trial judge regarded an affirma­tive
response by the appellant to one of the constable's questions as an adoption by
him of his companion's false

[Page 927]

story. Although the exact words were not disclosed
the fact of the subsequent conversations regarding the cloth­ing was also
admitted without a voir dire again over the objection of counsel.

Held (Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey
JJ.: This appeal affords an opportunity for further clarifica­tion of the
question of the admissibility of statements made by an accused to persons in
authority. The ques­tion essentially is whether a voir dire is always required
in respect of such statements or whether no voir dire is needed if the
statement is ""obviously volunteered"". A voir dire is clearly
necessary if the statement in question is made to police during investigation
of a crime just as it is necessary for statements made after the accused is in
custody, after he has been charged and after a decision to charge him has been
reached. The view that a voir dire is unnecessary where the
statement is ""volun­teered"" or obviously volunteered is unsound.
Quite apart from doubt as to whether the ""voluntariness"" test does
encourage practical efficiency in the conduct of trials, other interests must
be considered viz. the assurance of a full hearing of the evidence of both
sides on the issue of voluntariness; the maintenance of the rights of the
accused; and the integrity of the functional distinction between the voir
dire and the trial itself. There is no justification for engrafting upon
the general rule, amply borne out by the authorities, any exceptions,
particularly one expressed in such terms as ""obviously voluntary"" or
""volunteered"".

Per Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The issue is whether
the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence two verbal statements without
holding a voir dire which in both instances had been requested by
counsel for the defence. The first statement was made to a police officer in
the presence of another constable and of another person; the accused was then
under surveillance and the police officer did not know that he was
investigating an impor­tant criminal operation that was to lead to the arrest
of the appellant; shortly after the conversation, upon being instructed to do
so, the police officer proceeded to the arrest of the appellant. This first
statement was not admissible in evidence unless it was proven to have been made
voluntarily [Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599]. Such proof is
normally made on a voir dire and a request for a voir
dire should not be denied save in rare circumstances which were not present
here. However, the failure to hold a voir dire that should have been
held is not necessarily fatal since the statement may other-wise have been
proven to have been made voluntarily. This is not the case here where there was
an almost

[Page 928]

complete dearth of evidence as to the circumstances
in which the statement was made. The statement should therefore not have been
allowed. In the light of the evidence, this is not a case where resort should
be had to s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . As to the second
statement, our unanimous decision not to disturb the decision of the trial
judge was announced in Court at the hearing.

Per Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. dissenting:
It is established that the burden rests on the Crown to satisfy the trial
judge that all statements made by an accused which it seeks to introduce in
evidence against him have been freely and voluntarily made. Where, as here, a voir
dire is requested, the trial judge should require one to be held. The
failure to hold a voir dire in this case did not however occasion any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice or vitiate the trial as the
circumstances were such as to make the voluntary nature of the statements self
evident. The sole purpose of a voir dire is to determine whether such a
statement was made volun­tarily and the necessity for holding such an inquiry
is to be determined by the circumstances under which the statement is made. The
only statements which can be challenged as improperly introduced are those made
prior to the appellant's arrest. There is however other ample evidence to
support the finding of guilt. In any event the case is one in which s.
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should be invoked.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
Appeal Division[1],
dismiss­ing an appeal from conviction, by judge sitting without a jury, on a
charge of possession of cannabis

[Page 929]

resin for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 4(2) of the
Narcotic Control Act. Appeal allowed, Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting.

David F. Walker, Q.C., for the appellant.

E. G. Ewaschuk and R. Fainstein, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—Not long ago, this Court put an end to the
difficulties which had plagued trial judges in attempting to distinguish inculpatory
statements from exculpatory statements for the purpose of applying the voir
dire rules. The Court held that exculpatory statements made to a person in
authority by an accused would be subject on voir dire to the same
requirements as inculpatory statements: Fiché v. The Queen[2].
The present appeal affords an opportunity for further clarifica­tion and
rationalization in determining the admis­sibility of statements made by an
accused to persons in authority.

The Court is called upon to decide the extent of the procedural
safeguards necessary to support the substantive rights of the accused to have
inadmis­sible statements withheld from consideration by the trier of fact. The
question essentially is wheth­er a voir dire is always required
in respect of statements made by an accused which the prosecu­tion seeks to
introduce in evidence, or whether, as the Crown contends, no voir dire is needed
if the statement is ""obviously volunteered."" The issue has not
previously arisen for decision in this Court, but there are many dicta which
support the con­clusion that a voir dire is always needed. Many
of the cases appear simply to assume the necessity of a voir dire as
consistent with the basic principles governing the admission of statements made
in response to questions from police officers or from other persons in
authority.

[Page 930]

The Principle

The classic formulation of the applicable princi­ple is that of
Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[3], at
pp. 609-10:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn [sic] by the prosecution to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.

That statement of the rule has been adopted in decisions of this
Court: see Prosko v. The King[4],
Boudreau v. The King[5], Fiché
v. The Queen, supra.

The rule in England is expressed in 11 Hals. (4th ed.), para.
410, in these words (footnotes omitted):

It is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in
evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to
a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person,
that it shall have been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained
from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised or held out by a
person in author­ity, or by oppression. In order to render such extra-judi­cial
admissions or confessions admissible the prosecution must prove affirmatively
to the satisfaction of the trial judge that they were not induced by any
promise of favour or advantage, or by the use of fear, threats or pressure by a
person in authority. It is not sufficient for the prosecution to show that the
person in authority had not intended to extract a confession or that there had
been no impropriety on his part; what is necessary is to show, as a matter of
fact, that the statement in question had not been obtained in consequence of
something said or done by him which amounted to an express or implicit threat
or promise to the defendant.

The first sentence of the foregoing passage derives from the
Judges' Rules published in 1964 (Home Office Circular No. 31/1964, p. 5,
reprinted in ""Practice Note,"" [1964] 1 W.L.R. 152 at p. 153). It is
said to be ""overriding and applicable in all cases."" The Judges'
Rules are, of course, merely administrative instructions which do not
have the force of law in this country nor, indeed, in England,

[Page 931]

but it is of importance that the sentence to which I have
referred was adopted as a correct statement of the law by Lord Reid, speaking
for a unanimous House of Lords in Commissioners of Customs and
Excise v. Harz[6].

I think it can now be taken to be clearly estab­lished in Canada
that no statement made out of court by an accused to a person in authority can
be admitted into evidence against him unless the prosecution shows, to the
satisfaction of the trial judge, that the statement was made freely and
voluntarily: Boulet v. The Queen[7],
Powell v. The Queen[8], Fiché
v. The Queen, supra.

Procedure on Voir Dire

Accepting that a burden rests upon the Crown to show
affirmatively that the statement sought to be introduced was voluntary, how
does the Crown go about discharging that burden? In my experi­ence, the usual
procedure has been for the Crown, before adverting to the statement, to request
the trial judge to retire the jury. In the absence of the jury the Crown calls
witnesses, normally the police officers to whom the statement was made or
given, and any other police officers who might have been in a position to
threaten or to offer hope of advan­tage to the accused. These witnesses testify
affir­matively to statements made and to the absence of threat or promise. They
are cross-examined. The defence then calls its witnesses, including frequent­ly
the accused, and they are cross-examined. Then follows argument of counsel, and
the ruling of the trial judge as to whether the statement is voluntary and,
therefore, admissible. There is, in every sense, a trial within a trial. Once
admitted, the statement goes to the jury who must then pass upon whether the
statement was, in fact, made and the weight, if any, to be given to it.

Function of the Voir Dire

It is axiomatic that the voir dire and the trial
itself have distinct functions. The function of the voir dire is to
determine admissibility of evidence. The function of the trial is to determine
the merits of the case on the basis of admissible evidence. The

[Page 932]

voir dire is conducted in the absence of the jury, who
should not be informed, at any time, of the subject matter of the voir dire.
The accused may testify on the voir dire while remaining silent
during the trial. Evidence on the voir dire cannot be used in the trial
itself. The fundamental nature of this functional separation was recently reaf­firmed
by this Court in The Queen v. Gauthier[9]. Mr.
Justice Pigeon, speaking for the majority, stated that the procedure is similar
whether or not the trial is before a jury, and he emphasized the necessity for
a voir dire in both cases, at p. 450:

.. For this reason I fail to see how it could be decided
that in a trial without a jury, a voir dire is unnecessary, and
statements made by the accused may be admitted in evidence without a
preliminary decision as to whether or not they were freely and voluntarily
made. Furthermore, no one appears to suggest that in a trial without a jury
a voir dire is unnecessary. But if this is so, how can it be maintained
that the rules are different? [emphasis added]

In a later passage, Pigeon J. also expressed his view that the
holding of a voir dire is an essential requirement (at p. 451):

In deciding as it did in the case at bar, the Court allowed
the accused to testify on the voir dire on a portion of the case that
suited his purposes, while avoid­ing cross-examination on the rest and
preventing the prosecution from referring to it. This can hardly be described
as formalism; it touches one of the most basic aspects of the administration of
justice, namely the rule that any judgment must be based exclusively on the
evidence presented at the trial. If it were to be held that in a trial
without a jury it is not essential to hold a voir dire, and the judge may
admit evidence of statements made by the accused, provided he rules on their
admissi­bility at the end of the trial, I would not agree, but I would
consider it less objectionable than a voir dire that does not respect
the basic rule, namely that it is a trial within a trial, and accordingly the
evidence produced therein is to be used on the voir dire only, even
though the same judge presides at the voir dire and decides on the
merits. [emphasis added]

The courts have formulated strict standards gov­erning the
admissibility of statements in order to safeguard carefully the rights of an accused
person. The principles focus on the jury trial, but they apply equally to trial
by a judge alone.

[Page 933]

The Court of Appeal Decision

It would seem to follow, as a matter of simple logic, that if the
Crown fails to establish that the statement was not obtained by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage held out by a person in author­ity, it has
failed to discharge the burden upon the Crown and the statement should be ruled
inad­missible. In the case at bar, however, the trial judge, sitting without a
jury, notwithstanding a request of defence counsel, refused to hold a voir
dire in respect of two statements made by the appellant Erven to police
officers. In upholding the conviction, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia adopted what had been said earlier by Macdonald J.A. of that
Court (16 N.S.R. (2d) 422-427) in respect of a statement given to the police by
one Mayer, a co-accused of Erven, when Mayer's conviction was under appeal. The
points taken by Mr. Justice Macdonald were: (i) when questioned by the police,
the accused was not under arrest, nor even under the threat of arrest; (ii) in
the opinion of Mr. Justice Mac­donald, the conversation by the accused with the
police officer was entirely voluntary and ""even if a voir dire had
been held such would surely have been found to have been made voluntarily and
hence admissible in evidence."" Mr. Justice Mac­donald quoted from an
earlier judgment of the Appeal Division (R. v. Spencer[10])
in which the view was taken that the holding of a voir dire would have
been an ""unnecessary farce"" and the law does not require that a judge
hold a ""wholly useless voir dire"" when the result would
have been the same if the magistrate had held a voir dire.

Two issues arise from the Court of Appeal decision, one
substantive as to the scope of the general rule, and one procedural as to how
the general rule is to be put into practice in the course of the trial. I will
deal with the substantive issue first.

Investigatory Stage

I cannot accept the view that a voir dire is unnecessary
(or required only where special cir­cumstances cast doubt on voluntariness) if
the statement in question is made to police during

[Page 934]

investigation of a crime, rather than after the accused is in
custody, or after he has been charged, or a decision to charge him has been
reached, see, e.g.: R. v. Rushton[11];
R. v. Sweezey[12];
R. v. Spen­cer, supra; R. v. Armstrong[13]. Such
statements of the accused enjoy no exemption from the requirement of proof of voluntariness
before admission into evidence. As Martin J.A. stated, in words I would adopt,
in R. v. Sweezey, at p. 413:

I conclude that the rule with respect to proof of volunta­riness
is not confined to statements made by a person in custody or charged or about
to be charged with an offence. I am consequently of the view that a statement
made by a person to a police officer conducting an investigation with respect
to a suspected offence must be shown to have been made voluntarily before it is
admis­sible against that person in a criminal trial in which he is an accused.
The words ""statement by an accused"" used by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim
v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599, in my view, refer to a statement made
by a person who is an accused in a criminal trial when the statement is sought
to be introduced against him rather than to the fact that he was an accused at
the time he made the statement.

As Idington J. stated in the decision of this Court in Prosko
v. The King, supra, at p. 234:

It is the inducement exercised by the officers in charge that
is to be guarded against and not the acciden­tal circumstances of an arrest and
the bearing thereof on the mind of one accused that has to be guarded against.

The voluntariness rule is one of broad and gene­ral application.
It applies with as much force to statements made during investigation as to
state­ments made after the accused person is in custody. The procedure does not
vary depending upon the stage at which the statement is made. Such a
distinction would be fraught with difficulties in its application. Is the test
subjective or objective? Where is the line to be drawn when investigation,
discovery, custody, and arrest are a rapid conti­nuous series of events?
Practical considerations provide an additional reason which dictates the
rejection of this distinction. The opportunities for

[Page 935]

abuse by delaying arrest are obvious. I should note in passing
that even cases supporting a special rule for statements made at the
investigative stage generally require a voir dire where counsel
expressly contests the admissibility of the state­ments, as counsel did in the
present case: see R. v. Sweezey, supra, at p. 417.

""Volunteered""

Nor can I accede to the second proposition which found favour
with the Appeal Division, namely, that a voir dire is unnecessary where
a statement is ""obviously voluntary"" or ""volun­teered"", or
where the voluntariness of a statement is ""apparent from the circumstances
under which it was made"", or when it can be ""abundantly established
in some other way"", absent a voir dire: see R. v. Spencer,
supra; R. v. Sweezey, supra; R. v. Toulany[14].

No doubt the ""obviously voluntary"" test derives from a
desire to encourage practical efficiency in the conduct of trials. On that
point alone, there are grounds for some doubt as to the efficacy of the test.
However, there are also other interests which must be weighed in the balance
along with effi­ciency—(i) the assurance of a full hearing of the evidence of
both sides on the issue of voluntariness; (ii) the maintenance of the rights of
the accused; and (iii) the integrity of the functional distinction between the voir
dire and the trial itself. It is in the light of each of these interests,
as well as that of trial economy, that the proposed test for a voir dire ought
to be measured.

Hearing All the Evidence

In my respectful opinion, no judge at trial nor appellate judge
should decide any issue on hearing only one side of the matter. It is trite in
civil law that anyone having the duty to decide anything must hear both sides
before reaching a decision. The obligation is not any less in criminal law.
Unusual prescience would be required to determine that a statement is obviously
voluntary before the accused has had a chance to call wit­nesses, testify, and
present argument, and where

[Page 936]

all the persons involved have not been called as required by Thiffault
v. The Queen[15].

What would occur if a statement could be admitted without a voir
dire where the context did not cast doubt on its voluntariness? The
testimony of the Crown witness outlining the circumstances surrounding the
statement might give no indica­tion of any involuntariness. Defence witnesses
might be prepared to give contrary testimony which; might be believed over that
of the Crown witness. The defence witnesses, however, could not be called at
this point, as they can only be called after the Crown has concluded its case.
Thus no evidence up to this point would have cast any doubt on the voluntariness
of the statement, and it would be admitted into evidence for consideration by
the jury. Even if the statement were later excluded, the harm would be done:
see R. v. Armstrong, supra. As Dennistoun J.A., speaking for the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Baschuk[16], said
at p. 209:

Once the confession was read to the jury it was hopeless for
the accused to call witnesses to show it was not a voluntary statement. The
damage was done and could not be undone.

All surrounding circumstances must be exam­ined on a voir
dire. Although the main point of decision in Boudreau v. The King,
supra, was that the absence of a warning would not bind the hands of the
court so as to compel it to rule out a statement, Kerwin J. said, at p. 267:
""All the surrounding circumstances must be investigated and, if upon their
review the Court is not satisfied of the voluntary nature of the admission, the
statement will be rejected."" The last words of the last defence witness to
testify in respect of the statement may establish that it was involuntary.

Rights of the Accused

An accused may testify on a voir dire without
prejudice to his privilege not to take the stand before the jury. He may be
examined and cross-examined

[Page 937]

with regard to the statement allegedly given by him to one in
authority, but not upon his innocence or guilt.

It is a most important right of the accused to call witnesses and
present argument separately on the issue of the admissibility of a statement
direct­ly after the Crown's evidence on this matter has been adduced. This
right would be totally lost if a statement of the accused could be admitted
without a voir dire as part of the Crown's evidence because nothing in
that evidence cast doubt on its voluntariness. An accused has the right to
testify in the absence of the jury on the issue of voluntari­ness alone. On the
voir dire he is permitted to testify on the issue of the voluntary
nature of his statement without prejudice to his right not to testify on the
main issue. The testimony of the accused may be the only evidence which
indicates involuntariness. If a voir dire is not held, and the accused
exercises his right not to testify on the main issue, the evidence negating voluntariness
will never be revealed to the trial court nor to an appellate court. If the
judge denies a voir dire, the accused may have to become a
witness on the issue of whether the statement is voluntary, but he thereby is
improperly exposed to Crown examina­tion on the main issue of guilt or
innocence. The effect of limiting the voir dire to cases where there is
evidence of involuntariness is to obligate the accused to adduce such
evidence, thereby relieving the Crown of a burden which properly rests on the
Crown and placing an unwarranted evidential burden upon the accused.

The Distinction between Voir Dire and Trial

The essential separation between proceedings on a voir
dire and those in the trial itself would be undermined if a voir dire were
held only where doubt was cast on the voluntariness of a statement by evidence
given in the trial itself. As Kaufman says in The Admissibility of
Confessions (2nd ed.), at p. 51, ""... to say that a statement may have
been admissible without a voir dire because it was voluntary is putting
the cart before the horse."" The importance of keeping all evidence of a
statement from the jury unless the statement is admitted

[Page 938]

in evidence is expressed by Kaufman in the following passage (at
p. 52):

Despite these last two judgments [John v. The Queen, [1971]
S.C.R. 781 and R. v. Bohack (1971), 6 C.C.C.(2d) 457 (Ont. C.A.)], it
would still appear that a voir dire must be held, and where the Crown
attempts to tender a statement without first requesting a trial within the
trial, the Court must order it proprio motu. This may
create a problem where the jury was made aware of the existence of a statement.
In that case, the Court should proceed with the voir dire, but if the
statement is rejected, a mistrial may be in order.

Can it ever be said that an answer given in response to questions
asked by a police officer in circumstances of compulsive authority, as in the
case at bar, are ""volunteered?"" One immediate objection to the
introduction of an exception relat­ed to ""obviously voluntary"" or
""volunteered"" is the likelihood of confusing the word (i)
""voluntary"", which has a well-recognized and technical conno­tation
when used in relation to statements given by accused persons to those in
authority (variously expressed, but generally taken to mean free of fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage) with the word (ii) ""volunteered"",
which is a word of common parlance implying spontaneity. Yet, as pointed out in
""Developments in the Law: Confessions"" (1966), 79 Harv. L. Rev. 935,
1103, the Canadian concept of voluntariness, unlike the one prevailing in
Scotland, does not imply spontaneity. Rand J. made this clear in R. v. Fitton[17],
at pp. 962-3, where he said: ""The Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking
for the majority of the Court of Appeal, has treated the expression 'freely and
voluntarily' used in Boudreau v. The King, as if it connoted only a
spontaneous statement, one unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the
conduct of the police officers; but with the greatest respect that is an
erroneous interpretation of what was there said.""

Statements should not slip in without a voir dire under
the pretext that they form part of the res gestae: see R. v. Spencer,
supra; R. v. Toulany, supra. The rules regarding res gestae are
substan­tive rules regarding hearsay and the admissibility

[Page 939]

of evidence. They do not affect the procedure by which decisions
are to be made regarding admissi­bility of statements made to persons in
authority. Statements constituting part of the res gestae are admissible
as exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay. As with all statements by
an accused, they are subject to the general requirement of voluntariness. In order
to determine whether they are voluntary, as well as whether they are, in fact,
part of the res gestae and otherwise admissible, such statements must be
con­sidered by the judge on a voir dire in the absence of the
jury.

The Efficient Administration of Criminal Justice

I suspect that in a trial by judge sitting without a jury there
is a tendency, in what is thought to be the interests of trial economy, to lose
sight of the distinction between voir dire and trial. The dis­tinction
is just as important when the judge is sitting alone (and assumes also the jury
function of trier of fact) as when he is presiding at a trial with jury, and
the same rules apply so far as the voir dire is concerned: R. v.
Gauthier, supra. The distinction between a ""formal"" and an
""informal"" voir dire was firmly rejected by this Court in Powell,
at p. 368, where Mr. Justice de Grandpré said:

I note that for the second time the learned appeal judge
uses the expression ""formal voir dire"". I assume that this is
a slip of the pen because no voir dire at all was held and, in any
event, I cannot see any difference between an informal voir dire and a
formal one.

It is sometimes urged that the holding of a voir dire results
in delay and, therefore, a loss in trial economy. I have some doubt whether
trial econo­my would be achieved by recognition of an excep­tion, expressed in
terms of ""volunteered"" or ""obvi­ously voluntary"", to the
general requirement of a voir dire. The normal response, if a voir
dire were denied, would be an appeal, with consequent cost in time and
money. Accepting, arguendo, that a voir dire entails delay in the
judicial process, it does not necessarily follow that efficient adminis­tration
of justice should be sought at the expense of the legitimate rights of an
accused.

It must be sound policy to have rules of practice which are clear
and uncomplicated. This is particulary

[Page 940]

true in the field of criminal law. Rules should be such as to be
easily applied in the great variety of cases and circumstances which daily come
before the courts. In my respectful view, a rule requiring a voir dire only
after there is some evidence suggesting involuntariness is neither clear nor
easily applied.

If a statement is, in fact, ""volunteered"", this means
merely that voluntariness is easier to estab­lish than in other cases. It does
not mean there is a different procedure to determine voluntariness. The voir
dire in such a case may take only a few minutes. On the other hand, where
the initial impression is that the statement was voluntary, other evidence on
the voir dire may point to quite the opposite conclusion. Either way,
the rights of the accused will be protected and the efficient administration of
justice enhanced by the holding of a voir dire.

Further, I would not want to say that counsel may not expressly
waive the holding of a voir dire in a proper case where all precautions
have been taken: see Powell v. The Queen, supra, at p. 368; R. v. Sweezey,
supra, at p. 416; R. v. Dietrich[18], at
pp. 734-7 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to this Court dismissed [1970] S.C.R.
xi). I do not express any concluded view on the matter of waiver, however, as
there is no suggestion that defence counsel waived voir dire in the case
at bar.

The Cases

Generally speaking, the authorities appear to be against any
exception to the general rule requiring a voir dire. In the
recent case of Boulet v. The Queen, supra, it was affirmed that previous
state­ments made under oath by the accused during a judicial proceeding are
admissible without proof of voluntariness, and that therefore no voir dire
is required in respect of such statements. The Court, speaking through Mr.
Justice Beetz, contrasted the situation where a statement is made out of court
to a person in authority and clearly envisaged that the admissibility of such a
statement would always

[Page 941]

be decided in the absence of the jury, on a voir dire, (at
p. 343):

The courts have long made a distinction between statements
made by the accused out of court to persons in authority and those which are made
in a judicial proceeding. The first are admitted in evidence once the
presiding judge had decided alone, without the jury, after a voir dire, that
they were freely and voluntarily made, the onus of proving these conditions
being on the prosecution: R. v. Warickshall; Rex v. Baldry; Ibrahim v. Rex;
Fiché v. The Queen; Powell v. The Queen. [emphasis added]

While the decision in Powell v. The Queen, was carefully
restricted to what was necessary to decide the outcome of that case, it
nevertheless established a stringency in the need for a voir dire which
is consistent only with its requirement in all cases where voluntariness must
be established. In his reasons, Mr. Justice de Grandpré quoted the Court of
Appeal's view of the matter, at p. 367:

In our view, it would have been preferable for the trial
judge to have conducted a formal voir dire, then ruling on the voluntariness
of the statement [ ... ]; but it is perfectly plain from his reasons for
judgment that he directed himself to that question and considered the statement
to be voluntary.

and then de Grandpré J. stated.

I am unable to accede to the proposition that if a trial
judge directs himself to the question of the voluntariness of a statement and
is satisfied on the whole of the evidence of the guilt of the accused, there is
no need for a voir dire.

In Powell this Court also expressly rejected the
contention that a voir dire was only needed where counsel for the
accused objected to the admission of the evidence. Mr. Justice de Grandpré
stated, at p. 368:

The Crown further submits that, the evidence of Constable
Fisher having been received without any objection by counsel for the accused,
this silence amounts to an admission that the statement was volun­tary.
Although the point was mentioned by Hall J.A., it was not dealt with in the
Court of Appeal. For my part, I do not believe that this submission is well
founded. While I might be ready to accept in a proper case that counsel for an
accused may well waive the holding of a voir dire, I see a considerable
difference between an expressed waiver surrounded by all the precautions

[Page 942]

indicating that the question has been examined in depth and
mere silence on counsel's part. The heavy onus resting on the Crown certainly
cannot be displaced in such an informal fashion.

In a comment on Powell, (1976), 18 Crim. L.Q. 404,
Professor S. I. Bushnell noted that the case dealt with four questions:

(1) Must all statements made by an accused to a person in
authority pass the test of voluntariness?

(2) Need there be a voir dire for those confessions
to which the rule applies?

(3) Is there any obligation on the defence to object to the voluntariness
of a confession in order to require a voir dire?

(4) In a case in which there should have been a voir
dire, and none was held, can s. 613(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code  be
applied?

In discussing the second question, he stated, at p. 411:

(2) Need there be a voir dire in all cases?

The answer, following Powell, must also be a yes,
except when there has been an express waiver. Spencer had called it a
wise precaution to have a voir dire until the limits of Fiché
v. The Queen were clarified. The clarification has now occurred in Powell.
Sweezey and Rushton must be considered overturned on this point.

In a more recent article in (1978), 20 Crim. L.Q. 312, Professor Ratushny
said, at p. 324:

In Powell v. The Queen the court clearly established
that all statements made to a person in authority must pass the test of voluntariness
on a voir dire in the absence of an express waiver on the part of
the accused. Moreover, there is no obligation on the part of defence counsel to
object where the necessity for such a voir dire has been
overlooked.

I do not think the Crown can take any comfort from John v. The
Queen, supra. In John, the point here in issue was expressly not
decided because, in any event, there was sufficient admissible evidence of the accused's
guilt to apply the provisions of s. 529(1)(b)(iii) (now s. 613(1) (b)(iii)).

[Page 943]

In my opinion, it is always necessary to hold a voir dire to
determine the voluntariness of a statement made by an accused out of court to a
person in authority. Only in this way can fairness to the accused be assured.
To require a voir dire only if doubt is cast on the voluntariness
of a statement by the circumstances under which it was made, as determined from
evidence given in the trial proper, would not only shift a burden to the
accused but also, in other respects, cause him significant preju­dice. One must
be realistic with the jury process. If the statement is subsequently ruled
inadmissible, the jury will, nevertheless, at least be left with the knowledge
that a statement was made by the accused which has now been excluded. This is
bound to arouse suspicion as to its content. If evidence of the context of the
statement is allowed to be given for some time before anything casts doubt on
its voluntariness, the jury will know something, and perhaps much, of its
content. Prejudice will surely result. Such a limited requirement would destroy
the fundamental distinction between the function of the voir dire, which
is to determine voluntariness, and that of the trial proper, which is to
determine guilt.

I can see no justification for engrafting upon the general rule,
which is remarkably free of qualifica­tions, any exception and, particularly,
one expressed in such terms as ""obviously voluntary"" or
""volunteered."" Attempts in the past to water down the rule have not
met with success and, in my opinion, the present attempt should also be
repelled.

The Facts

I turn now to the evidence in the case. I do not think the
evidence is of great importance because it is not the task of this Court nor,
with respect, the task of any appellate court to make an independent judgment
as to whether a particular statement is voluntary. If the true rule is, as I
conceive it to be, that the voluntary nature of a statement given to a person
in authority can only be determined in a voir dire, then it is
undisputed that the judge at trial failed to hold a voir dire, though
requested to do so. I do not think it can be seriously contended that the
statements admitted

[Page 944]

in evidence without a voir dire were not of impor­tance
on the issue of guilt.

The facts are these. The accused was alleged to have been part of
a large-scale operation to traffic in hashish. The plan called for the hashish
to be cached on the Cape La Have Islands, just off the coast of Nova Scotia,
and to be transported by helicopter to an isolated cottage at Beech Hill, on
the mainland, for packaging and later resale. On August 21, 1974, one Robson
made three trips transporting hashish by helicopter from Cape La Have Islands
to the cottage. On the first of the trips, the appellant Erven and one Mayer
were passengers. The helicopter picked them up at Crescent Beach, on the
mainland, and transported them to the Islands. Upon arrival at the Islands, the
appellant and Mayer disappeared for two or three hours, during which time
Robson loaded the hashish into the aircraft and made two trips to the cottage,
where the hashish was unloaded. After the helicopter had been loaded by Robson
for the third and final time, the appellant and Mayer reap­peared and were
taken back to Crescent Beach, where they were dropped off. The helicopter con­tinued
its flight to the cottage. During the flights, the hashish was packed in large
wrapped bags and transported in the luggage compartment of the aircraft, out of
sight of pilot and passengers. There is no direct evidence that the appellant
was aware of the nature of the cargo.

Immediately after the appellant and Mayer returned to Crescent
Beach, they were confronted by two uniformed R.C.M.P. officers, Botham and Gaudet,
who began asking questions. In response, Mayer indicated that he and the
appellant were involved in a Search and Rescue operation, as well as collecting
soil samples from the Cape La Have area. In reply to a question by Constable Botham,
the appellant acknowledged that he was engaged in the same operations. He gave
the same address in Vancouver, British Columbia, as Mayer. The appellant and
Mayer were later picked up at the beach by a red Maverick automobile, driven to
the beach by a Miss Hale, but driven, on leaving, by the appellant. The trial
judge found, as a fact, that the red Maverick was a rented vehicle in the same

[Page 945]

of one of the persons involved in the narcotics operation.

The appellant and the others were arrested shortly after leaving
the beach. During the time the appellant and several co-accused were in cus­tody,
they were interviewed on August 27, 1974 by two officers, Berry and Melbourne.
According to Constable Melbourne, ""as a result of conversation with the
accused and with some of the co-accused,"" he and Constable Berry went to
the cottage at Beech Hill and removed some articles of clothing and toiletries.
They brought these articles to the jail and gave various of them to the
accused, ""because he requested them."" The importance of this evidence
to the trial judge is expressed in the following passage from his judgment:

..it seems to me that the acceptance by the accused of these
three items of clothing is some evidence which is unexplained and which
connected the accused with the whole operation. It is perhaps convenient to
point out, at this point, that a very large quantity of cannabis resin, some
seventeen hundred, sixty-five and a quarter pounds was found in eighty-nine
packages in the cabin at Beech Hill from which the clothes were removed.
Indeed, it was at this point the general evidence indicates that the resin was
being packaged by two persons who are not before me in this trial.

The accused was tried without a jury in the County Court Judges'
Criminal Court, on a charge of unlawfully having in his possession cannabis
resin, for the purposes of trafficking.

The interview on Crescent Beach when the accused and Mayer were
confronted by two uniformed police officers, Botham and Gaudet, was admitted
into evidence by the trial judge without a voir dire, as I have
indicated, despite the objection of defence counsel. Constable Botham was the
only officer to testify. The accused did not testify. According to Constable Botham,
he and Constable Gaudet did not, at that point, know the nature of the
operation they had discovered. However, they were, he testified, investigating
complaints from a person who was very suspicious of what was going on. The
trial judge regarded the affirmative response of the appellant to Constable Botham's
question as an adoption by the appellant of May­er's false story that the
appellant and Mayer, and

[Page 946]

the helicopter, were just engaged in collecting soil samples.

Although the exact words were not disclosed, the fact of the
conversations on August 27, 1974, respecting the clothing and the result of
those conversations, was also admitted without a voir dire, again over
the objection of defence counsel.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to five years'
imprisonment. The Appellate Division dismissed the appeal. Three main grounds
of appeal were advanced in the Appellate Division. It was contended that the
trial judge erred in admitting without a voir dire the statements made
by the appellant to the police on August 21 and August 27, 1974, and that the
judge erred in the wrongful use of hearsay evidence. On this last point, Mackeigan
C.J.N.S. said:

Dealing first with the last, I respectfully think the
learned judge erred in admitting and referring in his decision to hearsay
evidence by a police constable that the red Maverick car driven from the beach
by the appellant was rented, and even more seriously erred in saying in his
decision, with no evidence to support it, that the vehicle had been rented 'in
the name of one of the persons involved in the series of circumstances to which
I have related.' The judge did not specify which of Carr, Robson, Mayer or Miss
Hale had, as he understood, rented the car.

Carr was one of those found packaging the hashish in the cottage.
The learned Chief Justice continued:

I do not, however, look upon this error as fatal. The
wrongfully imputed rental of the car does not constitute a vital or
indispensable link between the appellant and Carr or Robson. Without it, strong
and ample evidence connects the appellant with Robson and his handling of the
hashish in the helicopter and at the cottage-includ­ing his unexplained
presence on the helicopter, his adop­tion, if admissible, of Mayer's false
story that they were just engaged in collecting ""soil samples"", and
his acceptance, if admissible, of some clothing picked up at the cottage. I am
of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred and
that the learned judge's conclusion would necessarily have been the same had he
not made this mistake. Section 613(1) (b)(iii) may properly be applied.

[Page 947]

The Appeal Division, in sustaining the conviction, applied s.
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , and in so doing relied upon (1) the
unexplained pres­ence of the appellant on the helicopter; (2) the appellant's
adoption, if admissible, of Mayer's false story that they were just engaged in
collect­ing soil samples; (3) the appellant's acceptance, if admissible, of
clothing picked up at the cottage.

Conclusion

For the reasons expressed earlier, in my opinion a voir
dire should have been held to determine the admissibility of the
appellant's statement to police at the beach on August 21, 1974. During argu­ment
of this appeal, counsel for the Crown was advised from the Bench that the Court
did not need to hear him with respect to the request for clothing. I therefore
say nothing further with respect to August 27 and the clothing. Consider­ation
of that aspect is not, in my view, essential to the outcome of the appeal, for
it cannot be said with assurance that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice occurred from the denial of a voir dire in respect of the
earlier August 21 ""beach"" statement. In light of the importance of
that evidence as affecting credibility, I do not believe this to be a proper
case for the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii). That is not to say that the
failure to hold a voir dire will in every case provide grounds
for ordering a new trial. As with every other case where inadmissible evidence
is admitted at trial, consideration has to be given to the impor­tance of the
evidence improperly admitted in light of the whole of the case. When one
considers, however, the function of a voir dire, and the interests at
stake in the holding of a voir dire, it will be but rarely that the
admission of such statements will have caused no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice, such that the appellate court may apply s.
613(1) (b)(iii).

I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the
Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and order a new trial.

[Page 948]

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal from a judgment
delivered by MacKeigan, C.J.N.S., on behalf of the Appeal Division of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, whereby he dismissed the appellant's appeal from
a conviction entered by His Honour Judge R. F. McLellan sitting without a jury
on a charge of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking,
contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act.

This appeal is brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court on
the following question of law:

Did the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, err in
holding that the trial Judge did not err in refusing to hold a voir
dire in respect of the voluntariness of statements allegedly made by the
accused to officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on August 21 and August
27, 1974 and in admitting such statements accordingly?

The circumstances giving rise to this prosecution are somewhat
complex, but the background indicating involvement on the part of the appellant
is described in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge which were
in this regard adopted by the Court of Appeal. From these reasons I excerpt the
following passages with respect to which it can be said that there is no
dispute:

It is clear from the evidence before me that there was
evolved a very sophisticated high grade operation, the object of which was to
import a large quantity of cannabis resin into this country. I, of course, am
not involved with the importing aspect but the whole of the evidence makes it
abundantly clear that the importation was the first step in what led to the
charges to which I have referred and has led to the charge before the accused.
At some point the cannabis resin was cached on Cape LaHave Island and it was
transported from there to a cottage in the Beech Hill area in Lunenburg County.
The accused's connection with this matter, if any, arises out of the
transportation aspect to which I have referred. It was accomplished by the use
of a helicopter, a rented helicopter, which made three trips between a point on
Cape LaHave Island and a cleared out area adjacent to a cottage in or near
Beech Hill. This transportation was accomplished in three trips made on August
21st, 1974... .

[Page 949]

By prior arrangement with somebody, the helicopter which was
engaged by one of the principals or one of the subordinates in the scheme which
involved the transpor­tation of this drug, picked up the accused and one,
Mayer, from a point on Crescent Beach on August 21st, 1974. The accused and
Mayer were transported to a point on Cape LaHave Island. They disembarked from
the helicopter and reappeared, at least as far as the evidence goes, only to
join the aircraft after the last of the cannabis resin had been stored aboard
the aircraft, entered the aircraft and were deposited by the helicopter at or
near the same point on Crescent Beach where they had been picked up. There is
no evidence, at least no direct evidence, that either of these men which of
course includes the accused, had any hand or part in the loading of the
aircraft. I accept the evidence that on the last occasion, that is the occasion
of the third trip required to transport the forbidden substance, the forbidden
substance was all stored in the compartment at the rear of the helicopter.
While the accused and Mayer were on the beach, they were interviewed by
Constable Botham of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The interview which ensued was admitted by the trial judge
without the holding of a voir dire notwithstanding the objection of
counsel for the defence and this constitutes one of the alleged errors referred
to in the order granting leave to appeal to this Court. The relevant evidence
describing this interview is to be found in the following testimony
given by Constable Botham of the R.C.M. Police:

Q. Alright, well now witness, you were questioning these two
men, that is Mayer and the accused, about the circumstances under which they
were on the beach and were in the proximity of the boat and motor, is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And were they under arrest at that time? 

A. No.

Q. And what was your general purpose in being in the area
that day?

A. Well the initial reason we had there was because the
person that called was very suspicious of what was going on.

Q. Alright, you were investigating. 

A. Complaints.

An objection followed from the accused's counsel and the witness
then continued:

[Page 950]

Q. Yes, would you continue Cst. Botham, you met these chaps
and what happened?

A. After finding out their names I also obtained their
addresses in Vancouver, B.C. as 132 Ontario Street. This applied to both Mr.
Mayer and Erven. Mr. Mayer indicated that he was a commercial artist; Mr. Erven,
the accused, indicated he was a truck driver working with Wells Fargo. We had
some conversation for I would say approximately five minutes. During that time
Marcel Patrick Mayer, after being asked what he was doing in the area, stated
he was working with search and rescue and that he was in this area to collect
soil and water samples from the Cape LaHave Island area. After that, I asked
Bruce Keith Erven if this was what he was doing as well and he said, 'Yes'.

Upon it being suggested to Constable Botham in cross-examination
that some other member of the R.C.M. Police had told him to say what he did
about the reference to soil samples and water samples, he made the following
answers:

A. Actually at the time I didn't realize it was impor­tant.
I didn't realize any of this was important at the time. But I couldn't add
it to my notes four hours later when I found out it could have been. [The
italics are my own.]

Q. Now let me ask you these questions. You didn't think it
was important so I take it you didn't read the notes back to Mr. Mayer or Mr. Erven
on any occasion?

A. No, I did not. Initially I had no idea of what was
even going on. [The italics are my own.]

Q. No. And so your
question Mr. Erven was in relation to what Mr. Mayer said he was doing?
A. Yes. Mr. Mayer did ninety per cent of the talking, or more.

Q. Mr. Mayer, in other words, virtually

A. Gave the story. I just asked Mr. Erven if he was doing
the same thing and he indicated he was.

Q. How did he indicate it? 

A. 'Yes'.

[Page 951]

And later in the cross-examination the Constable said:

Q. Certainly you have no knowledge that anything that Mr. Erven
told you as to name, address or occupation or where he was staying at that
time, is incorrect?

A. Not at that time, no.

Q. No, at any time, as far as his name or his address or the
place he was staying on August 21, 1974, did you ever subsequently find out
that any of that was incorrect?

A. No I did not.

Q. No, and you never found out that what he said about his
occupation was incorrect?

A. I have not made any inquiries to determine otherwise if
it is incorrect.

I think it to be established that the burden rests upon the Crown
to satisfy the trial judge that all statements made by the accused which it
seeks to introduce in evidence against him have been freely and voluntarily
made and where, as here, counsel for the accused objects to the admission of
such statements without the holding of a voir dire, the trial judge
should require one to be held, but his failure to do so in this case did not
occasion any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice or viti­ate the trial
as the circumstances were such as to make the voluntary nature of the
statements self evident and no basis was suggested in argument upon which the
appellant's answers might have been held to be otherwise than voluntary had a voir
dire in fact been held. Apart from the fact that the statements were made
to police officers, no evidence was adduced casting any doubt on the voluntary
nature of the answers.

The principle was recently restated by de Grandpré J., speaking
on behalf of this Court in Powell v. The Queen[19],
where he observed at pp. 366 and 367:

It is conceded by the Crown that in principle before a
statement of any kind can be admitted in evidence against a person accused, it
must be shown by the prosecution to the satisfaction of the trial judge to have
been freely and voluntarily made by that accused person. This principle, of course,
has been repeatedly stated by this Court, particularly in Sankey v. The
King, [1927] S.C.R. 436, Fiché v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23,

[Page 952]

John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781, and R. v.
Gauthier, a judgment of June 26, 1975, still unreported.

In the Powell case, the accused was charged with having
assaulted a woman and a statement which he had made to a constable which placed
him at the scene of the assault was admitted by the trial judge, who was
sitting alone, without the holding of a voir dire. In finding that the
trial judge was wrong in so admitting the statement, Mr. Justice de Grandpré
observed, at p. 366:

Was the statement admissible without a voir dire? It
must first be remembered that the conversation reported in the above quotation
took place in a context. When the police officers first made the accused aware
of the purpose of their investigation, they were met with a flat denial that he
had been in the vicinity of the hotel. Again, a few minutes later, upon being
charged and cautioned by the police officers [sic], he denied involvement. It
is only when Constable Melvin was busy attending to some other duties that the
impugned conversation took place. Later on, that same night, when questioned by
detectives, the accused twice repeated having no knowl­edge of the occurrence.

Later in the same judgment the learned judge observed that these
circumstances clearly show ""that the rule had to be applied without
question"".

It will readily be seen that the context in which the statements
were made by the accused at Crescent Beach differs in all material respects
from that in the Powell case. Here, when the police questioned Erven and
his companions they were not aware of any crime having been committed by anyone
but were acting on suspicion resulting from a telephone tip from someone who
was very suspi­cious of what was going on at the beach. The two men being
questioned were not under arrest and no crime was at that time being
investigated.

In my view, the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice de Grandpré
in Powell reaffirm the rule that the sole purpose of a voir dire is
to determine whether the statement sought to be introduced against the accused
was made voluntarily and that the necessity for holding such an inquiry is to
be determined by the circumstances under which the statement is made. The
matter was clearly put by

[Page 953]

Mr. Justice Rand in the case of Boudreau v. The King[20],
where he said at p. 269:

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex, [1914] A.C. 599, Rex
v. Voisin, [1918] I K.B. 531, and Rex v. Prosko, 63 S.C.R. 226 lay
it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is voluntary. No
doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a
warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is directed against the
danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions. It is
the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the
circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the
statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or
inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the case.
The underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely
and voluntarily made?

The historical origins of the rule making it necessary to ensure
that the trial judge is satisfied as to the voluntary character of all
statements made by the accused has its origins in early inquisitorial practices
when torture was far from unknown in order to extort a confession and brib­ery
frequently employed to the same end.

The nature of the burden of proof resting upon the Crown in order
to establish the voluntariness and therefore the admissibility of statements
made by an accused person has long been accepted as it was stated by Viscount
Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, supra, at p. 609 where he said:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn [sic] by the prosecution to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority.

The statements made by the accused at Crescent Beach in the
present case are limited to his having given his address and occupation and
having agreed when he was asked whether he was engaged like his companion in
working for search and rescue and in collecting soil samples. I can

[Page 954]

think of no way in which doubt could be cast on the voluntariness
of the first statement as to his address and occupation and although I am satis­fied
that the second statement was untrue, I do not think that this affects its
admissibility. The mere fact that an untrue statement may be exculpatory does
not of itself, in my opinion, make it inadmiss­ible under the judgment of this
Court in Fiché v. The Queen[21]. It
was stated more than once in the majority judgment in that case that the
initial question to be determined in deciding whether or not such statements
should be admitted was whether or not it was voluntarily made. In a case tried
with a jury when such a statement has been admitted after holding a voir dire,
the question of its truth is a separate issue for the jury to determine
and, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Pigeon in the case of R. v. Gauthier[22],
the issues of truth and voluntariness in such cases are to be treated as
severable even where the trial is conducted by a judge sitting alone.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the fact that
the statements in the present case were made to police officers who were
obviously persons in authority is enough to raise a doubt as to whether they
were obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, and while it
may frequently be the case that questioning by police officers could affect the
voluntariness of the answers, I think the matter is best viewed in light of
what was said by Mr. Justice Rand in The Queen v. Fitton[23],
at pp. 963 and 964 where he said:

The accused was not at the time under formal arrest although
he had been requested to stay in the police station and, for the greater part
of the time, remained in the general office, and the earlier questions were
such as the police might have addressed to any person in the remotest way drawn
into the enquiry. Questions without intimidating or suggestive overtones are
inescapable from police enquiry; and put as they were here, they cannot by
themselves be taken to invalidate the response given. The question still
remains: was the statement made through fear or hope induced by authority?

[Page 955]

The statements made by Erven at Crescent Beach were in answer to
questions such as the police might have addressed to any person in the remotest
way drawn into the inquiry. They were not made by a person who was under arrest
or in custody and I find no suggestion of intimidation or suggestive overtones
in anything which the police asked of the accused. Furthermore, it appears to
me to be unrealistic to treat Constable Botham as having held out any fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage to Erven in relation to the commission of any
offence, particularly as he did not realize that the conversation was important
and ""initially ... had no idea of what was going on"". Even if a voir
dire had been held, there was, in my opinion, nothing which could raise a
doubt in the mind of the trial judge as to the voluntary character of the
answers given by the accused.

The order granting leave to appeal to this Court is not limited
to the statements made by the appellant at Crescent Beach on August 21, but
also puts in question the admissibility of state­ments allegedly made by him
while in custody on August 27. This Court was, however, of opinion that the
exchange between the appellant and the police while he was in custody when he
accepted the items of his clothing which had been found in the cabin at Beech
Hill, was admissible without a voir dire and it was stated at the
hearing that it was not necessary to call on the respondent in this regard.

It is thus apparent that the only statements which are now
challenged as having been improp­erly introduced without the holding of a voir
dire are those made by the appellant to Constable Botham at Crescent Beach.
These statements were limited to the appellant giving his address in Vancouver
and his having said ""Yes"" when asked whether he was engaged, as Mayer
had claimed to be, in work with search and rescue collecting samples in the
area.

As I have indicated, I do not think that the learned trial judge
erred in admitting the conver­sation at Crescent Beach without the holding of a
voir dire, but even if he had been in error in this regard, it appears
to me from a careful reading of his judgment that the statements made by the

[Page 956]

appellant at that time did not play an essential part in the
reasoning which led to his finding that the appellant was guilty of possession
of cannabis resin.

The learned trial judge found that the appellant and his friend
Mayer had made two or three trips to and from LaHave Island in the helicopter
which was carrying the drug and he further made the following finding
concerning the clothing found at the cabin where the cannabis resin was stored:

It seems to me that the acceptance by the accused of these
three items of clothing is some evidence which is unexplained and which
connected the accused with the whole operation.

The two items of evidence to which I have last referred afford
ample material to support the find­ing of guilt and whatever doubt may be cast
on the admissibility of the brief words spoken by Erven at the beach, I am
satisfied that the judge's verdict would have been the same if these words had
been excluded from the evidence and that their admis­sion occasioned no
substantial wrong or miscar­riage of justice. I am therefore in any event of
opinion that this is a case in which s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should
be invoked.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Beetz and Pratte JJ. was deliv­ered by

PRATTE J.—I agree with my brother Dickson that the appeal should
be allowed, but I come to this conclusion on narrower grounds. I feel obligat­ed
to express my views separately.

The issue is as to whether the trial judge erred in admitting
into evidence two verbal statements allegedly made by appellant to officers of
the R.C.M.P. without holding a voir dire which in both instances
had been requested by counsel for the defence.

The first statement was made to Const. Botham of the R.C.M.P. on
August 21, 1974, when in the course of a conversation that lasted approximately
five minutes, appellant answered questions as to his name, his address and the
reason for his presence

[Page 957]

on the beach. This conversation took place in the presence of
another constable, and of one Mayer, who was appellant's companion in the
venture; after this conversation, the two constables kept appellant and Mayer
under surveillance for about one and a half hours and then proceeded to their
arrest.

We know little about the circumstances of the conversation
between Const. Botham and appel­lant. Of the four witnesses to this
conversation, only Botham gave evidence; he said that at the time he did not
know that he was investigating an important criminal operation and that
appellant was to be arrested shortly after the conversation. There is no
evidence as to the actions of the other constable prior to and during the
conversation between appellant and Botham.

In my opinion, the statement made on the beach by appellant to
Const. Botham was not admissible in evidence unless it was proven by the
prosecution to have been made voluntarily (Ibrahim v. Rex[24],
at p. 609).

The normal procedure for determining the voluntariness of a
statement of the accused is through a voir dire and, the onus
being on the Crown to prove voluntariness, a request for a voir dire should
not be denied save in rare circumstances, where, for instance, the request
would be clearly frivolous or would constitute a demon­strable abuse of
process.

In the case at bar, the trial judge refused to hold a voir
dire because he was of the view that the voluntariness of the statements of
the appellant had been established by the decision of the Nova Scotia Supreme
Court, Appeal Division in R. v. Mayer[25]. Whatever
be the merits of the decision in Mayer, it was not concerned with the
statement here in question. Whether a statement is voluntary or not is
essentially a question of fact to be determined by the trial judge who hears
the case. In D.P.P. v. Ping Lin[26], Lord
Salmon spoke thus at p. 606:

[Page 958]

... In deciding whether an alleged confession or statement
was free and voluntary and should be admitted in evidence, it is useless, just
as it is in an accident case, to search for another case in which the facts
seem to be similar and treat it as binding. Facts vary infinitely from case to
case. The judge's task is to consider the evidence before him, to assess its
implications and to decide the case on his view of that evidence in the light
of the basic established principle.

I am therefore of the opinion that the trial judge erred in
refusing to hold a voir dire as to the voluntariness of the first
statement of August 21, 1974.

But it does not necessarily follow that such error on the part of
the trial judge be fatal and the statement necessarily inadmissible. The
holding of a voir dire is only a means to an end and a statement
should not be held to be not voluntary for the sole reason that no voir dire
was held. The substantive issue always is whether the statement has been
proven to have been made voluntarily. There are some situations where the
failure to hold a voir dire which should have been held, while a
technical breach of a rule of procedure, would entail no practical effect
because the statement would otherwise have been proven to be voluntary; for
instance, in R. v. Spencer[27], Chief
Justice MacKeigan said at p. 36:

... Even if a voir dire had been held, the statement
would have had to have been held to be voluntary. This was shown in subsequent
evidence by the accused and his friends who said nothing to dispute the circum­stances
but only disputed exactly what was said and by whom: the accused indeed
admitted being asked the question about the carton of hashish but claimed:
""No, I think I said, 'Yeah, let's go.' ""—rather than the police
version of his reply, namely: ""Yes, that's all"", or ""Yes.""

The situation in the case at bar is entirely dif­ferent; there is
an almost complete dearth of evi­dence as to the circumstances in which the
statement of August 21 was made. The evidence does not indicate whether or not
there was any inducement or threat. The mere fact that the appellant was only
under surveillance and not yet under arrest cannot be the determining factor in
estab­lishing the voluntary nature of the statement.

[Page 959]

It has also been suggested to us that the statement should be
admitted in evidence because it was volunteered by appellant. I cannot agree. A
statement that is volunteered is one that is not asked for. The verb ""to
volunteer"" means: ""To communicate (information, etc.) on one's own initiative""
(Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). It is clear that the voluntary nature of a
volunteered statement would be much easier to prove than that of a statement
which, while not volunteered, is nevertheless voluntary. But in both cases, the
rule in Ibrahim is applicable. In the case at bar, the evidence does not
support the conclusion that the appellant took the initiative to communicate to
Const. Botham information as to his name, his address and also as to the
reasons for his presence on the beach.

I am therefore of the opinion that the statement of August 21,
1974 has not been proven to have been made voluntarily and should not have been
allowed in evidence. I am further of the view that the rest of the evidence is
not so strong against the appellant as to permit me to say that the error of
the trial judge resulted in no miscarriage of justice. This is therefore not a
case where we should exercise our discretion under art. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

As to the statement of August 27, our unani­mous decision not to
disturb the decision of the trial judge was announced in Court at the close of
the argument for the appellant.

I would therefore dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed
by my brother Dickson.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEWFOUNDLAND, IN BANCO

Extradition—Procedure—Depositions for
extradition proceedings—Right of counsel for accused to be present—Right of
counsel for accused to cross-examine deponents—Statements prepared in
typewritten form prior to appearance merely signed before magistrate—Mandamus
to direct that affidavits be properly taken—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 468—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21,

s. 468—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, s. 31.

Accused, a former senior civil servant in the
Province of Newfoundland, was
charged under the Criminal Code  with fraud, bribery and breach of trust.
Warrants were issued for his arrest. He was taken into custody in Panama and flown to Miami, Florida,
where he was to be transferred to an Air Canada flight to Montreal. At Miami accused applied for landed immigrant status and became the subject
of an application for extradition. In order to pursue the extradition
proceedings the Director of Public Prosecutions of Newfoundland had a number of
witnesses brought before a magistrate to give evidence by deposition for use in
the Florida extradition proceedings as provided in s. 31 of the Extradition
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21. Sub-section (1) of s. 31
provides that the depositions may be taken ‘in the absence of the person
accused of an extradition crime. Counsel for the accused attended some of the
proceedings at which the respondent magistrate ruled that he could not
cross-examine the deponents. Counsel for the accused was not informed of the
time or place of taking the remaining depositions although he requested such
information from the Crown. Some of the depositions were apparently prepared in
advance and simply signed by the depo-

[Page 294]

nents in the presence of the magistrate. The
depositions once signed and sworn were certified by the magistrate and then
sent to the United States after
authentication by T. Alex. Hickman, Attorney General of Newfoundland, the
Deputy Minister of Justice at Ottawa and by a U.S. Embassy official at Ottawa. Accused sought a writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court of
Newfoundland, first, to stay proceedings, second, to declare the depositions
null and void and, third, to order the return of the documents to the
Magistrate’s jurisdiction. The Chief Justice of Newfoundland dismissed the
application for mandamus and his judgment was confirmed on appeal by the
Supreme Court of Newfoundland in banco. Appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada lay as of right pursuant to s. 36 (b) of the Supreme
Court Act (since repealed by 1974(Can.), c. 18, s. 3) when
appellant sought, firstly, an order to recall the depositions and/or to inform
the Minister of Justice for Canada that they were not taken according to the
laws of Canada and, secondly, an order to allow counsel for the appellant the
right to cross-examine on any deposition taken or to be taken under s. 31 
of the Extradition Act .

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré: Section 31(1)  of the Extradition
Act  authorized the magistrate to take depositions in the absence of the
accused appellant who had no right to be present by counsel or to have his
counsel cross‑examine the deponents. The words of s. 31(1)  “… in
like manner as he might take the depositions if the accused were present and
charged before him with such extradition crime” could not be regarded as
importing all of s. 468  of the Criminal Code . Sections 31(1) 
imports, at most, the mechanical aspects of deposition-taking alluded to in
s. 468 . The duty of the magistrate under s. 31(1)  is simply to “take
depositions”. He is not presiding at a hearing, nor is he determining any issue
of fact or law. A deposition is nothing more than a statement on oath in a
judicial proceeding, taken down in writing and sworn before a justice and the
facts alleged by appellant did not support the view that the depositions were
not taken before the magistrate.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting: While s. 31 of the Extradition
Act  does not entitle the person whose extradition is sought to participate
in the taking of the depositions and while notice need not be given to that
person there is no reason why counsel instructed by him

[Page 295]

should be prevented from attending at the
taking of the depositions. If s. 468 of the Criminal Code  has any
operation at all it should include openness of the proceedings. In the
circumstances and on the basis of the affidavits filed, mandamus should issue
to direct that depositions taken from three of the deponents be taken properly.
While pre-preparation of a deposition need not be per se irregular what
was done in these three cases passed acceptable informality.

Per Curiam:
A magistrate taking depositions under the Extradition Act  performs a
function different from that of an extradition judge. The peripheral powers
exercised by the magistrate under the Extradition Act  are analogous to
his usual judicial duties and do not justify regarding him as a persona
designata and therefore within the scope of s. 2(g) of the Federal
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10. The mandamus was properly
sought in the Provincial Supreme Court.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Newfoundland in banco[1] dismissing
an appeal by the accused from the dismissal of an application for a writ of
mandamus. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence J. dissenting in part.

Robert Nelson, for the appellant.

James J. Greene, Q.C., for the
respondents.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting in part)—I
agree with my brother Dickson that s. 31  of the Extradition Act , respecting
the taking of deposi-

[Page 296]

tions to be used in a foreign state in
connection with the extradition of a person accused of an extraditable crime,
does not entitle that person to participate in the taking of the depositions.
The fact that the accused person held in a foreign state becomes aware of the
fact that depositions will be taken and instructs counsel to represent him does
not change the situation.

In my view, however, although notice need not be
given to that person, I see no reason why counsel instructed by him should be
prevented from attending at the taking of the depositions. If s. 468 of
the Criminal Code , which is referentially mentioned in s. 31  of the
Extradition Act , has any operation at all, it should certainly include
openness of the proceedings, which is an important value in our system of
administration of justice. The evasion practised by the then Director of Public
Prosecutions in Newfoundland when information was sought by the appellant’s
counsel as to the time and place of the taking of the depositions is fully set
out in an affidavit of that counsel, and I accept unreservedly his narration of
what occurred. (The appellant was, of course, represented by a different
counsel in this Court.) I think that the Crown counsel behaved badly towards a
fellow lawyer without reasonable excuse. That, however, gives no ground of
relief to the appellant in this case.

The point in this appeal which troubles me is
whether certain depositions were regularly taken. The record shows that about
thirty-six depositions were taken, and three of these are the subject of
affidavits which indicate that they were not so much taken as presented for
signature, after having been prepared by the Director of Public Prosecutions
without a fair opportunity to the deponents to consider their contents and to
have them verified before a magistrate. I refer to the depositions taken from
William Alexander MacPherson, Prospero Joseph DeSantis and Jack L. Goodson. The
affidavit of appellant’s counsel (previously referred to) respecting the
Goodson deposition and the affidavits of MacPherson and DeSantis as to how
their depositions were taken persuade me, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, that

[Page 297]

they were foisted on the deponents by the
Director of Public Prosecutions. There is no indication that a stenographer was
present to record any of the proceedings; indeed, the affidavit of appellant’s
counsel states in respect of the Goodson deposition that no stenographer was
present nor was any recording equipment evident.

I think it is open to the Court to issue mandamus
at the instance of the appellant to direct that the depositions of the
aforementioned three persons be taken properly. I do not say that pre‑preparation
of a deposition is per se irregular, but what was done in the three
instances I have mentioned passes any acceptable informality.

I would allow the appeal to this limited extent.
I may add that I also agree with my brother Dickson that mandamus could
properly be sought in this matter from the Newfoundland Courts and that it is
not within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This appeal raises an important
question as to the right of cross-examination; subsidiary questions are
presented but they fall to be determined only if the primary question is
decided favourably to the appellant, Oliver L. Vardy.

The case arose in this way. Mr. Vardy, a
former senior civil servant of the Province of Newfoundland, was charged under
the Criminal Code  in December, 1973, with fraud, bribery and breach of
trust. Warrants were issued for his arrest. He was taken into custody in
Panama, late in January, 1974, and placed on a Pan-American plane to go from
Panama City, Panama to Miami, Florida where he was to be transferred to an Air
Canada flight to Montreal. At Miami he applied for landed immigrant status. He
also became the subject of a complaint for extradition filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. He was arrested and
released on $50,000 bond upon condition that he remain

[Page 298]

within the Southern and Middle Districts of
Florida, where he currently resides.

From affidavits filed, it appears that on
January 25, 1974, the Canadian Embassy at Washington, D.C., delivered a note to
the State Department of the United States requesting Vardy’s extradition.
Section 30(1)  of the Extradition Act  authorizes the Minister of Justice
of Canada to make a requisition for the surrender of a fugitive criminal from
Canada, who is or is suspected to be in a foreign state with which there is an
extradition treaty. Section 31  of the Extradition Act , the construction
of which is at the heart of the present appeal, makes provision for the taking
in Canada of depositions for use in extradition proceedings in a foreign state.
Sub-sections (1) and (2) of s. 31  read:

31. (1)
Whenever, for the purposes of this Act, it becomes necessary or expedient to
secure evidence by depositions taken in Canada to be used in a foreign state,
any justice of the peace, or any person having authority to issue a warrant for
the apprehension of persons accused of offences and to commit such persons for
trial, may take depositions in the absence of a person accused of an
extradition crime in like manner as he might take the depositions if the
accused person were present and charged before him with such extradition crime.

(2) Such justice of the peace or person
having authority as aforesaid may, by subpoena or order, command the attendance
at the time and place therein mentioned, of any person or witness for the
purpose of being examined as to any extradition crime charged under this Act,
and may require the production of any writings or other documents relating to
the charge that are in the possession or power of such person or witness.

The Director of Public Prosecutions of
Newfoundland, John Connors, issued subpoenas to approximately 36 people to give
evidence by deposition for use in the Florida extradition proceedings. The
appellant Vardy retained counsel to appear for him at the taking of the
depositions. At the taking of the deposition of one Jack L. Good-son, charged
in conjunction with Vardy, Mr. Connors objected to the presence of counsel
for Vardy, as did Goodson and his counsel. The respondent magistrate, Clement
Scott, ruled that counsel

[Page 299]

could attend the proceeding but not
cross-examine Goodson. Counsel for the appellant was not informed of the time
or place of taking the remaining depositions although he requested such
information from Mr. Connors. In all, some 24 depositions were taken and
sworn before Magistrate Hugh O’Neill and 13 depositions before Magistrate
Clement Scott. The depositions were bound and then certified by the magistrate
and, accompanied by a certificate of authentication completed by T. Alex.
Hickman, Attorney General for the Province of Newfoundland, delivered to the
Deputy Minister of Justice at Ottawa. Further certificates of authentication
were added by the Deputy Minister and by an official at the United States
Embassy at Ottawa. Finally, on April 12, 1974, two copies of the extradition
record were delivered to the United States Department of Justice in Washington.
The record was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida at Miami on May 6, 1974. The extradition hearing in
Florida, on the merits, has been postponed sine die pending the outcome
of an interlocutory appeal by the appellant before a Louisiana Court.

The proceedings in Canada took the form of a
motion for a writ of mandamus before the Supreme Court of Newfoundland.
The notice of motion reads as follows:

TAKE NOTICE that leave of the Honourable
the Chief Justice having been given on the 10th day of May A.D. 1974, the Court
will be moved on the 28th day of May A.D. 1974, at 10:30 o’clock in the
forenoon or as soon thereafter as Counsel may be heard, on behalf of Oliver L.
Vardy, for an Order directed to the Respondents to show cause why a Writ of
Mandamus to the said Respondents ordering that the proceedings with respect to
two certain Informations charging Oliver L. Vardy with violations of Section 338(1) ,
Section 110 (c) and Section 111  of the Criminal Code  of Canada and those certain
proceedings seeking extradition of the said Oliver L. Vardy in respect of said
Informations and all depositions, affidavits, sworn statements and other
matters made, taken, obtained and sworn to in respect of the proceedings above
set forth be stayed, and further to declare with respect thereto that all
proceedings, affidavits, depositions and sworn statements taken, made and sworn
to in respect to the aforesaid extradition proceedings are null and void, and
further to issue a Writ of

[Page 300]

Mandamus commanding that all such
proceedings, affidavits, depositions, and sworn statements be withdrawn from
usage, withheld and returned to the Magistrate’s jurisdiction unless and until
such time as the said Respondents shall fully comply with the laws of Canada
and the Province of Newfoundland made and provided in respect to the carrying
on, making, taking and swearing of the same.

In effect, the appellant in the notice of motion
asked for three types of relief: (1) a stay of proceedings (on the charges and
on the extradition); (2) a declaration that the depositions were null and void;
and (3) an order for the return of the documents to the Magistrate’s
jurisdiction. The notice of motion was directed to Magistrate Clement Scott, to
the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Connors, and to the Attorney
General of Newfoundland, Mr. Hickman. On the return of the motion before
Chief Justice Furlong of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, counsel for the
respondents Hickman and Scott, and Mr. Connors in person, raised the
point, by way of preliminary objection, that mandamus would not lie
against the respondents. Chief Justice Furlong sustained the preliminary
objection and dismissed the mandamus application. Chief Justice
Furlong’s judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland
sitting in banco. An appeal to this Court was then taken pursuant to
s. 36(b) of the Supreme Court Act (since repealed by 1974
(Can.), c. 18, s. 3) which gave an appeal as of right from a final
judgment in mandamus.

Before this Court, the relief asked by the
appellant Vardy differed radically from that asked in the lower courts. The
order he seeks reads as follows:

(a) That the Respondents or either of them
be ordered to recall the said depositions and/or to inform the Minister of
Justice for Canada that the said depositions were not taken in accordance with
the laws of Canada.

(b) That the Respondents or either of them
be ordered to allow Counsel for the Appellant the right to cross-examine on any
depositions taken or to be taken under Section 31  of the Extradition Act  in
relation to the said requisition for extradition of the Appellant.

[Page 301]

Paragraph (a) is new. The Minister of Justice of
Canada is not and has never been a party to the proceedings and counsel for
Vardy conceded during argument that mandamus would not lie against the
Minister in the present proceedings. At the conclusion of argument counsel said
that what he was actually seeking was an order directed to Magistrate Scott to
require cross-examination on the depositions which have been taken. A request
in this form releases Mr. Hickman and Mr. Connors from the
proceedings. The request is silent on the matter of the 24 depositions taken
before Magistrate O’Neill, not a party to these proceedings.

The first observation which might be made is
that none of the three forms of relief sought in the notice of motion is
related to a specific public duty owed by any of the three respondents. Before mandamus
can issue there must be a duty, without discretion, upon the person or body
against whom the order is directed to do the very thing ordered. Here the
request made on behalf of the appellant leaves in obscurity the source of the
right to be enforced, a fortiori the duty, which would require the
magistrate to order the return of the depositions from the United States
courts. The request pays scant heed to the substantial body of jurisprudence
which holds that mandamus will not lie to undo that which has already
been done in contravention of statute. In short, it sits strangely in the
context of mandamus jurisprudence.

One must, however, examine carefully s. 31 
of the Extradition Act , quoted earlier, to determine whether it gives
the appellant the right he asserts. Counsel rests his entire case on the
submission that the effect of s. 31(1) , in particular the words “… any
justice of the peace… may take depositions in the absence of a person accused
of an extradition crime in like manner as he might take the depositions if the
accused person were present and charged before him with such extradition crime”
is such as to import into the Extradition Act  s. 468  of the Criminal
Code , or at least that portion of s. 468  which gives a right of
cross-examination to the accused or his counsel. Section 468  reads in part:

[Page 302]

468. (1)
Where the accused is before a justice holding a preliminary inquiry, the
justice shall

(a) take the evidence under
oath, in the presence of the accused, of the witnesses called on the part of
the prosecution and allow the accused or his counsel to cross‑examine
them; and

(b) cause a record of the
evidence of each witness to be taken

(i) by a stenographer appointed by him, or
in legible writing, in the form of a deposition, in Form 27, or

(ii) in a province where a sound recording
apparatus is authorized by or under provincial legislation for use in civil
cases, by the type of apparatus so authorized and in accordance with the
requirements of the provincial legislation.

(2) Where a deposition is taken down in
writing, the justice shall, in the presence of the accused, before asking the
accused if he wishes to call witnesses,

(a) cause the deposition to
be read to the witness,

(b) cause the deposition to
be signed by the witness, and

(c) sign the deposition
himself.

(3) Where depositions are taken down in
writing the justice may sign

(a) at the end of each
deposition, or

(b) at the end of several or
all of the depositions in a manner that will indicate that his signature is intended
to authenticate each deposition.

The appellant’s submission is unsupported by
authority other than a broad general statement in Extradition To and From
Canada (1961) by G. La Forest, at p. 95:

The Act makes provision for taking evidence
to be used in extradition proceedings abroad. It authorizes every justice of
the peace, or any person having authority to issue a warrant for the
apprehension of persons accused of offences, to take depositions required for
proceedings abroad in the absence of the accused, and to summon witnesses and
require the production of documents for the purpose. The justice or other
person may do this in the same manner as he would take depositions if the
accused were present and charged before him of the crime. This imports into the
proceedings section 453  of the Criminal Code . The depositions are
therefore given on oath or affirmation and taken down in writing by a
stenographer. These must then be signed and authenticated as provided in
section 453 . [Section 453  is the present s. 468 ]

[Page 303]

The author’s attention does not seem to have
been directed to the exercise of a right of cross‑examination by an
accused or his counsel, but rather to the more mechanical aspects of the
process.

Counsel for the respondents urges that s. 31
(1)  was placed in the Extradition Act  for the purpose of protecting the Crown
and not of giving rights to a fugitive accused. The sole object, it is urged,
is to permit witnesses to be heard and depositions to be taken in the absence
of the accused in derogation of the right of an accused, enshrined in common
law and statute, to face his accusers. This submission has considerable force.
The primary purpose of the subsection is clearly as respondent’s counsel
contends. In accepting this proposition, however, one must be careful to give
some effect to the concluding words of the subsection, beginning with “in like
manner”.

If s. 31(1) of the Extradition Act  imports
s. 468  of the Criminal Code , as is contended, it is obvious that it
cannot import all of s. 468 . That section requires that the evidence
of prosecution witnesses be heard “in the presence of the accused”. If the
accused were present there would be no need for extradition proceedings.
Similarly, if s. 31  imports a right of cross‑examination because of
s. 468 , the right must be one exercisable only by counsel for the accused
and never by the accused in person. Again, one cannot import s. 468(2) of
the Code to the extent that it requires the reading and signing of
depositions “in the presence of the accused”. The matter of “asking the accused
if he wishes to call witnesses”, more particularly spelled out in s. 469 ,
is equally out of place. So that when one carves out of s. 468  those parts
which are clearly inapposite because of the absence of the accused, and when
one qualifies even the alleged right of cross-examination by limiting its
exercise to counsel, and not the accused, the result is incongruous. It compels
the conclusion that s. 31  imports, at most, the mechanical aspects of
deposition-taking alluded to in s. 468 . While the presence of the accused
is central and indispensable to a preliminary hearing, absurdities result when
one tries to adapt the procedures of a preliminary hearing to a

[Page 304]

proceeding in which the accused is absent by choice.

In In re Collins[2] at p. 445, an extradition case,
Duff J., as he then was, endorsed the view that “…the technicalities of the
criminal practice should not be allowed to smother or encumber the
administration of the procedure prescribed by these modern statutes …”. Duff J.
quoted with approval the language of Mr. Justice Brown, delivering the
judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Grin v. Shine[3] at p. 184 “… proceedings for a
surrender are not such as put in issue the life or liberty of the accused. They
simply demand of him that he shall do what all good citizens are required and
ought to be willing to do, viz: submit themselves to the laws of their
country”.

The proceedings at the extradition hearing are
not such as to jeopardize the liberty of the accused, nor does the taking of
depositions preparatory to an extradition hearing. At an extradition hearing in
Canada the fugitive is brought before a judge. Section 13  of the Extradition
Act  applies. It reads:

13. The
fugitive shall be brought before a judge, who shall, subject to this Part, hear
the case, in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as if the fugitive was
brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an indictable offence
committed in Canada.

There are two significant points of difference
between s. 13  and s. 31(1) : First, the use of “shall” in s. 13 
and “may” in s. 31 , and, second, the presence in s. 13 of the words
“… judge… shall… hear the case …”, which enjoins all the concomitants of
a hearing whereas s. 31(1) does not.

Section 16  of the Extradition Act  provides
for the admission of deposition evidence in extradition hearings in Canada. In Re
State of Wisconsin and Armstrong[4], the
Federal Court of Appeal was called upon to consider whether a fugitive criminal

[Page 305]

was denied due process and a fair hearing if he
were not afforded an opportunity for cross‑examination upon the affidavit
evidence at the actual extradition hearing. A unanimous court rejected the
fugitive Armstrong’s appeal. Mr. Justice Thurlow, with whom
Mr. Justice Cameron concurred, used these words in reference to the nature
of an extradition hearing (at pp. 276-77 C.C.C., at p. 443 F.C.)

If the proceedings were in the nature of a
trial on the subject of guilt or innocence the absence of a right or opportunity
to test the evidence of the applicants by cross‑examination might well be
a serious objection to the fairness and justice of such a rule, but, as already
pointed out, that is not the situation. The hearing is a mere inquiry and what
the extradition Judge has to determine is not the guilt or innocence of the
fugitive but the question whether the evidence produced would justify his
committal for trial. The fugitive is entitled to be made aware, by the reading
of the affidavits presented, of the case against him, upon which his
extradition for trial may be ordered, but he is not required to answer that
case and even if he elects to do so, by evidence or otherwise, the Judge’s
function remains the same. He is not empowered to decide the merits of guilt or
innocence, or to pass upon the credibility of witnesses but simply to determine
whether there is a sufficient case against the fugitive to justify his
committal. The trial and determination of the fugitive’s rights with respect to
the charge are left to the trial Court.

The foregoing observations apply with even
greater force to proceedings antecedent to the extradition hearing. The stage
of gathering deposition evidence is further removed from a determination of
guilt or innocence than the process in Armstrong.

The duty, and authority, reposed in the
magistrate by s. 31(1) is simply to “take depositions”. He is required to
take the evidence of the witness under oath, to cause the deposition to be read
to, and signed by, the witness, and to sign the deposition himself. That is
all. He is not presiding at a hearing, nor is he determining any issue of law
or fact. Depositions are not taken for use at the trial of an accused but
merely for use at an extradition inquiry which antedates a possible preliminary

[Page 306]

inquiry. This last-mentioned procedure in turn
precedes a trial at which guilt or innocence is decided.

A further consideration in determining the scope
of s. 31(1) lies in the effectiveness of the right claimed. If the
submission on behalf of Vardy is valid, the Extradition Act  would become
ineffective as a means of extraditing fugitive criminals, for if a fugitive has
a right of cross‑examination of witnesses giving evidence by way of
deposition, he should be afforded an opportunity for the effective exercise of
that right. This would require, minimally, that the fugitive be given notice,
that he be permitted to retain counsel, and that he be advised, personally or
through counsel, of the time and place when each deposition is to be taken. If
there is a genuine right of cross-examination imported into the Extradition
Act  from s. 468 of the Code, it would not do to leave the
exercise of the right to chance, available only if the accused or his counsel
happened to learn fortuitously that a deposition was to be taken at a certain
time and place. When one recalls the parts of the world in which fugitive
criminals may seek refuge, the language and other difficulties in communicating
with authorities in those countries, and the complicated legal-diplomatic lines
of communication in extradition matters, it is obvious that a right to notice
would frustrate or defeat the entire extradition process.

Appellant would import into a pre-trial, and
indeed pre-inquiry, procedure most of the panoply and trappings of a criminal
trial—and all of this in respect of proceedings in which time may be of the
essence.

Counsel for the appellant in his factum referred
to s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights but the point was
not even faintly pressed during the oral argument on appeal.

For the foregoing reasons I do not believe that
s. 31(1) should receive the construction for which the appellant contends.
In my opinion the magistrate was authorized to take depositions in the absence
of the accused appellant and the accused appellant had no right to be present
by counsel or to cross-examine.

[Page 307]

Before leaving the case there are two other
matters to which I would briefly refer, both of which were raised from the
bench during the argument on the appeal.

First, whether on the facts of the case, it
could be said that the magistrates had, in fact, taken “depositions”. It
appeared from the affidavit of one William Alexander MacPherson, filed in
support of the motion, that MacPherson was questioned by a constable of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police who wrote out his version of the interview which
MacPherson signed. Some months later MacPherson was given a finished typed
document to sign as his deposition, the contents of which came from
MacPherson’s original statement and the minutes of a meeting of a Board of
Directors at which MacPherson was present. One DeSantis completed an affidavit
in which he said that the procedure adopted for the taking of the depositions
had not been that of questions and answers; rather he had been asked to sign a
written statement which had been prepared in advance. Mr. Isaac Mercer,
counsel for the appellant in the earlier proceedings, swore that Goodson had
been handed a document consisting of 15 to 20 pages and informed that the
magistrate was going to read the document, leaving it to Goodson to make any
corrections found necessary. Very few corrections or alterations were made. I
do not think these alleged facts support the view that there were no
depositions taken. A deposition is nothing more than a statement on oath in a
judicial proceeding, taken down in writing and sworn before a justice. Form 27
referred to in s. 468(1)(b)(i) of the Code merely says “XY
having been duly sworn, deposes as follows: (insert deposition as nearly as
possible in words of witness)”.

Second, a question was raised as to the
jurisdiction of the Newfoundland courts to hear the application for a writ of
mandamus, since the respondents were purporting to act in accordance with
s. 31  of the Extradition Act . By s. 18 of the Federal Court
Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10, the Trial Division of the Federal
Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to issue a writ of

[Page 308]

mandamus against “any federal board, commission
or other tribunal”. Section 2 (g) of the Act defines that phrase as
follows:

“federal board, commission or other tribunal”
means any body or any person or persons having, exercising or purporting to
exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of the Parliament
of Canada, other than any such body constituted or established by or under a
law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under or in
accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of The British
North America Act, 1867.

Clearly a magistrate or justice of the peace taking
depositions under s. 31  of the Extradition Act  is a person
exercising powers conferred by an Act of the Parliament of Canada. The question
is whether he or she is excluded from the definition by the proviso dealing
with provincial appointments.

The apparently broad words of s. 2 (g)
have been interpreted to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court in cases
involving County Court judges who sit as extradition judges (Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico v. Hernandez[5]) and
those who exercise powers under the Indian Act  (Lavell v. A.-G. Can.[6]). Although County Court judges are
appointed under s. 96 of the British North America Act, it has been
held that they fall within the scope of s. 2  (g) when they
sit as persona designata.

A magistrate taking depositions under the Extradition
Act  performs a function different from that of an extradition judge. He
performs a simple administrative task similar to his role when hearing evidence
in a preliminary inquiry. In contrast, an extradition judge is involved in
decision-making, performing a task integral to the comprehensive extradition
scheme created by statute and treaty. Thus, there would appear to be more
reason to regard an extradition judge as a persona designata and thus a
“federal board” subject to

[Page 309]

Federal Court supervision. The magistrate,
appointed under a law of a province and exercising only peripheral powers under
the Extradition Act , analogous to his usual judicial duties, remains
subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of provincial superior courts.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeal by Crown—Notice of appeal signed by
counsel for Attorney General—Instructions to counsel signed by official in
Attorney General's depart­ment—Implied authority to delegate—Notice of appeal
valid—Manner of proof when authority of counsel questioned—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 605(1).

The respondent was acquitted at trial on twelve
counts of theft by conversion. On appeal by the Crown a preliminary objection
to jurisdiction was taken on the ground that the notice of appeal did not
comply with the provisions of s. 605(1)  of the Criminal Code . The notice
of appeal had been signed ""J. E. Spencer, Counsel for the Attorney
General"". Mr. Spencer's authority was derived from a letter bearing the
letterhead ""Attorney General, Province of British Columbia"", signed
by an official of that department, Mr. N. A. McDiarmid, ""Director,
Criminal Law"". The respondent argued suc­cessfully before the Court of
Appeal that in order to comply with s. 605(1) of the Code, Mr. Spencer's
instructions must come directly from the Attorney Gen­eral or from the Deputy
Attorney General of the Prov­ince. The Crown appealed from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

There is implied authority in the Attorney General to
delegate the power to instruct in s. 605(1) . Section 605(1)  does not require
the Attorney General personally to appeal or personally to instruct counsel to
appeal in every case. Although there is a general rule of construc­tion in law
that a person endowed with a discretionary power should exercise it personally (delegatus
non potest delegare) that rule can be displaced by the lan­guage, scope or
object of a particular administrative scheme. Where the exercise of a
discretionary power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown it may be pre­sumed
that the acts will be performed, not by the Minister in person, but by
responsible officials in his

[Page 239]

department. While there was no evidence in the
present case that the Attorney General of British Columbia personally
instructed Mr. McDiarmid to act on his behalf in appealing judgments or
verdicts of acquittal of trial courts it was reasonable to assume the ""Director,
Criminal Law"" of the Province would have that author­ity to instruct. The
definition of Attorney General in s. 2  of the Criminal Code  includes
""the lawful deputy"" of the Attorney General. The words ""lawful
deputy"" are not confined to ""Deputy Attorney General""; they com­prehend
all persons appointed to act on behalf of the Attorney General when acting
within the scope of their authority.

In the absence of direct challenge, no evidence need
be adduced to confirm the authority of counsel who appeals on behalf of the
Crown and describes himself as ""counsel for"" or ""counsel
instructed by"" or ""agent for"" the Attorney General or in words
to like effect. Advo­cates are officers of the Court and it is to be taken, in
the normal course, that when a counsel is acting with the authority of the
Attorney General he is indeed clothed with that authority. If objection is
taken which raises ground for doubt as to authority, it is normally sufficient
if counsel produces a letter which he can say he received and believes to be
signed by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General or an officer of the
department whom he understands to have requisite au­thority to institute
criminal appeals.

R. v. Wiens (1970), 74 W.W.R. 639, approved; R.
v. Badall, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 503, considered; R. v. Green (1970), 1

APPEAL by the Crown from the dismissal of an appeal to the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia on a preliminary objection to jurisdic­tion
on the ground that the notice of appeal did not comply with the
provisions of s. 605(1)  of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed.

J. E. Smith, for the appellant.

J. T. Steeves, for the respondent.

[Page 240]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The respondent Harrison was acquitted before Judge Mussallem
in Provincial Court at Vancouver on twelve counts of theft by conversion of
sums of money. On appeal by the Crown a preliminary objection to jurisdiction
was taken on the ground that the notice of appeal did not comply with the
provisions of s. 605(1)  of the Criminal Code  which reads:

605 (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him
for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial
court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question
of law alone, .. .

The notice of appeal had been signed ""J. E. Spenc­er,
Counsel for the Attorney General"". Mr. Spenc­er's authority was derived
from a letter bearing the letterhead ""Attorney General, Province of
British Columbia"", signed by an official of that department, Mr. N. A. McDiarmid,
""Director, Criminal Law"". The respondent Harrison argued successful­ly
before the Court of Appeal that in order to comply with s. 605(1) of the Code,
Mr. Spencer's instructions must come directly from the Attorney General or
from the Deputy Attorney General of the Province.

In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeal relied on R.
v. Badall, a decision of that Court then under appeal to this Court. Some
three weeks after the present case was before the British Columbia Court our
Court, in a unanimous deci­sion of the full bench, set aside the judgment of
the Court in Badall[1]. Counsel
for the Crown submits that the rationale of Badall applies to the case
at bar. I am by no means persuaded that such is the case. In Badall the
Court concentrated on the form of the notice of appeal and did not deal with
the question of implied authority to delegate at issue here. As in the present
case the question was whether the Crown's notice of appeal from the
respondent's acquittal complied with s. 605  of the Criminal Code . In Badall,
however, counsel had

[Page 241]

signed the notice of appeal as ""Agent for the Attorney
General of Canada"" rather than ""Coun­sel for the Attorney General of
Canada"". It was contended that an agent could not bring an appeal in the
name of the Attorney General if the notice was signed by such ""agent""
even though no doubt had been cast on the fact of agency. Support for the
contention was said to be found in s. 748(6) of the Code dealing with
appeals in summary convic­tion matters, which in contrast to the words of s.
605(1)  authorizes an appeal by, inter alia, ""the Attorney General or
his agent"". In the course of his reasons delivered on behalf of this
Court, the Chief Justice referred to Lemay v. The King[2],
which had not been brought to the notice of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, in which this Court rejected the contention that the Attorney General
must sign the notice of appeal personally. At the time Lemay was
decided, the section of the Code corresponding to the present s. 605(1) 
was s. 1013(4) which gave a right of appeal only to ""the Attorney
General"". The right has been extended in the present s. 605(1)  to
""the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose"".
The Chief Justice's observations in Badall with respect to the
difference between a counsel who is ""agent of the Attorney General""
and one who is ""instructed by the Attorney General"" were in these
terms:

In my opinion, the extension of the Crown's right to appeal
to counsel instructed by the Attorney General, while also keeping the right in
the Attorney General as before, has not made the Lemay case
inapplicable. Indeed, I am unable to appreciate any but a semantic difference
between a counsel who is an agent of the Attorney General and a counsel
instructed by the Attor­ney General; the latter can surely be no more than an
agent, albeit perhaps a special one for the occasion.

In Badall, counsel for the respondents contended also that
there was no proof that the person signing as agent was in fact counsel for the
Attor­ney General or that he had been instructed by the Attorney General for
the purpose of the appeal. While that is the substantial point in the present
appeal, it was not essential to the decision in

[Page 242]

Badall. Nor was it discussed by the Court because the only
argument raised in the Court of Appeal had been that an agent was not empowered
by s. 605  to sign the notice of appeal.

Therefore this Court has not considered R. v. Green[3]
or R. v. Martin (No. 1)[4], to
which we have been referred by counsel for the respondent in this appeal.
Neither Green nor Martin is directly on point. In Martin's case,
an application for an order extending the time for giving notice of appeal was
made by ""Mr. MacMillan for F. Sigsworth repre­senting the Attorney-General
of Canada"". The form of the signature was explained as ""due to Mr. Sigsworth's
absence in Japan"". Nowhere in the record of the application was there any
allegation that either Mr. MacMillan or Mr. Sigsworth had been instructed by
the Attorney General of Canada for the purpose of the appeal. The judg­ment of
the Court was delivered by Traynor C.J. P.E.I. who directed attention to the
distinction (rejected by this Court in Badall) between s. 605(1)  appeals
and those in summary conviction matters. The learned Chief Justice said, p.
275:

On the appeal, counsel for the appellant strenuously urged
that the application had not been properly made within the provisions of s.
584(1). He argued that there was nothing to show that Mr. Sigsworth was the
agent of the Attorney-General of Canada, although as I intimated above, the
statute requires more than agency. He demonstrates from the record that there
was nothing to show connection between Mr. MacMillan and the Attorney-General
of Canada and that there was nothing to show any delegation of authority to Mr.
MacMillan.

and continued, p. 276:

When objection was raised, it was still open to counsel to
apply for leave to adduce evidence that at the date of the application Mr. Sigsworth
had in fact been instructed to enter an appeal against the order of July 20,
1970. However, no attempt was made to have such evidence presented; and we do
not think that the deficiency was cured by the filing of the notice of appeal
on September 28, 1970, in which the signature is followed by the words,
""counsel instructed by the Attorney-General of Canada"" without
further evidence that instruction by

[Page 243]

the Attorney-General of Canada had been given before the
application for the order now under appeal.

The order appealed against was set aside.

In Green's case the notice of application for leave to
appeal from sentence was signed by coun­sel as ""Agent of the Minister of
Justice for Canada"" and not as ""Counsel for the Attorney General for
Canada"". The Minister of Justice is ex officio Attorney General of
Canada. Limerick J.A. deliv­ered the judgment of the New Brunswick Supreme
Court, Appeal Division, and in the course of that judgment said, p. 146:

Any presumption of proper authority to institute the appeal
was rebutted when Crown counsel filed with the Court a letter on which he
relied for his authority to appeal. This letter purported to be signed by one
""J. M. Bentley, For Director, Criminal Law Section"", and was written
on the letterhead of the Department of Justice. There was no indication as to
J. M. Bentley's occupa­tion; it might be that of a stenographer.

Section 2(2) ... of the Code provides that with cer­tain
inapplicable exceptions ""Attorney General"" includes Deputy
Attorney-General.

The learned judge of appeal continued, p. 147:

Where a statutory power is given to an officer or an
individual that power cannot be delegated to another in the absence of
statutory authority so to do. See Abrahams v. The Queen (1881), 6
S.C.R. 10.

Section 584 clearly intends that there must be instruc­tion
to appeal given by the Attorney-General or Deputy Attorney-General directly to
counsel. The wording ""instructed by him for the purpose"" must be
given its ordinary meaning.

The right of appeal is not a common law right but a
statutory creation and, in the case of an appeal by the Crown, one of quite
recent creation and must be strictly construed. The wording ""instructed by
him"", differing so materially from the wording conferring the right of
appeal given by s. 720 of the Code, would suggest that in the case of an
appeal by the Crown in procedure by indictment there is a greater
responsibility resting on the Crown than in summary conviction matters and the
Attorney-General or his Deputy must take the personal responsibility for
instituting such an appeal. That au­thority cannot be delegated to others,
certainly not to a

[Page 244]

person or [sic] unidentified capacity purporting to sign ""For
Director, Criminal Law Section"". (Italics are mine.)

The Court concluded that counsel for the Crown was not vested
with the power to make the applica­tion for leave to appeal as ""he had not
been instructed by the Attorney-General or his Deputy for the purpose.""

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reached a
different, and, I believe, prefer-able conclusion on identical facts in R.
v. Wiens[5]. The
notice of appeal had been authorized, it appeared, by Mr. J. M. Bentley of the
Department of Justice. The Court referred to what had been said by Jenkins J.
and by Denning L.J. (as he then was) in Metropolitan Borough and Town Clerk
of Lewisham v. Roberts[6]. Lord
Denning said, p. 621:

... Now I take it to be quite plain that when a minister is
entrusted with administrative, as distinct from legisla­tive, functions he is
entitled to act by any authorized official of his department. The minister is
not bound to give his mind to the matter personally. This is implicit in the
modern machinery of government...

The Alberta Court disposed of the preliminary objection in these
words, p. 640:

The word ""official"" is used in each of these quota­tions.
This would imply that the person who gave the instructions to appeal held such
a position in the Department that it could be implied that he was performing
this duty on the instructions of the Minister. I am not suggesting that such a
person must hold any specific office in the Department. The present case
illustrates the type of person who would be included as an ""offi­cial"".
The criminal law section is charged with the responsibility for all criminal
litigation conducted by the Government of Canada. As director of that section,
Mr. J. A. Scollin, Q.C. would have the implied authority to authorize these
appeals. Mr. Bentley, as the person next senior to Mr. Scollin and authorized
to act as director in his absence, would unquestionably have similar author­ity.
A similar inference could be drawn from other officials, who, because of their
position in the Department, it could be assumed, had been authorized to act for
the Minister in such cases. The preliminary objection is dismissed.

[Page 245]

In my opinion there is implied authority in the Attorney General
to delegate the power to instruct, in s. 605(1) . I do not think that s. 605(1) 
requires the Attorney General personally to appeal or personally to instruct
counsel to appeal in every case. Although there is a general rule of construc­tion
in law that a person endowed with a discre­tionary power should exercise it
personally (delegatus non potest delegare) that rule can be displaced by
the language, scope or object of a particular administrative scheme. A power to
dele­gate is often implicit in a scheme empowering a Minister to act. As
Professor Willis remarked in ""Delegatus Non Potest Delegare"", (1943),
21 Can. Bar Rev. 257 at p. 264:

.. in their application of the maxim delegatus non potest
delegare to modern governmental agencies the Courts have in most cases
preferred to depart from the literal construction of the words of the statute which
would require them to read in the word ""personally"" and to adopt such
a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern government which,
being carried on in theory by elected representatives but in practice by civil
servants or local government officers, undoubtedly requires them to read in the
words ""or any person authorized by it"".

See also S. A. DeSmith, Judicial Review of Administrative
Action, 3d ed., at p. 271. Thus, where the exercise of a discretionary
power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown it may be presumed that the acts
will be performed, not by the Minister in person, but by responsible officials
in his department: Carltona, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Works[7].
The tasks of a Minister of the Crown in modern times are so many and varied
that it is unreasonable to expect them to be performed personally. It is to be
supposed that the Minister will select deputies and departmental officials of
experience and competence, and that such appointees, for whose conduct the
Minister is accountable to the Legislature, will act on behalf

[Page 246]

of the Minister, within the bounds of their respec­tive grants of
authority, in the discharge of minis­terial responsibilities. Any other
approach would but lead to administrative chaos and inefficiency. It is true
that in the present case there is no evidence that the Attorney General of
British Columbia personally instructed Mr. McDiarmid to act on his behalf in
appealing judgments or ver­dicts of acquittal of trial courts but it is
reasonable to assume the ""Director, Criminal Law"" of the Province
would have that authority to instruct.

I do not find anything in the Criminal Code  which
derogates from the thought that the duties imposed upon the Attorneys General
are to be exercised under their authority by responsible offi­cials of their
respective departments. ""Attorney General"", according to an amendment
to s. 2 of the Code made in 1968-69, includes ""the lawful
deputy"" of the said Attorney General or in the French version de «substitut
légitime». I do not read ""lawful deputy"" as confined to ""Deputy
Attorney General"". The words comprehend all persons appointed to act on
behalf of the Attorney General when acting within the scope of their authority.

The authority of Crown counsel to act in instituting an appeal is
not something which must be proved as part of the case on appeal. In the
absence of direct challenge, no evidence need be adduced to confirm the
authority of counsel who appeals on behalf of the Crown and describes himself
as ""counsel for"" or ""counsel instructed by"" or ""agent
for"" the Attorney General or in words to like effect. Advocates are
officers of the Court and it is to be taken, in the normal course, that when a
counsel states he is acting with the authority of the Attorney General he is
indeed clothed with that authority. Technical challenges to jurisdiction based
upon alleged insufficiency of signature to notices of appeal can be wasteful of
time and money. If, however, objection be taken which raises ground for doubt
as to authority, the ques­tion arises as to how far one must go, and what
evidence must be adduced, to establish authority. The answer will depend on the
circumstances of the particular case. Without attempting to lay down any
general rule, it would normally be sufficient

[Page 247]

if counsel produces a letter which he can say he received and
believes to be signed by the Attor­ney General or Deputy Attorney General or an
officer of the department whom he understands to have requisite authority to
institute criminal appeals. See R. v. Turner[8].

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia allow­ing the preliminary objection and direct that
the appeal be proceeded with.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Order of absolute
discharge—Appeal by Crown—Jurisdiction of appellate Court to interfere with
provincial judge’s order and to enter conviction and impose sentence—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 605(1)(a), 614, 618(2)(a), 662.1(1),
(3)(a) [enacted 1972, c. 13, s. 57].

The appellant, who pleaded guilty to a charge
of assault causing bodily harm, was granted an absolute discharge by the
Provincial Judge, pursuant to s. 662.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . On
appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta quashed the
order of absolute discharge, entered a conviction and imposed a fine of $200
with imprisonment for 30 days in default of payment. The appellant appealed to
this Court, asserting he had an appeal as of right under s. 618(2) (a)
because he was a person who had been acquitted of an indictable offence and
whose acquittal had been set aside on appeal. His principal submission was that
the Appellate Division was without jurisdiction to hear the Crown’s appeal
because the effect of s. 662.1(3) (a) was to require the
Crown, if it would appeal from an order of discharge, to found its appeal on
s. 605(1) (a) and hence to be limited to a question of law
alone.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant could come to this Court only
by leave, pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. Leave was
granted nunc pro tunc to enable the Court to consider the appellant’s
principal submission.

The Appellate Division had jurisdiction to
interfere with the order of the Provincial Judge and to enter a conviction and
impose a penalty. The words in s. 662.1(3)(a) “in the case of an
appeal by the Attorney General, [as if that direction were] a finding that the
accused was not guilty” were necessary in order to

[Page 196]

enable the provincial appellate Court to
enter a conviction upon setting aside an order of discharge and thereafter to
impose a sentence pursuant to s. 614. In order to fit an appeal from a
discharge into the scheme of appeals from sentence, which are predicated upon a
conviction, it was necessary to give the appellate Court power to enter a
conviction where it was disposed to allow an appeal from a discharge order and
this was done by s. 662.1(3)(a). This provision cannot be
regarded as giving a right of appeal on a different foundation than that for
existing appeals against sentence so as to make it virtually impossible for the
Crown to appeal a discharge order.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1],
quashing an order of absolute discharge, entering a conviction and imposing a
penalty. Appeal dismissed.

A.M. Harradence, Q.C., for the appellant.

B.A. Crane and P. Chrumka, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant in this case
pleaded guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. After making this
finding the Provincial Judge declared that “I do not convict the accused, I
find that it is in the interests of the accused and not contrary to the public
interest to grant to the accused an absolute discharge pursuant to
s. 662.1  of the Criminal Code .” The Provincial Judge, before making
the order of absolute discharge, delineated the considerations which moved him
to that determination. The Crown appealed to the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, coupling its assertion of an appeal de plano with
an application for leave if it should be necessary. The Appellate Division
quashed the order of absolute discharge, entered a conviction and imposed a
fine of $200, with imprisonment for 30 days in default of payment.

The convicted appellant now appeals to this
Court, asserting he has an appeal as of right under

[Page 197]

s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  because
he was a person who had been acquitted of an indictable offence and whose
acquittal had been set aside on appeal. For the reasons that follow, it is my
opinion that (1) the appellant can come to this Court only by leave, pursuant
to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, as
amended; (2) leave should be granted nunc pro tunc to enable this Court
to consider the appellant’s principal submission, namely, that the Alberta
Appellate Division was without jurisdiction to hear the Crown’s appeal to it
from the order of absolute discharge; (3) the Alberta Appellate Division had
jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Provincial Judge and to enter a
conviction and impose a penalty; and (4) I would dismiss the appeal to this
Court from the decision of the Alberta Appellate Division.

By amendments to the Criminal Code  made
by 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 662.1 was enacted to provide for absolute
or conditional discharges in certain circumstances and for appeals in such cases
and, concurrently, the definition of “sentence” in s. 601  was amended to
include “a disposition made under s. 662.1(1) …”. It will suffice for
present purposes to set out the provisions of s. 662.1(1)  and (3) , and
they are as follows:

662.1 (1)
Where an accused, other than a corporation, pleads guilty to or is found guilty
of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is
prescribed by law or an offence punishable, in the proceedings commenced
against him, by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life or by death, the
court before which he appears may, if it considers it to be in the best
interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of
convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely
or upon the conditions prescribed in a probation order.

…

(3) Where a court directs under
subsection (1) that an accused be discharged, the accused shall be deemed
not to have been convicted of the offence to which he pleaded guilty or of
which he was found guilty and to which the discharge relates except that

[Page 198]

(a) the accused or the Attorney
General may appeal from the direction that the accused be discharged as if that
direction were a conviction in respect of the offence to which the discharge
relates or, in the case of an appeal by the Attorney General, a finding that
the accused was not guilty of that offence; and

(b) the accused may plead autrefois
convict in respect of any subsequent charge relating to the offence to
which the discharge relates.

Were it not for s. 662.1(3)(a), it
would be clear beyond peradventure that an appeal from an order of absolute or
conditional discharge is an appeal against sentence, and hence governed, where
the appeal is by the accused, by s. 603(1)(b) and s. 614; and,
where the appeal is by the Crown, governed by s. 605(1)(b) and
s. 614. Leave is required in either case from the Court of Appeal. Counsel
for the appellant contends, however, that the effect of s. 662.1(3)(a)
(and especially the words “in the case of an appeal by the Attorney General,
[as if that direction were] a finding that the accused was not guilty”…) is to
require the Crown, if it would appeal from an order of discharge, to found its
appeal on s. 605(1)(a) and hence, to be limited to a question of
law alone. In short, the contention is that the appeal is from an acquittal and
this contention is also carried forward to support the appellant’s position
that there is an appeal de plano to this Court under s. 618(2) (a).

The effective answer to this line of argument
was given by counsel for the respondent who submitted, correctly in my opinion,
that the quoted words of s. 662.1(3)(a) were necessary in order to
enable the provincial appellate Court to enter a conviction upon setting aside
an order of discharge and thereafter to impose a sentence pursuant to
s. 614. The drafting in s. 662.1(3)(a) could have been
clearer, but there is no doubt, when regard is had to the amended definition of
sentence and to the distinction made between guilt and conviction in
s. 662.1 , that in order to fit an appeal from a discharge into the scheme
of appeals from sentence, which are predicated upon a conviction, it was
necessary to give the appellate Court power to

[Page 199]

enter a conviction where it was disposed to
allow an appeal from a discharge order and this was done by s. 662.1(3)(a).
I cannot agree that this provision is to be regarded as giving a right of
appeal on a different foundation than that for existing appeals against
sentence so as to make it virtually impossible for the Crown to appeal a
discharge order.

In the present case, leave to appeal the
discharge order was sought, and I take the Appellate Division’s decision to
have been made by granting leave and concurrently disposing of the appeal on the
merits. This is not a case in which leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to
s. 41(1) should be given. I would therefore quash the appeal to this Court
in so far as it was brought de plano, and dismiss it on the point on which
leave was granted.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Possession of stolen
goods—Motion for nonsuit—Sufficiency of evidence or absence of evidence—Rule in
Hodge’s Case not applicable—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 312.

Respondent was charged with being in
possession of two television sets knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown
presented no evidence and relied solely on the admissions of fact. These
disclose that the two television sets were loaded on a freight car which was
sealed when the car left Brockville and the seal upon which was unbroken when it arrived in Montreal. Neither of the consignees
received these television sets, which were found when the police searched the
premises of respondent. Respondent then filed a motion of nonsuit on the ground
that there was no evidence that the goods had been stolen. The judge of the
Court of Sessions of the Peace granted the motion. This decision was affirmed
by a majority of the Court of Appeal of Quebec. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: A motion for nonsuit cannot be
granted unless there is no evidence on which a jury acting reasonably might
have convicted the accused. The test propounded in Hodge’s Case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, was concerned with the weight to be attached
to the evidence, whereas here the question is whether there is any evidence to
weigh. The admissions constitute evidence upon which a jury might reasonably
have concluded that the goods were stolen and that respondent knew that they
had been obtained by theft. Even if the facts can be otherwise interpreted, the
burden upon the Crown is not to negative every conjecture to which
circumstantial evidence might give rise and which might be consistent with the
innocence of the accused.

[Page 182]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and de Grandpré JJ., dissenting: Even if there is
no question that on a motion for nonsuit the accused can only be released if
there is an absence of evidence, that does not mean that the motion must be
dismissed whenever there is an iota of evidence, no matter how inconsequential
this may be. In the case at bar theft was an essential element of the charge
and the Crown did not submit evidence that there was a theft in the car in
which the television sets were placed, or that the consignees were unlawfully
deprived of them. The doctrine of recent possession must be dismissed if its foundation,
namely the theft, is not established.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Quebec, affirming a
judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace granting a motion for nonsuit.
Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J., Spence and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

G. Fortier and P. Sauvé, for the
appellant.

G. Thouin and Fernande Rainville-Laporte,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J. (dissenting)—The Crown
asks this Court to set aside a judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace
granting a motion of nonsuit, a judgment affirmed by a majority of the Court of
Appeal.

The indictment reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] On or about January 12, 1972,
did unlawfully have in his possession two (2) R.C.A. Victor television sets, a Sylvania television set and a Phono-Sonic
stereo, the whole having a value of approximately $1,875, the property of
various persons, in which Canadian National has a special interest, knowing
that the said items were obtained by the commission in

[Page 183]

Canada of an
offence punishable by indictment, namely: a theft, committing thereby a
criminal offence, prescribed by s. 312  of the Criminal Code .

The appeal is concerned only with the two R.C.A.
Victor television sets, as the Crown admitted in the Quebec courts that it lacked sufficient evidence with respect to the other
two items.

In the case at bar the Crown summoned no
witnesses, relying solely on the following admissions:

[TRANSLATION] …the parties agree to admit
that:

(1) on January 11, 1972, two (2) R.C.A.
Victor television sets, produced as Exhibits P-1 and P-2 and here present in
the court, shipped to Paradis T.V. Enregistré of St‑Pascal, Province of
Quebec, and to Ouellet & Fils Limitée of Rimouski, Province of Quebec, were
delivered at Prescott, Province of Ontario, by Mr. Thomas Degroot, shipper
with R.C.A. Victor Limited, to Mr. Francis Ferguson, driver for Canadian
National;

(2) this delivery was recorded in two (2)
contracts of carriage numbered P-10 403 and P-14 01976, signed by
Messrs. Degroot and Ferguson;

(3) on the same day Mr. Ferguson
delivered the two (2) R.C.A. Victor television sets to Mr. Pervus
Dillabough at Brockville, Province of Ontario;

(4) this delivery was recorded on the
aforesaid contracts of carriage;

(5) Mr. Dillabough placed the two (2)
aforesaid television sets in car CN 523257 of train No. 212, originating at
Brockville and destined for Montreal, on January 11, 1972, and sealed the said
car CN 523257 with seal No. C 441889-90;

(6) in Montreal, at about five fifty-five (5:55) A.M. on January 12, 1972, Mr. Thrimp (according to
his testimony), the checker for Canadian National in Montreal, checked car No. CN 523257 in train No. 212, and found that the
seals were intact;

(7) Ouellet & Fils Limitée and Paradis
T.V. Enregistré did not receive the television sets they had ordered from
R.C.A. Victor Limited in Prescott;

(8) the aforesaid television sets, together
with a Sylvania set and a Phono-Sonic stereo, were found in a search conducted
by officers of Canadian National and the Montreal Police at the premises of the
accused, at

[Page 184]

about one-thirty (1:30) P.M. on January 14,
1972, at 8877 Tolhurst, in Montreal, Province of Quebec;

(9) if the police officers who carried out
the investigation were heard, they would identify the accused as the person on
whose premises they found the television sets on January 14, 1972.

The Crown having indicated that its evidence was
concluded after the presentation of the foregoing admissions, the defence
immediately moved for nonsuit; this motion was taken under reserve and finally
granted. On this point the transcript reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The Court grants the motion
of nonsuit and acquits the accused.

The Crown has not been able to present
evidence establishing the allegation beyond any doubt.

Further, in his oral judgment, the trial judge
said:

[TRANSLATION] I have concluded that the
motion for nonsuit should be granted, as the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction the commission of a prerequisite for the existence of the offence
as stated, namely a theft.

Brossard J., speaking for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, concluded that

[TRANSLATION] there is no evidence
on the record establishing that the aforesaid articles were actually stolen
(emphasis added).

Thus he concurs in the conclusion of the trial
judge, while emphasizing that the language used by the latter was not
especially well chosen, but that this could not have the effect of causing the
trial judgment to be set aside, if no valid evidence really existed in support
of one of the essential aspects of the information, namely theft. The relevant
paragraph from the reasons of Brossard J. is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Undoubtedly the trial judge
would have been wiser not to go beyond the finding that no evidence of theft
existed, and add the opinion that, in any event, he did not have before him
evidence to support beyond any reasonable doubt a conviction of the accused of
unlawful possession of stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen; but this can
have no effect on the validity of the dismissal of the information for lack of
evidence of theft of the goods found in the possession of

[Page 185]

the respondent, and accordingly of any link
between such a theft and the possession of respondent.

Turgeon J. was of the same view, stating that
there existed no

[TRANSLATION] evidence of theft of the
articles found in the possession of respondent.

For his part, Lajoie J. summarized his
dissenting opinion in the following way:

[TRANSLATION] The motion for nonsuit could
only have been granted if there was a total lack of evidence against the
accused. If there was any basis for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,
as in my opinion was the case here, the motion should have been dismissed and
the accused called to state whether or not he had a defence to present. The
judge could not proceed to assess the evidence and make a decision on the
merits until after the conclusion of that evidence on both sides.

Relying on this dissenting opinion the Crown
brought the case to this Court, stating the legal argument on which it relies
as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Did the Court of Appeal of
Quebec err in law in holding in its majority decision that there was a total
lack of evidence in the record of the essential element of theft required to
support the charge of unlawful possession of stolen goods?

There is no question that on a motion for
nonsuit the accused can only be released if there is an absence of evidence. In
this connection we need only refer to the remarks of Pigeon J. in The Queen
v. Kyling[1], at
p. 956:

Regarding the contents of the judge’s
report, I must respectfully point out that an absence, not an insufficiency, of
evidence is meant in the following reason: “the Crown did not adduce the
evidence necessary to show that the charge is well founded”.

In The King v. Morabito, [1949]
S.C.R. 172, this Court held that a nonsuit pronounced on a motion by the
defence after the close of the case for the Crown is a decision on a question
of law, namely the absence of evidence. This rule was also held applicable to
summary proceedings by the judgment in Feeley et al. v. The Queen, [1953]
1 S.C.R. 59. I have found nothing in the 1955 Criminal Code  that
might imply a change in the principles underlying these judgments, nor has
anything to this effect been brought to our attention.

[Page 186]

As Pigeon J. points out, the applicable
principles were discussed more fully in Morabito and Feeley, and
I adopt the reasons expressed in those cases.

However, the expression “absence of evidence”
does not mean that the motion for a nonsuit must be dismissed whenever there is
an iota of evidence, no matter how inconsequential this may be. On the
contrary, a careful reading of Feeley, referred to above, discloses that
there were few iotas of evidence in that case. Appellants had been acquitted at
first instance on a motion for nonsuit, and the Court of Appeal had set aside
this acquittal and ordered a new trial. This Court unanimously reinstated the
judgment of acquittal with respect to three of the four appellants. Cartwright
J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, emphasized that the various aspects
of the evidence “taken together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case”
(p. 64). This conclusion must be read in the light of the following paragraph,
taken from the reasons of Cartwright J. (at p. 60):

It is common ground that had the learned
Magistrate refused the motion the appellants would have had the right to call
evidence for the defence if so advised and counsel for the respondent submits
that the decision of this Court in The King v. Morabito establishes (i)
that at that stage it was not open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the
charge unless there was no evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury,
a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the
accused, and (ii) that whether or not there was such evidence is “a question of
law alone” within the meaning of section 1013(4) of the Code. I agree with
this submission.

In my view, therefore, the judges of the Court
of Appeal, on appeal by the Crown, applied the pertinent principles of law in
examining the record.

It must now be considered whether Brossard and
Turgeon JJ. were correct in concluding, as they did, that there was no evidence
on the record establishing theft of the two television sets, in the sense that
must be attributed to the phrase “absence of evidence”. On this point, Brossard
J. observes:

[Page 187]

[TRANSLATION] In my opinion counsel for the
respondent correctly maintained that there was no evidence on the record
establishing that the aforesaid articles were actually stolen; the most that
could be inferred from the Crown evidence and the admissions was that at some
point, not specified, these articles, under circumstances that were not
established, ceased to be in the possession of the carrier, and were not
subsequently delivered into the actual possession of their original consignees.
In my view, this evidence could not serve as the foundation of evidence of
commission of a theft, whether from the shipper or the consignees. Conjectures
and assumptions do not constitute evidence of the unlawfulness of possession.

I consider that this conclusion was correct.

In a case such as that before the Court, where
the indictment charges respondent with unlawful possession of stolen articles,
knowing that those articles were obtained by the commission of a theft, theft
is an essential element which has to be established by the Crown: Geist v.
The Queen[2], (Court
of Appeal of Quebec); R. v. Vogelle and Reid[3], (Court of Appeal of Manitoba); R.
v. Gowing[4], (Court
of Appeal of Alberta).

If the Crown submits no evidence (in the sense
defined above) of the commission of a theft, an accused who makes a motion for
nonsuit must be acquitted. Moreover, the Crown concedes the merit of these
principles, since it relies in its factum on [TRANSLATION] “proof that the
buyers had not alienated the goods”, “the absence of evidence of any title in
the accused to the said goods”, and “the other circumstances of the case”. In
the case at bar, I have read and re-read the admissions which constitute the
Crown’s only evidence, and I find absolutely no proof

(a) that there was in fact a theft in the car in
which the television sets were placed; on the contrary, the last time this car
was examined (para. six of the admissions) the seals were intact;

(b) that the consignees, namely Ouellet and
Paradis, were unlawfully deprived of the televi-

[Page 188]

son sets; on the contrary, the only statement to
be found in the admissions (para. seven) is that they were not received, but it
is in no way alleged that such non-delivery was against their will.

The record thus contains no evidence of the
theft alleged in the indictment, and consequently the entire argument of the
Crown based on “recent possession” must be dismissed, since the foundation of
that argument, namely the theft, was not established.

For all these reasons, I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeal and the acquittal of respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirming the judgment rendered
at trial in the “Cour des Sessions”, whereby the learned trial judge granted
the motion for nonsuit advanced by the present respondent at his trial on a
charge of being in possession of stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen,
on the ground that there was no evidence that the goods found in the
respondent’s pessession had been stolen. The conclusion of the learned trial
judge, which was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal (Lajoie J.
dissenting) was phrased as follows:

[TRANSLATION] I have concluded that the
motion for nonsuit should be granted, as the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction the commission of a prerequisite for the existence of the offence
as stated, namely a theft.

The Crown presented no evidence and this appeal
falls to be determined in accordance with a statement of admitted facts which
has been recited by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in the course of the reasons
for judgment which he has prepared for delivery in this appeal.

In summary, these facts disclose that two R.C.A.
Victor television sets produced at the trial had been shipped from Prescott,
Ontario, by the C.N. Railway, one to Paradis T.V. Enregistré of St-Pascal and
the other to Ouellet et Fils Limitée

[Page 189]

of Rimouski, and that these sets were loaded on
a freight car which was sealed and the seal upon which had not been broken when
it arrived in Montreal in the early hours of January 12, 1972. Neither of the
consignees received these television sets, both of which were found when the
police searched the premises of the respondent in Montreal on January 14, 1972.

It was agreed also that if the police officers
who effected the search had been heard at the trial they could have identified
the accused as the person in whose premises the television sets were found.

The position of a Magistrate in considering a
motion for nonsuit is authoritatively described by Cartwright J., as he then
was, in Feeley and others v. The Queen[5],
at p. 61 where, after making reference to the case of R. v.
Morabito[6], he
adopts the submission

…that at that stage it was not open to the
learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no evidence on which,
had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed jury, acting
reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that whether or
not there was such evidence is “a question of law alone” within the meaning of
section 1013(4) of the Code.

The underlining is my own.

On the admitted facts the two television sets
were known to have been in a sealed C.N.R. freight car in Montreal en route to
their respective destinations at St-Pascal and Rimouski in the early hours of January
12th. They were never received by the consignees, but two and a half days later
had found their way to the respondent’s premises in Montreal and I am of
opinion that from these facts a properly instructed jury might reasonably have
drawn the inference that they did not get there without having been stolen by
somebody.

It is suggested, however that as the evidence
disclosed by the admissions is purely circumstantial, the proper test to be
employed in assessing the

[Page 190]

weight to be attached to it is that first
propounded by Baron Alderson in charging the jury in Hodge’s Case[7], which was adopted by Sir Lyman
Duff, C.J., on behalf of this Court in R. v. Comba[8]. This test is, however, to be read
in light of what was said by Spence J., speaking on behalf of the majority of
this Court in R. v. Mitchell[9], at
p. 478, where he said:

Does the fact that evidence is
circumstantial necessarily require that an instruction be given to the jury in
accordance with that which was given in Hodge’s Case!

To answer this question it is desirable to
recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge’s case. The report
states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of
circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken
alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, not only that those circumstances were
consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied
that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.

It is quite clear that this direction
was concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person
who had committed the crime. (The underlining is my
own)

This statement was reaffirmed in R. v.
Bagshaw[10], at
p. 6. (a case of theft).

We are not concerned here with the
identification of the thief. The issue is not who stole the goods, but whether
there is any evidence justifying the inference that they were stolen. It should
be observed also that the rule in Hodge’s Case, supra, which was
reaffirmed in R.v. Comba, supra, was concerned with the weight to
be attached to the evidence, whereas here the question is whether there was any
evidence to weigh.

It is admitted that the goods in question were
found in the accused’s home on January 14, 1972, and if the admissions
constitute evidence upon

[Page 191]

which a properly instructed jury might
reasonably have concluded that the goods were stolen, it would follow that they
might also have concluded that the respondent knew that they had been obtained
by theft in accordance with the rebut-table presumption to which such possession
would give rise. See R. v. Schama: R. v. Abramovitch[11], Ungaro v. The King[12], and many other cases in this
Court.

It is said, however, that the admitted facts are
capable of being construed as leading to other rational conclusions than the
theft of the goods such as the conclusion that the consignees were a party to
their goods being diverted from the custody of the railway company to the home
of the accused. As to this contention reference may be had to the statement
made by McRuer, C.J.H.C. in R. v. Mclver[13], at p. 309, which was adopted
in this Court in Wild v. The Queen[14],
and in R. v. Bagshaw, supra, and where it is said:

The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it clear
that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is, the facts proved in
evidence and the conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be
rational conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion
would be a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.

I do not think that the burden resting upon the
Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt includes
the added burden of negativing every conjecture to which circumstantial
evidence might give rise and which might be consistent with the innocence of
the accused.

As I have indicated, however, I do not think
that the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff in the Comba Case, supra, in which
he reiterates the rule in Hodge s Case has any application to the circumstances
here disclosed. I am rather of opinion, as indicated by Mr. Justice Pigeon
in R. v. Kyling[15],

[Page 192]

at p. 957, that the true test to be applied
before granting a nonsuit is whether the Crown evidence gives rise merely to a
suspicion or whether it is such as to justify the drawing of an inference.

In my view the facts disclosed in the admissions
are such that a properly instructed jury might reasonably draw the inference
that the goods had been stolen, and as there was no evidence to support any
other rational conclusion, I am of opinion that this was not an appropriate
case in which to grant an order of nonsuit, and I would accordingly allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of
acquittal and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defences—Entrapment—Police
informer—Possession of cocaine and heroin—Narcotics Control Act, R.S.C., 1970,
c. N-1, ss. 3(1), (2), 4(2), (3).

Appellant was found by Metropolitan Toronto
police to be in possession of heroin and was arrested. He told the police that
he worked as an informer for the R.C.M.P. but that the R.C.M.P. were unaware
that he had bought the heroin and was going to sell it. He was also found to be
in possession of cocaine. Appellant was a drug addict and this was known to the
R.C.M.P. He had been used by the R.C.M.P. as a decoy and informer, and this
involved him, according to his evidence, in purchasing drugs with money
supplied by the R.C.M.P. and in selling drugs. The R.C.M.P. contact’s evidence
was that appellant had not told him that he was selling drugs as well as buying
them and that appellant was used by the R.C.M.P. as a paid informer even after
his arrest, not an unusual practice of the R.C.M.P. in their use of informers.
Appellant was convicted of possession and possession for the purpose of
trafficking after his defence of entrapment was withdrawn from the jury by the
trial judge.

The Court of Appeal in affirming the convictions
but reducing the sentence asserted that the defence of entrapment was not open
to the accused, adding that no such defence is available in England and that U.S. judgments dealing with entrapment have not been applied in Canada. The Supreme Court granted leave to
appeal further on the question of law: “Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the learned trial judge was right in not putting the defence of
entrapment to the jury?”

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The sole point raised by counsel for the
appelant was that entrapment should have been left to the jury because the
evidence showed a police-concocted plan to

[Page 488]

ensnare him going beyond mere solicitation.
The evidence was not open to such a view. Without expressing an opinion on any
other question the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The use of spies and informers is an
inevitable requirement for detection of consensual crimes and of discouraging
their commission. Such practices do not involve such dirty tricks as to be
offensive to the integrity of the judicial process. Nor can objection on this
ground be taken to the use of decoys who provide the opportunity to others intent
upon the commission of a consensual offence. In such cases the offender can
claim no extenuation that would mitigate his culpability or the use of evidence
to establish it or his punishment upon conviction. The problem which has caused
judicial concern is the one which arises from the police instigated crime,
where the police have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have
actively organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to
prosecute the person so caught. It is only in this situation that it is proper
to speak of entrapment and to consider what effect this should have on the
prosecution of a person thus drawn into the commission of an offence. In England and in New
 Zealand, judicial revulsion against entrapment of an
accused has been manifested not through recognition of it as a defence but
rather through a discretionary control of the admissibility of evidence and
through mitigation of sentence. While in Canada there is no appellate Court
judgment in which entrapment has been accepted as providing a defence or even
as going to discretionary power to exclude evidence, it was touched on in R.
v. Ormerod, [1969] 2 O.R. 230. No conclusion was reached in that
case because the issue did not arise on the facts which did not go beyond
ordinary solicitation of a suspected drug seller. The present case like Ormerod
and others does not squarely confront the Court with the need to decide
what legal effect should be given to such entrapment.

The evidence in the present case taking it most
favourably to the appellant failed to show entrapment in respect of the
offences charged. Appellant had initiated a transaction which he carried out on
his own for his own benefit. The view of the Court of Appeal in this case or of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Chernecki (1971), 16
C.R.N.S. 230, rejecting entrapment as a defence should not be endorsed. That
question should be left open.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal by the appellant from his conviction on charges under the Narcotics
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, ss. 3, 4. Appeal dismissed.

Victor S. Paisley, for the appellant.

S.M. Froomkin, Q.C., and Michael Dambrot,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal is here by leave
of this Court on the following question of law:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in holding
that the learned trial judge was right in law in not putting the defence of
entrapment to the jury?

The appellant was convicted after a jury trial
of two drug offences, namely, possession of cocaine contrary to s. 3(1), (2) of
the Narcotics Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1 and possession of heroin
for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2), (3) of the same Act. His
main defence was entrapment, which was withdrawn from the jury in the trial
judge’s charge to them. In affirming the convictions but reducing the sentence,
the Ontario Court of Appeal asserted that the defence of entrapment was not
open to the accused, adding that no such defence is available in England and
that judgments of Courts in the United States dealing with entrapment have not
been applied or followed in Canada: see R. v. Kirzner[2].

The trial judge’s charge to the jury shows that
he took a broad view of entrapment, taking it to embrace the use of an agent
provocateur or the use of an informer as well as inveiglement by the
police. However, he distinguished the situation where there was a complete
concoction, presumably by the police, so that there was no actus reus and
perhaps not even any mens rea by the accused. The trial judge obviously
had in mind the judg-

[Page 490]

ment of this Court in Lemieux v. The Queen[3], to which I will return later in these reasons.

The following three passages in the charge to
the jury show how the issue of entrapment was dealt with by the trial judge:

(1)… Entrapment is basically where a police
officer or somebody in authority has inveigled somebody or tricked them to
carry out some duty, or possibly it may be argued that the person who claims
they are entrapped, did it on their own volition. In other words, it arises in
a case such as this where we have an agent provocateur, the police agent or
undercover agent who uses an informer. Now, entrapment in our law is no
defence.

(2)… If you found the accused in fact
committed the offence with which he is charged and had done this at the
solicitation of an agent provocateur, that is an undercover agent, that would
have been irrelevant as to the question of guilt or innocence It may go to the
question of sentence but if you find he has acted as an agent in an illegal act
he would still be guilty.

(3)… it is not a defence for a person who
carries out a forbidden act or consents to do it knowing what he is in fact
doing. The only thing is that it would go to the mitigation of sentence. So
that a crime in some instances may be committed from the best of motives, but
it is still a crime.

…

So, I repeat to you, basically in this country
entrapment is not defence to the charge unless the only way that you could find
would be on the evidence that the accused really had no intention of committing
the crime, it wasn’t his act, this was a complete concoction. That wouldn’t
even involve entrapment in such a case, it would really be that a crime had not
been committed. It would be something similar to what I have told you of the
undercover arrangement for the break-in.

Again I must remind you that an accused if
he in fact did commit the offence with which he was charged, and in the
circumstances he had committed the act at the solicitation of an agent
provocateur, this would go to the question of his guilt or innocence.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant
that this Court should recognize the defence of

[Page 491]

entrapment both where a drug offence has been
committed through the mere solicitation of a police agent and where the police,
through a plan or design to ensnare a person in order to prosecute him, have
induced him to commit an offence. On the other hand, counsel for the Crown has
urged this Court to refuse to recognize the defence in either situation but
contended that even if it be proper to accept entrapment as a defence, the
distinction recognized in the American cases, between mere solicitation or use
of an informer and origination of a criminal design by the police into which
the accused is drawn, would exclude it as a defence in the present case. This
submission by the Crown depends, of course, on a particular view of the evidence
as not being capable of supporting a finding that there was here a plan or
design by the police to inveigle the accused into the commission of an offence.

Entrapment is not self-defining, and, in a
generic sense, may encompass a wide array of practices involving police action
which, directly or indirectly, reveals or brings about the commission of an
offence by another. The police, or the agent provocateur or the informer
or the decoy used by the police do not have immunity if their conduct in the
encouragement of a commission of a crime by another is itself criminal. Of
course, whether they are prosecuted is a matter for the Crown attorneys and
ultimately, for the Attorneys-General. What, however, of the person who is
charged as a result of the action of an informer or who commits an offence
through the solicitation or encouragement of a spy or decoy or through police
instigation or through a plan or design of the police to ensnare him? Absent
duress, as dealt with in s. 17  of the Criminal Code , what should the
Court’s attitude be if the evidence shows police involvement, in any one of the
ways above-mentioned, in the commission of the offence?

The role of the police and the role of the
Courts in the enforcement of the criminal law are distinct although interacting.
The former are charged with the investigation and detection of criminal conduct
and with gathering the evidence upon which

[Page 492]

charges are laid to bring the alleged offenders
before the Courts for judicial determination of their culpability. Courts are
concerned with the proper interpretation and application of the criminal law
invoked against accused persons, with the propriety of the conduct of the
prosecution and of the defence, especially in the light of the fundamental
principle of the presumption of innocence, and in this connection, with the
behaviour of the police authorities in respect of their dealings with an
arrested or about-to-be arrested accused. It was in the exercise of this
judicial oversight that the Courts recognized duress as a defence (see R. v.
Steane[4]), developed
the exclusionary rules respecting confessions (see, for example, Boudreau v.
The King[5] and Piché
v. The Queen[6]) and,
in this country, have accepted res judicata or issue estoppel as a bar
to a second conviction (see Kienapple v. The Queen[7]). These were common law developments,
although, in the case of duress, codification in s. 17  of the Criminal Code  has
overlaid the common law: see Paquette v. The Queen[8].

There is, of course, a balance to be struck
between giving reasonable latitude to the police in the employment of
stratagems to control the spread of crime, especially in the case of the
illegal drug traffic, and controlling behaviour that goes beyond any reasonable
latitude. American jurisdictions have, on a constitutional basis, sought to
control the introduction of illegally obtained evidence; in England, the Courts have continued to
exercise a discretionary power to control the admissibility of evidence that
would operate unfairly against an accused. Control techniques may thus relate
to the recognition of substantive defences or to rules against the admission of
evidence or to a discretion as to its reception. Abuse of process or stay of
proceedings have also been put forward as techniques of control.

Methods of detection of offences and of
suspected offences and offenders necessarily differ according to the class of
crime. Where, for example, violence or breaking, entering and theft are

[Page 493]

concerned, there will generally be external
evidence of an offence upon which the police can act in tracking down the
offenders; the victim or his family or the property owner, as the case may be,
may be expected to call in the police and provide some clues for the police to
pursue. When “consensual” crimes are committed, involving willing persons, as
is the case in prostitution, illegal gambling and drug offences, ordinary
methods of detection will not generally do. The participants, be they deemed
victims or not, do not usually complain or seek police aid; that is what they
wish to avoid. The police, if they are to respond to the public disapprobation
of such offences as reflected in existing law, must take some initiatives. They
may, for example, use a spy, either a policeman or another person, to obtain
information about a consensual offence by infiltration; they may make
arrangements with informers who may be parties to offences on which they report
to the police to enable the other parties to be apprehended; or the police may
use decoys or themselves act under cover to provide others with the opportunity
to commit a consensual offence or to encourage its commission. Going one step
farther, the police may use members of their force or other persons to
instigate the commission of an offence, planning and designing it ab initio to
ensnare others.

The use of spies and informers is an inevitable
requirement for detection of consensual crimes and of discouraging their
commission; otherwise, it would be necessary to await a complaint by a “victim”
or to try to apprehend offenders in flagrante delicto, an exercise not
likely to be crowned with much success. Such practices do not involve such
dirty tricks as to be offensive to the integrity of the judicial process. Nor
can objection on this ground be taken to the use of decoys who provide the
opportunity to others intent upon the commission of a consensual offence. In
all such cases, the offender can claim no extenuation that would mitigate
either his culpability or the use of evidence to establish it or his punishment
upon conviction.

[Page 494]

The problem which has caused judicial concern is
the one which arises from the police‑instigated crime, where the police
have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have actively
organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to prosecute the
person so caught. In my opinion, it is only in this situation that it is proper
to speak of entrapment and to consider what effect this should have on the
prosecution of a person who has thus been drawn into the commission of an
offence.

There is no doubt that it may be difficult in
particular cases to draw the line between mere use of spies, decoys or
informers and the use of agents provocateurs who go beyond mere
solicitation or encouragement and initiate a criminal design for the purpose of
entrapping a person in order to prosecute him. The principle of the distinction
has, however, been recognized in a series of cases in the Supreme Court of the
United States which has established that entrapment, in the ensnarement sense
above-mentioned, is available as a defence. The line of cases begins with Sorrells
v. United States[9] and
extends through Sherman v. United States[10], United States v. Russell[11] and Hampton v. United States[12]. The issue in the United States, as
reflected in the foregoing judgments of its Supreme Court and in a host of
judgments of other federal Courts and of state Courts, is no longer whether
entrapment should be recognized as a defence or a bar to conviction but whether
the approach to it should be subjective, fastening on the predisposition of the
particular accused, or objective, fastening on the police conduct and on
whether that conduct would have caused a reasonable person to commit the
offence. On the subjective approach, an accused with a predisposition to the
crime would not have the benefit of the defence of entrapment, regardless of
the degree of police involvement.

In England, judicial revulsion against entrapment of an accused has been
manifested not through recognition of a defence on that ground

[Page 495]

but rather through a discretionary control of
the admissibility of evidence and through mitigation of sentence: see Mealey
and Sheridan v. The Queen[13]; R.
v. Birtles[14]; R.
v. Ameer and Lucas[15]. The
Courts of New Zealand have taken the same view: see R. v. Capner[16]; R. v. Pethig[17]. In Canada there is no appellate Court judgment in which entrapment has been
accepted as providing a defence or even as going to discretionary power to
exclude evidence. Although it was touched on by me as a member of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Ormerod[18],
I was of the opinion there that I did not think it wise in that case to come to
any conclusion on the acceptability of entrapment as a defence. That was
because the issue did not arise on the facts, which did not go beyond ordinary
solicitation of a suspected drug seller.

In R. v. Chernecki[19], the British Columbia Court of Appeal
likewise found that the facts did not show such “calculated inveigling or
persistent importuning” (words used by me in R. v. Ormerod as a
description of entrapment) as to make it necessary to consider whether
entrapment should be recognized as a defence. The Court added that it did not
think that any such defence existed at the time in Canada. However, in R. v. Bonnar[20],
the Nova Scotia Appeal Division stated that if entrapment (as opposed to merely
providing an opportunity for the commission of an offence) was established the
proper course was to stay proceedings or to discharge the accused where he did
not have a prior intention or predisposition to commit the offence charged.
Macdonald J.A. speaking for the Court considered that there was abuse of
process in such a situation and that the entrapment was contrary to public
policy. In the particular case, it was held on appeal that the facts did not

[Page 496]

show entrapment.

The present case, like Ormerod, Chernecki and
Bonnar does not squarely confront the Court with the need to decide what
legal effect should be given to a showing of entrapment as I have described it.
The facts, taking them, as we must, most favourably to the accused, are against
such a showing, and I shall come to them shortly. In these circumstances, I
would not, however, endorse the view of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the
present case or of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Chernecki rejecting
entrapment as a defence. There are good reasons for leaving the question open.
Indeed, if that position is based on a static view of s. 7(3)  of the Criminal
Code  I find it unacceptable. I do not think that s. 7(3)  should be regarded
as having frozen the power of the Courts to enlarge the content of the common
law by way of recognizing new defences, as they may think proper according to
circumstances that they consider may call for further control of prosecutorial
behaviour or of judicial proceedings.

Although Courts may agree that entrapment
outrages one’s sense of decency and shames the administration of justice, there
is a difference of opinion as to what the control mechanism should be. The
division of opinion in the United States between the subjective and objective
approaches to entrapment is one aspect of the problem although it appears that
there is growing disposition in lower Court decisions, especially in those of
state Courts, to opt for the objective approach as being one which avoids
problems that arise in fastening on the predisposition of particular accused.
Among the extensive literature on the subject reference may be made to
Donnelly, Judicial Control of Informants, Spies, Stool Pigeons and Agents
Provocateurs (1951) 60 Yale L.J. 1091; Park, The Entrapment Controversy (1975-76)
60 Minn. L. Rev. 163. The Model
Penal Code of the American Law Institute, promulgated in 1962, appears to have
incorporated an objective approach in its

[Page 497]

broadened definition of entrapment in s.
2.13(1), reading as follows:

(1) A public law enforcement official or a
person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if
for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he
induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting such
offense by either:

(a) making knowingly false
representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is not
prohibited; or

(b) employing methods of persuasion
or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be
committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.

The English Law Commission, which has given some
consideration to the problem and has examined the way in which the American Law
Institute’s Model Penal Code has dealt with the matter was undecided on whether
there should be a defence of entrapment but would circumscribe it as narrowly
as has the Model Penal Code: see English Law Commission, Working Paper No. 55
(1974). Professor Glanville Williams in his work The Criminal Law, The
General Part (2nd ed. 1961) at p. 785 says this:

Is there any technical means by which the
courts could give effect to a defence of official instigation or procurement,
if they were so minded? If one thinks merely in terms of established legal
concepts, as the English courts have hitherto done, it may seem difficult to
give an affirmative answer. The police have no general power to consent to or
authorise acts that would otherwise be breaches of the criminal law. The strict
doctrine of estoppel has not been applied in criminal law, except in respect of
estoppel by judgment; and in any event the situation is not precisely one of
estoppel. In civil law the doctrine of estoppel is not allowed to be used to
extend the limits of governmental power. There is no other ready-made doctrine
to cover the situation.

Another English writer, J.D. Heydon, The
Problems of Entrapment, [1973] Camb. L.J. 268 would reject entrapment as a
defence but would give it legal effect through a discretionary bar on the
admission of evidence and as a mitigating factor in sentencing.

[Page 498]

Another issue concerns the range or class of
offences on which entrapment should have a bearing, either as a matter of
defence or of discretionary control of admissibility of evidence or of the
course of proceedings: see Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections,
Towards Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections, 1969 (The Ouimet Report), at
pp. 79-80. The American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code has taken the position
that with respect to some offences, as for example offences of violence, the
social interest in controlling the behaviour of an accused outweighs that
involved in disapprobation of undesirable police behaviour: see s. 2.13(3).

There is the further problem arising in jury
trials whether entrapment should be dealt with by judges alone, or should
involve the jury as a trier of fact. The Model Penal Code takes the position
that the issue of entrapment should be tried by the Court in the absence of the
jury: s. 2.13(2). The jury would not be excluded on the subjective test
since, if there was evidence of entrapment, it would be for the jury to
determine if there was entrapment in fact and if there was predisposition in
the accused. This is consistent with Canadian practice in respect of factual
issues in a trial with a jury, which is to limit the judge to a determination
of whether there is evidence to go to the jury and to leave it to the jury to
act on its view of the evidence once the issue is left to them.

In short, there are difficult questions that
arise in respect of entrapment which prudence dictates we should leave for
consideration when a decision thereon is demanded by the record. Canadian
writings on the subject have been alive to this policy of avoidance in their
examination of a number of cases, two of them in this Court, which raised
entrapment issues but the writings, useful survey articles, have also been
alive to the dilemmas that entrapment raises: see Shafer and Sheridan, The
Defence of Entrapment (1970), 8 Osg.H.L.J. 277; Watt, The Defence of
Entrapment (1971), 13 Cr.L.Q. 313; Sneideman, A Judicial Test for
Entrapment: The Glimmerings of a Canadian

[Page 499]

Policy on Police-Instigated Crime (1973), 16 Cr.L.Q. 81.

I wish to refer to the two cases in this Court
in which an issue of entrapment was allegedly raised by the facts. They are Lemieux
v. The Queen, supra, and Patterson v. The Queen[21]. In Lemieux v. The Queen, supra, an
informer, acting under police instruction, induced the accused to participate
in a break-in as driver of the car in which the informer and a third person
were taken to the particular house. The owner co-operated by giving the police
a key to the premises. It was found that the accused had no thought of being party
to any such offence until induced by the informer to participate. This Court,
speaking through Judson J., held that it was open to the jury to find that
there was no actus reus in view of the owner’s consent to the
breaking and entering. The facts, leaving aside the participation of the owner
of the premises selected for the break-in, fit exactly the defence of
entrapment as accepted in the American cases. In concluding his reasons, Judson
J. said this, at p. 496:

Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence
with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act
at the solicitation of an agent provocateur would have been irrelevant
to the question of his guilt or innocence.

This observation was not, of course, necessary
to the decision, and in so far as it envisages the same set of facts but
without the house owner’s involvement, it would involve entrapment as I have
viewed it in these reasons. On the other hand, if there was solicitation by an
informer without the complicity of the police, there would be no question of
entrapment.

Patterson v. The Queen involved a charge of keeping a bawdy house, a charge which arose out
of a telephoned sexual proposition by a police agent, resulting in an
assignation at certain residential premises where the police disclosed their
identity and made an arrest. This Court allowed an appeal from conviction on
the ground that there

[Page 500]

was no evidence of frequent or habitual use of
the house for the purpose of prostitution and it does not appear that any
question of entrapment was argued; certainly it was not dealt with. In any
event, the mere telephone solicitation would not qualify, in respect of a
willing accused, as an entrapment within the rationale of the cases that have
recognized such a defence.

A different set of facts concerning police
instigation of an offence is found in R. v. Woods[22], a judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal. That Court set aside a conviction of breaking and entering and theft
(and in the result, directed an acquittal) where it appeared that off duty
police officers in plain clothes, passing themselves off as toughs from
Toronto, threatened violence to the accused, whom they had not previously met,
if he did not produce a stolen outboard motor which they wished to purchase at
a discount. The accused yielded to the threats, broke into a marina and stole
an outboard and was then charged. The fact of the threat of violence came out
in the evidence of the police officers but the magistrate who tried the accused
convicted on the basis of giving credit to the evidence of one of the officers
because the magistrate knew him personally. The Court of Appeal found this to
be an extraneous circumstance and concluded the conviction must be quashed and
then (the Crown agreeing) ordered an acquittal. No consideration was given to
entrapment as a possible defence.

There are two lower Court decisions, R. v.
Shipley[23], an
Ontario County Court judgment R. v. MacDonald[24], a judgment of a British
 Columbia Provincial Court, in which, on a finding of
entrapment, a stay of proceedings was directed in the first case and an
acquittal in the second. In another more recent British Columbia Provincial

[Page 501]

Court judgment, R. v. Haukness[25], in which the aforementioned two cases
were considered as well as Ormerod and Chernecki, an acquittal
was also entered on a direct recognition of entrapment as a defence, the Court
saying that “notwithstanding [the accused’s] commission [of the drug] offence,
it would be contrary to the principles of the administration of justice in this
country to convict him”. Having indicated that I prefer to leave open the
question whether entrapment, if established, should operate as a defence I
express no view on the approach taken in the Haukness case. Similarly, I
leave open the question whether the appropriate way to deal with entrapment is
by a stay of proceedings, a matter considered by this Court in another context
in R. v. Rourke[26]. In
the present case, although the factum of the accused mentions stay of
proceedings, his counsel did not press the point, nor did he found any of his
submissions on any issue of admissibility of evidence. His main, indeed, sole
point was that entrapment should have been left to the jury because the
evidence showed a police‑concocted plan to ensnare him going beyond mere
solicitation.

I do not think that the evidence is open to such
a view. Although the trial judge’s charge is confusing on what is meant by
entrapment, the accused cannot complain of the withdrawal of entrapment as a
defence (assuming it to be a defence, if established by a preponderance of
evidence) if there was no evidence upon which it could be based.

The accused was found by the Metropolitan
Toronto police to be in possession of heroin and was arrested by them. He made
certain statements to the police, including assertions that he worked as an
undercover agent, as an informer in fact, for the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. The state-

[Page 502]

ments were admitted in evidence after a voir
dire as to their admissibility. He told the Toronto police that the R.C.M.P. were unaware that he had bought the heroin
and unaware that he was going to sell it. When taken to the police station he
was found in possession of cocaine as well as heroin. Upon his release from
custody and while awaiting trial, the accused had several conversations with
members of the Toronto police force about acting as a paid informer but nothing
came of it.

The accused was a drug addict, and this was
known to the R.C.M.P. and to a particular officer of that force, one Gascon. He
had been used by the force on various occasions as a decoy and informer to
ferret out information on drug pushing in the Montreal area, and this involved him, according to his evidence, in
purchasing drugs with money supplied by the R.C.M.P. and in selling drugs as
well. He reported these activities to his R.C.M.P. contact. It was also
Kirzner’s evidence that he told Gascon of a chance encounter with a person in
the illegal drug trade through whom he could set up a big “buy” and that Gascon
agreed to the plan. Gascon was on vacation when the chance for the “buy”
arrived, but the accused went ahead on his own and consummated the deal,
although it was by no means clear that he was under instruction by Gascon to go
ahead in the latter’s absence. It was in respect of this “buy” of heroin that
the accused was arrested. Gascon’s evidence was that the accused had not told
him that he was selling drugs as well as buying them. He was used by the
R.C.M.P. as a paid informer even after his arrest, but this was not an unusual
practice of the R.C.M.P. in their use of informers.

I fail to see how this evidence, taking it most
favourably to the accused, shows entrapment in respect of the offences
committed by the accused. To me it is obvious that he saw his police contacts
as a shield for activities which he carried out on his own, activities
amounting to trafficking in drugs. He had initiated a transaction which he
carried out for his own benefit.

[Page 503]

In the result, while not agreeing with the
reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal, I come to the same conclusion and would
dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—As the Chief Justice says in reasons
which I have had the advantage of reading, the sole point raised by counsel for
the accused at the hearing was that entrapment should have been left to the
jury because the evidence showed a police-concocted plan to ensnare him going
beyond mere solicitation. I agree that the evidence is not open to such a view
and that accordingly the accused cannot complain on that account although the
trial judge’s charge was confusing. Without expressing an opinion on any other
question, I concur in the disposition of the case proposed by the Chief
Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Testimony of
accomplices—Other witnesses not accomplices—Judge’s duty to warn jury.

Respondent, who is president of the Quebec
Federation of Labour, was charged with mischief for remarks he made during a
union meeting. The Crown claims that respondent suggested acts of sabotage and
vandalism for the purpose of making a slowdown effective. The day after the
meeting such acts were in fact committed.

The prosecution’s evidence was given entirely
by members of the local union, most of whom had been apprehended for the
activities that took place the day after the meeting. The trial judge did not
warn against the danger of convicting respondent on the uncorroborated evidence
of accomplices. Respondent was convicted by the jury and appealed his
conviction. Two of the three judges who heard the appeal held that the trial
judge had erred in failing to give the warning to the jury and ordered a new
trial. The third member of the Court did not deal with this issue, but would
have allowed the appeal on another ground, which was not raised in this Court.
This Court has only to resolve the issue of law upon which leave to appeal was
granted, namely, whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding that where the
majority but not all of the witnesses of a fact are accomplices, the trial
judge is required to warn the jury against the danger of accepting their
testimony.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

This Court recognized in Horsburgh, [1967]
S.C.R. 747, and it is now settled law that in a criminal trial, where a person
who is an accomplice gives evidence on behalf of the Crown, it is the duty of
the judge to warn the jury that, although they may convict upon his evidence,
it is dangerous to do so unless it is corroborated.

[Page 1008]

Without disputing the validity of this rule,
appellant contends that it applies only if the Crown’s case depends solely upon
the evidence of one or more accomplices, and that if there are other witnesses,
not accomplices, who give like evidence, the evidence of the accomplice or
accomplices is corroborated and the warning becomes unnecessary. The
authorities cited by appellant do not support this contention. Whenever the
Crown tenders as a part of its case against the accused the evidence of a
person who is an accomplice, it becomes the duty of the trial judge to warn the
jury that it is dangerous to convict upon uncorroborated evidence. This the
trial judge failed to do in the case at bar.

Horsburgh v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 747, followed; Brunet v. The King, [1928]
S.C.R. 375; Vigeant v. The King, [1930] S.C.R. 396; Lopatinsky
v. The King, [1948] S.C.R. 220, distinguished; Boulianne v.
The King, [1931] S.C.R. 621, referred to.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1]
setting aside the conviction of the accused and ordering a new trial.
Appeal dismissed.

Gérard Girouard, for the appellant.

Philip Cutler, Q.C, and Jacques Fortin,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This appeal is brought, with leave
of this Court, upon the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that
where the majority but not all of the witnesses of a fact are accomplices, the
trial judge is required to warn the jury against the danger of accepting their
testimony?

The respondent was at all material times
president of the Quebec Federation of Labour (Fédération des travailleurs du
Québec). On the evening of 29th May, 1974, he was in l’Assomption to attend a
meeting of a local of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, a union affiliated with his federation. This meeting had been called
to give him an opportunity to explain the advantages of affiliation with the
federation and the use to which the dues paid to it

[Page 1009]

were put. The meeting became, however, confused
with one called to consider a dispute between Hupp Canada Ltd. and its
employees, members of the local union, arising from the refusal of the company
to raise wages to compensate for the increase in the cost of living.

The respondent was of the opinion that, in view
of the terms of the collective agreement between the company and its employees,
the refusal to increase wages was not a ground for a legal strike and so warned
those at the meeting. It was suggested that, instead of a strike, there might
be a slowdown. Questions were asked as to how a slowdown might be made
effective, and it was in reply to these questions that the respondent was
alleged to have suggested acts of sabotage and vandalism. The very next day,
such acts were in fact committed. It is not suggested that the respondent
personally took any part in these acts.

The evidence adduced by the Crown as to what was
said by the respondent at the meeting was given entirely by members of the
local union. Most, though not all of these, had been apprehended by the police
as the result of the activities in the Hupp Canada plant the day following the
meeting and had implicated the respondent as the result of questions put to them
by the police.

The respondent, who alone testified for the
defence, gave his own version of what happened at the meeting. He stated that
he had advised the union members to attempt to negotiate with their employer on
a reasonable basis and had suggested that it was only if negotiations should
fail that they should try other means, such as a slowdown. He acknowledged
that, in reply to questions put to him from the floor, he had made some
suggestions as to how slowdowns were made effective but denied that he had at
any time advocated damage to property.

In his charge to the jury the trial judge did
not warn against the danger of convicting the respondent on the uncorroborated
evidence of accomplices. The respondent was convicted.

[Page 1010]

The respondent appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeal. Two of the three judges who heard the appeal held that the
trial judge had erred in failing to give the warning to the jury and ordered a
new trial. The third member of the Court did not deal with this issue. He would
have allowed the appeal on another ground, but his view was not shared by the
majority of the Court. We are concerned on this appeal only with the one issue
of law upon which leave was granted.

Dealing with that issue, Montgomery J.A., who
delivered the reasons of the majority, had this to say:

There remains the question as to whether
the warning was required, in view of the fact that this testimony was not the
only evidence against Appellant. I find nothing in the authorities to suggest
that the application of the rule should be thus restricted. I can understand
that, where the remaining evidence is sufficiently strong, it may be a matter
of no particular consequence that the warning has not been given, but here the
majority of those who testified as to what was said at the meeting were
accomplices. The rule is stated by Martland J., in the Horsburgh case,
in the following terms (at p. 754):

“It is now settled law that in a criminal
trial, where a person who is an accomplice, gives evidence on behalf of the
prosecution, it is the duty of the judge to warn the jury that, although they
may convict upon his evidence, it is dangerous to do so unless it is
corroborated.”

Ritchie, J., for the minority, cited (at
p. 767) the rule as given by Lord Abinger in R. v. Farler (1837), 8
Car. and P. 106, at p. 107:

“It is a practice which deserves all the
reverence of law, that judges have uniformly told juries that they ought not to
pay any respect to the testimony of an accomplice, unless the accomplice is
corroborated in some material circumstance.”

Further on (at p. 773), he put the
rule as follows:

“The well-known rule concerning the
evidence of accomplices was stated in this Court by Anglin C.J.C. in Vigeant
v. The King, [1930] S.C.R. 396, where it was recognized as a rule of law
that where an accomplice has given evidence the Judge must first instruct the
jury as to what in law constitutes an accomplice and then proceed to tell them
that although they are at liberty to do so, it is dangerous to convict on the
uncorroborated evidence of such witnesses.”

[Page 1011]

In my opinion, a substantial number of
those witnesses who testified as to what was said at the meeting were
accomplices and the trial Judge was required to warn the jury against the
dangers of accepting their testimony. This he failed to do, and for this reason
the conviction cannot stand. I express no opinion as to whether there was in
fact corroboration; this will be a matter for a jury to decide.

I am in agreement with the conclusions of
Montgomery J.A. In my opinion the issue before us is settled by the views
stated in the Horsburgh[2] case,
which, on this question, were unanimous.

The contention of the appellant is that, while
recognizing the existence of the rule, it was not incumbent on the trial judge
to give the warning to the jury because the Crown’s case did not depend only
upon the evidence of the accomplices, since there were other witnesses, who
were not accomplices, who also testified as to the statements of the respondent
at the meeting. In other words, it is submitted that the rule only applies if
the Crown’s case rests solely upon the evidence of one or more accomplices. If,
it is said there are other witnesses, not accomplices, who give like evidence,
the evidence of the accomplice is corroborated and the warning becomes
unnecessary.

In support of this proposition the appellant
relies upon quotations from reasons delivered in three cases in this Court. The
first of these is Brunet v. The King[3],
where Smith J., said at p. 381:

As stated, there seems to be no case in
which it is explicitly laid down that the warning must be given where there is
some corroborative evidence to go to the jury, but I think it necessarily
follows from the principle laid down in the cases referred to, where the evidence
of the accomplice is necessary to sustain the conviction and the corroborative
evidence may or may not be accepted as sufficient by the jury.

This passage, cited in the appellant’s factum,
is an excerpt from a paragraph in which this quotation is preceded by these
words:

It seems clear, therefore, that there was
in fact no admissible corroborative evidence to be submitted to the

[Page 1012]

jury, and that it was the undoubted duty of
the learned judge to have given the warning. It is not, however, to be taken
that the warning would have been unnecessary had there been some corroborative
evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. It is for the jury to say whether
or not the corroborative evidence is to be believed, and if it is not believed
by the jury, and yet they convict, no warning having been given, they are
convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice without having been
warned of the danger of doing so.

Read as a whole, the passage does not support
the appellant’s contention.

Reference was made to a statement of Anglin
C.J.C., who delivered the judgment of the Court in Vigeant v. The King[4], at p. 400:

He should then proceed to instruct the jury
that, if they concluded that the witness was, at any stage of the proceedings,
an accomplice in the crime charged against the defendants, there would be
danger in convicting them of that crime upon his evidence standing alone and
uncorroborated; that the law does not preclude their doing so—indeed, they are
at liberty to do so—but that there is danger in basing a conviction on such
uncorroborated evidence. If, after this warning, the jury had faith enough in
the evidence given by the accomplice to convict, their verdict will not be set
aside. The jury should not be told to acquit the prisoner; but they should be
warned of the danger of convicting. Rex v. Boycal (1920), 31 Que. K.B.
391. Where there has been failure so to charge a jury with regard to the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice the conviction must be quashed. Gouin
v. The King, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 539; Brunet v. The King, [1928] Can. S.C.R. 375.

The appellant stresses the use of the words
“standing alone”, but Chief Justice Anglin was not discussing the circumstances
in which the warning must be given. He was stating what the trial judge should
tell the jury if a witness is an accomplice. The word “alone” is used in
conjunction with the words “and uncorroborated”. He is referring to the
evidence of an accomplice tendered without corroboration. He is not confining
the application of the rule to a case in which the accomplice is the only
witness.

[Page 1013]

In this connection it may be noted that in the
following year in Boulianne v. The King[5],
a case involving the evidence of an accomplice, Chief Justice Anglin, at
p. 623, said:

We should add that we entirely disagree
with the view of Mr. Justice Hall that the rule requiring warning does not
apply where there is, in fact, corroboration. The rule applies equally whether
there be or be not corroborative evidence of the testimony of an accomplice.

The third case cited in support of the
appellant’s argument is Lopatinsky v. The King[6]. It was pointed out that in that
case this Court sustained the conviction of the accused and that it was a case
in which two other witnesses besides the accomplice had given evidence
implicating the accused. The case is not of assistance to the appellant’s
submission. The trial had been by a judge alone, without a jury. The trial
judge did not record his reasons for convicting the accused. Estey J., who delivered
the reasons of the Court for refusing the appeal by the accused, based his
decision on the following grounds:

The learned trial Judge did not record his
reasons upon which he founded his verdict of guilty and it may be that he did
not direct himself upon the foregoing points with that precision which the law
contemplates. However, the facts and circumstances of this case are such that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred within the
meaning of section 1014  of the Criminal Code .

I do not regard the authorities cited on behalf
of the appellant as supporting the proposition that the warning in respect of
the evidence of an accomplice need not be given if there is other evidence
apart from that of the accomplice which could support a conviction. In my
opinion if the Crown in a criminal trial tenders as a part of its case against
the accused the evidence of a person who is an accomplice, it becomes the duty
of the trial judge to warn the jury that, although they may convict upon his
evidence, it is dangerous to do so unless it is corroborated.

I would dimiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Accused charged with conspiring
to traffic in MDA, trafficking in MDA and having MDA in possession for purpose
of trafficking—Appeal by Crown against acquittals on first and third counts and
appeal by accused against conviction on second count—Conspiracy appeal
dismissed—Conviction of accused set aside and acquittal entered because
evidence disclosed accused trafficked in salt of MDA but not in MDA itself—Application
to amend third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA for purpose of
trafficking—Amendment allowed and new trial ordered on third count as
amended—Whether Court of Appeal erred in amending third count—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 529, 610, 613(8).

The appellant and another were tried on an
indictment containing three counts, namely, (1) conspiring to traffic in a
restricted drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA); (2) trafficking in MDA, and
(3) having MDA in possession for the purpose of trafficking. They were both
acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the appellant alone was convicted on the
second charge of trafficking but he was subsequently acquitted on the third
charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the acquittal being based
on the application by the trial judge of res judicata and of the
principle in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.
Proceedings against his co-accused on the third count were stayed.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts 1
and 3, and the accused appealed his conviction on count 2. The conspiracy
appeal was dismissed. On the appellant’s appeal from his conviction of
trafficking in MDA, the conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered
because the evidence disclosed that the accused trafficked in a salt of MDA but
not in MDA itself. The Court concluded that since the Crown had charged the

[Page 394]

appellant with trafficking in a specific
drug, MDA, proof of MDA was an essential element of the offence. The Court
rejected the contention that the relevant provisions of the statute, the Food
and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, listing among the restricted
drugs “MDA or any salt thereof” embraced any salt of MDA in a charge that
specified MDA only. McIntyre J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court,
considered that an amendment to the indictment, even after the hearing of the
appeal, would have been appropriate. However, an amendment was not sought and
the Court decided that an acquittal had to be entered.

When the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of
the appellant on the third count of possession for the purpose of trafficking
came on for hearing the Court was differently constituted. The Crown, on the
appeal, applied to amend the third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA
for the purpose of trafficking. The Court allowed the amendment, allowed the
Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal and directed a new trial on the third
count as amended. From that judgment the appellant appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The only issue before this
Court on the present appeal was whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its powers
when it amended the third count of the indictment in such fashion as to conform
to the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in that
count as originally drawn, upon which the appellant had been acquitted. Having
regard to the extensive activities which the appellant was found to have been
conducting in the manufacture of MDA hydrochloride, it could not be suggested
that the appellant was in any way misled by the fact that that salt was not
mentioned in the particulars. He knew in any event that he was being charged
with possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

In directing a new trial, MacLean J.A.
incorporated the amendment to the information in his order as he felt that the
ends of justice required him to do. In granting this order the Court of Appeal
was acting pursuant to the provisions of s. 613(4) (b) and (8)  of
the Criminal Code . The appellant’s contention that the order for a new
trial could not have been made unless the amendment had been granted and that
the amendment was therefore not an order “in addition” to the exercise of

[Page 395]

the court’s power under subs. (4)(b)(i),
but rather that it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial, was not
accepted. When Parliament authorized the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of
its power, to order a new trial, to “make any order, in addition, which justice
requires” it must be taken as having authorized that Court under those
circumstances to make any additional order which the ends of justice
require whether the order for a new trial is dependent upon the additional
order or not.

Since, in view of the evidence, the ends of
justice required the amendment which was here granted, it followed that it was
unnecessary to express any view as to the submission that the authority of the Court
of Appeal to grant an amendment stems from the provisions of s. 610(3) of
the Code which authorize the court to exercise powers “that may be
exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters…”.

As to s. 529 of the Code, which
bears the heading “Amending defective indictment or count”, the only mandatory
language in that section is contained in subs. (1) which provides for “an
objection to an indictment or to a count in an indictment for a defect apparent
on the face thereof” and requires such objection to be taken before plea or
thereafter by leave of the court or a judge. In the present case there was no
defect apparent on the face of the indictment and this
subsection accordingly had no application to the present circumstances.
There was no other language in the section which could be read as
curtailing the power of the Court of Appeal to make an order under
s. 613(8)  which has the effect of amending the indictment so as to conform
to the evidence where the ends of justice require it.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: Three issues were
raised by the order of the Court of Appeal in this case: (i) whether a Court of
Appeal has power to amend an indictment; (ii) if so, whether that power can be
exercised so as to provide a basis for ordering a new trial; and (iii) whether
a Court of Appeal has power to substitute a charge different from the one laid
and upon which the appeal has proceeded. There was nothing in the case law, and
certainly nothing in the applicable legislation to authorize a court of appeal
to do what the British Columbia Court of Appeal did in this case, namely,
substitute a charge of a different offence, something which the trial judge
himself could not do under the wide amending powers given to him under
s. 529  of the Criminal Code .

The view that s. 610(3) of the Code confers
power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment could not be accepted. That
section takes its context from the preceding provisions of s. 610
which concern evidentiary

[Page 396]

questions. The opening words of
s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that “a court of appeal may
exercise… any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be
exercised… on appeals in civil matters”. The subsection cannot, therefore,
be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Still less can
s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

As to s. 613(8) , the provision for “any
order, in addition, that justice requires” is sequential to the exercise of the
power to order a new trial under s. 613(4) . It does not enable a court of
appeal to make an order upon which to found a direction for a new trial; and
certainly not when that order does not relate to the charge on which the
accused has been acquitted and to an error of law in respect of that charge.
This is obvious when reference is had, as it must be, to s. 605(1)(a)
upon which the Crown must base its right to appeal an acquittal. Assuming,
however, that s. 613(8)  gives a court of appeal a wider power than that
which its terms appear to confer when considered alongside s. 613(4)  and
s. 605(1) (a), the relevant question here was whether the
words “make any order, in addition, that justice requires” empower the Court of
Appeal to direct a new trial on a different offence from that on which the
appeal was taken.

There was here a usurpation of the function
of the Attorney-General and of the Crown. It is for them to decide, the
existing charge not being proved, whether to lay the different charge which the
Court felt should have been brought against the accused. It is not for a Court
to take an ad hominem view in a case like the present one and to do
violence to the separate functions of Court and Crown lest a person guilty of
an offence, but not the one charged, escape punishment.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia granting leave to amend the indictment and allowing the
Crown’s appeal against the appellant’s acquittal, and ordering a new trial on
the indictment as amended, on a charge of unlawfully having in his possession a
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking. Appeal dismissed, the Chief
Justice, Spence, and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This case
raises an important issue in the administration of the criminal law. The issue,
briefly stated, is whether a court, in particular an appellate court, has the
power to raise a charge against an accused and to direct that he be tried on
that charge, not being the one laid or sought to be laid by the Crown and not
being an included offence in that respect. I should have thought that the
answer must be emphatically “no”, but the British
 Columbia Court of Appeal resolved the issue in the
affirmative under what, in my view, was a misconception of the problem that it
faced. A recital of the facts makes this clear.

The appellant and another were tried on an
indictment containing three counts, namely, (1) conspiring to traffic in a
restricted drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine, more conveniently called MDA; (2)
trafficking in MDA, and (3) having MDA in possession for the purpose of
trafficking. They were both acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the appellant
alone was convicted on the second charge of trafficking but he was subsequently
acquitted on the third charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the
acquittal being based on an application by the trial judge of res judicata and
of the principle in Kienapple v. The Queen[1]. Proceedings against his co-accused
on the third count were stayed.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts 1
and 3, and the accused appealed his conviction on count 2. The conspiracy
appeal was dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on November 26,
1975, and is of no concern here. The appellant’s appeal from his conviction of
trafficking in MDA was heard on February 4 to 6, 1976, by a Bench composed of Maclean, Seaton and

[Page 398]

McIntyre JJ.A. The latter delivered the
principal judgment of the Court[2] on
March 26, 1976, whereby the conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered
because the evidence disclosed that the accused trafficked in a salt of MDA but
not in MDA itself. The Court concluded that since the Crown had charged the
appellant with trafficking in a specific drug, MDA, proof of MDA was an
essential element of the offence. The Court rejected the contention that the
relevant provisions of the statute, the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. F-27, listing among the restricted drugs “MDA or any salt thereof”,
embraced any salt of MDA in a charge that specified MDA only. In its opinion,
the trial judge had erred in making interchangeable references to MDA and salt
of MDA.

McIntyre J.A. concluded his reasons for judgment
as follows:

This is a case where in my view an
amendment to the indictment, even after the hearing of the appeal, would have
been appropriate. Had the Crown sought an amendment I would have been disposed
to allow it. However, no application having been made I feel obliged for the
reasons given above to consider that this appeal should be allowed and an
acquittal entered.

Seaton J.A., who wrote brief concurring reasons,
noted that although the expert evidence was to the effect that MDA and salt of
MDA were the same drug, a view accepted by the trial judge, the question was
one of law turning on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Food
and Drugs Act , and particularly Schedule H. Under the Act they were not the
same drug, and since the Crown did not seek an amendment, an acquittal had to
be entered.

The issue now before this Court arises from the
disposition by the British Columbia Court of Appeal of the Crown’s appeal
against the acquittal of the appellant on the third count, namely, possession
for the purpose of trafficking. In approaching

[Page 399]

the issue, I take no position on the correctness
of the decision of the Court of Appeal that the Narcotic Control Act created
two distinct offences, one relating to MDA and the other to a salt of MDA. That
differentiation must stand for present purposes. The appeal by the Crown from
the acquittal of the appellant on the third count of possession for the purpose
of trafficking came on for hearing on May 12, 1976, some six weeks after the
provincial Court of Appeal had disposed of the appellant’s appeal on the second
count favourably to him. The Court was differently constituted, consisting of
Maclean, McFarlane and Branca JJ.A. The Crown, on the appeal, applied to
“amend” the third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA for the purpose
of trafficking. In short reasons with which the other members of the Court agreed,
Maclean J.A. allowed the “amendment”, allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the
acquittal and directed a new trial on the third count as amended. He said only
this:

In my view the ends of justice require that
the amendment in this case be granted and in my view no substantial wrong would
be suffered thereby by the accused person.

It is thus clear that judges of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal who made up the different Benches that heard the
appeals on the second and third counts were in no doubt of the Court’s power to
“amend” an indictment so as to charge a different offence from the one on which
the accused was tried. This is not the view of my brother Ritchie, whose
reasons in this appeal I have had the advantage of reading, because he speaks
not of an “amendment” to charge a different offence but of an amendment “to
conform to the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in
[the third] count as originally drawn”. Since for the purposes of this case, as
I have already noted, it must be taken that the specification of a particular
drug in the charge made proof thereof an essential element of the offence, the
substitution in the wording of the charge of another drug amounts to a charge
of a different offence, even though the other essential elements, namely,
possession for the purpose of

[Page 400]

trafficking, are the same in either situation.
Indeed, counsel for the Crown conceded that in this case he must accept as a
fact that different offences were involved in the indictment as laid and as
altered by the Court of Appeal.

Does then a court of appeal have the power to
order an accused to be retried on a different charge from that originally laid
and different from that on which he was originally tried? It is one thing to
amend, so as to rectify an imperfect charge or indictment of an offence where
the charge or indictment is not itself a nullity; it is another thing to
substitute a charge of a different offence. Supplying an omitted essential
averment of a charge which is clearly indicated is one thing; changing a charge
to allege a different offence is something else.

II

Three issues are raised by the order of the
court of appeal in the present case. They are, first, whether a court of appeal
has power to amend an indictment; second, if so, whether that power can be
exercised so as to provide a basis for ordering a new trial; and third, whether
a court of appeal has power to substitute a charge different from the one laid
and upon which the appeal has proceeded. I think it relevant to these issues to
begin with a consideration of the powers of a trial judge to amend an
indictment.

Those powers are now set out in s. 529  of
the Criminal Code . It is unnecessary in this case to trace its history,
other than to note that it goes back not only to the original Criminal Code  of
1892 (see s. 723 ) but beyond that Code to the Criminal Procedure
Act, 1869 (Can.), c. 29, s. 70. Although there was originally
some doubt whether the power to amend extended beyond the amendment of formal
defects, statutory clarification and ensuing judicial decisions settled that
question in favour of an extended power, including a power to supply an
essential averment of the offence charged as well as power to make changes in
the assertions of the charge to conform with the evi-

[Page 401]

dence as to any such details: see R. v.
Lacelle[3]; R.
v. Kerr[4];
Yanovitch v. The Queen[5]. Wide
as was the power to amend reposed in the trial judge, it did not extend to
authorize him to substitute an offence different from the one charged. This was
asserted more than fifty years ago in the Kerr case, supra, at
p. 231, where Meredith C.J.O. said, referring to the provision for
amendment of an indictment that “[it] does not, of course, authorize an
amendment which substitutes a different offence for that intended to be charged
or the addition of other offences”. The same view was taken more recently by
the Quebec Court of Appeal in Dupont v. The Queen[6], at p. 390, and re-affirmed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Elliott[7], at p. 237. An earlier
authority to the same effect is R. v. Cohen[8].

I am not unmindful of s. 496  of the Criminal
Code  which relates to the preferring of an indictment by the Crown and to
the inclusion of counts of offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry, even if the accused was not committed for trial thereon.
Although this provision does not touch the powers of the trial judge, it
indicates that it is left to the prosecution to determine, in the defined
circumstances, whether to add or substitute a charge other than that set out in
the information. The farthest that the courts have gone in respect of the
substitution of offences is to permit the Crown to ask for an amendment to that
effect of an information upon which an accused has elected trial before a
magistrate but in such case the accused must be allowed to re-elect: see R.
v. Hollman[9]. I
do not pass on the correctness of this view of a court’s power. The substance
of the matter appears to be a withdrawal of one information by the Crown and
the laying of another, and

[Page 402]

this is open to the Crown in respect of
indictments.

Coming then to the powers of a court of appeal
in respect of amendments or substitutions, I find no provision of the Criminal
Code  which gives a court of appeal greater powers in these respects than
are given to a trial judge; and, indeed, there is no provision which expressly
gives any power relating to indictments to a court of appeal. Neither Bench of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal discussed or even referred to any
provision of the Criminal Code  which supported the power it asserted,
but during the argument before this Court ss. 610 and 613(8) as well as
s. 529  were brought to the fore.

I shall deal first with s. 610 which reads
as follows:

610. (1) For
the purposes of an appeal under this Part the court of appeal may, where it
considers it in the interests of justice,

(a) order the production of
any writing, exhibit, or other thing connected with the proceedings;

(b) order any witness who
would have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was
called at the trial,

(i) to attend and be examined before the
court of appeal, or

(ii) to be examined in the manner provided
by rules of court before a judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer
of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the
court of appeal for the purpose;

(c) admit, as evidence, an
examination that is taken Under subparagraph (b)(ii);

(d) receive the evidence, if
tendered, of any witness, including the appellant, who is a competent but not
compellable witness;

(e) order that any question
arising on the appeal that

(i) involves prolonged examination of
writings or accounts, or scientific or local investigation, and

(ii) cannot in the opinion of the court of
appeal conveniently be inquired into before the court of appeal,

be referred for inquiry and report, in the
manner provided by rules of court, to a special commissioner appointed by the
court of appeal; and

[Page 403]

f) act upon
the report of a commissioner who is appointed under paragraph (e) in so
far as/the court of appeal thinks fit to do so.

(2) In proceedings under this
section the parties or their counsel are entitled to examine or
cross-examine witnesses and, in an inquiry under paragraph (1)(e), are
entitled to be present during the inquiry and to adduce evidence and to be
heard.

(3) A court of appeal may exercise in
relation to proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in
subsection (1) that may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil
matters, and may issue any process that is necessary to enforce the orders or
sentences of the court but no costs shall be allowed to the appellant or
respondent on the hearing and determination of an appeal or on any proceedings
preliminary or incidental thereto.

(4) Any process that is issued by the court
of appeal under this section may be executed anywhere in Canada.

Although I have reproduced the entire
section for context, the only terms thereof relevant here are the opening
words of subs. (3), namely “A court of appeal may exercise in relation to
proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that
may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters…”. Section 610 first
appeared as s. 1021(1)  of the Criminal Code , enacted by 1923
(Can.), c. 41, s. 9, and was taken from s. 9 of the English
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 (U.K.), c. 23. The concern of the English
Courts with this provision does not appear to have gone beyond reliance on it
to permit fresh evidence to be admitted on appeal: see R. v. Robinson[10]. A similar provision was at issue
in the New South Wales case of R. v. Burns[11] to support the power of an appellate court
to amend an indictment. In that case an indictment charged the accused with
obtaining a travel document by a false pretence to one N with intent to
defraud, but the evidence did not show a false pretence to N but rather to
another, and it was held that the provision was not ample enough to empower an
appellate court to make the amendment. Although dissenting on the ground that
there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the conviction of
the accused, Chief

[Page 404]

Justice Cullen was nonetheless of the same
opinion as his colleagues in declaring that the provision comparable to our now
s. 610(3) did not enable an appellate court to make an amendment to an
indictment which had been finally dealt with by the trial judge; and he added
(at p. 356): “so drastic a power, if it had been the intention of the
Legislature to confer it, one would expect to have seen expressed in plain
words”.

Section 610(3) was considered in a series of
British Columbia cases, which I wish to examine. R. v. Danyleyko[12] may be put to one side because
there the British Columbia Court of Appeal sitting as the Yukon Territory Court
of Appeal relied on s. 610(3) and on the provincial Court of Appeal Act
to support its right to send a stated case back to a magistrate for
amendment; it does not, therefore, touch the issue in question here. In R. v.
McNutt[13], an
issue arose as to proof of the territorial jurisdiction of a magistrate under
an indictment charging an assault in place H whereas it occurred in place W,
both being within the territorial jurisdiction. No amendment was made or sought
before the magistrate. A new trial was ordered by the majority in view of the
course of the proceedings below (the dissenting judge concluded that
territorial jurisdiction had not been proved) but Davey J.A. in obiter also
adverted to what is now s. 610(3) as being broad enough to empower the
Court of Appeal to make an amendment to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This
statement was induced, however, by doubt whether the British Columbia Court of
Appeal was right in an earlier case, R. v. More and Melville[14] (Davey J.A. being a member of the
Court), which held that an allegation of the commission of an offence at a
defined place was an essential averment, and where the evidence showed its
commission at a different place and no amendment was made at trial, the Court
of Appeal could not itself amend but must quash the conviction. However, it was
held that it was open to the Court to order a new

[Page 405]

trial in the interests of justice, and it would
be for the trial judge to decide whether an amendment was necessary and, if so,
whether it should be made. In the McNutt case, Wilson J.A. was content
to apply the More and Melville case in this respect while also agreeing
with Davey J.A. that a new trial was warranted in McNutt because of the
course of proceedings there.

Among the authorities relied on in the More
and Melville case was R. v. Austin[15]
where the Ontario Court of Appeal held that on a charge of robbing a named
person, proof that the person robbed was the one named was essential, and in
the absence of an amendment at trial to make the indictment conform to the
evidence the Court of Appeal could not remedy the defect because it had no
power to amend, and consequently an acquittal must be entered. There was no
such additional ground in the Austin case as there was in the More
and Melville case to warrant a new trial; there was simply failure of proof
at trial of an essential averment, and the Court of Appeal did not think it
should enter the lists and do for the Crown what it was open to it to do and
what it failed to do for itself, namely, seek an amendment at trial.

This brings me to the later judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt[16], in which the force of R. v.
More and Melville was eroded and in which the majority of the five-man
Bench concluded that (to use the words of Davey J.A. at p. 39) “this Court
may in appropriate cases exercise the powers of amendment conferred by the Code
upon trial Judges” but it was a power to be exercised with greatest care.
Davey J.A. did not himself indicate the provisions of the Criminal Code  giving
this asserted power to a court of appeal. It is clear from his words that he
was purporting to exercise the

[Page 406]

powers of a trial court under what is now
s. 529 . At the same time, he based his conclusion on adoption of the
reasons of Wilson J.A. who invoked what is now s. 610(3), pointing out
that there was no reference to that provision in the More and Melville case,
and holding that s. 529  did not extend to a court of appeal. I should say
at this point that the decision in Wixalbrown and Schmidt cannot be
justified by reliance on s. 529  which, by its own words, is restricted to
matters at trial. It is included in Part XVII of the Criminal Code —Procedure
by Indictment—while the powers of the Court of Appeal are set out in Part
XVIII—Appeals—Indictable Offences—and there is no incorporating reference.

What Davey J.A. said on the question of a court
of appeal’s power to amend, speaking also for Bird and Tysoe JJ.A., with
Sheppard J.A. dissenting on this point, was an alternative ground of decision,
having regard to the facts of the case. The two accused were charged with
breaking and entering certain premises at a specified time and committing an
indictable offence, to wit, theft. The charge was laid under what is now
s. 306(1)(b) (then s. 292(1)(b)) which concluded
with the word “therein” in defining the offence but that word was not included
in the indictment nor was objection taken to the omission at the trial which
proceeded on the basis that the alleged theft was committed in the specified
premises. The word “therein” had been included in the information upon which
the preliminary inquiry was conducted which resulted in the committal for
trial. On appeal from conviction, counsel for the accused took for the first
time two objections; first, that there were no or no sufficient particulars of
the alleged offence of theft, as was a requisite under s. 492, (now
s. 510) and, second, that the omission of the word “therein” was an
omission of an essential averment and hence the accused was convicted of an
offence not known to the law.

Davey J.A. disposed of the first objection by
agreeing that if theft alone had been charged the indictment would have been
fatally defective (rely-

[Page 407]

ing on Brodie v. The King[17], at p. 199), but theft being
alleged as part of a compound offence and there being sufficient particularity
to enable the accused to meet the charge, the objection failed. As to the
second objection, the omission of the word “therein” from the indictment, Davey
J.A. took alternative positions. He held, first, that as a matter of context
(purporting to distinguish this Court’s judgment in McNeil v. The
King[18], with,
in my opinion, questionable success) there was not an omission of an essential
averment but rather an imperfect allegation of such an averment which caused no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. His alternative position, agreeing
for this purpose that there was omission of an essential averment, was that in
principle (to quote him, at p. 39),

…no person ought to stand convicted or be
imprisoned on a charge that totally omits an essential averment required to
constitute an offence known to the law. That in itself is a substantial wrong.
I can see no difference in principle between a conviction for a charge that
lacks one averment necessary to constitute a crime, and a conviction for one
that is totally unknown to the law. To allow the former to stand would open the
door to grave abuses, the end of which cannot be foreseen.

He went on to say, however, that “that objection
can be met by amendment if we have the power”. He concluded, as I have already
noted, that a court of appeal “may in appropriate cases exercise the powers of
amendment conferred by the Code upon trial Judges”. He did not say whence
comes this power—it could only be given by statute—and I can only infer from
Davey J.A.’s reliance on Wilson J.A.’s reasons that in Davey J.A.’s view it
derived from what is now s. 610(3)  of the Criminal Code . However,
s. 610(3) speaks of the power of a court of appeal in civil matters and it
is impossible to find authorization in it for the exercise of powers conferred
by the Criminal Code  upon trial judges.

[Page 408]

Sheppard J.A. met the issue of the omission of
an essential averment, to which no objection was taken at trial, by invoking
the principle laid down in R. v. Leclair[19], namely, that when an accused has
failed to move to quash before pleading to an indictment and has failed as well
to object during the trial, the Court of Appeal may refuse to allow him to
raise the matter there unless it is of opinion that the accused has been in
some way prejudiced or misled. In Leclair, although an essential
averment was omitted, the section of the Code under which the
offence was charged was referred to, and this, it seems to me, must have some
bearing on the statement of principle which, otherwise, would appear to
contradict Davey J.A.’s opinion, quoted above, that omission of an essential
averment itself is a substantial wrong. I do not need, however, to dwell on
this point here but pass to Sheppard J.A.’s observation on whether there is a
power in a court of appeal to amend an indictment. He said this on the point
(at p. 44):

The Court of Appeal has not power to make
the amendment of the indictment and conviction by adding the word “therein” as
requested by the Crown. By reason that Parliament has expressly conferred on
the trial Court the power to amend indictments subject to certain restrictions
(s. 510) [now s. 529 ] there is difficulty in construing other
sections of the Code as impliedly conferring upon another Court,
such as the Court of Appeal, the power to amend the indictment and conviction,
either subject to the same restrictions on the trial Court or without any
restriction. Moreover, the primary question for the Court of Appeal is whether
or riot substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred (s. 592(1)(b)(iii))
[now s. 613(1)(b)(iii)]; if not the appeal would be dismissed and
the matter thereby ended. If substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred the appeal would be allowed and the conviction quashed, with the
direction of an acquittal, or of a new trial (s. 592(2)) [now s. 613(2)].
Only in the event of a new trial would any amendment be required and the power
to make such amendment has been given to the trial Court where the accused
would have an opportunity to plead thereto and to meet the issue raised
thereby. It would follow that the Court of Appeal has not the power to amend
the indictment and conviction as requested for the Crown.

[Page 409]

I have reviewed the Wixalbrown and Schmidt case
at some length because it has spawned other decisions to the same effect on the
power to amend. Certain observations must be made about it. In the first place,
and central to the present case, it does not deal with the substitution of a
charge of a different offence from that sought to be alleged. Second, Wilson
J.A. did not say what Davey J.A. said he did. Wilson J.A. noted that a court of
appeal could not found a power to amend an indictment on the now s. 529 ,
that provision being limited to trial judges, but it could be founded on the
now s. 610(3) as giving the same power to amend as the Court of Appeal had
in civil cases.

I am unable to accept the view that
s. 610(3) confers any power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment.
That subsection takes its context from the preceding provisions of
s. 610 which concern evidentiary questions. The opening words of
s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that “A court of appeal may
exercise… any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be
exercised… on appeals in civil matters”. The subsection cannot, therefore,
be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Although Wilson J.A.
purported to find support for his view in this Court’s judgment in Kissick v.
The King[20], that
case was concerned with an issue as to admissibility of evidence and thus
related to the very subject-matter of s. 610. Still less can
s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

Wixalbrown and Schmidt was invoked by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v.
Breland and George[21], where
essential averments were omitted from a charge but no objection was taken at
trial. The majority judgment proceeded on alternative bases, relying, first, on
the principle of R. v. Leclair, supra, that where no objection is taken
at trial the accused will not be allowed to take it on appeal unless he has
been misled or prejudiced; and, second, on the principle allegedly

[Page 410]

derived from the judgment of Davey J.A. in Wixalbrown
and Schmidt that even if the accused has been misled or prejudiced, the
Court of Appeal may amend and affirm the conviction under s. 529  of the Criminal
Code  if there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. I
have doubts whether Wixalbrown and Schmidt goes this far (and the
dissenting judgment of Whittaker J.A. supports my doubt), since Davey J.A. was
mistaken as to what Wilson J.A. said in that case but, in any event, I need not
pursue this because we are not dealing in the Breland and George case
with the substitution of a different charge but only with the perfection of an
imperfect one.

There is another line of cases represented by Morin
and Morin v. The Queen[22] and
by R. v. Pearson[23] which
take a strict approach against the Crown where an essential particular of a
charge is not proved and no application to amend is made by the Crown to the
trial judge. In the Morin case, there was a charge of illegal possession
of goods on a stated date but the evidence showed possession at a later date.
The Crown did not move to amend but a conviction was entered at trial. The
Quebec Court of Appeal held that the offence charged was not proved and that it
had no power to rectify the matter, citing R. v. Volaine[24]. This class of case differs from
those where an essential averment or some particular is omitted; the charge is
good in all respects but, as in the Volaine case, it alleges an offence
committed on a specific date and the evidence does not show any of the
prohibited acts to have been committed on that date. No rectification having
been effected at the trial, it was held in Volaine that the Court of
Appeal had no power to rectify the mistake, with the result that a conviction
on the charge could not stand and an acquittal had to be ordered.

[Page 411]

In the Pearson case, supra, there
was a variance as to the place of commission of an offence between the
statement in the charge and the evidence that was adduced but no application
was made to amend. On appeal, a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal held
that the conviction must be quashed and an acquittal entered because the Court
of Appeal had no power to amend the charge to conform to the evidence. Owen
J.A. dissented in an extensive review of the authorities, preferring to follow
and to apply, in respect of a variance as to the place of commission of an
offence, a line of cases, having their source in English case law, holding that
a variance as to date was not fatal to a conviction because the place, like the
date, was not an essential averment, and since the accused was not misled or
prejudiced the conviction should stand. He added this (at p. 26):

In view of this conclusion, I do not deem
it necessary to discuss whether this Court, in the present case, had the power
to amend the indictment so as to conform with the proof.

One further point may be noted, arising from the
judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Christiansen[25]. That Court was unanimous in
holding that a charge of trafficking in narcotics by distributing was not
supported by the evidence and further that an attempt to commit the offence was
not established. However, it divided on the consequences of its holding. Since
it appeared that the evidence supported a finding of trafficking by giving, the
question was whether the trial judge should have amended the indictment suo
motu and whether, not having done so, this was a reversible error. Hughes
C.J.N.B. held on the authorities that there was no duty on the trial judge to
amend the indictment to conform to the evidence when the Crown did not seek an
amendment and hence would dismiss the Crown’s appeal against an acquittal. Ryan
J.A. was content to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the offence charged
was not proved. Only Limerick J.A., who dissented, viewed s. 610(3) as
giving the Court of Appeal power to amend the indictment

[Page 412]

but, apparently, only by reason of the trial
judge’s error in law in failing to make the amendment. It followed in his view
that a new trial should be directed on an amended indictment, invoking in this
respect s. 613(8)  of the Criminal Code .

I cannot subscribe to Limerick J.A.’s
proposition that a trial judge has a duty to amend an indictment to conform to
the evidence when the Crown has not sought an amendment and hence the basis on
which he asserted an amending power in the Court of Appeal under s. 610(3)
disappears. Indeed, if he is correct in imposing such a duty on a trial judge
there is no need to invoke s. 610(3) since the issue then becomes merely
one of correcting an error of law below. I do not find the Christiansen case
of any assistance on the issues in the present case.

It is, of course, the fact that, with the power
given to a trial judge to amend to add an omitted essential averment, the line
between a charge which is a nullity and one which is merely imperfect has
become more difficult to draw. R. v. Hunt, Nadeau and Paquette[26] is an illustration, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal holding there that there was no offence disclosed in
the charge, which was thus not amendable. In R. v. Major[27], which came to this Court (see 27
C.C.C. (2d) 239) MacKeigan C.J.N.S. considered both R. v. Leclair and
R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt and, speaking for the majority, laid it
down (at p. 65) that “the omission of what used to be considered an
essential averment is not now sufficient to prevent a charge being cured by
amendment, even at the Court of Appeal level, so long as the accused is reasonably
informed and not misled, and especially where the offence is correctly
identified by section number”. The source of this power must have been
s. 529  because MacKeigan C.J.N.S. said that he respect-

[Page 413]

fully agreed with Davey J.A. in Wixalbrown
and Schmidt.

The issue for MacKeigan C.J.N.S. in the Major
case was whether the charge was an unamendable nullity or was amendable
despite its imperfection, and he concluded that it was amendable by supplying
an omitted essential averment but that it was necessary to see if the matters
covered by the missing averment were in fact proved in order to decide whether
the amendment should be made and whether the accused should have been
convicted. It was on the point of whether there was such evidence that Cooper
J.A. dissented from the majority and would, unlike them, have allowed the
amendment and affirmed the conviction which the majority quashed. In so far as
the Nova Scotia Court’s decision in the Major case stands for the
proposition that a court of appeal may exercise the powers of a trial judge
under s. 529  to amend a charge of an indictable offence to supply an
essential averment it is, in my opinion, wrong in law and this is very clear
from a mere reading of s. 529 . The appeal to this Court was disposed of in
short oral reasons at the conclusion of the hearing whereby Cooper J.A.’s
assessment was preferred and the conviction was accordingly restored: see
(1976), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 239.

The Major case was considered by this
Court in its recent decision in R. v. Côté[28], which was a Crown appeal from
acquittal on an information charging an offence under s. 235(2)  of the Criminal
Code , the information referring to the section but omitting from the
particulars of the charge the words “without reasonable excuse”. No objection
was taken by the accused to the omission either at first instance or on the
trial de novo, nor did he object in his notice of appeal that the charge
did not disclose an offence. However, leave to amend the notice of appeal to
raise this objection was given by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal which, in
the result, quashed the summary conviction on that ground. The case was brought
here on

[Page 414]

the question of the applicability of ss. 732(1),
(3) and 755(4) (as it stood at that time) of the Criminal Code . Whether
s. 732, which refers to the powers and position of a summary conviction
court, has any relevance to an issue arising in an appellate court is, at best,
doubtful, and I have grave doubt as well whether s. 755(4)  has any
application to a court of appeal since it is a provision referring to an
“appeal court” defined in s. 747  as being the court for trials de novo whereas
the further appeal to a court of appeal is dealt with in s. 771 . However,
neither s. 732(1) , (3)  nor s. 755(4)  was necessary to the
determination of the Crown’s appeal (which was allowed in this Court) since
both de Grandpré J. who wrote for the majority and Spence J. who wrote in
concurrence were agreed that the information was sufficient and did not need
amendment.

However, in deference to the arguments advanced
by counsel on the question on which leave was given to bring the case to this
Court, de Grandpré J. went on to discuss the Major case, pointing out
(and in this Spence J. agreed) that we were concerned, on the appeal here, only
with the question whether there was sufficient evidence to prove an element of
the offence charged, and we supported the dissenting view of Cooper J.A. in the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that there was such evidence. The further observation
and conclusion of de Grandpré J. on the effect of ss. 732(1), (3) and 755(4)
(and I have already indicated my doubt of their applicability to a court of
appeal) that “it was an error on the part of the [Saskatchewan] Court of Appeal
to fail to consider the application of the relevant provisions of s. 732
and s. 755… in the circumstances of the case and to hold that the
information did not disclose an offence known to the law” (at p. 358 of 33
C.C.C. (2d)) have no relevance for the issue under consideration in the present
case.

This observation and conclusion was prefaced by
the words (referring to the Major case) that “this recent decision of
our Court settles the matter with the result that the question of law defined
in the order granting leave [in the Côté case] must be

[Page 415]

answered in the affirmative”. Whatever be the
view taken of our decision in the Major case, nothing in it touches the
power of a court of appeal to substitute a charge of a different offence, and
it must be assumed that Chief Justice MacKeigan’s reference to the Court of
Appeal’s power to amend can only have been a reference to s. 529  although
no Criminal Code  provision was identified by him.

Since it is established—and a recent
illustration is seen in R. v. Vallée[29]—that
a charge or an indictment which fails to disclose an offence, one which is a
nullity, is not amendable by the trial judge even given the wide powers of
amendment reposed in him by s. 529 , and that no power to breathe life into
a nullity rests in a court of appeal, it would be astonishing if on appeal a
court of appeal could exercise power to substitute a different charge when a
trial judge cannot do so. There is no express power to do so, indeed there is
not even any express power in a court of appeal to amend, as there is in New
Zealand under s. 392(1) of the Crimes Act, 1908 (N.Z.), No. 32, and
it would seem that the proper course for the Court of Appeal to adopt, if it
decides to order a new trial and not apply the Leclair doctrine to
foreclose the accused on any objection to the indictment, is to leave it to the
trial judge to decide whether an amendment should be made.

III

I turn now to s. 613(8)  of the Criminal
Code  and, in order to provide a context for its consideration I reproduce
as well s. 613(4)  as that provision stood at the time of the proceedings
in this case in the British Columbia Court of Appeal (it was amended and re‑arranged
by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93,
s. 75, effective July 26, 1976, but without any change in substance). The
two subsections read as follows:

613. (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict and

[Page 416]

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make
any order, in addition, that justice requires.

I supplement these provisions to make the short
point here that this Court’s power to entertain the accused’s appeal from the
setting aside of his acquittal is found in s. 618(2)(a) which gives
him a right of appeal in such circumstances on a question of law, here the
question of the proper construction and application of s. 613(4) , (8) .

Grammatically and as a matter of common sense
construction, a court of appeal, seized of a Crown appeal against an acquittal,
looks to s. 613(4)  for the powers it may exercise on such an appeal, and
it is only where (in the words of s. 613(8) ) “a court of appeal exercises
any of the powers conferred by subsection… (4) [that] it may make any order, in
addition [to that exercise (the italicized words are my own)] that
justice requires”. The provision in s. 613(8)  for “any order, in addition,
that justice requires” is sequential to the exercise of the power to order a
new trial under s. 613(4) . It does not, in my view, enable a court of
appeal to make an order upon which to found a direction for a new trial; and
certainly not when that order does not relate to the charge on which the
accused has been acquitted and to an error of law in respect of that charge.
This is, I think, rather obvious when reference is had, as it must be, to
s. 605(1)(a) upon which the Crown must base its right to appeal an
acquittal. There is a statutory framework, and only a statutory framework, for
appeals, and the limitations which have been placed by Parliament on Crown
appeals are clear. A court of appeal, limited to questions of law arising out
of the indictment on which an accused has been tried and acquitted, cannot, so
to speak, pull itself up by its own bootstraps to exercise its power to order a
new trial but must find a basis for doing so in respect of the charge as laid
and considered at trial. It is only that charge which an accused must be
prepared to

[Page 417]

defend (saving included offences) and fairness to
him, which the Criminal Code  purports to express in accordance with the
fundamental conceptions residing in the presumption of innocence, dictates that
he not be taken beyond the bounds of what the Crown has chosen to lay against
him.

What is now s. 613(8)  was considered by
Fauteux J., as he then was, in Welch v. The King[30], where he spoke for the majority of
the Court on an issue arising from a conviction on a charge of manslaughter
upon a second trial of the accused who had first been charged with murder and
convicted of manslaughter. The first verdict was set aside for misdirection and
the Ontario Court of Appeal either failed or refused to order a new trial or to
direct an acquittal, contenting itself with saying that although the conviction
would be set aside the accused was not acquitted. The second trial followed. In
the result, the majority of this Court allowed the accused’s appeal, quashed
the conviction on the second trial and ordered his discharge. What this Court
was concerned with in the Welch case was the incomplete judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in the first proceeding and, hence, with the statutory
powers of courts of appeal on appeals in criminal cases. The explanation of the
Court of Appeal’s unusual decision neither to convict nor acquit nor to order a
new trial was the assumed impossibility under the Criminal Code  of the
Crown laying a second indictment for manslaughter where the accused had been
acquitted on an indictment charging murder: see R. v. Pascal[31].

In the course of his reasons, and adverting
obviously to what is now s. 613(8) , Fauteux J. said this (at p. 426):

…I fail, I must say with deference, to
appreciate the alleged obstacles standing in the way of the Court of Appeal to
exercise its authority if, as suggested, the

[Page 418]

majority judges wanted to direct a new
trial only on this sole undisposed of part of the indictment, that is, the
lesser charge of manslaughter. Legal and sufficient it would have been to
direct a new trial on the offence of manslaughter exclusively and to further
order that the original indictment of murder be, to that end, amended. Thus, on
this new trial, the accused could only be found guilty or not guilty of
manslaughter. The language of the statute is broad enough to embrace the
authority to make such “other order”, if the justice of the case suggests no
other. And I know of no principles of law which could have then been violated
by such order. I must, therefore, conclude that the exercise of the statutory
authority given to the Court of Appeal, under section 1014(3), to direct
an acquittal to be entered or to direct a new trial and in either case, to make
such other order as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory.

This application of s. 613(8)  does not
touch the present case but it clearly gives sensible subject-matter to the
provision in respect of the substitution of convictions for included offences
or orders for a new trial in respect of such offences.

A reference to what is now s. 613(8)  is
also made in the dissenting reasons of Taschereau J., as he then was, Chief
Justice Rinfret concurring. The dissent was on another point but as to
s. 613(8) , the learned justice said this (at p. 416):

I had the advantage of reading the reasons
for judgment of my brother Fauteux, and I agree with him, that when the Court
of Appeal allows an appeal against a conviction, in a case like the one at bar,
it has only two alternatives. It may quash the conviction and direct a verdict
of acquittal, or direct a new trial, and it is only when one of these two
courses has been followed that it may make such other order as justice
requires. It is however imperative and not only permissive, that
there should be an acquittal or that a new trial should be directed.

I entertain no doubt that the Court of
Appeal had power by virtue of section 1014(3) of the Cr. C., after
haying quashed the conviction, to direct a new trial limited exclusively to the
charge of manslaughter. This would have clearly been an order authorized by the
concluding part of section 1014(3) Cr. C.

[Page 419]

I subscribe fully to this view and would
underline Taschereau J.’s words that “it is only when one of these two courses
[direction of an acquittal or of a new trial] has been followed that [the Court
of Appeal] may make such other order as justice requires”. (The italics
are those of Taschereau J.)

The Welch case appears to have been
applied in R. v. Kelso[32], where
the accused on an indictment for rape was convicted of attempted rape, and in
ordering a new trial because of misdirection the Court felt it could properly
order the new trial to proceed on the charge of attempted rape, not a very
surprising conclusion and, indeed, it may be doubted whether in the
circumstances of the Kelso case there was any need to rely on
s. 613(8) : see also R. v. Robertson[33]. However, such reliance in case of
an included offence (as to which see R. v. Popoff[34]) is a long way from the issue confronting
this Court here.

Assuming, however, that s. 613(8)  gives a
court of appeal a wider power than that which I think its terms confer when
considered alongside s. 613(4)  and s. 605(1) (a), the relevant
question here is whether the words “make any order, in addition, that justice
requires” empower the court of appeal to direct a new trial on a different
offence from that on which the appeal was taken. It would be incongruous to me
if the Court of Appeal, under the relevant words of s. 613(8) , could do
what the trial judge could not do under the wide amending powers given him
under s. 529 . That aside, a consideration of the history of the words in
question in their original setting and in their present one does not lead to
the conclusion reached by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in this case.

I begin the historical canvass with a statute of
pre-Confederation Canada, An Act for the Further Amendment of the
Administration of the Criminal Law, (1851) (Can.), c. 13, providing
for the reservation of questions of law arising in a criminal trial for the
opinion of a superior court. The question or

[Page 420]

questions of law were to be submitted by a
stated case and

…the Justices of either of the said
Superior Courts shall thereupon have full power and authority to hear and
finally determine the said questions, and thereupon to reverse, affirm or amend
any judgment which shall have been given on the indictment or inquisition on
the trial whereof such question or questions have arisen, or to avoid such
judgment, and to order an entry to be made on the record, that in the judgment
of the said Justices the party convicted ought not to have been convicted, or
to arrest the judgment, or order judgment to be given thereon at some other
Session of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or other Sessions of the Peace,
if no judgment shall have been before that time given, as they shall be advised,
or to make such other order as justice may require;…

This statute by its terms was in force only in
Upper Canada.

Similar provision for stating a case on a
reserved question of law is found in the Statutes of Lower Canada: see C.S.L.C.
1860, c. 77, s. 58. The Court of Queen’s Bench was authorized to
reverse, amend or affirm any judgment on the indictment in question, to avoid
or arrest judgment or “to make such other order as justice requires”. Section 3
of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada 1859, c. 112, was in similar
terms, and so was s. 101 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1864 (3rd
series), c. 171, and to the same effect was s. 23 of the Revised
Statutes of New Brunswick, 1854, c. 159. These provisions were virtually a
reproduction of English legislation, 1848 (U.K.), c. 78, and were
similarly entitled. When the statutes of Canada were first revised after
Confederation, the foregoing common provisions were superseded by s. 261
of the Criminal Procedure Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, which was as
follows:

261. The
justices of the court for Crown cases reserved, to which the case is
transmitted, shall hear and finally determine such question, and reverse,
affirm or amend any judgment given on the trial wherein such question arose, or
shall avoid such judgment or order an entry to be made on the record, that in
the judgment of such justices the person convicted ought not to have been
convicted, or shall arrest the judgment, or if no judgment has been given,
shall order judgment to be given thereon at some future session of the court
before

[Page 421]

which the person was convicted, or shall
make such other order as justice requires.

The new Criminal Code  of 1892 retained
provision for the reserving of questions of law arising during a trial but to
be considered by courts of appeal upon a case stated: see s. 743 . The Code
improved upon the previous law governing appeals in criminal cases by the
enactment of a composite provision, s. 746 , reading as follows:

746. …

(a) confirm the ruling
appealed from; or

(b) if of opinion that the
ruling was erroneous, and that there has been a mis-trial in consequence,
direct a new trial; or

(c) if it considers the
sentence erroneous, or the arrest of judgment erroneous, pass such a sentence
as ought to have been passed or set aside any sentence passed by the court
below, and remit the case to the court below with a direction to pass the
proper sentence; or

(d) if of opinion in a case
in which the accused has been convicted that the ruling was erroneous, and that
the accused ought to have been acquitted, direct that the accused shall be
discharged, which order shall have all the effects of an acquittal; or

(e) direct a new trial; or

(f) make such other order as justice
requires: Provided that no conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial
directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or
rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some
misdirection given, unless in the opinion of the Court of Appeal some substantial
wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial: Provided that if the
Court of Appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly
disallowed a new trial shall be granted.

2. If it appears to the Court of Appeal
that such wrong or miscarriage affected some count only of the indictment the
court may give separate directions as to each count and may pass sentence on
any count unaffected by such wrong or miscarriage which stands good, or may
remit the case to the court below with directions to pass such sentence as
justice may require.

[Page 422]

Section 746 of the original Code came
down in subsequently revised form to the present s. 613 , and
s. 613(8)  may be looked upon as a transformed version of s. 746(f).

The case law on the pre-Confederation and
post-Confederation legislation cited above, at least until it was subsumed
under the new Criminal Code , established that although the sufficiency
of an indictment was a question that could be reserved in arrest of judgment
(see R. v. Gibson[35], holding,
however, that the sufficiency of an indictment could not be challenged on a
motion to quash), there was no power on the consideration of a reserved
question to amend the indictment: see R. v. Garland[36]. The Court said in the Garland case,
at p. 227, that “our powers do not extend to amending the indictment. We
can only deal with the judgment; and if we amend the judgment here the record
will be wrong”. A fortiori, there was no power to direct the
substitution of a different charge.

I referred earlier in these reasons to the
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. More and Melville[37], and, risking repetition, I wish to
mention again what was there decided. The Court took a cautious approach to the
question of its power to direct a new trial on an amended indictment involving
an essential averment, namely, the place of commission of the offence of
unlawful possession of stolen property. After considering the Welch case
and some others the majority concluded that it had no power to amend the
indictment in that respect but, in the special circumstances, it could order a
new trial, leaving it to the trial judge to determine whether an amendment to
the charge was necessary and whether it should be made. The dissenting Chief Justice
Desbrisay agreed that the Court of Appeal had no power to amend and would have
entered an acquittal. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court en

[Page 423]

banc applied More
and Melville in R. v. Rooney[38]
to deny to an appellate court the power to amend an indictment. In the
result in that case, which involved a conviction on a charge of obtaining money
by false pretences but the proof did not go higher than showing that the
accused had obtained a cheque by false representations, the majority of the
Court ordered a new trial because, in the words of McDonald J. for the majority
at p. 196, “it appears that evidence does exist by which a case may be
proved properly, with or without amendment of the charge by the magistrate”.
The opposing view was put by Ilsley C.J. in dissent (Currie J. concurring),
namely, that this was not a case where because of some mistake in the conduct
of the trial the conviction could not stand although there was evidence to
convict on a proper trial, but rather it was a case where the Crown had failed
to prove guilt of the offence charged and “for this Court to order a new trial
would be to place again the appellant in jeopardy… in order to give the Crown
another opportunity to secure his conviction on an amended charge” (at
p. 192).

I refer to one more decision, that of the New
Brunswick Court of Appeal in Budovitch v. The Queen[39]. It involved a conviction for
fraudulently failing to pay over or account for money, the charge alleging the
offence to have been committed in Fredericton. The evidence showed that, if
committed, it was in Saint John. On appeal, a new trial was ordered on a charge
which alleged an offence in Saint John, the majority purporting to invoke what
is now s. 613(8)  in directing the amendment to be made at the new trial.
Hughes J.A., as he then was, would, following the Rooney case (as
holding there was no power to amend the indictment on appeal), have ordered a
new trial, leaving it to the trial judge to make the appropriate amendment
under what is now s. 529 , pointing

[Page 424]

out there was uncontradicted evidence of a theft
in New Brunswick.

Although Budovitch goes beyond More
and Melville and beyond Rooney in directing a new trial on an
amended charge, it is nonetheless simply a case where the amendment was within
the trial judge’s power, relating as it did to an essential particular in the
charge, but not to a different charge, and, moreover, a particular on which
evidence had been adduced, that is as to the place of commission of the
offence.

I do not find anything in the case law, and
certainly nothing in applicable legislation to authorize a court of appeal to
do what the British Columbia Court of Appeal did here, something which the
trial judge himself could not do. There is here a usurpation of the function of
the Attorney-General and of the Crown. It is for them to decide, the existing
charge not being proved, whether to lay the different charge which the Court
felt should have been brought against the accused. It is not for a Court to
take an ad hominem view in a case like the present one and to do
violence to the separate functions of Court and Crown lest a person guilty of
an offence, but not the one charged, escape punishment.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal and restore the acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The appellant and one Arthur James
Williams were charged together on an indictment dated October 22, 1974, with
the following offences:

1. THAT in or about various places in the
County of Nanaimo, and elsewhere, in the Province of British Columbia, between
on or about the 23rd day of August, A.D. 1972 and on or about the 21st day of
December, A.D. 1973, they and Stuart Hunter Elliott, Lois Phoebe

[Page 425]

Elliott, Jerry Dean Elliott, Myron Zarry,
Shirley Ferguson, Ingrid Elliott, unlawfully did conspire together the one with
the other or others of them, and persons unknown to commit the indictable
offence of trafficking in a restricted drug, to wit, 3, 4,
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) contrary to the form of statute in such case
made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

2. THAT in or about various places in the
County of Nanaimo, and elsewhere, in the Province of British Columbia, between
on or about the 23rd day of August, A.D. 1972 and on or about the 21st day of
December, A.D. 1973 they did unlawfully traffic in a restricted drug, to wit;
3, 4, Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) contrary to the form of statute in such
case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, and her
Crown and Dignity.

3. THAT in the County of Nanaimo, Province
of British Columbia on or about the 17th day of December A.D. 1973 they did
unlawfully have in their possession a restricted drug, to wit; 3, 4,
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) for the purpose of trafficking contrary to the
form of statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our
Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

At the trial before Cashman C.C.J., both accused
were acquitted on the first count of this indictment, the appellant alone was
convicted on the second count but acquitted on the third. The learned trial
judge entered the latter acquittal on the ground that he had already convicted
the appellant of “trafficking” on the second count and that the offences
charged in these two counts were so intermingled that he could not distinguish
the one from the other; he therefore invoked the judgment of this Court in Kienapple
v. The Queen[40], and
thus concluded that the matter was res judicata.

When the appellant appealed his conviction on
the second count, the Court of Appeal directed an acquittal on the ground that
although it had been proved that the appellant had substantial quantities of a
salt designated MDA hydrochloride in his possession for the purpose of sale and
distribution, it was not shown that he was in possession of MDA itself for the
purpose of trafficking or otherwise.

[Page 426]

All the counts in the indictment were laid under
the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27,
s. 40 of which defines a “restricted drug” as including
“methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) or any salt thereof”. The Court of Appeal
being satisfied that trafficking in the salt constituted a separate offence
which was not charged in the indictment, allowed the appellant’s appeal.

In appealing the verdict of acquittal on the
third count, the Crown applied to amend the charge by adding the words “a salt
of” prior to the words “3, 4,MDA” so that the allegation would comply with the
facts as disclosed by the evidence and found by the Court of Appeal in the
appeal against conviction on count 2. This application was granted and the
Court ordered “that the appeal against acquittal be allowed, the acquittal set
aside and a new trial ordered on the indictment as amended”. Judgment on this
application was rendered on behalf of the Court by Mr. Justice MacLean who
had presided at the appeal from the conviction on the second count and, as I
have said, it is clear that the Court of Appeal in disposing of that count
treated the charge of being in possession of MDA and being in possession of a
salt thereof as two separate charges, although McIntyre J.A., speaking for the
majority of the Court, clearly indicated that he regarded the designation of
“MDA” in the charge as a “particular” and would have considered an amendment
appropriate after hearing the appeal had one been sought.

In considering the third count, however, the
Court of Appeal, differently constituted, appears to have recognized that the
charge was that the accused “did unlawfully have in their possession a
restricted drug… for the purpose of trafficking” and that the failure to allege
possession of “a salt of MDA” constituted a failure to allege “a particular” of
the offence which was capable of being added by way of amendment, in order to
conform to the evidence which the Court had accepted in disposing of count 2.

The latter amendment did not in my opinion have
the effect of charging a new offence as it did

[Page 427]

no more than specify a particular of the offence
which had already been charged. If I thought the amendment to be tantamount to
the charge of a different offence from that contained in the original count,
other considerations might apply, but what we have here is a particularization
of an ingredient of the main charge which was made necessary by the evidence
which the Court had already accepted and which had in fact been in great
measure conceded by the appellant.

Mr. Justice MacLean’s judgment on this
application is very brief and I reproduce it in full:

In this case the Crown applies for an
amendment of the indictment, some considerable time after conclusion of the
trial, applying to this Court rather than to the court below.

In my view the ends of justice require that
the amendment in this case be granted and in my view no substantial wrong would
be suffered thereby by the accused person.

I would accordingly allow the amendment of
the third count in the indictment, allow the appeal of the Crown, set aside the
acquittal and direct a new trial on the third count as amended.

It is from this decision and the order granted
pursuant thereto that the appellant now appeals alleging:

(i) that as the trial judge had found count
three to be indistinguishable from count two, it followed that by acquitting
the appellant with respect to count two the Court of Appeal had necessarily
disposed of the Crown’s appeal on count three and that the Court of Appeal
lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Crown’s appeal on this count; (Kienapple
v. The Queen was cited in support of this contention.)

(ii) that proceedings by way of appeal relating
to several counts in an indictment which had been tried together cannot be
severed by the Crown in the Court of Appeal;

(iii) that there is no power in the Court of
Appeal to amend an indictment so as to conform with the evidence, this power
being limited to the trial court by reason of ss. 529 , 610  and 613  of the Criminal
Code .

[Page 428]

In acquitting the appellant on count 2 the Court
of Appeal did not, in my view, dispose of the third count; it did on the other
hand dispose of the reason given by the trial judge for his acquittal on that
count. It will be observed that the gravamen of the offence under these counts
is in the one case that the accused did “unlawfully traffic in a restricted
drug…” and in the other that they did “unlawfully have in their possession a
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking”. The whole gist of the decision
in the Court of Appeal on count 2 was that although the appellant was guilty of
having possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA) for the purpose of
trafficking, the salt was not a drug specified in the particulars of the
indictment. It remained for the Crown to seek an order amending count 3 of the
indictment so as to conform to the evidence. Far from having been disposed of
by the appellant’s acquittal by the Court of Appeal on count 2, the Crown’s
appeal from the acquittal on count 3 had not then been heard by the Court and
it was open to the Crown to pursue it.

Having found that the appellant was in fact in
possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA) for the purpose of trafficking,
Mr. Justice MacLean indicated that he would have been disposed to allow an
amendment to the second count of the indictment even after the hearing of the
appeal. The fact that the Crown did not seek such an amendment in no way
precluded it from applying to amend count 3 so as to conform to the evidence
described in Mr. Justice McIntyre’s reasons for judgment. The case of Kienapple
does not appear to me to have any application in this situation as that
case was concerned essentially with the proposition that an accused cannot be
convicted twice for the same offence.

The second ground of appeal advanced on behalf
of the appellant to the effect that counts in an indictment cannot be severed
in the Court of Appeal appears to me to overlook the course of proceedings at
trial in the present case. Here the learned trial judge disposed of the first
and second counts by a judgment rendered on January 31, 1975, and only then
proceeded to consider the

[Page 429]

third count against Elliott alone (a stay of
proceedings having been entered with respect to Williams). The third count was
thus effectively severed from counts 1 and 2 by the trial judge who proceeded
to consider that count separately and to dispose of it by a judgment dated
February 24, 1975.

In so doing, the learned trial judge purported
to act in accordance with s. 43  of the Food and Drugs Act  and it
therefore appears to me to be desirable to consider the following provisions of
that statute:

42. (1) No
person shall traffic in a restricted drug or any substance represented or held
out by him to be a restricted drug.

(2) No person shall have in his possession
any restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

43. (1) In
any prosecution for a violation of subsection 42(2), if the accused does
not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed as if the issue to be tried is
whether the accused was in possession of a restricted drug contrary to
subsection 41(1).

(2) If, pursuant to subsection (1),
the court finds that the accused was not in possession of a restricted drug
contrary to subsection 41(1), he shall be acquitted, but, if the court
finds that the accused was in possession of a restricted drug contrary to
subsection 41(1), he shall be given an opportunity of establishing that he
was not in possession of the restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking and
thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an opportunity of adducing evidence to
the contrary.

In purported compliance with these provisions,
Judge Cashman made the following statement in his judgment on the third count:

As required by Section 43  of the Food
and Drugs Act … I made a finding that the accused Elliott was in possession
of MDA on December 17th, 1973.

It was then agreed by Counsel that I should
make findings on Counts 1 and 2 with respect to each accused on these counts
before the accused Elliott be given an opportunity to establish that he was not
in possession of MDA for the purpose of trafficking.

Later in his judgment the learned trial judge
reasoned as follows:

[Page 430]

If the accused was before me on a charge of
possession for the purpose of trafficking in MDA and that was the only charge
before me then in the circumstances in which the MDA was found I would have no
difficulty in concluding it to be a fair inference from the evidence that the
accused had that quantity of MDA for the purpose of physically making MDA available
to other persons.

And he went on to say:

The question is not whether the accused can
be convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking in MDA in the
circumstances of this case but whether he should as a matter of law be
convicted of that offence, he having been convicted on the same evidence of
trafficking in MDA.

He then concluded:

In my opinion the two offences charged here
in Counts 2 and 3 are so intermingled that I cannot say that one is distinct
from the other.

It is my view that in the circumstances
here were I to convict the accused of both offences I would in reality be
convicting the accused twice of the same offence.

In Kienapple v. The Queen (supra) in
the C.R.N.S. volume at page 7, Laskin, J. said this:

In my view, the term res judicata best
expresses the theory of precluding multiple convictions for the same delict,
although the matter is the basis of two separate offences.

Accordingly I find that I cannot convict
the accused Elliott on Count 3 and I make that finding notwithstanding that
during the course of the Trial pursuant to Section 43  I found the accused to be
in possession of MDA. My inability to convict the accused Elliott is not due to
a matter of fact but rather to a matter of law for the reasons stated above.

As I have pointed out, the Court of Appeal has
found that the appellant was in possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA)
within the meaning of s. 41(1)  of the Food and Drugs Act  and the
effect of the amendment granted by Mr. Justice MacLean is to give the
appellant “an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking” as provided by s. 43(2)  of
the Food and Drugs Act .

[Page 431]

In my opinion the only issue before this Court
on the present appeal is whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its powers when
it amended the third count of the indictment in such fashion as to conform to
the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in that count
as originally drawn, upon which the appellant had been acquitted. Having regard
to the extensive activities which the appellant was found to have been
conducting in the manufacture of MDA hydrochloride, I do not think that it can
be suggested that the appellant was in any way misled by the fact that that
salt was not mentioned in the particulars. He knew in any event that he was
being charged with possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of
trafficking.

In directing a new trial, Mr. Justice
MacLean incorporated the amendment to the information in his order as he felt
that the ends of justice required him to do.

In granting this order it seems to me to be
plain that the Court of Appeal was acting pursuant to the provisions of
s. 613(4) (b) and (8)  which provide as follows:

613. (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may…

(b) allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict and

(i) order a new trial,…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection… (4),… it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the order for a new trial could not have been made unless the amendment had
been granted and that the amendment was therefore not an order “in addition” to
the exercise of the court’s power under subs. (4)(b)(i), but rather that
it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial.

In my view when Parliament authorized the Court
of Appeal, in the exercise of its power, to order a new trial, to “make any
order, in addition, which justice requires” it must be taken as having
authorized that Court under those circumstances to make any additional order
which the ends of justice require whether the order for a new trial is
dependent upon the additional order or not. I do

[Page 432]

not think that the wide powers conferred on the
Court of Appeal by s. 613(8)  are to be narrowly construed but rather that
they are designed to ensure that the requirements of the ends of justice are
met, and are to be liberally construed in light of that overriding consideration.

In ordering a new trial it would normally be
undesirable to comment on the evidence, but I think that in this case the
concessions made by the appellant on his appeal are relevant as indicating the
material of which the Court must have been aware in determining that the ends
of justice required a new trial on the third count.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
appeal on the second count, Mr. Justice McIntyre, with whom all members of
the Court agreed, had this to say:

The appellant conceded that the police had
found M.D.A. hydrochloride a salt of MDA upon the premises and conceded that it
was manufactured by the appellant. Indeed, in the absence of such a concession
there was positive proof that MDA hydrochloride had been manufactured in
substantial quantity and that it was intended for sale and distribution.

Seized with knowledge of this evidence, it is
small wonder that Mr. Justice MacLean considered the ends of justice to
require the amendment which he granted and that no substantial wrong was done
to the appellant by granting it. I fully agree with this conclusion and would
affirm the order that implemented it.

In the course of the argument in this Court
reference was made to other cases in which provincial courts of appeal have
granted amendments to an indictment as to which there was no complaint made at
trial, but the circumstances disclosed in each of these cases differs
materially from the situation disclosed in this appeal and I prefer to base my
conclusion on the broad ground that the ends of justice required the amendment
which was here granted. It follows that I find it unnecessary to express any
view as to the submission that the authority of the Court of Appeal to grant an
amendment stems from the provisions of s. 610(3)  of the Criminal Code  which
authorize the court to exercise powers “that may be exercised by the

[Page 433]

court on appeals in civil matters…”. In my view
a final determination of this question can be appropriately considered when it
is an essential element in the disposition of the appeal.

In the course of the argument reference was made
to the provisions of s. 529  of the Criminal Code  which bears the
heading “Amending defective indictment or count” but in my view the only
mandatory language in that section is contained in subs. (1) which
provides for

an objection to an indictment or to a count
in an indictment or a defect apparent on the face thereof…

and requires such objection to be taken before
plea or thereafter by leave of the court or a judge. In the present case we are
not concerned with a defect apparent on the face of the indictment and this
subsection accordingly has no application to the present circumstances. In
my view there is no other language in the section which can be read as
curtailing the power of the Court of Appeal to make an order under
s. 613(8)  which has the effect of amending the indictment so as to conform
to the evidence where the ends of justice require it.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
conclusion reached by the Chief Justice in this appeal and the reasons
therefor, with one reservation. I would like to leave open the issue as to
whether s. 529(1)  or s. 732(1)  of the Criminal Code  prevents
initial objection being taken in the Court of Appeal to a defect on the face of
the indictment or information and the effect of the judgment in R. v.
Leclair[41].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Interpretation—Availability of
absolute or conditional discharge—Criminal Code , ss. 234 , 662.1 .

Respondent had been found guilty of having
care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 234  of the Criminal
Code . Rather than assessing a penalty as provided in s. 234  the provincial
court judge purported to exercise the jurisdiction given by s. 662.1  and
granted a discharge to the accused conditional upon a probation order. The
Crown successfully appealed by way of stated case, however the Court of Appeal
subsequently held that a conditional discharge could be granted.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Section 234 (a) of the Criminal
Code  prescribes an alternative penalty for which no minimum is set but this
notwithstanding it also prescribes a minimum punishment i.e. a
fine of fifty dollars. The offence in question is therefore an offence for
which a minimum penalty is prescribed by law and it follows that the provisions
of s. 662.1(1)  do not apply.

R. v. Millen
(1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 395; R. v. Poulin (1974), 16 C.C.C.
(2d) 39; R. v. MacNeill (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 247 referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario allowing an appeal
from an order of Donohue J. allowing an appeal by way of stated case. Appeal
allowed, remitted to the Provincial Court Judge for the entry of a conviction
and the imposition of a sentence.

R.M. McLeod, for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

[Page 163]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal by leave of this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on May 23, 1974. In that judgment, the said Court of
Appeal, by a majority, allowed an appeal from the judgment of Donohue J.
pronounced on September 25, 1973. Provincial Court Judge Clendenning, on May 28, 1973, found the
respondent guilty of the charge that:

on or about the 9th day of March, 1973 at
the Town of Deseronto, in the County of Hastings
while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol he did have
the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to Section 234  of the
Criminal Code 

but rather than assessing a penalty as provided
in the said s. 234  of the Criminal Code , he purported to exercise the
jurisdiction given by s. 662.1  and granted a discharge to the accused
conditional upon a probation order. At the request of the Crown, the Provincial
Court Judge stated a case in which the following questions were put:

1. Did I err in law in applying the
provisions of Section 662.1  of the Criminal Code  after first stating in
open court on the record that a conviction would be entered?

2. Did I err in law in applying the
provisions of Section 662.1  of the Criminal Code  in proceedings under
Section 234  of the Criminal Code ?

Donohue J., in his order, allowed the appeal by
way of a stated case holding that s. 234  of the Criminal Code  did
provide a minimum punishment for the first offence and that, therefore, the
provisions of s. 662 . 1(1) were not available. From that order, the respondent
here appealed to the Court of Appeal and the majority of that Court composed of
Dubin and Estey JJ.A. allowed the appeal and answered both of the questions in
the stated case which I have recited above in the negative. Jessup J.A.
dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.

The first question in the stated case was
concerned simply with the result of the Provincial Court Judge having declared
in open court that he

[Page 164]

would convict the accused and then upon hearing
evidence determining that, rather than registering a conviction, he would grant
the conditional discharge.

As Jessup J.A. pointed out in his reasons,
counsel for the appellant in the Court of Appeal, here respondent, submitted
that in announcing he was registering a conviction the Provincial Court Judge
used that term merely in the sense of making a finding of guilt and counsel for
the Crown did not attempt to answer that argument. The issue was not canvassed in
this Court and I see no reason to disturb the negative answer to the first
question given by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

It will be seen, therefore, that the sole
question remaining for determination is whether or not a trial court judge,
coming to the conclusion that an accused person is guilty of the offence of
driving a motor vehicle when his ability was impaired by alcohol contrary to
the provisions of s. 234  of the Criminal Code , is free to refrain from
entering a conviction and grant to the accused either an absolute or a
conditional discharge as provided for in s. 662.1 (1)  of the Criminal Code . These
two sections read as follows:

234. Every one who, while his ability to
drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a
fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or
to imprisonment for three months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than three months and not less than fourteen days;
and

(c) for each subsequent
offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three
months.

...

662.1 (1) Where an accused, other than a
corporation, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence,

[Page 165]

other than an offence for which a minimum
punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable, in the proceedings
commenced against him, by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life or by
death, the court before which he appears may, if it considers it to be in the
best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of
convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged
absolutely or upon the conditions prescribed in a probation order.

That exact issue was considered not only in the
judgment from which the appeal presently considered was taken but also by the
Appellate Courts of three other provinces. In R. v. Millen[1], the Appellate Division of Nova
Scotia, in a judgment pronounced on April 10, 1973, held that the provisions of
s. 662.1(1)  did not apply, and in R. v. Poulin[2], the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
came to a similar conclusion citing Millen. In R. v. MacNeill[3], the Appeal Division of New
Brunswick, in a judgment pronounced on July 12, 1974, also came to a like
conclusion after considering the judgment in the present appeal as given by the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, and also Millen and Poulin. In each
one of the four cases, the provincial Appellate Courts were concerned with the
same problem.

Turning to the wording of s. 662.1(1) , the
procedure of a discharge without conviction is available only when the offence
of which the accused has been found guilty is “other than an offence for which
a minimum punishment is prescribed by law”. Therefore, the problem is whether
the provisions of s. 234 , para. (a), of the Criminal Code  providing
for the penalty upon a first offence of impaired driving are provisions which
do prescribe a minimum punishment.

The reasons of the learned justices in the Court
of Appeal for Ontario are concerned with the weighing of the various possible
penalties set out in the said s. 234 (a). Jessup J.A. would have
dismissed the appeal on the basis that the provision

[Page 166]

for a fine not less than fifty dollars was “a
minimum punishment” as he believed that the Parliament had intended that “a
fine is always minimal to imprisonment in the hierarchy of punishment provided
in the Code”. Dubin J.A., for the majority of the Court, relied on the
provisions of s. 645, subs. (1) and (2), of the Code which read as follows:

645. (1) Where an enactment prescribes
different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the
punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the
enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits
the offence.

(2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment
in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the
limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that
convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum
punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.

He pointed out that the trial judge had a choice
not only of degrees of punishment but of kinds of punishment and if the trial
judge chose to adopt imprisonment as the kind of punishment which he should
assess then s. 234 (a) of the Code provided no minimum for such
imprisonment. Dubin J.A. concluded that s. 234  (a) did not
prescribe a minimum sentence and the provisions of s. 662.1(1)  were available.

I am of the opinion that it is not necessary to
weigh the various penalties prescribed by s. 234 (a) of the Code
or attempt to arrange them in a hierarchy or order.

I turn to consider the exact words of s. 662.1
(1) , i.e., “other than an offence for which a minimum punishment
is prescribed by law”. (The emphasis is my own.) Certainly s. 234 (a)
does prescribe a minimum penalty, that is, a fine of fifty dollars. It
might prescribe an alternative form of penalty and fail to prescribe a minimum
for that other kind but it has none the less prescribed a minimum penalty.

Dubin J.A., in his reasons for judgment,
carefully reviewed the history of the enactment of the

[Page 167]

provisions for conditional discharge and also
for suspension and came to the conclusion that when the exact same phrase, i.e.,
“other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by
law”, was inserted in s. 663 dealing with suspension of sentence at the time
when such provisions as to suspension were to permit suspensions to be granted
to other than first offenders, it would not be proper to imply that Parliament
had, at the same time, removed the right to grant suspension to those who had
been found guilty of impaired driving for the first time. He said that since
the words in s. 663 as to suspension of sentence were exactly the same words as
in s. 662.1 (1) , it should not be considered that Parliament had not intended
to permit a discharge of those found guilty for the first time of impaired
driving. With all respect, I am of the opinion that these sections do not
permit a court to come to this conclusion. It might well be that when
Parliament extended the provisions as to suspension of sentence to those who
had had more than one previous conviction and granted the additional right to
find guilt and give a discharge, it also concluded these ameliorating
provisions should not apply to first convictions for impaired driving.

We were informed by counsel for the Crown that
the wording of s. 234(a) is found only in that section and the
accompanying sections dealing with alcohol-related driving offences and
such offences have been for some years the very serious concern of Parliament.
I think also there is very considerable weight to the submission made by
counsel for the Crown that a discharge either absolute or conditional in form
after a person has been found guilty of a first offence of impaired driving
might permit that person to avoid the compulsory terms of imprisonment set out
in paras. (b) and (c) of s. 234 when convicted of

[Page 168]

subsequent like offences.

Section 592, subs. (1) and (2) of the Criminal
Code  provide:

592. (1) Where an accused is convicted of
an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous
convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposed upon him by reason thereof
unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that the accused, before making his
plea, was notified that a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.

(2) Where an accused is convicted of an
offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous
convictions, the court shall, upon application by the prosecutor and upon being
satisfied that the accused was notified in accordance with subsection (1),
ask the accused whether he was previously convicted and, if he does not admit
that he was previously convicted, evidence of previous convictions may be
adduced.

To comply with those sections, the Crown would
have to give notice and cite a previous conviction. If the penalty assessed
upon the accused being found guilty on the first occasion was a discharge then
the Crown could not cite a conviction. It is possible that the Crown could
submit a request that the compulsory jail term be imposed by not giving the
notice required by s. 692 but merely by proving the finding of guilt and the
granting of a discharge which occurred on the first occasion, but that result
would entail the accused upon a second or subsequent occasion being given the
compulsory jail term without having been served with a notice of the Crown's
intention to apply for such a sentence. It would not seem to be a sound
interpretation of the provisions of the Code to permit such a procedure.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
direct that the matter be remitted to the Provincial Court Judge for the entry
of a conviction and the imposition of a sentence.

Appeal allowed, remitted to the Provincial Court Judge for the entry
of a conviction and the imposition of a sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Expert
evidence—Psychiatric opinion—Admissibility—Examination of accused at instance
of Crown without notice or court order—Criminal Code , ss. 465 (c), 543 , 608.2 .

Appellant was arrested on February 1, 1973,
and held in custody. At the request of the Crown a number of psychiatrists
examined the accused at various dates all a considerable time prior to the
preliminary hearing. There was no judicial determination that such examination
should be permitted and it appeared that on the dates in question appellant was
not represented by counsel although he had been interviewed by duty counsel
under the provisions of the Ontario Legal Aid Scheme. At trial the judge
admitted the evidence of these psychiatrists when they were called to testify
in reply as witnesses for the Crown. The Court of Appeal decided inter alia that
the trial judge had not erred in admitting this evidence and dismissed the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

As was said in the Court of Appeal, while it
would be preferable for the Crown to seek a Court order for psychiatric
examination of an accused under arrest and to advise defence counsel, where
applicable, of their intention to have such examination, the Crown’s failure so
to do is not by itself a basis for the exclusion of the psychiatric evidence.
As there does not appear to be a provision in the Criminal Code  or
elsewhere which would authorize a court to give an order for examination of an
accused in the circumstances of his confinement in the Toronto Jail all a court
can do is to express regret that no such provision exists and that therefore no
Court order had been obtained.

R. v. Lafrance
(1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 22, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[1] for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a 

[Page 14]

conviction by Donnelly J., with a jury, of
capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

Arthur Maloney, Q.C., and Clare E. Lewis,
for the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
pronounced on January 25, 1974,
wherein that Court dismissed an appeal by the accused from his conviction on
October 1, 1973, at a trial before Donnelly J. and a jury of the offence of
capital murder. The judgment of the Court of Appeal has since been reported in
(1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 137. That report contains a very detailed account of all
the circumstances and I, therefore, do not intend to repeat them in these
reasons.

After counsel for the accused had presented his
argument before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that Court called upon counsel for the Crown to argue only grounds
of appeal which counsel for the accused had, in his notice of appeal,
designated as grounds 1, 2 and 5.

In this Court, after counsel for the appellant
(the accused) had presented his argument, the Court called upon counsel for the
Crown to reply only on ground of appeal 1. This ground of appeal, as set out in
the appellant’s notice of appeal to this Court, was as follows:

THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO
ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE WAS CORRECT IN ADMITTING THE
EVIDENCE OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN REPLY AS WITNESSES FOR THE
CROWN.

Ground of appeal No. 1 before the Court of
Appeal for Ontario was cited in
the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario as follows:

THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING
THE EVIDENCE OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN REPLY AS WITNESSES FOR
THE CROWN.

[Page 15]

It will be seen that it is exactly the same
ground of appeal.

I have carefully perused the reasons given by
Gale C.J.O. for the dismissal of this ground of appeal. I am in complete agreement
with them and have very little to add. There is one matter, however, upon which
I feel it only proper to express concern.

The appellant, after his arrest on February 1,
1973, was, of course, held in custody. He appeared in police court in the City
of Toronto on February 2, 1973, and on February 9, 1973, for
remand. On each of those occasions, he was taken by detectives of the Toronto
Police Department to be interviewed by a solicitor who was the designated duty
counsel present under the provisions of the Ontario Legal Aid scheme. There is
no other indication of any kind that until after the examinations by Crown
psychiatrists, to which I shall refer, the appellant consulted or retained any
other legal counsel. The duties of the duty counsel under the provisions of the
Ontario Legal Aid scheme are set out in Reg. 557 (R.R.O. 1970) under The
Legal Aid Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 239, and I quote paras. 69 and 89 of such
regulations:

69. Where a person has been taken into
custody or summoned and charged with an offence, he may obtain before any
appearance to the charge the assistance of duty counsel who shall,

(a) advise him of his rights
and take such steps as the circumstances require to protect his rights,
including representing him on an application for remand or adjournment or for
bail or on the entering of a plea of guilty and making representations with
respect to sentence where a plea of guilty is entered;

89. The customary solicitor and client
relationship shall exist between a solicitor and his client.

The Crown called in reply the following
professional witnesses:

Dr. Joseph Thomas Marotta, who testified that on September 5, 1973, he had seen the appellant at the request of Dr. Davidson, a
psychiatrist who had testified on behalf of the defence, and that he had
conducted an EEG examination of the appel-

[Page 16]

lant which examination revealed no abnormality
of any description. It is to be noted that this witness had performed his
service at the request of the defence and I am not dealing further with his evidence.

Dr. Peter Watts Rowsell, who testified that he examined the accused February 9, 1973, at the
Don Jail in Toronto. This
examination was made at the request of counsel for the Crown. There is nothing
to show that the accused had any notice that he was to be so examined nor was
anyone who in any way represented him consulted. Dr. Rowsell gave expert
opinion evidence as to the mental condition of the appellant.

Dr. David Lang Common, the consultant psychiatrist at the Toronto Jail, examined the
appellant at the Toronto Jail on February 12, 1973. He testified that upon seeing the appellant, he introduced himself
and said “I am Dr. Common. I am the jail psychiatrist and I have been asked by
Mr. Whitehead, the superintendent, to examine you”, to which the appellant
replied, “What! Do I have to see another psychiatrist? There is nothing wrong
with me”. Again, there is no evidence that there was any previous notice to the
appellant that such examination would take place nor was anyone consulted on
behalf of the appellant. Again, the witness, Dr. Common, gave expert opinion
evidence as to the mental condition of the appellant.

Dr. Andrew Ian Malcolm examined the appellant on February 10, 1973, in the Don Jail. This
examination was also made at the request of the Crown and Dr. Malcolm reported
immediately to Crown counsel. Again, there is nothing in the evidence that the
appellant had any notice of such examination or that anyone was consulted on
behalf of the appellant.

All of these examinations took place a considerable
time before the appellant appeared on preliminary hearing and there was no kind
of judicial determination whatsoever that such examination should be permitted.
Since it would appear that at the time the examinations took place the
appellant was not in fact represented by counsel, there was no legal
representative with whom the counsel for the Crown could confer.

[Page 17]

It was the submission of counsel for the accused
to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to this Court that under these circumstances the learned trial
judge should have refused to permit these three last-named witnesses to give
evidence and that a court order should have been obtained on notice prior to
such examinations taking place.

Gale C.J.O., in his reasons for judgment, said:

Although this Court has already pointed out
that it would be preferable for the Crown to seek a Court order for
psychiatrists’ examination of an accused under arrest, and when the accused has
retained counsel to advise defence counsel of their proposal to have a
psychiatrists’ examination of the accused, the Crown’s failure to do so is not
by itself a basis for excluding that evidence.

As I have said, I am in agreement with the
reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario including that statement.

The learned Chief Justice was referring to the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Lafrance[2],
where speaking for the Court, he said:

Complaint was taken that he ought not to
have been so examined without notice to his counsel, or without an order of the
Court. We agree that it would have been better to have had the concurrence of
counsel, or an order of the Court, although in this respect we must point out
that Crown counsel did in fact attempt to obtain the permission of defence
counsel, but went ahead with the examinations when he could not reach him.
However, the evidence was not inadmissible, and we think the learned Judge
could not be said to have exercised his discretion incorrectly, if one was
available to him, in permitting that evidence to be introduced. In this
connection we have in mind the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Wray, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 1, 11 D.L.R. (3d) 673, [1971] S.C.R. 272.
For these reasons the appeal will be dismissed.

It is noteworthy that in the Lafrance case
the examination by the psychiatrist to which defence counsel took objection was
made while the accused had been confined in the mental hospital at Pene-

[Page 18]

tanguishene and there may have been some
jurisdiction for a court to make an order under those circumstances. In the
circumstances in the present case, the accused was confined in the Toronto
Jail. I have been unable to discover any provision in the Criminal Code  or
elsewhere which would authorize some court to give an order for his examination.

It must be remembered that these examinations
took place prior to the preliminary inquiry and it would appear that in the
opinion of the Crown counsel it was necessary in the due administration of
justice to have these psychiatric examinations at that time. Counsel for the
appellant referred to s. 465  (c), s. 543  and s. 608.2  of the Criminal
Code , but reference to these actions indicates that they are all concerned
with a later period when the accused was at preliminary inquiry, at trial, or
before the Court of Appeal, and I am of the opinion that they are quite
inapplicable to the circumstances in the present appeal.

The interest of the accused in the issue of
whether he should be subject to psychiatric examination and in the form and
content of that examination is, of course, evident. It would appear that a
provision whereby there could be an application made to a designated judicial
officer upon notice to an accused person for an order permitting such
examination would be a proper provision in the protection of the rights and
interests of an accused person. If notice of such an application were given to
an accused person, then the accused person would be in the position where he
could immediately seek advice from a solicitor in reference thereto and would
result in either the retaining of such a solicitor or seeking the services of
legal aid under the various provincial plans. At the present time, it would
seem that all a court can do is to express regret that no court order had been
obtained without being able to point out how such a court order could be
obtained. In the present circumstances, as I have said, I am of the opinion
that the appeal could not succeed.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Capital
murder—Evidence—Admissibility without a voir dire of previous testimony given
by the accused at the preliminary inquiry of an accomplice—Admissibility of
evidence of a similar act—Evidence of mistreatment by the
police—Self-defence—Instructions to the jury—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 17 and 619(a)—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10,
s. 5(2).

The appeal is against a decision of the Court
of Appeal of Quebec dismissing
the appeal against a verdict of guilty of capital murder.

There are two main versions of the murder and
of the circumstances preceding and following it. The first version, which tends
to incriminate appellant, was given by him at the preliminary inquiry of an accomplice,
without objection and without requesting the protection of the law. The second
version was given by appellant at his trial. The relevant difference between
the two versions concerns the element of planning: according to the second
version, appellant was caught up in a misadventure which he could not have
foreseen, and in which he took no part except after the murder and under
compulsion. Appellant objects to the admission into evidence of his first
version, alleging that this testimony was extorted from him by threats and
violence. He claims that at his request the presiding judge should have
ascertained by a voir dire that this testimony was free and voluntary
before admitting it in evidence, since the courts have held only that it is
presumed to be free and voluntary.

Appellant also objects to evidence of similar
acts, admitted on rebuttal after a voir dire despite his objections.
Shortly after showing police the location of the grave of the victim of the
murder with which he was charged, appellant directed them to a second grave
where another body had been discovered by accident several days before. More
specifically, appellant claims that this evidence that he knew the location of
the second grave created the suspicion that he had participated in the second
murder. He maintains that even if this evidence were admisssible the presiding
judge

[Page 333]

should have exercised his discretion to
exclude it, because of the damage it caused him, as he did with the evidence of
appellant’s participation in the second murder provided by his testimony at the
Coroner’s inquest regarding the second body, evidence which the Crown also
wanted to present.

Appellant claims to have been denied the
right to a full and complete defence. He objects to the limits which the judge
imposed on the evidence he wished to introduce to persuade the jury to doubt
the probative effect of his first version (which he says was not free and
voluntary because at the time he was under the influence of violence and
threats inflicted on him by the police), by calling witnesses to testify that
they had also been mistreated by the police. The presiding judge allowed this
evidence if it dealt with mistreatment inflicted in the presence of appellant
or to his knowledge, or which was reported to him by the police or others, but
ruled it inadmissible in the case of the mistreatment, if any, which was
inflicted on others without appellant’s knowledge. It is this limitation to
which appellant objects. Appellant also alleges that the judge lacked composure
in presiding over the trial and objects to the aggressiveness of counsel for
the Crown.

Appellant argues in addition that
self-defence should have been submitted to the jury for consideration, and
alleges, finally, that the trial judge gave his opinion on the facts in his
charge to the jury and thereby influenced the verdict.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Appellant’s testimony at the preliminary
inquiry of an accomplice is admissible in evidence at his trial without a voir
dire. The testimony in question was an earlier judicial statement given
under oath, under compulsion of the law and by authority of the court, and the
jury remains free to assess its probative value in view of all the evidence, in
particular of the alleged illegal compulsion. The courts have long made a
distinction between statements made by an accused out of court to persons in
authority and those made in a judicial proceeding. Unlike the former, the
latter do not require the procedure of voir dire, whether or not they
were made under oath or under compulsion of the law and by authority of the
court. Appellant did not succeed in demonstrating the existence of a refutable
presumption that they were free and voluntary or that such a presumption could
be attacked. A witness may request the protection of the law at the time of his
testimony, but he may not do so after the event and this would be the effect of
withdrawal following a voir dire

[Page 334]

In accordance with well-established
principles governing the admissibility of this type of evidence, the evidence
of a similar act admitted by the presiding judge was admissible because the
similarity between the two murders tended to show a system. The prosecution had
to prove premeditation and guilty intent, and this is precisely what a
systematic course of action tends to establish. The testimony given by
appellant at the Coroner’s inquest into the second murder was also admissible
in principle since appellant had testified without requesting the protection of
the law and since nothing showed that appellant had at that time been charged
with the second murder. The presiding judge excluded it, exercising the
discretion recognized in Noor Mohamed v. R., [1949] A.C. 182, and Kuruma v.
R., [1955] A.C. 197, as they were interpreted at the time, but he
would have committed no error in law and would not have abused his discretion
if he had admitted this testimony. The exclusion of this evidence and the
instructions to the jury on the subject caused no prejudice to the defence.
They could only have been to its advantage, by allowing the jury to remain
ignorant of an even more incriminating piece of evidence which could have been
admitted. Appellant cannot possibly object to them.

With regard to the limits imposed on the
evidence of mistreatment by the police, the Court agrees with the trial judge
and the majority in the Court of Appeal that the use, if any, of other
repressive methods unknown to the accused could not have influenced the
testimony he gave at the preliminary inquiry of an accomplice, and that
evidence of this mistreatment was not relevant. Moreover, if four witnesses’
consistent testimony on this question did not change the jury’s verdict,
additional testimony would certainly not have had that effect except by
ultimately turning attention away from the primary issue by simple
accumulation.

The complaint regarding a lack of composure
on the. part of the presiding judge is not a serious one. With regard to the
aggressiveness of counsel for the Crown, it appears that the intemperate
language on both sides did not affect the jury. With regard to self-defence, in
the case at bar the judge would have erred if he had directed the jury to
consider it. Finally, there was nothing unlawful or irregular in the
instructions to the jury.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1]
dismissing an appeal from a conviction for capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

Bernard Lamarche and Michel Denis, for
the appellant.

François Tremblay, for the respondent.

The judgement of the Court was delivered by

BEETZ J.—The appeal, based on s. 619 (a)
of the Criminal Code , is against a unanimous decision of the Court of
Appeal of Quebec, which dismissed the appeal brought by appellant against the
verdict of guilty pronounced against him by a jury of the Court of Queen’s
Bench at Quebec City on November 2, 1967, on the following charge:

[TRANSLATION] On or about September 18,
1965, near St-Etienne, in the district of Quebec City, Ovila Boulet, having
planned the said murder, unlawfully and deliberately killed Albéric Bilodeau,
thereby committing capital murder, contrary to ss. 201 , 202A(2) , 206(1)  and 21 
of the Criminal Code .

[Page 336]

Appellant was condemned to death but his
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.

I. The evidence

It is useful to mention at the outset that four
persons were involved in this case: Jean-Jacques Gagnon, who according to his
own testimony fired at the victim; appellant, who again according to his own
testimony was an eyewitness to the murder and helped conceal the victim’s body,
clothing, car and other evidence; André Lamothe, occasional employer of
appellant: according to one version, Lamothe was also a witness to the murder,
while according to other versions he returned to Quebec City before the death
of the victim; and Fernand Quirion, also an occasional associate or employee of
Lamothe: he arranged a meeting with the victim and saw him the day before and
on the day of the murder, but was not present when it occurred.

The victim’s body was found on October 2, 1965
as a result of directions given by appellant, who led the police to the
location, within a swampy woodland, at Gosford road, Saint-Gilles, Lotbinière
County. The grave in which the body was buried was about seventy-five feet from
the road. It was covered by branches. The body was in a more advanced state of
decomposition than could be explained by the two weeks it had been in the
ground: an alkaline substance, probably caustic soda, which when activated by
water dissolves fats and turns them into soap, had been poured into the grave.
In the neck area of the body doctors found a.32 calibre bullet which had been
fired from in front. The bullet had been fired from a revolver which the police
found buried elsewhere, in Ham-Sud, and which, as appears to be uncontested, was
the weapon used to kill Bilodeau; it was a.32 calibre gold-plated revolver. The
body was identified by the fingerprint of the only remaining finger. The victim
was Albéric Bilodeau, of Sainte-Marie de Beauce, a church building painter.

Albéric Bilodeau had previously been the owner
of a hotel which had burned down. Jean-Jacques

[Page 337]

Gagnon admitted under questioning that he had
conspired with Bilodeau to set fire to the hotel. Appellant also admitted, on
cross-examination, that he had pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiring with
Jean-Jacques Gagnon to burn Bilodeau’s hotel.

There are two main versions of the murder and of
the circumstances preceding and following it. The first version is the one
given by appellant on December 2, 1965 at André Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry.
After ascertaining that appellant had given testimony without objecting to
answering on the grounds that his answers could tend to incriminate him, and
without requesting the protection of the law, the presiding judge admitted this
testimony in evidence despite the objections of counsel for the appellant, who
requested a voir dire, because he alleged that this testimony had been
extorted from appellant by violence and threats. The second version is that
which appellant gave at his trial.

According to the first version, Lamothe,
Quirion, Gagnon and appellant met at Lamothe’s home on Friday evening,
September 17, 1965. Gagnon and Quirion had just seen Bilodeau with the purpose
of urging him to deny the statements which he had presumably made to
investigators regarding the burning of his hotel. An offer of $5,000 to
Bilodeau to buy his silence or a retraction of the statements was discussed;
they were to meet with him again. Appellant spent the night in his car in front
of Lamothe’s house. The next morning, September 18, appellant went back to
his home in Cap-Rouge, returned to Quebec City to buy some heating oil and went
to Lamothe’s house. Fernand Quirion came to tell Lamothe and appellant that the
meeting was set for two o’clock in the afternoon. One Roger Arsenault, an
employee of Lamothe, gave the latter a gold-plated revolver and some
cartridges. Lamothe and appellant went to appellant’s house in Lamothe’s
Cadillac. Lamothe borrowed a bucket from appellant, filled it with caustic
soda and put it with a shovel into the trunk of his car.—The bucket and the
shovel were entered as exhibits at the trial.—Lamothe also put a jug of water
from his house in the trunk.

[Page 338]

A little later, Lamothe and appellant went to
meet Gagnon and Quirion. They crossed the Quebec City bridge and went toward
the Hotel St-Henri in Scott together, in Lamothe’s and Quirion’s cars; they
stopped a couple of miles from the hotel. At about two p.m. Quirion went to the
hotel to see whether Bilodeau was there. He was not. Quirion telephoned
Bilodeau’s home; he was out. Finally, they saw Bilodeau in his car going
towards the hotel, accompanied by someone else. Appellant remarked:

[TRANSLATION] “He is bringing a witness. It
could be the police… Don’t go”.

Gagnon
replied:

“One witness more or less doesn’t make any
difference to me”.

and:

“It doesn’t matter whether you get rid of
one or two”.

Lamothe gave the loaded revolver to Gagnon.
Gagnon and Quirion went to the hotel in Quirion’s car. Lamothe and appellant
waited in Lamothe’s car. Quirion came back alone to inform them that Gagnon and
Bilodeau had taken the St-Lambert’s road, and then he left them. Lamothe and
appellant, in Lamothe’s car, caught up to and followed Bilodeau’s car, in which
he was riding alone with Gagnon. The cars stopped on a secondary road.
Appellant heard two shots. He went to Bilodeau’s car and saw Bilodeau’s body on
the front seat. After this point, appellant states that he acted under the
influence of threats from Lamothe and Gagnon. He took the wheel and Gagnon sat
in the back seat. He followed Lamothe’s car to the Saint-Gilles woods. They
carried Bilodeau’s body into the woods. Appellant undressed the body and buried
it after pouring caustic soda into the grave. He did not need to use the jug of
water since the ground was wet. Lamothe and Gagnon left him alone to finish
this job; they went to try to dispose of Bilodeau’s car, which was
blood-stained. Lamothe and Gagnon returned in Lamothe’s car to get appellant.
Appellant brought Bilodeau’s clothing and personal effects and the shovel and
bucket. Along the way, they threw out Bilodeau’s watch, ring and wedding ring.
The clothing was burned later by appellant, at his home, with Gag-

[Page 339]

non’s clothing. Appellant learned from Lamothe
and Gagnon that Bilodeau’s car had run out of gas. Appellant and Gagnon went to
buy gas. In Bilodeau’s and appellant’s cars they went toward Plessisville. On
another secondary road they set fire to Bilodeau’s car with some heating oil.
They had previously removed the licence plates from the car. On the way back,
Gagnon folded the plates and threw them onto the road. These plates were later
found by the police. That evening, Lamothe gave the revolver to appellant and
asked him to put it away. Appellant hid the revolver under his neighbour’s
cottage.

In this testimony, appellant maintained that he
had not known Bilodeau before the incident.

The other version of events was given by
appellant in his defence at his trial. The following is a summary of it.
Appellant did not see Lamothe, Gagnon or Quirion on Friday, September 17, 1965.
He followed them, for no particular reason, on September 18, and with them he
met Bilodeau, whom he did not know, near the Hotel St-Henri in Scott. After
Lamothe and Quirion left, he went with Gagnon and Bilodeau in Bilodeau’s car,
at Gagnon’s request. Gagnon and Bilodeau talked business but appellant only
listened absentmindedly to their discussion. Gagnon and Bilodeau quarrelled.
They decided to stop to urinate by the side of the road. The three men got out.
Bilodeau went toward the trunk of his car, which he opened on the pretext of
getting out some bottles of beer. Bilodeau grabbed a rifle which he pointed at
Gagnon. Gagnon pushed the rifle barrel away which went off hitting no one. Gagnon
pulled out a revolver and fired several times at Bilodeau, who fell dead.
Gagnon and appellant placed the body on the front seat. Appellant advised
Gagnon to report the matter to the police. They went back toward the trunk of
Bilodeau’s car and discovered in it a shovel and a bucket of caustic soda.
There was also another rifle in the car. Gagnon said “He had everything
prepared to kill me; we’ll use it on him.” Gagnon threatened appellant. He told
him

[Page 340]

they had to find a wooded place. They covered a
distance of eight or nine miles, to the St‑Gilles woods. Appellant helped
Gagnon to carry Bilodeau’s body into the woods and removed the clothing from
it. Gagnon buried Bilodeau. Gagnon and appellant then went to get rid of
Bilodeau’s car by setting fire to it. The rest of this testimony is
substantially the same as the first statement made by appellant, except that he
stated that he did not know what Gagnon did with the revolver. Appellant stated
that the shovel and bucket produced as exhibits, which were found at his house
and which he had at first identified as those used to conceal Bilodeau’s body,
were not those which were in fact used for that purpose, since Gagnon had
disposed of those while returning from the St-Gilles woods. Appellant stated
that he did not know that Gagnon was armed. In short, the essence of this
second testimony and of the defence is that appellant found himself caught up
in a misadventure which he could not have foreseen, and in which he took no
part except after Bilodeau’s death and under compulsion from Gagnon. With
respect to his previous testimony, appellant says, it was a web of lies
fabricated by the police; they extracted these lies from him through violence,
including torture which they inflicted on him, and through threats including
threats on his life. The violence was inflicted on him about a month before the
testimony he gave at Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry, but the threat to inflict
the same on him again and the threats on his life were renewed the day before this
preliminary inquiry; moreover, the police had expressly told him not to refuse
to answer on the grounds that his answers could incriminate him, and not to
request the protection of the law. He did, however, request the protection of
the law, on the advice of the Crown attorney, he said, at Lamothe’s and
Gagnon’s trials.

The testimony of Jean-Jacques Gagnon and Fernand
Quirion were substantially to the same effect as appellant’s second testimony.

[Page 341]

The first and second versions of the murder differ
on two main points, of which only the second is relevant for the purposes of
the case at bar: the participation of Lamothe in the murder and the planning.
The first version, if believed, is overwhelmingly against appellant: the secret
meetings of Friday, September 17, 1965, Lamothe obtaining the revolver and
Gagnon receiving this revolver in front of appellant on September 18, the
incriminating remarks of Gagnon and appellant when they saw Bilodeau and a
witness going by, the shovel, the bucket, the caustic soda, the jug of water,
lead irresistibly to the conclusion that the murder was not only premeditated
but carefully prepared with the knowledge and assistance of appellant.

The first version was corroborated on several
points by other testimony.

Neither the defence nor the prosecution
questioned the police officers who were alleged to have mistreated and
theatened appellant. On the other hand, the prosecution attempted to discredit
appellant, Gagnon and Quirion, by bringing up their long record of convictions.

In rebuttal, the prosecution gave evidence of
similar acts. This rebuttal evidence, admitted after a voir dire despite
objections by the defence, was as follows: half or three-quarters of an hour
after showing police the grave where Albéric Bilodeau’s body was found,
appellant directed them to a second grave about a thousand feet from the first.
In this grave, pointed out by appellant, a roads worker had discovered by
accident several days before another body, nude and decomposed by a caustic
substance. The death had probably not occurred more than three months before;
the chest cavity contained two .32 calibre bullets, and the body also bore the
marks of two skull fractures. Identification was possible through a
fingerprint: it was the body of one Paul Brie. On cross-examination, appellant
admitted that he knew Paul Brie. The Crown also wished to introduce in rebuttal
the testimony appellant had given, without requesting the protection of the
law, at the inquest held by the Coroner into Paul Brie’s death. However, the
pre-

[Page 342]

siding judge refused to admit this testimony in
evidence because of the extreme prejudice it would cause to the defence. This
testimony is not in the record; according to what the presiding judge said
about it in his report to the Court of Appeal, appellant in it admitted his
participation in Brie’s murder and stated that it was he who had buried Brie.
The presiding judge allowed the defence to contradict the rebuttal evidence
with further evidence, but warned it that if appellant testified regarding the
second grave he exposed himself to cross‑examination. The defence stated
that its case was closed.

I would add in concluding this summary of the
evidence that, during cross-examination of Gagnon, a third body was mentioned,
found buried in Ham-Sud. It was in Ham-Sud that the police found the
gold-plated revolver. The Crown attorney showed Gagnon a photograph showing
Gagnon above Chandonnet’s grave and read him an extract from earlier testimony,
in which Gagnon had said that he had shot Chandonnet. Gagnon replied that this
testimony was extracted from him by torture and denied having killed
Chandonnet. The part of the statement Gagnon made in court regarding Chandonnet
was given under protection of the law.

II. Arguments in support of the appeal

1. Appellant’s first argument is that the
presiding judge should have ascertained by a voir dire, before admitting
in evidence the accused’s testimony at André Lamothe’s preliminary hearing,
that this testimony was voluntary. According to counsel for the appellant, the
courts have held only that previous testimony is presumed to be free and
voluntary, but this is a presumption which it is open to the accused to rebut
in a procedure comprising several stages:

[TRANSLATION] (a) the Crown moves for the
judge to decide on the admissibility of the statement after a voir dire;

(b) the Crown then puts in evidence that
the accused has made a statement in court;

[Page 343]

(c) the Crown gives evidence on a voir
dire to show that s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  does not
apply to the said statement;

(d) when the Crown has established these
facts, the judge must ask the accused whether he has any defence to offer
before the judge rules on the admissibility of the statement;

(e) if the accused presents no defence on
the voir dire, his statement is then admitted in evidence;

(f) if the accused presents evidence and
succeeds in raising a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of his
statement, the judge must refuse to admit it in evidence.

Appellant’s factum, at pp. 18-19.

The courts have long made a distinction between
statements made by the accused out of court to persons in authority and those
which are made in a judicial proceeding. The first are admitted in evidence
once the presiding judge has decided alone, without the jury, after a voir
dire, that they were freely and voluntarily made, the onus of proving these
conditions being on the prosecution: R. v. Warickshall[2]; Rex v. Baldry[3]; Ibrahim v. Rex[4]; Piché v. The Queen[5]; Powell v. The Queen[6]. This Court has nevertheless held
that statements made to a person in authority are not inadmissible merely
because they are required by law: (Walker v. The Queen[7]); other courts have, however, ruled
that the obligation imposed by law to make a statement out of court does not
exempt the prosecution from showing on a voir dire that the statement
was not obtained by a constraint other than that of the law: Reg. v.
Cleaveley[8] and
Reg. v. Fex[9]. This
Court did not deal with the question, at least not expressly, in Marshall v.
The Queen[10].

[Page 344]

The situation is different for statements made
by the accused during a judicial proceeding. Some such statements are not made
under oath. This is true, for example, with statements made after a warning,
following a preliminary inquiry, by a person committed for voluntary
examination. It is also true of guilty pleas. The courts have generally held
that statements of this type are admissible in evidence because they are given
voluntarily: Wig-more, On Evidence (3rd edition), Vol. 3, at pp. 298 to
302; Rex v. Lambe[11] Rex
v. James[12]; Rex
v. Bahrey[13]. In
the last case, however, the accused had inadvertently been placed under oath: Reg.
v. Dietrich[14].
Nevertheless, evidence of a guilty plea withdrawn with leave of the court is
inadmissible in a subsequent proceeding: Thibodeau v. The Queen[15].

With respect to statements previously made under
oath by the accused during a judicial proceeding, there is a relative abundance
of longstanding precedents which has consistently held them to be admissible
without evidence that they were made voluntarily. These statements are of two
types: either the law did not require the accused to make them, or they were
given under compulsion of law. Examples of the first type are found in Reg.
v. Coote[16] and
in Reg. v. Brown (No. 2)[17]. In
Coote, the Judicial Committee ruled that a statement that Coote, who was
accused of arson, had made previously without objection before the Fire
Commissioner was admissible. At that time, before enactment of the Canada
Evidence Act , the common law principles by which a witness could refuse to
answer on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him were
followed. If a witness agreed to reply to certain questions when he could have
refused to answer for this reason—and, according to the Coote decision,
at p. 605, Coote had in fact refused to reply to several questions—it
could then be said that his testimony was voluntary in the sense that his
answers were

[Page 345]

not given under compulsion of law. In Brown the
accused, charged with murder, was found guilty of manslaughter in a first
trial, but a new trial was ordered by this Court. The issue was whether the
accused’s testimony at the first trial was admissible in evidence at the
second. This Court held that it was, reversing a majority decision of the Court
of Appeal of the Northwest Territories and declaring itself in agreement “in
substance” with the reasons of Johnson J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal.
The accused Brown was not required to testify at his first trial; because he
had chosen to do so, his testimony could be considered voluntary. For a similar
conclusion, see also the following cases: Reg. v. Connolly and McGreevy[18]; Rex v. Deakin (No. 2)[19]; Rex v. Drew (No. 2)[20]; Marcotte v. Rex[21]; John McGregor v. Reg.[22]

In support of the first argument counsel for the
appellant cited, inter alia, two passages from Coote and Brown,
which in his submission tend to show that the authorities only presume
that previous testimony of the accused is voluntary:

Coote, at
p. 607:

…the depositions on Oath of a Witness
legally taken are evidence against him, should he be subsequently tried on a
criminal charge, except so much of them as consist of answers to questions to
which he has objected as tending to criminate him, but which he has been
improperly compelled to answer. The exception depends upon the principle “nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare,” but does not apply to answers given
without objection, which are to be deemed voluntary. (Italics are mine.)

Brown, at
pp. 102 and 103:

It is also argued that the rules applicable
to confessions apply to this testimony. It is said that the evidence of the
accused during cross-examination

[Page 346]

could not be said to be voluntarily given.
Confessions obtained by cross‑examination by a person in authority
outside courts have frequently been excluded as not being voluntary; no such
rule has been applied to evidence taken in court. Lord Russell C.J., referring
to, and adopting the Scott case, supra, said (Regina v.
Erdheim, (1896) 2 Q.B., 260 at 267, 18 Cox C.C. 355):

“As to the objection that the statements
were not voluntary, it was held that such an objection does not apply to a
lawful examination in the course of a judicial proceeding.”

It is difficult to see logic in saying that
although the accused may voluntarily give evidence in his own behalf his
evidence assumes the nature of an admission or confession given under
compulsion when cross-examination begins.

…

In the United States, where the power to
grant new trials is pretty general, the practice of admitting such evidence is
well established. In Massachusetts in 1877 Endicott J., speaking for the
Supreme Judicial Court (Commonwealth v. Reynolds (1877), 122 Mass. 454,
at 458) said:

“The statements made by the defendant while
testifying at a former trial were competent, either as admissions or for the
purpose of contradicting him. They were voluntary statements, in regard
to his connection with the transaction, and it is immaterial where or when they
were made”. (Italics are mine.)

In my opinion, these two passages in no way show
the existence of the presumption and the necessity for the procedure which we
are asked to recognize. They mean simply that Coote’s replies and Brown’s
testimony were given voluntarily because the law did not require them to be
given, which is an additional reason to subsequently admit them in
evidence; the primary reason is that these were statements under oath and given
in court, and not confessions. This primary reason is especially apparent in Brown,
where Johnson J.A. refers to the requirement of cross-examination once the
accused has submitted to examination,

[Page 347]

and in R. v. Scott[23], where the accused, charged with
having falsified his books, was confronted by the testimony which he had
previously been forced to give under the Bankruptcy Act.

Scott laid down
the principle that a statement made under oath by the accused during an earlier
judicial proceeding is admissible in evidence against him although it was
obtained under compulsion of the law and by authority of the court. This is the
position of appellant’s statement during Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry. Scott
is even more persuasive in that the witness did not even have the
protection now available under s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  against
subsequent use of his testimony; he was deprived of any protection. The courts
have invariably followed this decision, and clearly it has been followed a
fortiori since the law of evidence was amended to permit the witness to
protect himself against subsequent use of an incriminating statement which he
is compelled to make: Reg. v. Bateman[24]
(admission of a statement made by the accused at a coroner’s inquest); Reg.
v. Hillam[25]
(admission of a statement made by the accused under the compulsion of the Bankruptcy
Act, 1869); R. v. Clark[26] (admission
of a statement made by the accused in testifying at the trial of another
accused); Rex v. Lunan[27] (admission
testimony given by the accused when he was examined under oath by a royal
commission of inquiry); Rex v. Mazerall[28]
(as in Lunan); Tass v. The King[29] (admission of a statement by the
accused testifying at the preliminary inquiry of another accused).

To offset this consistent line of authority,
which is not compatible with the first argument, counsel for the appellant could
not refer this Court to a single decision, English or Canadian, in which

[Page 348]

before admitting in evidence the previous
testimony of the accused a voir dire was held with respect to the
voluntariness of the testimony, or the testimony was declared inadmissible. I
myself found only one decision which appeared to incline toward the first
argument, Wahlberg v. The Queen[30]:
in that case the Court of Appeal of Quebec excluded the statement made by
the accused before the Fire Commissioner; the text of this decision is hardly
more explicit than the summary published in the reports, and it disposes of the
statement at the same time as a confession. The three principal findings read
as follows:

CONSIDERING that evidence was permitted by
the trial judge of admissions or a confession made by Appellant to a police
officer while under constructive detention, and before the Fire Commissioner;
and

CONSIDERING that the circumstances in which
the said confession was obtained give rise to the gravest doubt as to the
voluntary nature of the confession, which doubt the Crown failed to dispel; and

CONSIDERING further that no warning was at
any time given to Appellant that his statements might be used in evidence; and

CONSIDERING therefore that the said
evidence and confession were illegally admitted;

This isolated decision is not conclusive,
because the Court of Appeal did not discuss the question. When the opportunity
was again provided for that Court to discuss it, it decided the opposite: in
the case at bar and Lamothe v. The Queen[31]; in the latter case appellant,
convicted of the murder of Henri-Paul Chandonnet, objected that the presiding
judge had admitted the statement made by Lamothe at the Coroner’s inquest
without a voir dire. The Court of Appeal held that a voir dire was
not necessary and that Lamothe’s previous testimony could be used against him
because Lamothe had testified without requesting the protection of the law. I
would add that, in Tass, the accused had expressly pleaded that it was
necessary to hold a voir dire with respect to the volun-

[Page 349]

tariness of the testimony which he had
previously given; this plea was dismissed, as is clear not from the decision of
this Court but from that of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba: Rex v. Tass[32], at pp. 393 and 399. This ground
was also expressly relied on without success in Lunan and Mazerall. Finally,
in R. v. Drouin[33], a
judge sitting alone admitted in evidence, without holding a voir dire and
despite the objections of the defence, the confessions made by the accused
persons under oath before the Fire Commissioner, and then, deciding as a jury,
he set these confessions aside because he did not think that they met the
requirements of a voluntary statement, and he acquitted the accused. This
Court, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec, dismissed the
Crown’s appeal: the questions of the admissibility of evidence and of its
probative effect are two distinct questions, one of law and the other of fact;
the trial judge ruled the accused’s judicial confessions under oath admissible,
and so it remained only to weigh the probative effect of the confessions, a
question of fact which did not give jurisdiction to this Court. This Court did
not have to decide the point, but it in no way implied that the trial judge had
erred in admitting the judicial confessions of the accused in evidence without
a voir dire.

In my opinion, it is an error to contend that
the law presumes that the accused’s previous statement was voluntary. Either
the accused was not a compellable witness and his testimony was in that sense
freely given, or he was compellable, and in that case he was not free because
he had to answer or be found guilty of contempt of court. However, whether he
testified freely or not he was not free as to his answers: he had to
tell the truth or risk being charged with perjury. That is why it is never
necessary to hold a voir dire with respect to the voluntariness of a
previous statement of the accused given in court.

However, it will be said that in all these
cases, except Drouin, Wahlberg and Lamothe, there was only a
legitimate constraint provided by law and

[Page 350]

imposed by authority of the court. It is still
conceivable for an accused to be exposed, prior to the first testimony, to
unlawful constraint, to threats, to mistreatment which may have caused him not
to tell the truth—because, if he did tell the truth, it was because of his
oath—or not to seek the protection of the law, thereby risking
self-incrimination. Would it not be proper, if the accused requested it, to
hold a voir dire which would allow him to prove that unlawful constraint
vitiated this first testimony to the point where it should not be used against
the accused?

I do not believe so. In my opinion, several
considerations make the accused’s previous testimony admissible as of right,
even if its voluntariness is disputed in the sense that it is allegedly
affected by unlawful constraint.

A statement in court carries more objective
guarantees and involves more important consequences than a mere extra-judicial
confession to a person in authority. It is given in open court and there is
generally no reason to doubt that it in fact was made and was reported
accurately. It is received by a judge who, it must be assumed, has done his
duty and safeguarded the integrity of the proceedings over which he is
presiding. The constraint, if any, cannot be physical and immediate. The
witness may request the protection of the judge who is hearing him, not only
against subsequent incriminating use of his testimony, but also against the
undue pressure to which he alleges he is subject. The testimony is in solemn
form and based on an oath to tell the truth on pain of perjury. The question
whether use of unlawful constraint can excuse perjury under s. 17  of the Criminal
Code  is another matter. On the basis of this oath, reports were made,
judgments were pronounced, justice was rendered; men other than the accused
were cleared or condemned, released or sent to trial, found innocent or
criminally responsible for a fire or a homicide, civilly or criminally
acquitted or convicted, and possibly suffered loss of property, reputation,
liberty or even life. Why should the testimony which could involve such
consequences for third parties and for the administration of justice be hidden
from the jury, even if it

[Page 351]

is alleged that testimony is affected by
unlawful constraint?

These considerations override the risk, which is
all it is, of revealing the testimony to the jury, which is still able to
measure its probative effect, and disregard it if it does not believe it
because of the unlawful constraint or for any other reason. It is still open to
the accused to attack his earlier testimony and try to destroy it or lessen its
credibility. The testimony is not necessarily false even though the accused, at
the time he gave it, was subject to two constraints, the unlawful constraint
and the obligation to tell the truth. If the accused now says that this
testimony was false because it was forced from him, he admits his perjury,
whether or not it is excusable, and the function of deciding between
contradictory testimony coming from the same person is one which is clearly
within the competence of the jury rather than that of the judge. It is still
possible that the accused was unlawfully and expressly urged, at the time of
the earlier testimony, to incriminate himself without objecting. The law
provides a safeguard in this matter, but it only provides one: the witness may
request the protection of the law, and he should request it at the time he is
testifying both to prevent subsequent use of his testimony against himself and
to protect the integrity of the testimony which he is called on to give and of
the proceedings in which he gives it. However, the witness is not allowed to
request the protection of the law after the event, which would in practice be
the case if his testimony could subsequently be excluded following a voir
dire.

Appellant’s first ground is ill-founded and must
be rejected.

2. Appellant’s second argument was that the
evidence of a similar act with respect to Paul Brie’s death was inadmissible,
and that even if it were admissible, the presiding judge should have exercised
his discretion to exclude it, because its probative value was tenuous in
comparison to the damage it caused to the accused.

[Page 352]

It may immediately be noted that in the case at
bar the oft-debated question of whether, assuming that evidence of similar acts
were admissible, it could be established by evidence in chief or by rebuttal
evidence, was not raised; in fact, it was established by rebuttal evidence.
However, the presiding judge offered the defence an opportunity to reply to
this rebuttal evidence by further evidence, but the defence did not take that
opportunity.

The principles which determine the admissibility
of evidence of similar acts are still those given by the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales[34], at p. 65:

It is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have Committed the offence for which he is being tried.
On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the
commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to
an issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the
question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the
indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut a defence which would
otherwise be open to the accused.

Evidence of similar acts is not designed to show
that, because he has committed other crimes, the accused probably committed the
act with which he is charged, and in principle it should not be admitted if
that is its only effect. However, although it may have this effect, it is still
admissible if it is relevant to a question which is important to the outcome of
the trial, which is the case, for example, when it establishes the accused’s
state of mind, intent (Leblanc v. The Queen[35]), systematic course of action,
premeditation, and so on.

In the case at bar, the evidence of Paul Brie’s
murder and the circumstances surrounding his burial were, in my opinion, a
classic example of a case where evidence of a similar act should prima

[Page 353]

facie be
admitted. The similarity of the circumstances described above concerning the
deaths and exhumations of Bilodeau and Brie is striking and tends to show a
system. The prosecution had to prove premeditation, and a systematic course of
action has a clear tendency to establish premeditation. On the other hand, the
prosecution was confronted by a defence which had several aspects. One of these
was that appellant found himself caught up by accident in an unforeseeable
misadventure, and that as a result his intent was innocent, since he in no way
willed the victim’s death. Evidence of a similar act showing a systematic
course of action, premeditation and guilty intent is admissible to rebut such a
defence. Another aspect of the defence, intended to explain how appellant and
Gagnon found the caustic soda after Bilodeau’s death and not before it, was
that not only was the victim the aggressor, but that he had himself planned to
murder Gagnon, going as far as providing himself with caustic soda to dispose
of the body. With respect to a defence which turned to its advantage part of
the same evidence which the prosecution had introduced in attempting to
establish premeditation on the part of the accused, the similar act evidence
presented the jury with, inter alia, the following question: if Bilodeau
had in fact formed the plan to murder Gagnon and bury him in a grave covered in
caustic soda, and if Bilodeau had been caught in his own trap, he nevertheless
could not have chosen his own place of burial; by what remarkable coincidence
was there, at the place chosen by appellant and Gagnon for that purpose,
another grave containing the body of a man known to appellant, killed in the
same manner as Bilodeau and also burned with a caustic substance? The similar
act evidence was relevant and at the very least admissible as rebuttal
evidence: even if it had the effect of reinforcing or confirming the evidence
in chief, that was not its purpose, which was to rebut the evidence of
premeditated aggression by the victim, in particular the evidence that the
victim was carrying in the trunk of his car enough caustic soda to burn a body.

[Page 354]

In fact, appellant objects primarily not to the
similar act evidence, but to the evidence of that act “as presented”:
the similar act was directly related to the accused but not so as to show
that he participated in it. The similarity created the suspicion that the
accused had participated in Brie’s murder or the concealment of his body, since
he knew the location of the grave, but it did not prove the participation of
the accused in Brie’s murder.

However, this evidence existed. The prosecution
wished to present the jury with it, but the presiding judge prohibited it, in
order not to unduly burden the accused. He expressed his view in his report to
the Court of Appeal as follows:

[TRANSLATION] TO refute this evidence of accident,
and to establish the possibility of a systematic course of action and even of mens
rea on the part of Boulet, I admitted the similar act evidence, that is,
that on the same day that Boulet led the police officers to Bilodeau’s grave,
he led them a few hundred feet from that spot, about an hour later, and showed
them another grave in which a body was found, nude and burned by caustic soda
like that of Bilodeau. This body was formally identified as that of a certain
Brie, who was a casual labourer for Boulet’s accomplices.

However, I did not allow the Crown to
introduce other testimony that Boulet had given at the Coroner’s inquest into
Brie’s death, when he stated without even requesting the protection of the
Court that, in short, he had been an accomplice in the murder of Brie, and that
it was he again in this case who had interred him.

Since he was found criminally responsible
for this death at the Coroner’s inquest, and was not assisted during that
testimony, I felt that the statements which the Crown wished to introduce would
probably cause considerable harm to the defence, disproportionate to the act
which the Crown wished to prove, that is, the similar act of pointing out
Brie’s grave, evidence which was already before the jury.

On the other hand, I informed the jury as
clearly as possible of the meaning that such evidence could have, that is, that
the directions Boulet gave in the cases of Bilodeau and Brie did not mean that
it was Boulet who had killed and buried Bilodeau and Brie, but was only
evidence that Boulet had knowledge of the existence of these graves, evidence
from which the jury clearly could draw the conclusions they saw fit.

[Page 355]

With respect to the instructions to the jury on
this point, the gist of them was as follows:

[TRANSLATION] It was requested, I admitted
this evidence, that evidence be introduced of similar acts, that is, that
Boulet’s directions had been followed to a little farther in the same area, on
the same morning, because similar acts, the circumstances of time and place, in
respect of similar acts, are important, the thing must not have occurred ten
months later, but there it was a whole, they had led him to a place where he
pointed out a grave, a thousand and some feet away, a grave which was then
empty, but the evidence showed later that another body had been found in that
grave, which was identified—at least if you accept the evidence that this is in
fact so, it is not for me to say—and which was apparently in the same condition
as Bilodeau, nude and with… burned by caustic soda, according to the testimony
of Dr Authier.

This does not mean, gentlemen of the jury,
that it was Boulet who killed them, nor does it even mean simply that it was
Boulet who had put them there. This means that you must conclude from these
similar acts that Boulet had knowledge of the existence of those things, and
then you may deduce that that rebuts a defence of accident, that it can
establish a systematic course of action, this is why the law permits it.

From those acts you should conclude that
Boulet had knowledge. Why did he have it? Ah! It is for you to decide that. How
is it that there was a second grave there, how is it that he knew that Bilodeau
[Brie (?)] was buried there? That similarity may also allow you to draw
conclusions as to the reason he should know what had happened there. It is for
you to do it, to draw those conclusions. (Parenthesis mine.)

In my opinion, if the sole purpose of the
similar act evidence was to rebut the defence of accident and to establish a
systematic course of action on the part of the accused, it would have been
logical to also admit in evidence the testimony given by appellant at the
Coroner’s inquest into Brie’s death. This testimony was admissible in principle
since appellant had testified without requesting the protection of the law and
that nothing showed that appellant had been at that time charged with

[Page 356]

Brie’s murder (Batary v. A.G. for Sask.[36]). This testimony not only showed
that appellant knew the location of Brie’s grave, but implicated him directly
in the murder. The presiding judge excluded this evidence, exercising the
discretion recognized in Noor Mohamed v. Rex[37] and Kuruma v. Reg.[38], as they were interpreted at the time.

In my opinion, the presiding judge would have
committed no error in law and would not have abused his discretion if he had
permitted the prosecution to introduce the evidence given by appellant at the
inquest held by the Coroner into Brie’s death. The exclusion of this evidence
and the instructions to the jury on the subject caused no prejudice to the
defence; to the contrary, they could only have been to its advantage, by
allowing the jury to remain ignorant of an even more incriminating piece of
evidence which could have been admitted. Appellant cannot object to its not
being admitted.

Appellant’s first two arguments were the only
ones that his counsel argued orally, although he specified that he was not
abandoning the others, which were mentioned in his factum.

The third, fourth and fifth arguments related to
the right to a full and complete defence, which appellant claims he was denied.

3. The third argument challenged the limits
which the judge imposed on the evidence which appellant wished to introduce, to
persuade the jury to doubt the probative effect of the testimony he had given
at Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry. The defence wished to call a number of
witnesses to testify that they also had received mistreatment at the hands of
the police. The presiding judge allowed this evidence if it dealt with mistreatment
inflicted in the presence of appellant or to his knowledge, or which was
reported to him by the police or others. Therefore, Gagnon, Quirion and one
Sicotte gave testimony on this point. However, this evidence was ruled
inadmissible in the case of the mistreatment, if any, which was inflicted on

[Page 357]

others without appellant’s knowledge. Appellant
objects to this limitation.

Of the five judges of the Court of Appeal who
unanimously dismissed the appeal only Montgomery J.A. found merit in this argument,
but he did not consider it decisive:

I agree with the trial judge that he was
not entitled to bring before the court any person who might be prepared to
state that at one time or another he had been maltreated by the police, but
what Appellant was seeking to establish was something far more specific: that
other persons accused of this murder or related offences were systematically
beaten by the same policemen during the same period and in the same premises
and that this was generally known to those who were being held by the police in
connection with these offences.

I might be disposed to order a new trial on
the above ground were it not for the fact that, despite the trial judge’s
ruling, evidence was in fact made before the jury that three of the Appellant’s
associates, namely his witnesses Gagnon, Quirion and Sicotte, were beaten by
the police. The Crown countered this evidence by discrediting these witnesses,
all of whom had criminal records, but did not produce as witnesses any of the
policemen named or bring any other evidence in refutation. In view of this, I
doubt that any further evidence that Appellant might have made regarding the
alleged system would have persuaded the jury to accept the version of the facts
that Appellant gave at his trial.

In the present state of jurisprudence, it
appears that any such evidence of coercion could not have led to the complete
rejection of the declaration previously made; it could merely give the jury
reasons for viewing it with scepticism. In my opinion, the jury accepted the
earlier version not because they believed that it was given freely and
voluntarily but because it was plausible and to some extent corroborated by
other evidence and because the later version appeared incredible.

While I am not entirely satisfied with the
conduct of the trial, I am of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred. I therefore agree with my colleague that
we should dismiss this appeal.

I agree with the trial judge and the majority in
the Court of Appeal that the use, if any, of other

[Page 358]

repressive methods unknown to the accused could
not have influenced the testimony he gave at Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry, and
that evidence of this mistreatment was not relevant. Moreover, if four witnesses’
consistent testimony on this question, including that of appellant, did not
change the jury’s verdict, I do not see how additional testimony would have had
that effect except by ultimately turning attention away from the primary issue
by simple accumulation.

4. Appellant’s fourth argument was that the
judge lacked composure in presiding over the trial. This complaint is not a
serious one. The Court of Appeal’s opinion was as follows:

[TRANSLATION] With respect to the attitude
of the judge presiding at the trial, it should be noted that if the judge from
time to time made severe comments to counsel for the appellant it was because
the latter provoked numerous long debates before the jury, which were often
acrimonious and futile, and several times showed tenacity of an offensive kind,
to say the least, putting the judge’s patience to many severe tests.

I am of the opinion that appellant had a
fair trial, that he suffered no significant prejudice and that the verdict was
justified by the evidence.

I would add that counsel for the appellant
repeatedly refused to accept the rulings of the trial judge, who had to assert
his authority and maintain control of the proceedings in a difficult
atmosphere. In my opinion he did so with the firmness necessary in the circumstances
and without losing his composure.

5. In his fifth argument, appellant objects to
the aggressiveness of counsel for the Crown. Their behaviour was not above
reproach, especially with respect to the epithets which they used in referring
to defence witnesses. They replied in exaggerations opposite to those used by
counsel for the defence, exaggerations which breached propriety. The lack of
moderation on both sides in the choice of words, while reprehensible, included
no statement of fact and as such did not relate to the evidence. Moreover, at
the beginning of his charge to the jury, the presiding judge alluded to the
climate in which the trial had taken place, to control of tempers, to

[Page 359]

counsel’s emotionalism, and his remarks were
clearly designed to neutralize the possible effect of some intemperate
language. I do not believe that in the context the jury could have attached
importance to this intemperance.

6. Appellant’s sixth argument was that the
presiding judge did not explain to the jury that Gagnon could have been acting
in self-defence when he killed Bilodeau. According to this theory, no crime
would have been committed by Gagnon or by appellant.

Gagnon was the first to use the word
“self-defence” in his testimony. However, he admitted that he had not relied on
this defence at his own trial for Bilodeau’s murder. Counsel for the appellant
at the trial also referred several times in his pleadings to what he called the
“theory” of self-defence. At best, however, this would be a secondary defence,
which moreover could not be urged without compromising the primary position
which tended to dissociate appellant from Gagnon.

When the presiding judge, after his charge to
the jury, invited counsel to bring to his attention omissions or errors which
he might have made, counsel for the appellant submitted another complaint to
him but did not in any way refer to self-defence, nor was there any question of
self-defence in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, which did not
mention it in its decision.

In any case, the trial judge would have erred,
in my opinion, if he had directed the jury to consider this particular defence.
Even if the testimony of appellant and Gagnon was accepted as true, it did not
open the way to that defence: Bilodeau was alone against two people; the barrel
of the rifle he had pointed at Gagnon was pushed aside by the latter; the rifle
went off, and Gagnon then fired more than once at Bilodeau. This is not a
situation in which, in law, Gagnon was acting in self-defence.

7. Appellant’s seventh and last argument was
that the trial judge gave his opinion on the facts in

[Page 360]

his charge to the jury in such a way as to
influence the jury’s verdict. This complaint is also without basis. Even though
one might suspect or guess his opinion on certain specific facts in reading the
analysis of the evidence made by the trial judge, there is nothing unlawful or
irregular in that: the trial judge clearly outlined his role and that of the
jury, and repeated his instructions to the jury that they should not consider
his opinion on questions of fact. Following are examples of these instructions:

[TRANSLATION) If while I am speaking to
you you could have had or could now have the impression or the feeling that by
my attitude, my words, my actions… I may have suggested to you that I have an
opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, you may not consider it…
If by chance you may have had the idea that I have an opinion, I implore you in
conscience not to consider it.

It is the duty of the judge to draw the
jury’s attention to certain parts of the evidence, or to certain comments on
the testimony… That does not mean that what the judge says must be accepted by
you… I want this to be your decision and I do not want it to be influenced by
me.

I would also reject this last argument and I
would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Murder—Trial by judge without a
jury—Stricter standard of proof than required applied to particular elements of
evidence—Discretion properly exercised under s. 9(2) of Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1970 ,c. E-10.

On a charge of murder, the accused elected to
be tried by a judge without a jury under the provisions of s. 430  of the Criminal
Code . The trial judge found the accused not guilty. The Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed an appeal by the Crown and directed a
new trial. An appeal by the accused was then brought to this Court.

The judgment of the Appellate Division was
based on the following grounds: (1) the trial judge had failed to exercise
properly his discretion under the provisions of s. 9(2) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10; (2) the references to motive in
the reasons for judgment of the trial judge do not represent the law on this
subject and (3) the trial judge had, on several occasions, assigned a burden of
proof to the Crown which was “far more stringent” than the burden put upon the
Crown in law.

Held: (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ: There was no misuse of the
trial judge’s discretion, under s. 9(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , in
the direction he gave as to how a witness who was called by the Crown should be
examined before leave would be given for Crown counsel to cross-examine him as
to an inconsistent statement previously made.

The two other grounds of the judgment
appealed from could be summarized by saying that the trial judge misdirected
himself as to the standard of proof required. He fell into a double error, not
only did he apply repeatedly a much stricter standard than that which is

[Page 749]

required, but he applied it to particular
elements of the evidence taken in isolation. Instead of taking all the evidence
and properly relating every fact to all the others, he dealt separately with
each discarding them successively as insufficient to meet his exaggerated
standard of proof.

In a charge to a jury, the failure of the
trial judge to mention a large part of the incriminating evidence, to relate it
properly to the rest and to instruct the jurors that the whole must be
considered together in deciding whether there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,
would certainly constitute misdirection requiring a new trial. There was no
reason to hold otherwise in the case of a judge sitting without a jury. The
judgment in this case showed serious misdirection and not mere slips. The Court
of Appeal properly singled out as specially serious the manner in which
incriminating statements made to police officers were swept aside because each
of them taken separately did not prove anything beyond “any peradventure of
doubt” or “beyond any shadow of a doubt”.

Per Laskin
C.J., Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: The trial judge, preparatory to
exercising his discretion under s. 9(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , considered
that the witness should have his memory refreshed and have an opportunity to
read his alleged inconsistent statement. Counsel for the Crown resisted that
reasonable request and, therefore, the trial judge exercised his discretion to
refuse to permit the Crown counsel to cross-examine his own witness. That
course could not be considered to be the failure to exercise his discretion in
a judicial manner.

There was no error in the trial judge’s
statement that the absence of motive is usually considered on the side of
innocence nor in his statement that if it is believed that it has been proven
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime of which he is
accused or if there is a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime the
matter of motive or absence of a motive becomes unimportant. Since the trial
judge used the words “After consideration of all of the evidence” and
since a very large part of the evidence at trial was concerned solely with the
question of motive, the submission by Crown counsel that what the trial judge
was saying was that if he considered all of the circumstances apart from the
evidence of motive and had a reasonable doubt then the evidence of motive was irrelevant,
could not be accepted.

[Page 750]

The third ground of the Appellate Division’s
judgment should be rejected. Under the circumstances, following the words used
by Crown counsel in his address, the trial judge’s use in his reasons for
judgment of the terms “beyond any peradventure of doubt”, “conclusively” and
“beyond any shadow of a doubt” cannot indicate his burdening of the Crown with
any stricter standard of truth than the criminal law requires. The trial judge
did not make findings of fact unsupported by the evidence. He merely drew
inferences from the evidence as he was entitled to do.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, setting aside an acquittal by MacDonald J.,
sitting without a jury, on a charge of murder. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J.,
Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

A.M. Harradence, Q.C., for the appellant.

D.C. Abbott and J. Franklin, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and
Dickson JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
pronounced on November 12, 1975.

The appellant had been charged by indictment as
follows:

Albert Stewart, you stand charged that you
on or about the 13th day of August, A.D. 1973, at the City of Edmonton, in the
said Judicial District did kill and slay Marion Hilda Parker, thereby
committing murder punishable by life imprisonment, contrary to the provisions
of the Criminal Code .

At the commencement of the trial, H.J.
Mac-Donald J., stated:

Mr. Stewart has elected to be tried
with a judge alone.

That statement was confirmed immediately
thereafter by the counsel for the accused and by the accused himself. Such a
course is possible under

[Page 751]

the provisions of s. 430  of the Criminal
Code  which reads:

430.
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, an accused who is charged with an
indictable offence in the Province of Alberta may, with his consent, be tried
by a judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction of Alberta without a
jury.

The trial proceeded at once and on November 9,
1974, H.J. MacDonald J. found the accused, the present appellant, not guilty
for reasons which he dictated. The Appellate Division, by its judgment
aforesaid, allowed an appeal by the Crown and directed a new trial. Sinclair
J.A. gave the reasons for the Court and based his judgment upon three factors.
Firstly, the learned justice on appeal found that the trial judge had failed to
exercise properly his discretion under the provisions of s. 9(2) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10.

The Crown had called as a witness one Gordon
Andersen and had examined this witness in chief for some time when counsel for
the Crown made the following statement:

Now, My Lord, at this stage I am making
application under Section 9(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . I advise Your
Lordship that the witness has made a statement, previous statement, which I
submit is inconsistent with what he is now telling the Court, and in that
regard, sir, I have the case of Regina vs. Milgaard, M-i-l-g-a-a-r-d, which is
a decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, the judgment of the Court
delivered by the Chief Justice Culliton, and it is found in 1971 2 Canadian Criminal
Cases, at 206. I refer you to this decision, My Lord, because it contains a
suggested procedure which I would urge Your Lordship to adopt here.

The learned trial judge expressed the view that
prior to permitting the cross-examination of a witness on the basis that he had
previously made an inconsistent statement, the counsel for the Crown should
refresh the memory of the witness as to the making of such statement and permit
the witness to read that statement, being of the opinion that had such a procedure
been followed the witness might well have acknowledged that he had made the
previous statement and that that statement was true. The learned trial judge
said:

[Page 752]

I feel that any witness, knowing the
frailties of the human mind, that the witness, without being cross-examined,
should be examined carefully in direct examination and the questions put to
him, if necessary, in a variety of ways, and that should be exhausted before we
get into trying to get the evidence in some other manner. I am not going to
accept the proposition of the Crown that they can call a witness and then
almost immediately start cross-examining him under Section 9(2) . Surely the
section is there as a remedy or as a means of obtaining evidence that
cannot be obtained in some other way, but we must exhaust the other ways of
doing it first, and then I am prepared, if the Crown wants to move that the man
be declared hostile or they want to take advantage of Section 9(2) , to give it
every consideration.

and later gave the specific direction:

and, I think, in fairness, I would direct
that we carry on as I have suggested.

Counsel for the Crown, upon Andersen returning
to the witness stand, simply proceeded with his examination-in-chief and did
not present the witness with any previous inconsistent statement.

Sinclair J.A., in his reasons for judgment for
the Appellate Division, said:

In our opinion, it is clear from the record
that in dealing with the evidence of the witness Gordon Andersen, the learned
trial judge misconstrued s. 9(2) , and failed to appreciate the purpose for
which the subsection was added to the Canada Evidence Act  in 1968‑69.
He failed to draw a distinction between the objectives of subsection (1),
on the one hand, and subsection (2), on the other. Consequently he failed
to exercise the discretion given to him by s. 9(2)  in a judicial manner.
This is particularly significant in view of the learned trial judge’s remarks
concerning the evidence of Andersen made during the course of his judgment.

With respect, I differ with the learned justice
on appeal. It was agreed that under the provisions of s. 9(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  the learned trial judge had a discretion as to whether he
would permit counsel to cross-examine his own witness. The learned trial judge,
preparatory to exercising his discretion, considered that the witness should
have his memory refreshed and have an opportunity to read his alleged
inconsistent statement. Counsel for the Crown resisted that reasonable request
and, therefore, the learned trial judge exer-

[Page 753]

cised his discretion to refuse to permit the
Crown counsel to cross-examine his own witness. I am quite unable to see how
that course could be considered to be the failure to exercise his discretion in
a judicial manner. I might add that although the complete allegedly
inconsistent statement does not appear in the record, the references to it in
the discussion between the learned trial judge and counsel for the Crown and
for the accused would seem to indicate that it is highly doubtful that the
learned trial judge should have found it to be an inconsistent statement. It
was a statement which was not as complete as the evidence which the witness
gave at his trial but there is nothing, so far as one could see from reading
the relevant evidence, that contradicts the evidence given at trial.

The second ground upon which Sinclair J.A. based
his reasons for judgment was the references to motive in the reasons for
judgment of the learned trial judge. Sinclair J.A. quoted that part of the learned
trial judge’s judgment as follows:

“Speaking of motive first. Were there a
jury I would say something along these lines in dealing with motive: The proof
of motive for an alleged crime is permissible and it is often valuable but
never essential. The evidence of motive is sometimes of assistance in removing
doubt and completing proof. Motive is a circumstance, but nothing more than a
circumstance, to be considered. The absence of motive is usually a circumstance
to be considered but on the side of innocence and to be given such weight as is
deemed proper. After consideration of all the evidence if it is believed that
it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the
crime of which he is accused or if there is a reasonable doubt that he
committed the crime the matter of motive or absence of a motive becomes
unimportant.”

And commented:

With respect, it is difficult to understand
what the trial judge meant to say by the last two sentences of the remarks just
quoted, but, in our view, they do not represent the law on this subject,
particularly in a case where there is evidence of threats against the deceased
having been made.

Again, with respect, I am unable to find fault
with the learned trial judge’s reasons. It is true that in those reasons there
is a certain degree of

[Page 754]

looseness which might result in a lack of
clarity but it must be remembered that the learned trial judge was not charging
a jury but was, rather informally, at the close of the trial, giving his
reasons for the acquittal of the accused. The last two sentences to which
Sinclair J.A. referred were, firstly:

The absence of motive is usually a
circumstance to be considered but on the side of innocence and to be given such
weight as is deemed proper.

Surely, it is true, as the learned trial judge
pointed out earlier, evidence of motive is always admissible and therefore the
absence of evidence of motive is a circumstance to be considered. Since the
absence of any evidence of motive would seem to make it less probable that the
accused did commit the act, such absence of evidence is usually considered on
the side of innocence. I find nothing in error in that sentence.

Secondly, that is the second sentence, was:

After consideration of all the evidence if
it is believed that it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused committed the crime of which he is accused or if there is a reasonable
doubt that he committed the crime the matter of motive or absence of a motive
becomes unimportant.

With respect, what the learned trial judge was
saying was that if it was found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did
the act with the necessary mens rea then his motive for so doing was
irrelevant, and if, on the other hand, there was a reasonable doubt that the accused
did do the act with the necessary mens rea then even the presence of a
motive did not permit his conviction. That is a very trite statement of
ordinary law.

Counsel for the Crown attempted to persuade this
Court that what the learned trial judge was saying was that if he considered
all of the circumstances apart from the evidence of motive and had a reasonable
doubt then the evidence of motive was irrelevant. Since the learned trial judge
used

[Page 755]

the words “After consideration of all of
the evidence” (the underlining is my own), and since a very large part of the
evidence at trial was concerned solely with the question of motive, one could
not possibly attribute the meaning which Crown counsel advanced to the sentence
uttered by the learned trial judge. For these reasons, I find the judgment of
the Appellate Division in error as to this second ground.

The third ground upon which Sinclair J.A. based
his reasons for judgment was his view that the learned trial judge had, on
several occasions, assigned a burden of proof to the Crown which was “far more
stringent” than the burden put upon the Crown in law.

The learned trial judge used, in his charge,
certain words. Firstly, referring to the Crown’s evidence adduced as to
statements made to police officers, he said:

and if these statements were to be relied
on, then the statement or statements must convince the Court, beyond any
peradventure of doubt, that the accused is guilty of the charge. It isn’t a
matter of whether the accused was telling the truth or not telling the truth,
simply that there is no burden placed on the accused to prove his innocence,
that the entire burden is on the Crown to present evidence that conclusively
shows that the accused is guilty of the offence.

(The italics are my own.)

In the concluding half of the next paragraph of
his reasons, the learned trial judge said:

We are asked to put it together with the
statement that he made to Detective Hecht on the way back in the plane, that
“the main evidence is gone”. The Court is asked to conclude or to infer that he
must have been talking about the rifle that killed Mrs. Parker. There is
no evidence to show what he was talking about, there is nothing in front of me
that I feel that forces me to conclude, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that
it was the rifle he was speaking of when he mentions this. I feel that to
convict the accused were you to rely almost entirely on that would be to infer
more than what the statement itself suggests should be inferred.

(The italics are my own.)

The italicized expressions are those to which
the Appellate Division took objection and which the

[Page 756]

Appellate Division considered to be the
application of a much more stringent burden of proof than required by the
criminal law. A reading of this section of the reasons for judgment
demonstrates that there the learned trial judge was dealing with the probative
value of evidence that the accused had made certain statements to police
officers. Counsel for the Crown had stressed the weight of those statements in
his submission and had gone so far as to say:

Then, sir, you have the incident of the
plane, and this was some hours after the interview by Detective Hecht, and he
was sitting there and nothing was being said and the accused has had these
several hours to consider his statements to Detective Hecht and the subject
must have been on his mind. Out of the blue, to use my learned friend’s
suggestion, to Detective Hecht, the term he used, he says “Just between you and
me, the main evidence is gone”. Surely the only inference there to draw, My
Lord, is that he is referring to the firearm. No weapon was found.

In short, the Crown was putting to the learned
trial judge the submission that the only possible inference which could be
drawn from that evidence was that the accused was referring to the actual
weapon used to cause the victim’s death. It was quite evidently the view of the
learned trial judge that there was no such irresistible inference to be drawn
from the evidence and remembering again that he was giving reasons for judgment
and not charging a jury, his use of the stronger terms of “beyond any
peradventure of doubt”, “conclusively” and “beyond any shadow of a doubt” were
mere reflections of the positive nature of the Crown’s submission which could
be characterized as a submission that the matter had been proved in any of
those three strong fashions. In the very next paragraph, the learned trial
judge describing the onus said:

The decision of the Court must be made, of
course, on the evidence that has been presented. That evidence itself, no
matter how suspicious it is, must, when one considers everything that has been
said and what weight can be given to it it must convince the mind and satisfy
the conscience to the extent that no other rational conclusion could be
reached. I feel that in this case that there is room for a reasonable doubt.
There are, of course, a number of things that have not been explained,

[Page 757]

the fact they have not been explained does
not entitle one to place any burden on the accused.

And two paragraphs later when concluding his
reasons, the learned trial judge again referred to the recognized standard of
“beyond a reasonable doubt”.

Under the circumstances to which I have
referred, I can find no reason for a new trial in the learned trial judge’s use
of the three above-mentioned sets of words in his reasons for judgment.

A fourth ground was mentioned by Sinclair J.A.
in his reasons for judgment but the learned justice on appeal found it
unnecessary to deal with it in view of his finding as to the other three
reasons and that ground was that the learned trial judge erred in his
application of the rule in Hodge’s case.

In this Court, counsel for the respondent Crown
seemed to put this ground more on the basis that the learned trial judge, in
finding that he had a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, based his
conclusion on facts which were not substantiated by the evidence. Counsel for
the Crown outlined five different statements made by the learned trial judge in
his reasons all of which he alleged were not made on a basis of any evidence.
Without going through them in detail, I am strongly of the view that in each
one of the cases the learned trial judge was drawing an inference which a
finder of fact could draw from the evidence. For example, a consideration of
the injuries to the victim might lead a trier of fact to conclude that those
injuries had occurred in a struggle. It might well be that the counsel for the
Crown or members of the Appellate Division, or even members of this Court,
would not find that such an inference was a proper one from the evidence, but
we are not triers of fact. That was a task put upon the learned trial judge
under the unusual provisions of s. 430  of the Criminal Code  and I
do not think that any appellate court is free to vary the findings of fact made
by the learned trial judge or inferences which the learned trial judge drew
from the evidence unless one can say that there was no evidence upon which the
learned trial judge could make such a finding. Counsel for the Crown was unable
to put any of

[Page 758]

the incidents to which he referred in that
class. I am, therefore, not ready to concur in this additional ground of appeal
which was urged in the Appellate Division but not dealt with.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal,
quash the judgment of the Appellate Division, and restore the judgment of the
learned trial judge directing the acquittal of the accused.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal is from a judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside an acquittal
pronounced by a judge sitting without a jury, with the consent of the accused,
on a charge of murder.

The judgment in appeal rests on three grounds.
The first is that the trial judge misconstrued s. 9(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and failed to exercise in a judicial manner the discretion
given to him by that provision. In what respect the trial judge was thus in
error is not stated. At the hearing, counsel for the Crown complained of the
direction given as to how the witness should be examined before leave would be
given to cross-examine him as to an inconsistent statement previously made. I
fail to see any misuse of the trial judge’s discretion in the direction which
he gave. It was for him to decide whether the cross-examination on the
statement would be permitted. I cannot see why this would not include the power
to require examination along certain lines before the discretion would be
exercised in favour of allowing the cross-examination. In my view, no case was
made for considering such direction as an abuse of the power implicit in the
discretion to grant or to refuse leave to cross-examine.

The two other grounds are much more serious and
I find it desirable to deal with them together. They can be summarized by
saying that the trial judge misdirected himself as to the standard of proof
required. While in the end, he properly spoke of proof “beyond any reasonable doubt”,
twice before, in dealing with particular elements of the evidence, he referred
to a much higher standard.

[Page 759]

Dealing with statements made by the accused to
police officers, he said:

…if these statements were to be relied on,
then the statement or statements must convince the Court, beyond any
peradventure of doubt, that the accused is guilty of the charge. (Italics
added.)

Again, dealing with a statement to a police
officer that “the main evidence is gone”, he said:

There is no evidence to show what he was
talking about, there is nothing in front of me that I feel that forces me to
conclude, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that it was the rifle he was
speaking of when he mentions this. (Italics added.)

In my view, the trial judge fell into a double
error, not only did he apply repeatedly a much stricter standard than that
which is required, but he applied it to particular elements of the evidence
taken in isolation. In other words, instead of taking together all the evidence
and properly relating every fact to all the others, he dealt separately with
each discarding them successively as insufficient to meet his exaggerated
standard of proof. This is the error in which he fell in the somewhat equivocal
reasoning whereby, at the outset, he practically swept aside the evidence of
motive, saying:

The proof of motive for an alleged crime is
permissible and it is often valuable but never essential. The evidence of
motive is sometimes of assistance in removing doubt and completing proof.
Motive is a circumstance, but nothing more than a circumstance, to be
considered. The absence of motive is usually a circumstance to be considered
but on the side of innocence and to be given such weight as is deemed proper.
After consideration of all the evidence if it is believed that it has been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime of which
he is accused or if there is a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime the
matter of motive or absence of a motive becomes unimportant.

After this, the trial judge went on to mention
not mere evidence of motive but evidence of plan and design. He said:

In this case, to begin with, we have the
evidence of several witnesses, Mr. Serby, Gay Parker and her sister Edith
Parker and Gordon Andersen who mentioned that

[Page 760]

the accused made statements indicating or
stating that he was going to kill the victim and it is suggested by the Crown
that this proves a plan, a design, an obsession and yet no one of these
witnesses when they heard these statements made and when they heard them
repeated apparently considered that there was any danger involved. No complaint
was made to the police and nothing was done to protect the victim from what
they allege. The Court was asked to conclude there was a serious plan or
design.

I think the evidence of Gordon Andersen was
reliable evidence and I place some weight on it. He indicated that the mention
of killing he took as a rather flippant statement, he felt the man was joking.

Like the Court of Appeal, I wish to avoid going
into any detailed discussion of the evidence, but I must point out that there
was evidence that the accused had worked on making a silencer and gone to a
quarry for testing one which had exploded, that the victim had been shot in her
apartment and nothing but clicks heard by neighbors. There was also evidence
that shortly before the murder was committed, the accused had bought traveller
cheques with his savings, that afterwards, he had gone east as far as Winnipeg
as he had said he would when talking of his intention to kill the woman he had
recently deserted, that when he was arrested, rubber gloves were found in the
trunk of his car that he had tried to conceal, etc.

In a charge to a jury, the failure of the trial
judge to mention a large part of the incriminating evidence, to relate it
properly to the rest and to instruct the jurors that the whole must be
considered together in deciding whether there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,
would certainly constitute misdirection requiring a new trial. I can see no
reason to hold otherwise in the case of a judge sitting without a jury. It may
sometimes be presumed to a certain extent, that he is not misdirecting himself,
even when not spelling out every direction which he should give to a jury but,
in this case, the judgment taken as the whole shows serious misdirection and
not mere slips. The Court of Appeal properly singled out as specially serious
the manner in which incriminating statements made to police officers were swept
aside because each of them taken separately did not prove anything

[Page 761]

beyond “any peradventure of doubt” or “beyond
any shadow of a doubt”.

In my view, this was made all the more serious
by the trial judge considering the weight of various elements of proof taken
separately. In Côté v. The King[1], Taschereau
J. as he then was, said, speaking for all but one member of the Court (at
p. 76):

It may be, and such is often the case, that the
facts proven by the Crown, examined separately have not a very strong probative
value; but all the facts put in evidence have to be considered each one in
relation to the whole, and it is all of them taken together, that may
constitute a proper basis for a conviction.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Robbery—Defence of
alibi—Illegal rebuttal evidence—Harm to accused—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 302.

Appellant was convicted on a charge of
robbery committed at the L … jewellery store. The evidence at the trial
centered on identification of the accused as a participant in the robbery. The
testimony of the victim, jeweller L …, and of a neighbouring jeweller, H …,
seems to indicate that on June 25, 1968, the accused was shown rings, and that
the next day he returned to commit robbery. The two jewellers identified the
accused from a set of photographs a month after the robbery. At the trial, only
the jeweller H. was able to identify the accused in court. The accused
testified in support of his defence of alibi. He stated he had worked on June
25 and 26, 1968. In cross-examination, he answered without objection when asked
if he knew a third jewellery store, S … He answered that he did not know this
jewellery store and that he had never gone there. The accused’s employer also
testified.

In rebuttal, the Crown introduced the
testimony of a sales clerk at the S … jewellery store. She recognized the
accused, both in a photograph and in person as the man who committed a robbery
at the S … jewellery store on September 13, 1968. It is the admission of this
rebuttal evidence that appellant objected to. The Court of Appeal dismissed his
appeal and affirmed the judgment at trial. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Appellant alleged that if this rebuttal
evidence was to attack credibility, it offended the principle that a collateral
fact put in evidence by the Crown in its cross-examination may not be
contradicted by the Crown and that if, on the other hand, the rebuttal evidence
attacked the alibi, it had no basis in fact since the alibi related to June 25
and 26, 1968 and the rebuttal evidence to September 13, 1968.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

If the right of the Crown to contradict a
defence of alibi is unquestionable, it is also indisputable that this right may
only be exercised by attacking the material

[Page 362]

points of the alibi. The rebuttal evidence
establishing the accused’s presence at the S … jewellery store on September 13
does not rebut the defence of alibi according to which the accused was not at
the L … jewellery store on June 25 and 26.

Viewed as an attack on credibility, the
rebuttal evidence is still inadmissible since it offends the principle that a
collateral fact put in evidence by the Crown in its cross-examination may not
be contradicted. This rebuttal evidence also cannot be used as similar fact
evidence, inadmissible in the case at bar. Moreover, the lack of objection by
the defence at the trial did not prevent appellant from raising the illegality of
the rebuttal evidence.

The admission of this illegal rebuttal
evidence caused harm to the accused. A new trial should be ordered but since
the Crown agrees, the Supreme Court enters a verdict of acquittal.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a
conviction pronounced by a jury on a charge of robbery. Appeal allowed:
acquittal.

Michel Denis and Bernard Lamarche, for
the appellant.

Fernand Côté, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—Appellant obtained leave to
appeal from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal, affirming a conviction
pronounced by a jury on October 17, 1973 on a charge of robbery committed on June 26, 1968 in St-Rémi, at the Claude
Létourneau jewellery store, amounting to $23,000 (s. 288  of the Criminal
Code , now s. 302 ).

As the substance of the appeal is the admission
of rebuttal evidence against a defence of alibi, and appellant contends such
admission was illegal, it is enough to summarize in a few words the evidence

[Page 363]

of identification given by the prosecution. Two
witnesses were called, the victim Létourneau and Jean-Paul Houle, both
operating jewellery stores in St-Rémi a few steps from each other, and
according to their testimony:

(a) on June 25, in mid-afternoon, Latour and two
companions asked to be shown some expensive rings, by Houle and Létourneau in
turn;

(b) the next day, June 26, 1968, at about 10:30 a.m., Latour and two companions, one of
whom had been with him the day before, committed the robbery mentioned in the
indictment.

It should be noted that these witnesses reported
only what happened at their own businesses, having no knowledge of the events
at their competitor’s store. It should also be noted that the identification
was made the month following the robbery from a set of about a hundred
photographs, including one of appellant taken at the Montreal prison and inscribed as such. Houle added to this an identification
in court, which Létourneau could not do.

In support of his defence of alibi, Latour
offered his testimony. In chief, he stated in essence that he had worked all
day on June 25 and 26, 1968, and that he had never set foot in St‑Rémi.
In cross-examination, he described the usual occupation of his days with his
employer at the time, one Dulude, a grocer, and explained that he stated that
he had worked on those days because his employer had entered it in his books.
The cross-examination includes the following exchange, which according to the Crown
opens the way for the rebuttal evidence, which will be discussed below:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Sir, do you know the Serre
jewellery store? A. I don’t know the jeweller, no.

Q. I am not asking you about the jeweller,
I am asking you about the Serre jewellery store.

A. Serre—I don’t know where that is.

Q. I will tell you where it is: Chemin
St-Jean in Laprairie.

A. No, I have never heard of it.

Q. You swear that, sir?

A. Yes, I swear it.

[Page 364]

Q. You swear that you have never been to
the Serre jewellery store?

A. Yes, I swear it, I swear it, yes, I have
never gone there in my life.

Latour’s testimony ended with the statement that
his hours of work had been changed on October 22, 1968.

Latour’s employer, Dulude, also testified for
the defence. With respect to the dates, he could only testify by referring to
his books, which is not surprising since the trial was taking place almost five
and a half years after the event. On the basis of the entries he had made, he
stated that Latour had worked on June 25 and 26, 1968. He added that during the
two years Latour had been in his employ, he had never missed a day of work, but
that occasionally he had been given a couple of hours off. He admitted the
possibility that this had occurred on June 25 and 26, 1968, and his testimony
ended with the examination of certain entries in his books for December 1968
and a general description of Latour’s duties.

In rebuttal, the Crown introduced the testimony
of Lyne Martin, the whole of which follows below. Exhibit P-19 is the photograph
taken at the Montreal prison,
already used by the witnesses Latour and Houle.

[TRANSLATION] Q. Miss Martin, I show you an
exhibit which was introduced as P-19; would you look at it and tell the Court
whether you have, or whether you recognize this individual as having seen him
somewhere?

A. Yes, I recognize him, as having
committed a robbery at the Serre jewellery store in Laprairie.

Q. In Laprairie; what was your position at
that time?

A. I was a sales clerk.

Q. You were a sales clerk?

A. Yes.

Q. At the counter?

A. At the counter, yes.

Q. And when did you see this individual at
the Serre jewellery store?

A. I saw him at about one o’clock in the afternoon; he came in with
another boy.

Q. When?

A. …

[Page 365]

Q. What month?

A. Oh! Yes, excuse me, the thirteenth,
Friday, September 13.

Q. What year?

A. Sixty-eight.

Q. On September 13, 1968, you saw this
individual at the Serre drugstore?

A. At the jewellery store.

Q. At the Serre jewellery store in
Laprairie?

A. Yes.

Q. That’s correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you look at the dock: do you
recognize that individual?

A. I recognize him, but he was thinner.

Q. Do you recognize him as the one who went
to the Serre drugstore in Laprairie?

A. Yes, I recognize him, at the Serre
jewellery store.

Q. At the Serre jewellery store?

A. Yes.

Mr. Lagacé

Counsel for the Defence:

Q. Now, Miss Martin, on exactly what date
did this holdup occur?

Mr. Trudeau

Crown Attorney:

Your Lordship, she has just answered that
question.

That is not the purpose of
cross-examination, it is not to repeat the same thing, she has just said that
it was September 13, 1968.

Mr. Lagacé

Counsel for the Defence:

Q. You identified the photograph of
Mr. Latour how long after the robbery?

A. About three-quarters of an hour.

Q. After the robbery?

A. Yes, the time it took me to get to Montreal.

Q. Do you recognize Mr. Latour here
today?

A. Yes.

Q. Is he the individual you have seen when
the Serre jewellery was robbed?

A. Yes.

Q. You are sure—you are under oath?

A. I am as sure as I was when I identified
the photograph.

[Page 366]

Appellant submits that this rebuttal evidence
should not have been admitted for the following reasons, inter alia:

(1) if this rebuttal evidence was to attack
credibility, it offends the principle that a collateral fact, put in evidence
by the Crown in its cross-examination of the defence witnesses, may not be
contradicted by the Crown;

(2) if, on the other hand, this rebuttal
evidence claims to attack the alibi, it has no basis in fact, since neither
Latour nor Dulude stated that, according to Dulude’s books, Latour was at work
on September 13, 1968, though they did testify he was at work on June 25 and
26, 1968.

Bernier J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal,
rejected these two grounds of appeal:

[TRANSLATION] It appears from appellant’s
testimony that he was still working for the Dulude grocery store in October
1968; moreover, during cross-examination, the Crown Attorney drew from him that
he did not know the Serre jewellery store in Laprairie, and that he had never
been there. These questions were asked without objections; there is reason to
believe that if objections had been made, the judge presiding at the trial
would have allowed them, in the circumstances.

This is the context of the rebuttal
evidence. It appears that it had the purpose of further discrediting the alibi,
already greatly weakened by the cross-examination of the accused and Dulude,
and at the same time, the credibility of the accused with respect to the other
part of his testimony, that is, his statement that he had never been to St-Rémi
and did not know the Létourneau jewellery store.

In calling Lyne Martin, the Crown did not
complete the evidence which it should have given in chief, but, provided that
the jury believed Miss Martin, it established that the accused had lied during
cross-examination.

I cannot agree with this conclusion. The defence
of alibi related only to June 25 and 26, 1968: not a word was said about September 13, 1968; nor was this date mentioned
during the cross-examination of Latour regarding the Serre jewellery store. The
right of the Crown to contradict a defence of alibi is, it goes without saying,
unquestionable, but it is also indisputable that this right may only be
exercised by attacking the material points of the alibi advanced by the
accused. If, for example, Miss Martin had stated that she had seen appellant at

[Page 367]

the Serre jewellery store on June 25 or 26,
1968, her testimony would clearly have been relevant in the context of the
development of the evidence up to that time. However, that was not the case
here, and appellant was right to maintain that the rebuttal evidence designed
to establish that he was in Laprairie on September 13, 1968 does not rebut his
statement that he was not in St-Rémi on June 25 and 26 of that year.

Viewed as an attack on credibility, the rebuttal
evidence is still inadmissible. In the context of the charge against him, the
negative answer given by Latour in cross-examination to the prosecution’s
suggestion that he knew the Serre jewellery store in Laprairie relates to a
collateral fact, and does not open the way to rebuttal evidence. The principle
is clear, and as examples we need only refer to R. v. Cargill[2], R. v. Hrechuk[3] and R. v. Rafael[4].

The Crown did not suggest that in the case at
bar the testimony of Lyne Martin could be admitted because it established a
similar fact independently of the defence of alibi. That is what the trial
judge explained to the jury in his charge:

[TRANSLATION] A somewhat different
situation presented itself when Miss Martin was called to testify to the effect
that she identified the accused specifically when he had committed a holdup at
a later date, October 12, pardon me, September 13, this evidence normally—if
there had not been a question of an alibi—this evidence would justify me in
ordering a new trial, a mistrial, and discharging the jury. However, given that
there was a defence of alibi, the law permits similar fact evidence to be
given; in this situation, however, without examining the Crown’s intentions in
developing its evidence, I nevertheless find that this girl squarely
contradicted the testimony of the accused when she said that he had gone to the
Serre jewellery store, and that he did so in a holdup. So you must not take
this part of her evidence, relating to the holdup, as evidence of bad
character.

[Page 368]

This position of the Crown is clearly correct.
The conditions in which similar fact evidence is permitted are not found here;
they were examined recently in two decisions of this Court: Leblanc v. The
Queen[5] and
Boulet v. The Queen[6].

The Crown, moreover, did not contend that the
lack of objection by the defence at the trial prevented appellant from raising
the illegality of the rebuttal evidence. That also is in accordance with
principle, and I need only refer to R. v. Rosik[7].

Is this a matter in which, notwithstanding the
admission of illegal rebuttal evidence, it is possible to state that no
significant harm was caused, so that the appeal should be dismissed (s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code )? I do not think so. Not only does the Crown have
the burden of proving the absence of significant harm, see The Queen v.
Vézeau[8], but
the extract which I have cited from the judge’s charge shows the importance
which he attached to the testimony of Lyne Martin, an importance which surely
influenced the jury.

Faced with the conclusion I have reached, I
would normally have to order a new trial. However, appellant has asked the
Court to make an order of acquittal, noting, among other things, the
exceptional circumstances of the record. Crown counsel, at the hearing, agreed
with this proposal if we concluded that the appeal should succeed. In my
opinion, we should comply with this agreement.

I would allow the appeal and order that a
verdict of acquittal be entered.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Statutes—Interpretation—Ambiguities—Successive
revisions in both French and English versions—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, ss. 213, 306—Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 1-23, s. 36.

Criminal law—Murder—Burglary—Meaning of “burglary”—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 213, 306—Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. 1-23, s. 36.

At a jury trial in Toronto the respondents, together with Radco Govedarov and Sreto Dzambas,
were found guilty of murder. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of
Govedarov and Dzambas but ordered a new trial for the respondents, since, in
the opinion of the majority, the trial judge had erred in directing the jury
that breaking into the restaurant should be considered as burglary within the
meaning of s. 213  of the Criminal Code  whereas, in their view, burglary
meant breaking into a dwelling-house only. The subsequent appeal was taken only
by virtue of the dissent in the Court of Appeal which relied particularly on
the expression “vol avec effraction” used in the French text of s. 213 .

Held (Judson
and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The Criminal Code ,
1892, in s. 228  concerning constructive murder refers to “burglary”, using
in the French version the term “effraction nocturne”, and in Part XXX entitled
“Burglary and housebreaking” defines “burglary”, using in the French version
“effraction nocturne (burglary)”. It was clear that burglary as referred
to in these sections meant not common law burglary but burglary as defined
in that Code. Successive revisions of the Code introduced
discrepancies making the Code seriously defective in both languages.
However a review of the various revisions and of the legislation respecting the
Revised Statutes indicates that the provisions with respect to burglary of

[Page 309]

what is now s. 213  of the Criminal Code  are
in substance the same as these of s. 228  of the Criminal Code , 1892, as
reproduced in the revisions of 1906 and 1927, to which no change was made in
the 1970 revision. “Burglary” therefore, in the absence of any indication of
Parliament’s intent to alter that provision, still means the offence defined as
such in s. 410  of the Criminal Code , 1892, coupled with the definitions
of “dwelling-house” and “break” in s. 407 .

The conclusion, based on a review of previous
enactments of the Criminal Code  made necessary in both languages by an
ambiguity in the Code presently in force, gives full effect to the
principles respecting the effect of codification as stated by Lord Herschell in
Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers, [1891] A.C. 107 at pp. 144-5.

Per Judson and
de Grandpré JJ. dissenting: The dissenting reasons delivered in the
Court of Appeal by Schroeder J.A. should be adopted in full, the appeal allowed
and the convictions at trial affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1[1]
ordering a new trial on appeals by the respondents against convictions of murder.
Appeal dismissed, Judson and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

Patricia Peters, for the respondent,
Nicholas Popovic.

Michael Lynch, for the respondent, Elija
Askov.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—At a jury trial in Toronto the respondents, together with
Radco Govedarov and

[Page 310]

Sreto Dzambas, were found guilty of having
murdered one Trevor Poll. The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of
Govedarov and Dzambas but ordered a new trial for the two others1.
In the opinion of the majority, the trial judge had erred in directing the jury
that breaking into the restaurant where the murder was committed could be
considered as burglary within the meaning of s. 213 , Cr.C . In their
view, burglary meant breaking into a dwelling-house only. Schroeder J.A.
dissented on that point relying particularly on the expression “vol avec
effraction” used in the French version of s. 213 .

The appeal to this Court was taken solely by
virtue of this dissent, the Attorney General for Ontario stating the ground of appeal as follows in his inscription:

That the Court of Appeal erred in law in
holding that breaking and entering the restaurant with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein did not constitute the offence of “burglary” as found in
Section 213  of the Criminal Code .

In the circumstances of this case, I find it
necessary to make a full review of the relevant legislation in both languages.

In the Criminal Code , 1892 (Can.), c. 29, the relevant part of s. 228
concerning constructive murder was as follows:

228.
Culpable homicide is also murder in each of the following cases, whether the
offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to
ensue:

(a) If he means to inflict grievous
bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the
offences in this section mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the
commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury;
or…

2. The following are the offences in this
section referred to:- Treason and the other offences mentioned

[Page 311]

in. Part IV of this Act, piracy and
offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody, resisting
lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery, burglary,
arson.

The term used for burglary in the French version
was “effraction nocturne”.

Burglary was defined as such in Part XXX
entitled “Burglary and housebreaking” as follows:

410. Every
one is guilty of the indictable offence called burglary, and liable to
imprisonment for life, who—

(a) breaks and enters a
dwelling-house by night with intent to commit any indictable offence therein;
or

(b) breaks out of any dwelling-house
by night, either after committing an indictable offence therein, or after
having entered such dwelling-house, either by day or by night with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein.

In the French version, the term used to describe
the offence was as in s. 228  “effraction nocturne” but followed by “(burglary)”.

Thus, it was perfectly clear that the “burglary”
mentioned in the constructive murder provision was not the common law burglary
but statutory burglary as defined in the Code. In this respect, I would
note further that while s. 228  had no counterpart in previous Canadian
statutory law, murder not being defined in the Act respecting Offences
against the person, R.S.C. 1886, c. 162, burglary was defined in the Larceny
Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 164, as follows:

37. Every
one who enters the dwelling-house of another with intent to commit any felony
therein, or being in such dwelling-house, commits any felony therein, and, in
either case, breaks out of such dwelling-house in the night, is guilty of
burglary.

In the French version of the Larceny Act, the
words used were as in the Code “effraction noc-

[Page 312]

turne (burglary)”. In that act, “night” was also
defined in s. 2(k) as in the Code (9 p.m. to 6 a.m.), but
“dwelling-house” and “break” were not given the extended meaning stated in s.
407 of the Code.

As I have already said, I have no doubt that in
s. 228 , “burglary” necessarily meant “the indictable offence called burglary”
as defined in s. 410  and related provisions, in other words, statutory burglary
as defined in the Code, not the common law offence. Although substantially
broadened, it remained an offence that could be committed only in respect of
dwelling-houses at night.

In the 1906 revision, which was not a
Parliamentary revision but the work of commissioners, considerable changes in
wording were effected in both versions. This was done under the authority of
the Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1903 (Can.), c. 61, where the first paragraph of
s. 3 was as follows:

3. The said
Commissioners in consolidating the said statutes and in incorporating therewith
the Acts or parts of Acts passed subsequent thereto and selected for inclusion
therein as above provided may make such alterations in their language as are
requisite in order to preserve a uniform mode of expression, and may make such
minor amendments as are necessary to bring out more clearly what they deem to
be the intention of Parliament or to reconcile seemingly inconsistent
enactments or to correct clerical or typographical errors.

The revision was not brought into force by
proclamation under that act but by the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, Act, 1907 (Can.), c. 43,
from which I shall quote the following provisions:

3. The
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, are hereby confirmed and declared to have and
to have had, on, from and after the thirty-first day of January, 1907, the
force of law as if herein enacted…

7. The said
Revised Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws, but shall be
construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as
contained in the said Acts and parts of Acts so repealed, and for which the
said Revised Statutes are substituted.

[Page 313]

2. If upon any point the provisions of the
said Revised Statutes are not in effect the same as those of the repealed Acts
and parts of Acts for which they are substituted, then, as respects all
transactions, matters and things subsequent to the time when the said Revised
Statutes take effect, the provisions contained in them shall prevail, but, as
respects all transactions, matters and things anterior to the said time, the
provisions of the said repealed Acts and parts of Acts shall prevail.

10. The Governor
in Council may appoint two or more competent persons to prepare the French
version of the said Revised Statutes, and they shall proceed as speedily as
possible to make and complete such version and report the same to the Governor
in Council.

2. The Governor General shall thereupon cause a
printed roll of the version so made and reported, attested under the signature
of the Governor General and that of the Clerk of the Parliaments, to be
deposited in the office of the said Clerk, and such roll shall be deemed to be
the authentic original French version of the said statutes, and as such shall have
the force of law as if herein enacted.

Thus, the 1906 revised statutes were brought
into force at first in the English version only. The French version was so
carelessly done that in the re-arranged s. 260, corresponding to s. 228 of
the 1892 Code, four offences were omitted namely, “le meurtre, le viol,
le rapt, le vol à main armée” (murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery).
While “burglary” remained unchanged in the English version, “effraction
nocturne” was replaced by “effraction de nuit”. Then, under the heading “Burglary
and Housebreaking”, in French, “Effractions” instead of “Des
effractions et escalades”, the words “called burglary” were deleted from s.
457 (formerly s. 410 ) as well as the words “called housebreaking” in s. 458.
Why this was done is not apparent.

As a result of all those changes, the two
versions, if considered by themselves, exhibited a most serious discrepancy. In
the English, the word “burglary” remained only in s. 260 and in the heading
preceding ss. 455 to 465 where it was coupled with housebreaking so that there
was no longer any-

[Page 314]

thing to indicate what was burglary and what was
housebreaking. Unless one went back to the previous enactment, it could be
argued that in s. 260 (constructive murder) “burglary” was now to be read in
its ordinary sense, nothing showing that under the heading “Burglary and
Housebreaking” the first word meant the offence described in s. 457. On the
other hand, in the French version of s. 260 “effraction de nuit” clearly meant
any break-in by night, “Effractions” being the heading under which
shopbreaking as well as burglary and housebreaking were defined.

Thus, if the two versions of s. 260 of the 1906 Code
were now read literally, the result was a major change concerning
“burglary” in both versions but in opposite directions. In the English, it
would be restricted to common law burglary instead of statutory burglary as
defined in the Code of 1892, in the French, it would be broadened to
include any break-in by night.

In my view, it is clear that neither Parliament
nor the commissioners intended to effect any change of substance. Although s.
16(2) of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, Act repealed the 1903 statute,
it is clear enough that, in effect, the 1903 statute was not repealed but replaced
by the new enactment. This is apparent from the first paragraph of s. 16 which
amends the 1903 enactment; if it was intended to be wiped out, it was pointless
to amend it. On account of the discrepancies between the two versions of the
1906 Criminal Code , the conclusion should be that no change of substance
was intended, and there were only misguided attempts at improvements in
drafting which resulted in making the Criminal Code  seriously defective
in both languages.

What those actually responsible for these
unfortunate changes—the ill results of which persist to this day—failed to
appreciate was that they could not possibly give to the changes they were
making the kind of exhaustive consideration that had been given by the framers
of the original Code. They

[Page 315]

also did not take into consideration something
which the authors of the original Code had not overlooked, namely, the
importance of having such statutes in readable form. By this I mean enactments
that are readily understandable upon hearing them read. This is especially
desirable with respect to such provisions as the definitions of crimes which
must be read to the juries. For readability, it is necessary that sentences be
short and unencumbered by incidentals, lists and enumerations. These
requirements were substantially met in s. 228 of the original Code by
listing the offences separately as ss. 2. Also, it is obvious that for
readability the use of names rather than of section numbers for referring
to offences is preferable, provided the names used are specific enough and
their meaning is not too remote from the usual sense. These requirements were
met in the original Code where, in s. 410 , the words “the indictable
offence called burglary” made the meaning of the word “burglary” in s. 228 
perfectly clear.

The Revised Statutes of Canada 1927 were
made and proclaimed pursuant to the provisions of the Act respecting the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1924 (Can.), c. 65, s. 3 of this act was the
same as s. 3 of the 1903 Act, and s. 8 the same as s. 7 of the 1906 Act. The
numbering of Criminal Code  ss. 260  and 457  was unchanged. The wording
also was unchanged in the English version. However, in the French version of s.
260 , the words inadvertently omitted in 1906 were restored but the words “de
nuit” after “effraction” were dropped so that, instead of “burglary” in the
English, the French now meant “break-in”, no change being made in s. 457  or in
the heading “Effractions” preceding s. 455 .

It is perfectly obvious that the 1927 revision
was never intended to alter the constructive murder provision so as to make it
applicable to every break-in as the words used in the French version would have
it. The fact that the English version remained entirely unchanged is a clear
indication that no change was intended to be made in the

[Page 316]

provisions with which we are concerned.
Therefore, the legal situation remained as after the 1906 revision, namely,
that in spite of the unfortunate ambiguities introduced by the altered wording,
the meaning of s. 260  was the same as of s. 228  of the Criminal Code , 1892,
namely, burglary as there defined.

The changes effected in 1947 by c. 55, ss. 6 and
7 consisted in putting “indecent assault” among the offences mentioned in s.
260  and in adding paragraph (d). These amendments have no bearing on the
question raised in this case.

In 1950, by s. 5 of c. 11, ss. 457, 458 and 459
were replaced by a single section which combined in a single offence
carrying the same penalty the offences which, in the 1892 Code, were
called burglary and housebreaking and the unnamed offence in s. 412 (then s.
459). The new section read:

457. (1)
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for
life who

(a) breaks and enters a
dwelling-house with intent to commit any indictable offence therein; or

(b) breaks and enters any
dwelling-house and commits any indictable offence therein; or

(c) breaks out of any dwelling-house
either after committing any indictable offence therein, or after having entered
such dwelling-house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

(2) Every one convicted of an offence under
this section who when arrested, or when he committed such offence, had
upon his person any offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the imprisonment
above prescribed, be liable to be whipped.

(3) The breaking and entering of a
dwelling-house or the breaking out of a dwelling‑house after having
entered such dwelling-house shall be prima facie evidence of an intent
to commit an indictable offence therein.

No change was made in the heading “Burglary
and Housebreaking” or in s. 260 .

With respect, Martin J.A. is mistaken, I think,
in the view (at p. 27) that “thereafter, the offence of burglary in s. 260 
referred to breaking and

[Page 317]

entering in a dwelling-house either by day or by
night”. This conclusion is at variance with the opinion previously expressed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. Lachance[2] in the following words (at p. 133):

By ss. 292, 295 of the present Criminal
Code  the distinction between burglary or breaking and entering by night and
breaking and entering by day has been abolished, but since the framers of the
present Criminal Code  continued to use the word “burglary” in the constructive
murder section, present s. 202 , that word should be given the meaning assigned
to it in s. 410 , combined with ss. 3  (q), 407  (b) and 407  (b)
(i) (ii) of the Criminal Code  of 1892, 55-56 Vict., c. 29 above set out.

In s. 260 the crucial word is “burglary”. For
the reasons previously given, this word meant, when the 1950 amendment was
made, burglary as defined in the Code of 1892. To alter the scope of s.
260 and to make it applicable also to what was then known as “housebreaking”
plus another unnamed offence, there would have to be some indication of Parliament’s
intention to effect such a change. Constructive murder is a most serious
offence at that time carrying the death penalty, now mandatory life
imprisonment. I can find no indication of such intention.

It is true that in accordance with s. 7 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906, Act and s. 8 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, Act, the provisions of s. 260 are to be read as having the
same effect as s. 228 of the Code of 1892 in spite of the deletion of
the words “called burglary” in what was s. 410  and became s. 457 . If those
words were in the new s. 457  enacted in 1950, it might be that Parliament would
be deemed to have had in mind that the word “burglary” was used in s. 260 and
intended that section to be read in the future as referring to the offence
now described under that name. Such is not the case. The words “called
burglary” were not only deleted by the 1906 revi-

[Page 318]

sion and left out in the 1927 revision, they
were not restored in the new s. 457  enacted in 1950. That new section did
not purport to define burglary; it only combined in a single offence what was
formerly known as burglary, housebreaking and another offence. Moreover, it
remained under the heading “Burglary and Housebreaking”. While the 1906
and 1927 revisions had to be construed not as new laws but as consolidations,
effect must also be given to the subsection directing that, for the
future, the new provisions shall govern although different from those that
existed before. Even accepting that the offence then defined in s. 457  was
still “burglary”, there was nothing to indicate that the combined offence was
to be “burglary” within the meaning of s. 260. There is no such indication in
the enactment itself or in the explanatory note quoted in Martin’s Criminal
Code  1955 (p. 514), which explanatory note, I am afraid, may no more be
considered for purposes of construction than any other portion of the
parliamentary history of an enactment. (Attorney-General of Canada v. Reader’s
Digest Association (Canada) Ltd.)[3].

We now come to the parliamentary revision
effected by c. 51 of the Statutes of Canada 1953‑54 (Can.). In the Criminal
Code  thus enacted, the constructive murder provision is s. 202 . Although it
was completely re-arranged in one long sentence including several paragraphs
and subparagraphs, no substantial change was made in the English version. There
was, however, a notable change in the French version. For “burglary” the
expression used now is “un vol avec effraction” instead of “effraction”. Of
course, “effraction” meaning any break-in was much too wide, but the new
expression is equally inappropriate.

As Schroeder J.A. noted (at p. 14), Harrap’s New
Shorter French Dictionary defines “bur-

[Page 319]

glary” as “vol de nuit avec effraction”. From a lexicographer’s point of view, this is quite accurate because
in an English dictionary, the French equivalent of English legal terminology
must be expressed in terms of the vocabulary used in the law of France. But the
meaning of words used to describe legal concepts is not purely a matter of
common usage in any given country. It is inevitably largely dependent on the
actual words used in its legislation, in France, in the Code pénal. In
that Code, “effraction” is defined in art. 393 but it is not a crime by
itself, only a “circonstance aggravante” (an aggravating circumstance), art.
381 to 389 prescribing varying penalties for theft according to the
“circonstances”. These include not only “effraction” but also night-time,
weapons, “maison habitée” (dwelling-house), etc. Thus, in order to describe the
crime of burglary in the vocabulary of the French Code pénal, one would
have to speak of “vol de nuit avec effraction dans une maison habitée” (theft
at night by breaking into a dwelling-house). Even this would not be completely accurate
because it would cover only theft, not any indictable offence as burglary does.

In section 228 of the Criminal Code , 1892,
the expression “effraction nocturne” was unequivocal only because, in s. 410 
defining burglary, this was said to be the name of the offence. But, the
expression “vol avec effraction” in the French version of s. 202  (now s. 213 )
of the present Criminal Code  does not describe an offence known as such
anywhere in our Code. The only possible conclusion is that this
expression as used in the French version is imprecise and ambiguous.

One must now turn to s. 292 (now s. 306). The
words burglary and housebreaking have disappeared, the heading above ss. 292 to
295 (now ss. 306 to 311) is now “Breaking and Entering”, and s. 292 is
as follows:

Breaking
and Entering

292.

(1) Every one who

(a) breaks and enters a place with
intent to commit an indictable offence therein;

(b) breaks and enters a place and
commits an indictable offence therein; or

[Page 320]

(c) breaks out of a place after

(i) committing an indictable offence
therein, or

(ii) entering the place with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein,

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable

(d) to imprisonment for life, if the
offence is committed in relation to a dwelling house, or

(e) to imprisonment for fourteen
years, if the offence is committed in relation to a place other than a dwelling
house.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under
this section, evidence that an accused

(a) broke and entered a place is prima
facie evidence that he broke and entered with intent to commit an
indictable offence therein; or

(b) broke out of a place is prima
facie evidence that he broke out after

(i) committing an indictable offence
therein, or

(ii) entering with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein.

(3) [Repealed, 1972, c. 13, s. 24.]

(4) For the purposes of this section,
“place” means

(a) a dwelling house,

(b) a building or structure or any
part thereof, other than a dwelling house,

(c) a railway vehicle, vessel,
aircraft or

(d) a pen or enclosure in which
fur-bearing animals are kept in captivity for breeding or commercial purposes.

It will be noted that shop-breaking has been
combined with burglary, housebreaking and kindred offences into a single
offence covering breaking and entering a “place”. However, the punishment
differs according to whether the “place” is a dwelling house or not. A
“dwelling house” is defined in s. 2 (14) which is substantially to the same
effect as previous enactments.

I have reviewed the dictionaries current in 1954
to see whether it might be said that, due to legislation enacted by many states
defining “burglary” so as to cover all break-ins, the word might have

[Page 321]

acquired a new meaning. The results of this
search have been so negative that I do not find it necessary to elaborate or to
supply references.

Concerning the French version, I need say
nothing more than that the heading has been changed to read “Introduction
par effraction”, which is far from being an improvement over the single word
“Effractions” that was a proper title. The word “introduction” seems to
have been added merely for the purpose of not having one word in the French
version where there were two in English, in my view, a wholly misconceived
notion. Each version should be written in accordance with the idiom (“le génie
de la langue”). If a single word is a proper expression in one language, I
consider it basically wrong to use two or more because that is desirable or
necessary in the other. In our present Code, this has been carried to
absurdity. The heading above s. 374 (now s. 389) is Arson and Other Fires. In
the French version this reads “Crime d’incendie et autres incendies” (Criminal
Fire and Other Fires).

Although it is an argument by analogy, and of
doubtful value at best, it was strenuously contended that “arson” in the
constructive murder section no longer has its common law meaning, but
extends to all those offences that are enumerated in s. 374 of the 1955 Code
(now s. 389). I do not find it necessary to express an opinion on this
point, but will note that in the 1906 revision, the name of this offence was
not eliminated as was done for burglary. Section 511 of 1906 read as s.
482  of the Criminal Code , 1892:

511. Every
one is guilty of the indictable offence of arson…

This was not changed in the 1927 revision and
the equivalent words remained “l’acte criminel d’incendie”. Just what was the
effect of the elimination of the word “arson” from the description of the
offence in s. 374 (now s. 389) coupled with the enlargement of the definition
of that offence need not be determined. However, it should be noted

[Page 322]

that the caption “ARSON” in Martin’s and
Cartwright’s Criminal Codes is the marginal note in the statute and by virtue
of s. 13 of the Interpretation Act “forms no part of the enactment”.

Consideration must however be given to the
following provisions of s. 36 of the Interpretation Act:

36. Where an
enactment (in this section called the “former enactment”) is repealed and
another enactment (in this section called the “new enactment”) is
substituted therefor,

…

(f) except to the extent that the
provisions of the new enactment are not in substance the same as those of the
former enactment, the new enactment shall not be held to operate as new law,
but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of
the law as contained in the former enactment;

…

It seems clear to me that with respect to
burglary the provisions of what is now s. 213  of the Criminal Code  are
in substance the same as those of the former enactment which was s. 228  of the Criminal
Code  1892 as reproduced in the two successive revisions of 1906 and 1927.
No change was made in the 1970 revision and I cannot find anywhere the
slightest indication of Parliament’s intent to alter that provision. This means
that, in my view, “burglary” still means the offence defined as such in s. 410 
of the Criminal Code  1892, coupled with the definitions of
“dwelling-house” and “break” in s. 407 .

This conclusion gives full effect to the principles
respecting the effect of codification as stated by Lord Herschell in Bank of
England v. Vagliano Brothers[4] at pp.
144-5. I am not going back to the common law meaning of burglary and see no
reason for so doing. All common law offences have now disappeared. However, due
to inadequacies in the successive revisions, it is unfortunately necessary to
go back to the initial enactment because only thus is it possible to find the
proper meaning.

[Page 323]

It is certainly much to be deplored that such
should be the situation and I agree that the utmost should be done to ascertain
the intent of Parliament by considering only the Code presently in
force. However, there is here such an ambiguity that it is absolutely necessary
to go back to previous enactments. It is particularly regrettable that from
1906 to this day, both versions of what is now s. 213  should have been
ambiguous not to say misleading; I trust it will not be considered improper for
me to express the hope that this will soon be rectified and my observations
will be of some utility in this respect.

I conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Judson and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

JUDSON J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
dissenting reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal by Schroeder J.A.[5], and I adopt those reasons in full.

I would, therefore, allow this appeal and affirm
the convictions at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Indictment—Construction—Wording
not clear whether offence charged one of “causing death by criminal negligence”
under s. 203 or “criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle”
under s. 233(1)—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 203, 233(1).

The respondent was convicted under
s. 203  of the Criminal Code  on a charge that he “…was criminally
negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle and did, thereby, cause death…
contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code .” The trial judge sentenced him
to a term of five years and in addition prohibited him from driving a motor
vehicle on a highway anywhere in Canada for a period of 15 years.

On appeal, the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta quashed the conviction under s. 203  but found the
respondent guilty under s. 233(1) of the Code. The Appellate
Division substituted a sentence of imprisonment for nine months and a
prohibition from driving for three years.

With leave, the Crown appealed to this Court.
The question at issue was whether the offence alleged in the indictment was
that of “causing death by criminal negligence” contrary to the provisions of
s. 203  of the Criminal Code  or merely one of “criminal negligence
in the operation of a motor vehicle” contrary to s. 233(1) .

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed, the conviction at trial restored and the case returned to the Appellate
Division for consideration of the appeal against sentence imposed pursuant to
that judgment.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: The gravamen of the charge was
that the

[Page 843]

accused “was criminally negligent… and did
thereby cause death…”, and the fact that the means whereby the death was
caused, i.e., by being “criminally negligent in the operation of a motor
vehicle”, were also alleged did not alter the fact that the respondent was
charged as “one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person”
within the meaning of s. 203  of the Criminal Code . By specifying
the kind of criminal negligence which caused the death, the Crown was doing no
more than providing the respondent with particulars of the charge against him.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ., dissenting: The charge as framed
was capable of being regarded as charging either crime i.e., criminal
negligence under s. 233(1)  of the Criminal Code  or homicide under
s. 203 . In this state of ambiguity, the ambiguity should be resolved in
favour of the accused. The Court ought not to construe an ambiguous charge as
referring to the graver of two possible offences but rather to the less serious
one, especially where, as in this case, its charging words are in the language
of the less serious offence.

[Schwartzenhauer v. The King, [1935]
S.C.R. 367, distinguished.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, allowing the respondent’s appeal from his
conviction under s. 203  of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed,
Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

B. Pannu and B.A. Crane, for the
appellant.

M. Harradence, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The only
question in this appeal with which I think it necessary to deal is whether the
charge against the accused was one of criminal negligence under s. 233(1) 
of the Criminal Code  or homicide under s. 203 . These two sections read,
respectively, as follows:

233. (1)
Every one who is criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle is
guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for five years, or

[Page 844]

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

203. Every
one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

The charge upon which the accused was tried was
in these words:

You Wayne Donald McGloan stand charged
before the Honourable Mr. Justice M.E. Manning, that you at or near
Penhold in the Judicial District of Red Deer in the Province of Alberta, on or
about the 19th day of May, A.D. 1973, [were] criminally negligent in the
operation of a motor vehicle and did, thereby, cause death to Cary Lou Gatchke,
contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code …

This was the charge read to the accused at the
opening of the trial. I note particularly that there was no section number
of the Criminal Code  that was part of the charge as read to the accused
and as recorded in the transcript. When Crown counsel opened he made no
reference to the Criminal Code  identification of the offence on which
the accused was to be tried.

The submissions that counsel made to the trial
judge (who was sitting without a jury) at the conclusion of the evidence are
also in the record that is before this Court. Apart from Crown counsel’s
statement at the beginning of his argument, in which he simply repeated the
allegations in the charge in the words of the charge, adding only that “it was
admitted… that Cary Gatchke died as a result of injuries received in this
accident”, there is nothing in the argument to suggest that the Crown was
seeking a conviction under s. 203 . The argument of counsel for the defence
proceeded clearly on the basis of a charge under s. 233(1)  and he urged
that at the most there was dangerous driving under s. 233(4). He concluded
as follows: “There is no evidence to substantiate the charge of criminal negligence
within the meaning of the Criminal Code .” The trial judge in a comment at the
conclusion of the arguments of counsel spoke only of the “crime of criminal
negligence”. It was only after the trial judge found the accused “guilty as
charged” and Crown counsel proceeded to speak to sentence that the issue was
raised by Crown counsel of a penalty under s. 203 . Defence counsel

[Page 845]

immediately objected, saying the charge was
under s. 233(1)  and addressed himself to the question of sentence for that
offence.

The trial judge imposed a sentence of five
years’ imprisonment, the maximum for an offence under s. 233(1) , and also
made an order prohibiting the accused from driving on any highway in Canada for fifteen years. This
last-mentioned order could only be related to a conviction under s. 203 ,
as is evident from s. 238 under which the order was made.

I am of the opinion that there ought to have
been a clearer indication from the beginning as to the charge on which the
accused was to be tried. True enough, the specification of a Code section in
the charge is not mandatory, but in this case it would have had a clarifying
effect. The record seems to me to suggest that counsel for the accused may have
been misled by the terms of the charge when preparing the defence. The Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta thought that the charge came under
s. 233(1)  and not under s. 203  when it substituted a conviction under
the former provision. So we are left, at worst from the accused’s standpoint,
with a situation where the charge as framed was capable of being regarded as
charging either crime. In this state of ambiguity, I am of the view that the
ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the accused, a view obviously held by
the Alberta Appellate Division, if indeed, it felt that there was any
uncertainty.

The appeal case lodged here by the Crown in
respect of its appeal does not contain a copy of the indictment as laid, but
only a copy of the information which itself contains no Code section number
but is in the exact form of the charge read at the trial. The file of the case,
which was available to the Court, includes a number of documents to which I
wish to refer. There is the Provincial judge’s report of committal on the
charge in the information, a report which is signed by the Provincial judge and
which reports explicitly that the

[Page 846]

accused was charged with criminal negligence,
s. 233(1)  Criminal Code  and committed for trial accordingly. The
names of Crown counsel and defence counsel (they appeared at trial and in the
Appellate Division) are included. Next there is a copy of the indictment as
preferred by Crown counsel as agent of the Attorney General. There is no
variation in the wording of the charge as it was recited in the information but
at the bottom of the page are the typed words “Sec. 203  Criminal Code ”.
Then there is a document headed “Report of the Criminal Trial”, signed and
verified as correct by the Deputy Clerk of the Court. This report shows that
the trial took place before Manning J., that the offence charged was “Section
233(1) C.C. Criminal Negligence”, that there was a plea of not guilty and that
the accused was convicted as charged and a sentence imposed in the terms I have
already set out.

I cannot agree that on this material the accused
or his counsel should have had no doubt as to the exact charge against him.
Perhaps defence counsel was as much at fault as Crown counsel in not clarifying
the nature of the charge when they were before the trial judge and at the
opening of the trial. In my opinion, however, it is for the Crown rather than
for the accused to bear the consequences of the uncertainty that the official
records created.

In Schwartzenhauer v. The King[1], the charge against the accused was
that he counselled or procured one [S] to use instruments on a woman [K] with
intent to procure her miscarriage “which offence the said [S] did commit and
did thereby kill and slay the said [K] against the form of the statute in such
case made and provided…”. The main point in the appeal to this Court was the
admissibility of a dying declaration which was the basis upon which the accused
was convicted of manslaughter. The conviction was set aside and an acquittal
entered on the ground that in the circum-

[Page 847]

stances the dying declaration was inadmissible,
but the opinion was expressed that the indictment did not charge homicide but
rather the counselling of a statutory offence of procuring an abortion. I
regard this opinion as supporting the view I hold here, namely, that the Court
ought not to construe an ambiguous charge as referring to the graver of two
possible offences but rather to the less serious one, especially where its
charging words are in the language of the less serious offence. That is the
present case, and I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

I may add that were I of a different opinion so
as to hold that the indictment properly charged manslaughter under s. 203 ,
I would agree that the case should be remitted to the Alberta Appellate
Division to review the sentence in the light of a conviction under s. 203 .
The accused did appeal sentence as well as conviction and the Appellate
Division should have the opportunity to consider the appropriateness of the
sentence on a conviction under s. 203 .

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court by the Attorney General of Alberta from a judgment of the
Appellate Divison of the Supreme Court of that Province whereby it was ordered
that the appeal of the present respondent from his conviction under s. 203 
of the Criminal Code  entered at trial before Mr. Justice Manning
sitting without a jury

…be allowed and the conviction be quashed
under section 203  but found guilty under section 233(1)  of the Criminal
Code . Sentence varied to become nine months’ imprisonment and prohibited
from driving a motor vehicle for a period of three years.

It was argued on behalf of the respondent that
the Attorney General had no right to appeal to this Court under s. 621(1) 
of the Criminal Code  because the Appellate Division did not “set
aside a conviction” but rather substituted a conviction for another offence
than that charged in the indictment. This argument is based on the opening

[Page 848]

paragraph of the reasons for judgment delivered
by Mr. Justice Prowse on behalf of the Appellate Division which reads as
follows:

The Court is of the view that the appeal
must be allowed to the extent of substituting a conviction under
section 233(1)  of the Criminal Code  instead of a conviction under
section 203  on the ground that the indictment clearly alleges an offence
in the wording of section 233(1)  and in our view the Appellant was guilty
of that offence.

I am unable to give effect to the contention
that the judgment of the Appellate Division did not set aside the conviction
having regard to the terms of the order allowing the appeal and particularly to
that part thereof which expressly stipulated that “the conviction be quashed
under section 203 ”.

The question at the heart of this appeal is
whether indeed the offence alleged in the indictment is that of “causing death
by criminal negligence” contrary to the provisions of s. 203  of the Criminal
Code  or merely one of “criminal negligence in the operation of a motor
vehicle” contrary to s. 233(1) . It is in my view desirable that both
sections should be reproduced in these reasons. Section 203  reads as
follows:

203. Every
one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

Section 233(1)  on the other hand provides that:

233. (1)
Every one who is criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle is
guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for five years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The indictment was framed in the following
language:

Wayne Donald McGloan stands charged

That he at or near Penhold in the Judicial
District of Red Deer in the Province of Alberta, on or about the 19th day of May,
A.D. 1973, was criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle and did
thereby cause death to Cary Lou Gatchke, contrary to the Provisions of the
Criminal Code .

[Page 849]

Dated this 1st day of November A.D. 1973 at
Red Deer, Alberta

Sec. 203 Criminal Code.


 
  
  B.S. PANNU
  
 
 
  
  Agent of the Attorney General
  
 


There is in my view no ambiguity in the charge
so laid although objection might have been taken to it as being duplicitous had
it not been for the provisions of s. 519(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code  which read as follows:

519. (1) A
count is not objectionable by reason only that…

(b) it is double or
multifarious.

The respondent, however, cited and relied on the
case of Schwartzenhauer v. The King[2] in support of the view expressed by
Mr. Justice Prowse in the passage which I have quoted from his reasons for
judgment. In that case the accused was charged that he did

…counsel or procure a certain person, to
wit, Grietje Sundquest, to commit an indictable offence, namely, to use
unlawfully on the person of Veronica Kuva an instrument or instruments with
intent to procure a miscarriage of Veronica Kuva, which offence the said
Grietje Sundquest did commit and did thereby kill and slay the said Veronica
Kuva against the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against
the peace of our Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.

This was treated at trial as being a charge of
murder and the accused was convicted of manslaughter. His conviction was
affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and the
matter came to this Court by reason of the dissenting judgment of
Mr. Justice McPhillips on the following grounds which are epitomized in
the formal judgment of the Court:

(1) The dying declaration of Veronica Kuva
was wrongfully admitted in evidence; or wrongfully admitted as to counselling;
and

(2) that the learned trial judge
misdirected the jury respecting the said evidence of the said Veronica Kuva.

In this Court it was unanimously agreed that the
dying declaration of a deceased could only be

[Page 850]

admitted where his or her death was the subject
of the charge and it was contended on behalf of the accused appellant that the
charge was one of counselling an abortion and not one of homicide and that the
declaration was therefore inadmissible. A careful consideration of the reasons
for judgment of the members of this Court discloses that the declaration was
found to be inadmissible on other grounds and the majority of the judges
expressly stated that they were disposing of the case without deciding whether
or not the charge might be considered one of homicide.

Counsel on behalf of the respondent in the
present case contended that it was held in the Schwartzenhauer case that
the “charge was one of counselling an abortion from which death resulted and
not homicide”, but as I have indicated the majority of the judges in that case
expressly refrained from making any such finding. The case therefore affords no
authority whatever, either by analogy or otherwise, to support the submission
that under the entirely different circumstances of the present case, the charge
was one of “criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle” contrary
to s. 233(1)  and not one of “causing death by criminal negligence”
contrary to s. 203 .

The gravamen of the charge here is that the
accused “was criminally negligent… and did thereby cause death…” and in my view
the fact that the means whereby the death was caused, i.e. by being
“criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle” are also alleged
does not alter the fact that the respondent is charged as “one who by criminal
negligence causes death to another person” within the meaning of s. 203  of
the Criminal Code . By specifying the kind of criminal negligence which
caused the death in this case, the Crown was, in my opinion, doing no more than
providing the respondent with particulars of the charge against him.

The second two paragraphs of the reasons for
judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Prowse read as follows:

With respect to the admissions supposedly made
at the beginning of the trial we are of the opinion that they

[Page 851]

were unsatisfactory and that in making
admissions the procedure set out in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
in Castellani v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 310, should be followed.

Admissions should be made in clear,
unambiguous terms and if the procedure set out in that case is followed it
should assist counsel in that regard. The effect of the admissions in dispute
is unimportant in view of the substitution of a conviction under s. 233
(1)  for the conviction entered under s. 203 .

As I consider that the conviction entered at
trial was a proper one, it becomes necessary to deal with the two paragraphs
last recited.

In this regard I find it necessary to reproduce
the record of the admission in question which appears to have been agreed to by
Mr. Doz on behalf of the accused:

MR. PANNU: (For the Crown)

At the outset, My Lord, I might bring to
the attention of the Court it is agreed that the person who is alleged to have
died as a result of the accident was a passenger in the accused’s vehicle and
she died as a result of the injuries.

MR. DOZ:

That is correct, My Lord, sustained in the
accident.

THE COURT:

Cary Lou Gatchke referred to in the charge
died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.

MR. DOZ:

In the accident.

MR. PANNU:

She was a passenger in the vehicle.

THE COURT:

She was a passenger in the vehicle?

MR. DOZ:

Accused’s vehicle.

THE COURT:

A vehicle being driven by the accused.

MR. DOZ:

The Crown will lead evidence to that
effect, sir.

Section 582  of the Criminal Code  provides:

[Page 852]

Where an accused is on trial for an
indictable offence he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for
the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.

In Castellani’s case an attempt was made
on behalf of the accused to have the Court accept a lengthy written admission
by the accused, one paragraph of which was objected to on the ground that it
had a tendency to disparage the Crown’s case and this paragraph was deleted.

In the course of the reasons for judgment which
he delivered on behalf of this Court, Chief Justice Cartwright commented on
s. 582  (562 as it then was) in the following language at p. 315:

In a criminal case, there being no
pleadings, there are no precisely worded allegations of fact which are
susceptible of categorical admission. An accused cannot admit a fact alleged
against him until the allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be
had to s. 562 it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact
or facts which it alleges against the accused, and of which it seeks admission.
The accused, of course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but
his choice is to admit it or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of
the allegation to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. To
permit such a course could only lead to confusion. The idea of the admission of
an allegation involves action by two persons, one who makes the allegation and
another who admits it.

In the present case the charge laid against the
respondent involved the allegation that Cary Lou Gatchke’s death was caused by
the manner in which the respondent operated his motor vehicle, and under the
circumstances, one of the facts which the Crown would have to prove in support
of this allegation was that the deceased died as a result of the injuries she
received while a passenger in the accused’s vehicle. The exchange between
counsel in open Court to which I have alluded, constituted an admission of this
fact, and with the greatest respect for Mr. Justice Prowse, it was made
“in clear, unambiguous terms” and I am further of opinion that the procedure
set out in the Castellani case was fully complied with.

It will be apparent that for all the above reasons
I am of opinion that the conviction entered at trial was a proper one and that
the trial judge did not

[Page 853]

err in accepting the admission then rendered. I
would therefore restore the conviction entered at trial.

The appeal to the Appellate Division included an
appeal from the sentence of five years’ imprisonment and a prohibition from
driving a motor vehicle in Canada for 15 years. The Appellate Division
substituted a sentence of imprisonment for nine months and a prohibition from
driving for three years on the basis of a conviction under s. 233 (1) . The
Appellate Division, however, had no opportunity to consider the appeal from the
sentence imposed pursuant to the conviction under s. 203  entered by the
trial judge. For this reason it appears to me desirable that the question of
sentence be remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration.

In the result, I would allow this appeal,
restore the conviction of the learned trial judge and direct that the case be
returned to the Appellate Division for consideration of the appeal against
sentence imposed pursuant to that judgment.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Appeal against sentence—No cross-appeal by Crown—Increased
sentence requested in Crown’s statement of fact and law—Sentence increased by
Court of Appeal—Right of Court of Appeal to increase sentence—Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, s. 41—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 603, 605,
607 and 614—Criminal Appeal Rules (Ont.), 10 to 25.

The accused had pleaded guilty to charges of
rape and wounding. He was sentenced to 12 years concurrent. On his appeal against
sentence this was increased to life imprisonment. Leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada was granted on the question whether, on an appeal by
the accused against sentence, where there was no cross appeal by the Crown to
have the sentence increased, the Court of Appeal on dismissing the appeal had
the power to increase the sentence imposed on the accused. The appeal was heard
before a Court composed of eight judges. In the result the appeal failed on an
equal division of the members of the Court. The accused made application for a
re-hearing; this was granted and the full bench considered the appeal on
re-argument.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Curiam: The
Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission of
an indictable offence but will not entertain an appeal against the fitness of a
sentence.

Per Martland,
Judson, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: Section 614(1) provides that, where an
appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against and may… vary the sentence with(in) the limits prescribed
by law for the offence… The words “vary the sentence within the limits
prescribed by law” are plain words which fix the scope of the power conferred
upon the Court by reference to the maximum applicable penalty and are not to be
read as restricted to a variation by way of reduction.

If the accused had not been given adequate
notice that at the hearing of his appeal consideration would be given to an
increase in his sentence, it would have to be held that he was not given an
opportunity to be heard before the adverse determination was made against him.
In this case, Counsel for the Crown made it known in the statement of fact and
law filed prior to the hearing. Due to this notice the objection to
jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. There is no basis for adverse
comment against Counsel for the Crown or the Court below.

Per Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ.: Parliament having fixed the Court of Appeal with the
obligation to “consider the fitness of the sentence”, it would take clear
statutory language to limit that consideration to the question of whether the
sentence was too severe while precluding any consideration of whether it was
severe enough. There is no such language in the Criminal Code  and s.
614(1)  constitutes a mandatory direction to the Court of Appeal to consider
both aspects of the question. The Court of Appeal has power to increase a
sentence when an appeal is taken in accordance with s. 603(1)  by a person
convicted at trial and this power is not dependant on an appeal being asserted
by the Crown under s. 605 .

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting: A right of appeal is
altogether statutory (s. 602) and is governed by the Criminal Code  and
as to procedure (s. 607 ) by the rules of court, in this case the Criminal
Appeal Rules (Ont.), 10 to 25. The Crown in serving notice on the appellant
attempted to assert a

[Page 829]

right of appeal from sentence without
complying with the provisions of the Code or the Rules. Further, the
powers of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are exact
and do not permit that court to exercise powers other than these given. The
powers in paras. (a) and (b) are disjunctive. The
word “or” at the end of para. (a) does not permit the Court to
exercise its jurisdiction under both paragraphs. It must choose whether to
exercise its powers under para. (a) by varying or under para. (b)
by dismissing the appeal. The Crown attempted to short-circuit the proper
procedure and to intimidate the accused from asserting his right of appeal.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting (after the first hearing): An appeal
should not be understood to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond
that already incurred as a result of the trial, especially where criminal
justice is involved. The judgment in appeal is a departure by a provincial
appellate Court from judicial justice and a venture into a species of
administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate procedure all the
more startling because criminal justice is involved.

Per Beetz J., dissenting:
After a re-hearing of the appeal there is no reason to alter the views
previously expressed.

Per Beetz J., dissenting
(after the first hearing): The wording of s. 614 was not meant to relieve
the Crown from the need to seek leave and, such leave being granted, from
actually appealing, merely because a convicted person avails himself of his
right to try to have his sentence reduced; nor does s. 614 give to the Court of
Appeal jurisdiction to hear what amounts to an appeal as of right by the Crown
despite the explicit provision in the Code and where no formal notice
was given to the convicted person.

RE-HEARING OF AN APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] imposing
a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant on an appeal from sentence, 12
years concurrent, on a plea of guilty to rape and to causing bodily harm.
Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

J.R. Belleghem, for the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. after
the first hearing was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had
the advantage of seeing the reasons proposed by my brothers Spence and Pigeon.
There are two questions in this appeal, a preliminary question of jurisdiction
and the question going to the merits on which leave to appeal was granted. Like
my brother Spence, I am in agreement with my brother Pigeon in his disposition
of the question of jurisdiction, a disposition that affirms jurisdiction in
this case and which consequently involves the overruling of the Goldhar case[2], and of other cases which adopted its
approach to deny jurisdiction. On the question of the merits, I am fully in
accord with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Spence.

What prompts me to add observations of my own
is a troubled concern about the way in which I think the two questions in this
appeal have been assessed. Both in the Goldhar case and in other cases,
such as Paul v. The Queen[3], which
applied it, and in the reasons of my brother Pigeon in the present case, the
issue of jurisdiction was resolved according to different canons of statutory
construction leading to different results. My brother Pigeon declares in the
preseSupreme Court of Canadant case in favour of literal construction while
Fauteux J. (as he then was) in Goldhar and in Paul was of the
view that literal construction would lead to repugnancy with other statutory
provisions.

[Page 831]

Does this mean then that the choice of a canon
of construction determines the meaning and application of a statutory provision
which is under review? My experience does not persuade me that the matter is so
simple. The relevant question is surely that of determining why one approach is
selected rather than another, involving therefore a consideration of the
factors that bear on the selection. I assume in this connection that different
results will flow according to the selection made. This is not however
invariably so. In the vast majority of the cases where statutes have to be
interpreted and the interpretation determines the result, it makes no
difference which canon of interpretation (be it the so-called literal rule or
the golden rule or the mischief rule) is chosen.

There are contradictions or difficulties in all
of the canons that have been usually relied on. Judges may disagree on what the
plain meaning is even when they agree that it is the plain meaning or literal
approach that should prevail. Similarly, judges may disagree on what is the
social purpose of a statute, although agreeing that under the mischief rule
that is what they should seek in construing a statutory provision. In my view,
we cannot escape making our own determination of purpose, or policy, regardless
of the canon that is invoked; indeed, we make it when we purport to apply one
canon rather than another. The present appeal is illustrative of this view in
respect of both of the questions that are involved in it.

I take first the preliminary question of
jurisdiction. It is to me unreal to think that literal construction determines
the result when in order to arrive at it a detailed review of legislative
history is required (and properly so) and the purpose of the measure under
review is pursued through an examination of the changes made in the
jurisdiction and role of this Court. Once it is admitted, as it must be here,
that reasonable men can differ on the effect of language directed to a
particular end which itself is in issue, we are in a situation where our
conclusion will be influenced by our view of what this Court’s jurisdiction and
role should be. Since I would not exclude cases from the leave jurisdiction of
this Court unless it is quite plain

[Page 832]

that they have been excluded by statute, and
since I do not regard the present appeal as plainly excluded I support the
conclusion of my brother Pigeon on the question of jurisdiction.

On the question of the merits, I think this is
eminently a case where under any canon of construction the result reached by my
brother Spence is the preferable one. I readily admit to a predisposition to
that result by reason of my dissent, as a member of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, in R. v. Willis[4]. My
conclusion there was based on a full examination of the legislative history, on
an assessment of social purpose as I saw it reflected in the statutory
language, and on my appreciation of the nature of an appeal. I have never
understood an appeal to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond that
already incurred as a result of the trial; and this must be especially so where
criminal justice is involved.

The result that I reached in the Willis case
and that I would reach here has been made even clearer to me by the canvass
that my brother Spence has made of the language of the various provisions of
the Criminal Code  bearing upon the issue, a canvass which emphasizes literal
construction of the whole of s. 614(1)  in the context of the rights of appeal
open to the Crown as well as to the accused.

The provincial appellate Courts in this country
appear to have been influenced by English cases without, at least so far as their
reasons disclose, dwelling on the terms of the English legislation on which
those cases were based. The judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Christakos[5], which
seems to have become a pivotal case on the question at issue, contains nothing
but a bare reference to some English cases. The majority in R. v. Willis
purported to proceed on a literal approach and it was applied without more
by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. R.[6] Since this was the approach taken by
my brother Spence in reaching an opposite result, I am reinforced in

[Page 833]

my observations on the canons of construction.

As is well known, the English Criminal Appeal
Act of 1907 (U.K.), c. 23
gave express power to increase a sentence on an appeal by the accused. There
was no right of appeal against sentence in the Crown, and hence it might well
have been the view of the Court of Appeal that the language of s. 4(3) of the
1907 Act (which empowered it “if they think that a different sentence should
have been imposed… [to] pass such other sentence warranted in law by the
verdict”) would support the exercise of power to impose a harsher sentence even
without express authority to do so. But s. 4(3) included the words “whether
more or less severe”, indicating an appreciation by the British Parliament of
the ordinary limits of an appeal, especially in criminal matters. I may add
that the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1968 (U.K.), c. 19, s. 10, as
amended by the Courts Act, 1971 (U.K.), c. 23, s. 56 and Sch. 8 has
removed the express power theretofore given to increase a sentence upon an
appeal against it by an accused.

I regard the judgment in appeal as a departure
by a provincial appellate Court from judicial justice and as a venture into a
species of administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate
procedure all the more startling because criminal justice is involved.

I would allow the appeal as proposed by my
brother Spence.

Laskin C.J. and Dickson and Beetz JJ. also
concurred in the judgment of

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This appeal was
argued at an earlier date before a court composed of eight judges. Several
members of this Court, including myself, wrote reasons for judgment and in the
result the appeal failed upon an equal division of the eight members of the
Court. The

[Page 834]

appellant made application for a rehearing which
application was granted and all nine members of the Court considered the appeal
upon reargument.

I am still of the opinion that the appeal should
be allowed and I, therefore, repeat hereunder my reasons for judgment as
previously delivered. They are as follows:

I have had the opportunity to peruse the reasons
for judgment written by Mr. Justice Pigeon and I adopt the facts as stated
in those reasons and will find it necessary to refer to very few other facts.

In so far as Mr. Justice Pigeon finds that
this Court had jurisdiction to consider this appeal, I am in complete agreement
with him and I have nothing to add. With respect, however, I am of the opinion
that the appeal should succeed and that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had no
jurisdiction to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused when the Crown
had chosen merely to serve upon the accused a notice that if he persisted in
his appeal the Crown would request the court to impose a more severe sentence.
This conclusion entails the determination that in my opinion, the decision of
the Court of Appeal in R. v. Willis[7], was in error and that also the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in R. v. Christakos[8], and
of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. The Queen[9], suffered from like defect.

I commence with the proposition that a right of
appeal is altogether statutory. This principle itself appears in the Criminal
Code  in s. 602 . It reads:

602. No proceedings other than those
authorized by this Part and Part XXIII shall be taken by way of appeal in
proceedings in respect of indictable offences.

The right of appeal of the attorney general or
counsel at his direction is granted by s. 605 of the Code and as to
sentence is dealt with in para. 1(b) thereof which reads:

[Page 835]

605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

. . .

(b) with leave of the court
of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

Section 607 [am. 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 53]
of the Code governs procedure on appeals by either the Crown or the
accused and provides particularly that the appellant “shall give notice of
appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal, in such manner and
within such period as may be directed by rules of court”. Those rules of court,
in the case of Ontario, are
contained in Rules 10 to 25 of the Criminal Appeal Rules and Rule 12(2) thereof
provides that:

12. (2) Where the appeal is from sentence…
the Notice of Appeal shall be served within thirty days from the day of
sentence.

Rule 13(b) provides:

13. (b) Service of a Notice
of Appeal shall be effected… in all other cases by delivering to the office of
the Registrar personally or by registered mail three copies of a Notice of
Appeal, and, in addition, in appeals by an Attorney General, by personal
service on the convicted person.

When the Crown served notice upon the accused,
the appellant in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, of an intention to
request a more severe sentence, it was, in fact, attempting to assert a right
of appeal from sentence. The Crown was doing so without carrying out the
formalities required by the provisions of the Code which I have cited
and the proper carrying out of such requirements was, in my view, requisite for
obtaining the right to ask the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence, and
failing due compliance with those requirements, the Crown had no jurisdiction
to apply for an increase in sentence and the Court had no jurisdiction to grant
such an increase: Dennis v. The Queen[10].

[Page 836]

If the Crown had complied with the requirements,
then the Crown would have had to make application for leave to appeal from the
sentence and both upon such application and on the appeal itself, if leave to
appeal had been granted, the Crown would have the same onus as has an appellant
on all appeals. Using the procedure which the Crown used in this particular case,
there was no statutory onus at all upon the Crown and it would appear that, in
fact, the onus was thrown upon the accused not only in his vain attempt to
demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him was too severe but to prevent that
sentence from being increased. I am, moreover, of the opinion that the powers
of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are exact and do
not permit the Court to exercise powers other than those given.
Section 614(1) provides:

614. (1) Where an appeal is taken against
sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law,
consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such
evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,

(a) vary the sentence with
the limits prescribed by law for the offences of which the accused was
convicted, or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

In the present appeal, the certificate of the
formal judgment of the Court of Appeal reads, in part:

THIS COURT DID ORDER THAT the said appeal
should be and the same was thereby dismissed but that the sentence of twelve
(12) years on the charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment.

Jessup J.A., in giving reasons for the Court of
Appeal, said:

In the result I would dismiss the
appellant’s appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it
to one of life imprisonment.

So the certificate of the formal order
accurately reflects the reasons given for the Court of Appeal.

It will be seen, therefore, that the Court of
Appeal purported to act under both para. (a) and para. (b)
of s. 614(1) in that it not only dismissed the appeal as authorized by
para. (b) but it also varied the sentence as authorized by para.
(a). The

[Page 837]

powers in paras. (a) and (b)
are disjunctive. The word “or” is the word which is at the end of para. (a)
and I am of the opinion that s. 6114 of this Code does not permit a
court on the consideration of a specific appeal to exercise its jurisdiction
under both paras. (a) and (b) but that the Court of
Appeal must choose whether to exercise its powers under para. (a) by
varying or under para. (b) by dismissing the appeal. I think this
is a convincing indication that by the words of s. 614(1)(a) “vary the
sentence with the limits prescribed by law for the offences of which the
accused was convicted”, Parliament only intended to permit a variation by way
of decrease upon the appeal of an accused person or, if the Crown were the
appellant, to consider a variation by way of increase upon the Crown’s appeal.

It is, I think, of some interest and value to
note that in the United Kingdom, when the power of the Court of Appeal to
increase sentence was granted by s. 4(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907
(U.K.), c. 23, the Appellate Court was empowered to quash the sentence passed
at trial and “(2) pass such other sentence warranted in law by the verdict
(whether more or less severe) in substitution therefor”. Thus, the Parliament
in the United Kingdom by
specific words granted a power to increase. No such words as “whether more or
less severe” appear in s. 614(1)(a) of the Code and, in my view,
the words “such other sentence warranted in law” as they appear in the United
Kingdom statute and the words “the sentence with the limits prescribed by law”
as they appear in the Criminal Code  are exactly in pari materia. It
is, I think, indeed significant that Parliament in the United
 Kingdom thought it necessary to add a specific
authorization for the imposition of a more severe sentence.

I note also the opening words of s. 614(1)
“where an appeal is taken against sentence” and that the words are not “where
any appeal is taken against sentence”, again indicating that the power to vary
is limited to a power in considering an appeal not in considering a motion by
the Crown urged at the time that an appeal by the accused is before the Court.

[Page 838]

There is another reason for my conclusion which
I find most convincing. In the present case, counsel for the Attorney General
relying on R. v. Willis, supra, first advised counsel for the
appellant by telephone and later confirmed by letter that if the appellant had
put his sentence in issue the Court of Appeal would be at liberty to increase
it if it saw fit and that the Crown would be asking the Court of Appeal to
increase the sentence, possibly to life. The Crown and the appellant’s counsel
agreed to adjourn the appeal and maintain the status quo of the proceedings to
enable the appellant’s counsel to obtain instructions. Jessup J.A., in his
reasons for judgment, said:

The appellant was given notice of the
Crown’s motion from its Statement of Law and Fact and did not abandon his
appeal but rather argued it with vigour.

I am of the opinion that this is a most
objectionable in terrorem procedure.

An accused person, on the advice of counsel, is
of the opinion that he has a serious appeal as to the quantum of sentence which
he wishes to urge before the Court of Appeal. The Crown seeks to intimidate him
from doing so by threatening that if he does urge his appeal then the Crown
will ask that the sentence be increased. If the Crown desires to obtain an
increase in sentence, then the Crown should apply for leave to appeal against
sentence and take on the burden of an appellant to which I have already
referred, rather than by threatening the accused that if he is bold enough to
assert his own right of appeal dire results will ensue.

To the foregoing reasons, I wish to add the
following.

I am of the opinion that there is another factor
of some importance. Had the Crown acted in accordance with the usual procedure
and cross-appealed against sentence as I have already pointed out, the Crown
would have had to obtain leave to do so. The time for application for leave, as
I

[Page 839]

have noted above and as fixed by Rule 12(2) of
the Criminal Appeal Rules, was within thirty days from the date of
sentence.

The sentence was passed on July 11, 1973. The appellant appealed to the
Court of Appeal by notice dated July 13, 1973 but served on July 18, 1973. The time for application for leave
to cross-appeal, therefore, had expired on August 10, 1973. There is nothing in
the appeal to show that the Crown had at that date any intention to
cross-appeal and, in fact, there is no indication that the Crown was
considering asking for an increase of sentence until October 16, 1973 when
counsel for the Attorney General verbally advised counsel for the appellant of
an intention to ask the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence.

If the Crown had sought to bring the matter
before the Court of Appeal at that time, it would have had to apply for an
extension of the time within which application for leave might be given. Such
application is governed by the provisions of s. 607(2) of the Code which
provides:

(2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof
may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an
application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not
apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction.

Although the said subsection does not set
out any criteria for the grant of such extension of time, it has been said in a
series of cases that such extension will not be granted as of course butt only
upon special circumstances. So, in R. v. Raymond[11], Montgomery J.A., considering such
an application, said at p. 659:

The reason given is insufficient: It should
not be beyond human ingenuity to devise an administrative system whereby the
proper officers of the Crown could decide whether or not to appeal within 15
days of such a judgment; if this cannot be arranged, the department should make
representations to have either the Court’s rules of practice or the Criminal
Code  suitably amended. To accept this as a reason for extending the delay would
be tantamount to deciding that the Crown is more or less automatically entitled
to a delay in every case of

[Page 840]

an appeal of this nature. The accused, if
he wishes to obtain a delay, must demonstrate some special circumstances; there
is no reason why this rule should not apply to the Crown.

and in R. v. Antoine[12], Guy J.A., considering such an
application as a member of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, held that in order to grant the application he would have had to
find that there was an intention to appeal sentence prior to the time for
making the application for leave having expired. As I have said, no such
intention on the part of the Crown was manifest in the present case.

I cite this point as further demonstration of
the fact that the Crown, by choosing the procedure it has chosen in the present
case, has in fact short-circuited the proper procedure provided in the Criminal
Code  for bringing to the Court of Appeal the Crown’s submission that a
sentence passed at trial should be increased. Not only must theCrown, under the
ordinary procedure, apply for and obtain leave to appeal but the Crown must do
so within a thirty-day period after the sentence and if the Crown does not make
application within that limited period it must obtain an extension of that
period for some special reason. None of that procedure, of course, was required
from the Crown under the circumstances existing in the present appeal.

The result of the rehearing is that the appeal
stands dismissed by a majority of five judges to four. Therefore, it is
apparent that after two arguments in this Court the appellant still is
condemned to a sentence of life imprisonment by this slim majority after an
experienced provincial court judge having heard all the evidence was of the
opinion that a twelve-year sentence was proper.

It may well be that Parliament will wish to
consider whether the provisions of s. 614  of the Criminal Code  should be
at least clarified if not amended. Parliament, in such consideration, might

[Page 841]

have regard for the fact that the statutes in
the United Kingdom, which as I have pointed out previously made specific
provision permitting the Court of Criminal Appeal to increase the appellant’s
sentence upon his application to decrease it, have been amended by the Criminal
Appeal Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 19, s. 11(3), by which the power of the Court
of Appeal was limited to quashing the sentence or passing such sentence or
making such order as the Court thought appropriate for the case and as the
court below had power to pass or make “but the Court shall so exercise their
powers under this subsection that, taking the case as a whole, the
appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than he was dealt with by
the court below”. This provision was enacted despite the fact that the Crown in
the United Kingdom has no
appeal against the sentence passed after trial.

For all of those reasons, I would allow the
appeal and restore the sentence imposed by the Provincial Court Judge.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Pigeon and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This case having been reheard before
the full Court I will first repeat the reasons written by me after the first
hearing.

Before Provincial Court Judge, D.V. Latimer, the
appellant pleaded guilty to charges of rape and wounding. He was sentenced to
twelve years concurrent. On his appeal against sentence, this was increased to
life imprisonment. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the following
question of law:

On an appeal by the accused against
sentence, where there is no cross-appeal by the Crown to have the sentence
increased does the Ontario Court of Appeal on dismissing the accused’s appeal
have the power to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused?

[Page 842]

Rather than summarize the reasons stated by
Jessup J.A. for the Court of Appeal, I will quote the essential.

The Appellant appeals his sentence of
twelve years imposed after his plea of guilty to a charge of rape and his
sentence of twelve years concurrent imposed upon his plea of guilty to a charge
of causing bodily harm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure. The sentences having
been put in issue, the Crown moves for their increase, citing Regina v. Willis,
[1969] 1 O.R. 64. The appellant was given notice of the Crown’s motion from
its Statement of Law and Fact and did not abandon his appeal but rather argued
it with vigour.

Under circumstances indicating planning and
deliberation, the appellant went at night to a home where the
fourteen-year-old, virginal complainant was baby-sitting. After assaulting her
with his fists he forcibly stripped her of all her clothes and, although she
was menstruating, then raped her. He then forced the complainant, unclothed
except for a jacket she threw on, to go outside with the evident intention of
taking her somewhere in his car. When the complainant attempted to run away he
overtook her and forced her back into the house. When the complainant then
attempted to use the telephone, the appellant knocked her to the floor and with
a paring knife stabbed her repeatedly in the face and eyes and about the throat
until the knife broke. As a result the complainant may lose the sight of one
eye. The appellant then fled the house abandoning the wounded complainant.
While the appellant had considerable to drink the evening of the crimes, there
is no suggestion that he lacked the requisite intent to commit them.

. .
.

The reports and evidence available to the
learned Provincial Judge at the time of sentencing show that the appellant is
not insane, mentally ill or psychotic. However, he suffers from a personality
disorder manifested in impulsiveness, low stress tolerance, anger which he does
not know how to handle properly and difficulty in knowing his own sexual
identity. Dr. Karen Galbraith, a psychologist, and Dr. Peter Rowsell, a
psychiatrist, both agreed that he was dangerous to the community. Both were testifying
for the appellant.

. .
.

[Page 843]

When an accused has been convicted of a
serious crime in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he suffers
from some mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the
community but not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and
when it is uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his
affliction, in my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life. Such a
sentence, in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which
the Parole Board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon
adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interest of the accused and of
the community for him to return to society. The policy expressed in my opinion
is that of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal, cf. Thomas,
Principles of Sentencing at pp. 272-279.

In the result I would dismiss the
appellant’s appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it
to one of life imprisonment.

On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the
Crown objected to the jurisdiction of this Court relying on Goldhar v. The
Queen[13], a
decision rendered on an application for leave to appeal heard by a court of
five judges in which it was held, Cartwright J. dissenting, “that this Court
has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the
commission of an indictable offence”. In my view, that decision is not binding
and should not be followed for the following reasons.

Before the 1949 amendments, the Supreme Court
Act did not confer jurisdiction to this Court in criminal cases. This was
due to the following words in s. 36: “except in criminal causes and in
proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or
prohibition arising out of a criminal charge”. Therefore, any jurisdiction in
criminal matters had to be found in the Criminal Code  or other statute.

In Goldhamer v. The King[14], the appeal to this Court was from
a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal increasing the sentence passed on
conviction. This had been done on an appeal by the Crown under s. 1013  of the Criminal
Code  then in

[Page 844]

force as replaced by 1923 (Can.), c. 41, s. 9 and reading in part as
follows:

1013. A person convicted on indictment may
appeal to the Court of appeal against his conviction,…

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or
the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave
of a judge of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence
passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

Appeals to this Court were then governed by ss.
1024  and 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code . The latter section*
governed appeals by leave from judgments setting aside or affirming a
conviction of an indictable offence in the case of a conflict with a judgment
of another court of appeal in a like case. Therefore, it was clear that the
only possible foundation for the appeal was in s. 1024 of which the only
relevant part, subs. 1, then read as follows:

1024. Any person convicted of any
indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under
section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
against the affirmance of such conviction:** Provided
that no such appeal can be taken if the court of appeal is unanimous in
affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been
served on the Attorney General within fifteen days after such affirmance or
such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge
thereof.

It was held that this Court had no jurisdiction
Duff J. saying:

As my brother Idington points out, the word
“conviction” cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily
exclusive meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification
including the sentence. Section 1013  does, however, I think, distinguish
very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for

[Page 845]

the purposes of appeal, and the Act of
13-14 Geo. V, by which the present section was brought into force, made no
change in section 1024 . Accordingly, I think the word “conviction” in the
last mentioned section should be read in its less technical sense, and
consequently that there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an appeal under
subsection (2) of section 1013 .

In 1949, after the Privy Council had affirmed[15] (A.G. Ont. v. A.G. Can.) the
opinion of this Court on a reference[16] (Re
Privy Council Appeals), Parliament enacted important amendments to
the Supreme Court Act by 1949 (Can.), c. 37. Appeals to the Privy
Council which had previously been abolished in criminal matters only, by
re-enacting in 1933 s. 1024.4  of the Criminal Code , were definitely
abolished in all cases. Much wider provision than before was made for appeals
by special leave in a new s. 41, the material part of which is as follows
(parentheses indicate words deleted in 1956):

41. (1) Subject to subsection three
(and to section forty-four) an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada
with leave of that court from any final or other judgment of the highest court
of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had
in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada,
whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada has been refused
by any other court.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting
or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction,
of an offence other than an indictable offence.

The first case in which leave to appeal in a
criminal cause was sought to be obtained under those provisions appears to be The
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. et al. v. The Queen. It
is unfortunately reported on the merits only[17].
The judgment appealed to this Court was a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario

[Page 846]

affirming with variation an order of prohibition
issued out of the Supreme Court of Ontario under the provisions of s. 31 of the
Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended, subsequent
to a conviction upon indictment for an offence under that Act. The appeal to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario had been taken under the provisions of the Criminal
Code  pertaining to an appeal from a sentence and the Court of Appeal had
varied the judgment appealed from expressly holding it to be a sentence by virtue
of s. 1012 (e) of the Criminal Code  providing that for the
purposes of appeal: “ ‘sentence9 includes any order of a trial court made on
conviction with reference to the person convicted.” ([1954] O.R. 377, at
p. 396). The application for leave was first heard on June 22, 1954. A re-argument was directed that
took place on December 6, 1954. On January 25, judgment granting leave was
rendered by the full Court. No written reasons were delivered and the decision
was recorded as follows in the Minute Book:

The majority being of the opinion that this
Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal, the applications therefor are
allowed.

The material filed by the applicants on the
motions for leave shows that the applications were made exclusively under s. 41
of the Supreme Court Act. The decision in Goldhamer was referred
to as showing that this Court did not have jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code . On the merits, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed and
this would seem to indicate that this Court did not consider that the Court
below had erred in asserting jurisdiction to deal with the order as being a
sentence.

The next case of an application for leave to
appeal in a criminal cause under the Supreme Court Act was Parkes v.
The Queen[18]. The
subject-matter of the appeal was a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a
decision of a County Court judge finding

[Page 847]

that the appellant was an habitual criminal and
sentencing him to an undetermined term in the penitentiary under the provisions
of s. 660  of the Criminal Code . It was held unanimously by a Court of
five judges that such a decision is a judgment within the meaning of that word
in s. 41(1)  and does not fall within the terms of s. 41(3)  so that this
Court had jurisdiction to grant leave. In the reasons of the Court no reference
was made to the decision in the Goodyear case, but it was referred to in
the material on the application for leave. On the merits, the appeal was
allowed unanimously and the sentence of preventive; detention was quashed[19]. (This precedent has been uniformly
followed in appeals from sentences of preventive detention, jurisdiction being
asserted to hear such appeals in a number of cases culminating in Poole v.
The Queen[20] where
the majority of the full Court held that this applied not only against the
finding that the accused is an habitual criminal but also to the conclusion
that it is expedient to sentence him to preventive detention.)

A few years later, s. 41 was considered in
connection with an offence other than an indictable offence in Smith v. The
Queen[21]. The
appeal was from the dismissal of an application for a writ of certiorari against
a finding of delinquency against a child under the Juvenile Delinquents Act.
Leave to appeal was granted subject to argument as to the right to grant
leave. On the merits, the appeal was allowed. The reasoning of Kerwin C.J. (at
p. 642), concurred in expressly by Judson J. and inferentially by the other
members of the Court, was as follows on the question of jurisdiction.

This Court had power to grant leave to
appeal under subs. (1) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 259:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an
appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or
other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge
thereof, in which

[Page 848]

judgment can be had in the particular case
sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.

Subsection (3) reads:

41. (3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies
under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting
or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable
offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an
offence other than an indictable offence.

It has no application as the judgment of
the Court of Appeal is not one affirming a conviction.

It will be noted that up to nearly ten years
after the enactment of s. 41, this Court uniformly adhered to literal
construction and granted leave to appeal in criminal matters from any judgments
not excluded by subs. (3). Consideration must now be given to the decisions in
which a different view was taken. This will be done in chronological order.

In Goldhar v. The Queen[22], the application was for leave to
appeal a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal against a sentence imposed on conviction for
an indictable offence. In the reasons of the majority of the five judges
sitting, Fauteux J., after saying that no right of appeal to this Court was
given in such case by the provisions of the Criminal Code , pointed out
the inconsistencies that would ensue if this Court had jurisdiction in the
matter of sentence under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act and said (at p.
70):

I cannot think that Parliament ever
intended or even contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of
these interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never
intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend
to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable offences.

Reference was made to Goldhamer v. The
King but not to any of the previous decisions above mentioned dealing with
the application in criminal matters of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act after
its replacement by the statute of 1949.

[Page 849]

In Paul v. The Queen[23], substantially the same reasoning
was made on an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of a Court of
Appeal to hear an appeal in a summary conviction matter or alternatively from
the dismissal of the appeal to a County Court judge. It was held on a four to
three division that this Court did not have jurisdiction. Taschereau J. (as he then
was) said (at pp. 457-458):

It was held in Goldhar v. The
Queen, that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal
Code , we could not find any authority in 41(1) to review a sentence imposed
by the Courts below. In that case it was stated by Fauteux J. with whom all the
members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J. disisenting, that in order to
determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of
indictable offence, it was not permissible to look to s. 41(1)  for the
authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal Code  which does not
permit an appeal against a sentence.

The general proposition that matters which
are not mentioned in 41(3) must be taken to be included in 41(1) has been ruled
out in Goldhar, supra.

Fauteux J. said (at p. 467):

The proposition that judgments which are
not within the scope of s. 41(3) are necessarily embraced in s. 41(1) has been
ruled out in the Goldhar case, where a strict adherence to the rule of
literal construction of s. 41 was, in the matter, shown to lead to repugnancy.
Such a result would equally obtain if the judgment refusing leave to appeal, in
this case, was held to come within s. 41(1). For on the same reasoning, one
would have to hold that, for indictable offences, s. 41(1) authorizes an appeal
to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal
to its Court from the verdict or judgment of first instance on grounds of mixed
law and facts or pure facts. Such a jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the
limitation of our jurisdiction to pure questions of law in criminal appeals
from convictions or acquittals of offences.

The majority decision in Paul v. The
Queen was followed by a Court of five judges in R. v. J.

[Page 850]

Alepin Frères Ltée[24]. Also in R. v. MacDonald[25], a four to three decision, an
appeal by the Crown from a judgment setting aside a sentence of preventive
detention was quashed, the majority relying on the decisions in Goldhar,
Paul and Alepin Frères.

There is a clear conflict between the four last
mentioned cases and the other judgments adhering explicitly or implicitly to a
different view of s. 41. This means that on any view of the rule of stare
decisis the Court has to choose between the two conflicting views.

In my opinion, the literal construction is
preferable not only because in the absence of ambiguity the literal meaning
should always be adhered to despite any inconsistencies short of absurdity, but
also because any assumption that Parliament did not intend to depart from the
previous state of the law is unjustified. Section 41 was enacted
substantially in its present form at the time when appeals to the Privy Council
were being abolished and this court was being made truly supreme. The Privy
Council had enjoyed unlimited jurisdiction by special leave and it is apparent
that the new provision was intended to effect the change from a limited
specific jurisdiction to a broad general jurisdiction. To hold that the
inconsistencies resulting from this sweeping change indicate the intention of
leaving some wide gaps open is, in my view, entirely unwarranted. On the
contrary, the enactment of a provision that undoubtedly confers some
jurisdiction in criminal matters beyond that existing under the Criminal
Code , clearly indicates Parliament’s will to remedy the omission to extend
the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal cases when the Privy Council’s
jurisdiction in such cases was effectively abolished after the Statute of
Westminster.

No reason has been advanced for construing the
words “convicting” and “conviction” in subs. (3) of s. 41 otherwise than
the same words in s. 1024.1  of the Criminal Code  in force when it was
enacted

[Page 851]

had been construed in the Goldhamer case.
It is already firmly established by a long line of cases in this Court that
those words in s. 41(3) do not include a judgment imposing a sentence of
preventive detention. It is also established by the decision of the full Court
in the Goodyear case that those same words do not apply to an order of
prohibition that was a sentence within the meaning of the definition of that
word in the same Criminal Code . Although the possibility of a
distinction with respect to other sentences was left open in Poole, this
now appears impossible on further consideration especially in view of what was
said in Goldhamer.

For those reasons, it does not appear to me that
s. 41(3) should be construed otherwise that in accordance with the strict
meaning of “convicting” and “conviction” as established by the Goldhamer decision.
This means that, in my view, the objection to jurisdiction fails. However, I
consider it appropriate to point out that such conclusion implies no departure
from our rule of never entertaining an appeal concerning the fitness of a
sentence.

Dealing now with the question on which leave was
granted in this case, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are
the following:

603. (1) A person who is convicted by a
trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction.

or

(b) against the sentence passed by
the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless
that sentence is one fixed by law.

605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

. .
.

(b) with leave of the court
of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in

[Page 852]

proceedings by indictment, unless that
sentence is one fixed by law.

607. (1) An appellant who proposes to
appeal to the court of appeal or to obtain the leave of that court to appeal
shall give notice of appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal,
in such manner and within such period as may be directed by rules of court.

(2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof
may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an
application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not
apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction.

. .
.

614. (1) Where an appeal is taken against
sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law,
consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such
evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,

(a) vary the sentence with the
limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted, or


(b) dismiss the appeal.

(In 614(1) (a) “with” is a
typographical error, it should read “within” as in s. 593  of the Criminal
Code  as enacted by 1953-54, c. 51).

The question, in my view, is whether, on an
appeal against sentence by the accused, the words “vary the sentence within the
limits prescribed by law” are to be read as restricted to a variation by way of
reduction.

Counsel for appellant relied heavily on the
judgment of this Court in Richard v. The Queen[26].It was an appeal in a summary
conviction case. At trial, the accused who had been charged with criminal
negligence in the operation of his motor vehicle, was convicted of the lesser
offence of driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public. On his appeal
from this conviction he was, at the end of the trial de novo, convicted
of criminal negligence as originally charged. The majority in this Court,
reversing the Ontario Court

[Page 853]

of Appeal, held that, in what is now s. 755(1),
the words “the appeal court shall hear and determine the appeal by holding a
trial de novo” meant in the case of an appeal “from a conviction” a
determination in respect of such conviction, not in respect of the charge
originally laid. Consequently, the judge hearing the appeal had no power to
enter a conviction of the more serious offence originally charged, because the
conviction for the lesser included offence involved an acquittal of the more
serious offence. There was no provision which, on an appeal by the accused from
the conviction for the lesser offence, authorized the judge hearing such appeal
to set aside that acquittal.

In my view, this decision on the construction of
a different provision concerning appeals from summary convictions is of no
assistance in the instant case. It dealt with the meaning of the words
“determine the appeal from a conviction”, while here the words used are “vary
the sentence within the limits prescribed by law”. In my view, those are plain
words which fix the scope of the power conferred upon the court by
reference to the maximum applicable penalty, irrespective of the prior
decision. I am unable to find any good reason for departing from this plain
meaning or for introducing restrictions.

A full review of the legislative history of the
enactment was made by Laskin J.A. (as he then was) in his dissenting reasons in
R. v. Willis[27]. Concerning
the power to vary mentioned in Rule 503 (Ontario) and in Rule 100 of the Supreme Court of Canada Rules, I
cannot, with respect, agree that, without those provisions the power to
increase or decrease damages in civil cases, even without a cross-appeal or
notice to vary, would exist. In my view, those rules involve a recognition that
the jurisdiction exists to do it and do not

[Page 854]

create it. Rule 100 reads:

Rule 100.—It shall not, under any
circumstances, be necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of
cross-appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the hearing of an appeal to
contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, he shall, within
fifteen days after the service of the notice of appeal, or such further time as
may be prescribed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers, give notice of such
intention to all parties who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such
notice shall not in any way interfere with the power of the Court on the
hearing of an appeal to treat the whole case as open, but may, in the
discretion of the Court, be ground for an adjournment of the appeal or for
special order as to costs.

It seems to me that this provision as
writtenclearly implies that, once the case is inscribed in appeal, jurisdiction
exists to “treat the whole case as open”. The giving of notice to vary is only
aprocedural requirement which can be remedied or waived, if omitted. The same
should be said, I think, with respect to the prescribed form for prisoner
appeals including this notification:

11. Further take notice that if you appeal
from sentence the Court of Appeal may increase your sentence without further
notice to you if the Court of Appeal considers the sentence inadequate.

Although those rules and forms cannot have the
effect of conferring a jurisdiction which the courts of appeal would not
otherwise have, they ought, I think, to be considered as of great authority in
support of the proposition that the jurisdiction does exist. I will also note
that decisions similar to that of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Willis case
were rendered by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Christakos[28] and by the Quebec Court of Appeal
in Valade v. R.[29]

[Page 855]

If the accused had not been given adequate
notice that at the hearing of his appeal, consideration would be given to an
increase in his sentence, I would think that the same rule ought to be applied
as in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[30] where sentence was passed without
hearing submissions. It would have to be held that the accused was not given an
opportunity to be heard before the adverse determination was made against him.
In this case however, counsel for the Crown made it known prior to the hearing
that an increased sentence would be required. This was mentioned in the
statement of fact and law filed by the Crown on the appeal.

Due to this notice, it seems to me that the
objection to jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. Counsel for the
Crown could, under s. 605(b) apply for leave to appeal against the
sentence. The time for making this application is not fixed by law and may be
extended at any time by the Court of Appeal under s. 607 as well as Rule 28(1)
of the Supreme Court of Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules,

Even assuming that an application by counsel for
the Crown to the Court of Appeal was necessary for directing an increase in
sentence, I fail to see what could prevent the Court at the hearing of
the appeal from treating the statement of fact and law as a notice of appeal
and granting an extension of time, no question could be raised as to counsel’s
instructions, R. v. Badall[31].
To say that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction because all this was
not spelled out in a formal order is, in my view, to treat as going to
jurisdiction a purely formal objection. Sometimes, as in Dennis v. The
Queen[32], a
failure to comply with certain formalities is destructive of jurisdiction, but
this is so only when, by law, jurisdiction is made dependent on a particular
formality that was omitted. This is not one of those cases as I see it.

[Page 856]

I would also consider as without substance the
objection that, under s. 614(1) the Court of Appeal may vary the sentence or
dismiss the appeal and therefore cannot do both as was done by the formal
order in this case. What was intended to be done is abundantly clear: it was to
vary the sentence. This cannot be nullified by the superfluous addition of
words purporting to dismiss the appeal.

It does not appear to me that the construction
of s. 514 Cr. C. can be influenced by consideration of s. 4(3) of the
United Kingdom Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c. 23) which was in
the following terms:

4. (3) On an appeal against sentence the
Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they think that a different sentence should
have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial, and pass such other
sentence warranted in law by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in
substitution therefor as they think ought to have been passed, and in any other
case shall dismiss the appeal.

It must first be noted that the United Kingdom
Act gave a right of appeal to the person convicted only, not to the Crown as
well. In such a situation, one can readily see why it was deemed necessary to
provide explicitly that, on an appeal, the Court would have jurisdiction, not
only to decrease, but also to increase the sentence. No such implication ever
arose under our Code in which there is a right of appeal by the Crown as
well as by the person convicted.

It must also be considered that while the
sections of our Criminal Code  dealing with appeals were, in 1923,
generally replaced by verbatim copies of the corresponding provisions of the
above-mentioned U.K. Act, such was not the case with respect to the particular
provision with which we are here concerned. The right of appeal from sentence
by the Crown as well as by the person convicted was preserved.
Section 1015(1)  defining the powers of the Court of Appeal on appeals
against sentence was a re-enactment of s. 1055A enacted by 1921 (Can.) c. 25,
s. 22, as noted by Laskin J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Willis,
supra,

[Page 857]

at p. 73, it was not copied from s. 4(3) of the
U.K. Act, anymore than present s. 614  was.

I should also say that I doubt very much
whether, in any case, the omission in an enactment of some words found in a
similar enactment of another jurisdiction can ever have the effect of
restricting the clear meaning of the words actually used. Would not this imply
that words used elsewhere could never be omitted as surplusage?

Concerning the propriety of Crown prosecutors,
on an appeal from sentence by the accused, requesting an increase without a
formal inscription in appeal to that end, I would quote those words of Goddard
L.C.J. spoken on behalf of a Court on which he sat with Lewis J. and Denning J.
(as he then was) (Re: Harry John McBain[33],
at pp. 114-5):

The appellant was convicted on the clearest
possible evidence, and was sentenced to three years’ penal servitude. He had
not been convicted before. He applied for leave to appeal against both
conviction and sentence. The Court refused his application for leave to appeal
against conviction, but gave him leave to appeal against sentence for one
reason only, in order that it might consider whether or not it should
substantially increase his sentence.

Hitherto, when this Court has considered an
application for leave to appeal against sentence, and has formed the opinion that
the sentence was not severe enough, it has generally warned the applicant that
if he persists in his appeal the Court may increase his sentence. This Court no
longer intends to take that course. The Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, does not
require it, but by section 4(3) provides that where a prisoner applies for
and obtains leave to appeal against his sentence, this Court, if it thinks that
a different sentence should have been passed, shall pass such sentence as it
thinks ought to have been passed, whether greater or less than the sentence
actually passed.

In that case there was no increased sentence,
but the benefit of time served pending judgment in

[Page 858]

appeal was denied. However, three other cases
are noted in which a two year increase was ordered. Two other such cases are
noted in the 1962 Criminal Law Review (pp. 495, 853). It is true that
the United Kingdom Parliament provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1968
(U.K.), c. 19 s. 11(3), that the Court of Appeal shall so exercise their powers
that the appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than he was dealt
with by the Court below. However, the Canadian Parliament has not so amended s.
614(1) Cr. C. and has not repealed the right of appeal by the Crown
against sentence.

Inasmuch as counsel for the accused had
reasonable notice that an increased sentence was sought and opportunity to be
heard on that, as was the case herein as in Willis, every essential of
proper judicial conduct was met. On any view of this case, there is no basis
for adverse comment against counsel for the Crown or the Court below.

At the rehearing, counsel for the appellant
pressed the argument that, if the power of the Court of appeal was sought to be
supported on the basis that it could grant an extension of time to the Crown
for a cross-appeal against sentence and treat its request for an increase as
such a cross-appeal, the accused was entitled to urge that no proper ground was
established for such use of the Court’s discretion. In my opinion, the mere
fact that the Court of Appeal at the hearing feels that there are serious
grounds to question the adequacy of the sentence is quite sufficient to justify
a decision to grant an extension and entertain submissions on that issue,
provided the accused is not taken by surprise and given an adequate opportunity
to be heard on the point. Furthermore, I remain of opinion that upon any appeal
against sentence for an indictable offence the Court of Appeal has anyway full
jurisdiction to vary as deemed proper.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 859]

de Grandpré J. also concurred in the judgment of

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court which were delivered
on the first hearing of this appeal and I agree with their unanimous conclusion
as to the jurisdiction of this Court.

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal of Ontario was invoked by the appellant
himself in accordance with the provisions of ss. 603 , 607  and 614  of the Criminal
Code , and s. 614(1)  makes it plain that in the exercise of that
jurisdiction the court “shall… consider the fitness of the sentence.” In
the discharge of this duty, the court is not limited to considerations
affecting the appellant but must also have regard to the welfare of the
community and the public interest generally. The deterrent effect which the
sentence may have on others and to some extent the standards which have been
established in other cases of a like kind, are also relevant and in the present
case the stark horror of the crime itself would of necessity be compelling
consideration.

Parliament having fixed the Court of Appeal with
the obligation to “consider the fitness of the sentence”, it would, in my view,
require clear statutory language to limit that consideration to the question of
whether the sentence was too severe while precluding any consideration of
whether it was severe enough. There is no such language in the Criminal
Code , and I am of opinion that the opening paragraph of s 614(1)
constitutes a mandatory directory direction to the Court of Appeal to consider
both aspects of the question.

In the result, where an appeal against sentence
is taken by the person convicted seeking to have the sentence reduced, the
court may see fit to increase the sentence and this is a risk to which all such
persons are exposed whether or not the Attorney General has appealed.
Conversely, where an appeal is taken against sentence by the Attorney General
seeking to have the sentence increased,

[Page 860]

the court may consider it fitting to reduce the
sentence and is empowered so to order without any appeal having been asserted
by the convicted person.

Whether an appeal is taken by the accused or at
the instance of the Attorney General, it is characterized in the Criminal
Code  as an appeal “against the sentence” and in either event the only
restriction upon the power of the court to vary the sentence is that contained
in s. 614(1)  (a) which provides in effect that the sentence can only be
varied “within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the
accused was convicted”.

It has been suggested that as the powers of s.
614(1)(a) and (b) are phrased in the alternative, the
section does not permit a court to exercise its jurisdiction under both
subsections in the same case and that it must choose whether it is to vary
the sentence or dismiss the appeal. In the present case the court ordered that
the appeal be dismissed “but that the sentence of twelve (12) years on the
charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment”. I take the view
that in exercising its power to increase the sentence the Court of Appeal by
implication dismissed the appellant’s appeal and that the portion of the formal
judgment ordering that the appeal be dismissed was pure surplusage which in no
way vitiates the order.

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
Court of Appeal has power to increase a sentence when an appeal is taken in
accordance with s. 603(1) by a person who has been convicted at trial and that
this power is in no way dependant upon an appeal being asserted by the Attorney
General under s. 605. I would accordingly answer the question of law upon which
leave to appeal was granted in the affirmative.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

BEETZ J. (dissenting)—After a rehearing
of this appeal, I see no reason to alter the views I had previously expressed,
[v. infra]

[Page 861]

BEETZ J. (dissenting) [after the
first hearing]—I agree with Mr. Justice Pigeon as to the jurisdiction of
this Court to hear this appeal. But I find myself in agreement with
Mr. Justice Spence’s analysis and construction of s. 614  of the Criminal
Code .

By virtue of s. 603(1)(b) and s. 605(1)(b),
a person convicted by a trial court and the Attorney General may both, with
leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof, appeal the sentence passed by
the trial court. The wording of s. 614  reflects both possibilities in a single
enactment. However, such economy of words was not, in my view, meant to relieve
the Attorney General from the need to seek leave and, such leave being granted,
from actually appealing, merely because a convicted person avails himself of
his right to try to have his sentence reduced. Nor does s. 614  give to the
Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear what amounts to an appeal as of right by
the Crown where the Code explicitly provides against such a right and
where no formal notice was given to the convicted person. Even if failure to
observe formalities relating to application for leave, to the granting of leave
and to notice may be remedied in time, it was not remedied in this case.

I would dispose of this appeal as is proposed by
Mr. Justice Spence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Charge to Jury—Motor vehicles—Criminal
negligence causing bodily harm—Accident as a defence—Whether theory of defence
outlined to jury—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 191, 193.

The appellant was convicted, after a trial
before a judge and jury, on a charge of causing bodily harm to one L by
criminal negligence in the operation of an automobile. The appellant was in a
restaurant when a fight broke out involving L, a white man, and another person,
a coloured man who was injured. The appellant, also a coloured man, took the
injured man into his car, intending to drive him to a hospital. He then drove
off, turned left into a side street, turned off his lights and slowed down as
if to park. A minute or two later he accelerated and pulled to the right so as
to mount the curb and hit L who had just crossed the street and reached the
sidewalk. The appellant continued to the hospital and telephoned the police. In
his statement to the police he admitted that when he glanced down at his
passenger who was injured, he drove onto the curb and there was a possibility
he might then have hit a pedestrian. The appellant gave no evidence and his
defence was based on the statement he had given to the police. The conviction
was affirmed by the Court of appeal without recorded reasons. The appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The trial judge did
not err in refusing to grant the motion for a non-suit made on

[Page 288]

the ground that the evidence did not support
a charge under s. 193 of the Code.

The second question is whether the trial
judge failed to outline to the jury any theory of the defence which was
consistent of the appellant having acted otherwise than with wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives and safety of others. The defence was based on the
statement the accused had given to the police. It was read to the jury towards
the close of the Crown’s case, it was made the subject of extensive comment by
counsel for the accused in his address to the jury which was concluded less
than an hour before the judge started his charge, and it was left with the
jury. The trial judge did not err in not reading it to them again. The theory
of the defence that absence of motive (i.e. intent) is established by the
statement, was made clear in the judge’s charge.

What would be a proper charge to the jury in
a case in which there are no racial overtones does not become an improper
charge in a case involving the same facts merely because such overtones exist.
In the absence of manifestations of racial prejudice, racial overtones
surrounding a trial do not make a proper charge into an improper charge. As
there was not suggestion that there had been any manifestation of racial
prejudice in the present case, any racial overtones which may have existed at
the time of the trial had no relevance to this appeal.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
It must have been evident to everyone, and particularly to the presiding
judge, that there could be racial overtones to the proceedings with the added
dimension that the appellant was defended by a junior counsel of his own race.
Crown counsel was white as were the jurors. The trial judge did not put the
defence of accident to the jury and, in essence, denigrated the defence
contentions to an extent that vitiated the trial.

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The trial judge failed lamentably to put before
the jury the defence of the accused. There was not a single sentence in the
entire charge that goes to any defence of the accused under the law and,
especially in

[Page 289]

respect of the parts of his statement that
would be exonerating, if believed. Accident, as a defence, required not only
mention but explanation since it could have more than one meaning, including
complete absence of negligence as well as momentary inattention. The charge was
devoted to a minute repetition of the evidence of the Crown witnesses, and this
recital was associated with express to the theory of the Crown. A trial judge
does not put the defence to the jury merely by emphasizing that the Crown
carries the ultimate burden of proof to the end of the case or by telling the
jury what the issues are under the applicable law. If he sends the case to the
jury he must send it evenhandedly, with equal fairness to the accused,
according to the evidence, and to the Crown. This was not done here; in fact,
the charge can best be described as drawing an obscure curtain over any
exonerating factors telling in favour of the accused, keeping them from the
jury’s view.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ.
dissenting.

A. Maloney, Q.C., and D. O’Connor, for
the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—I have had the advantage of
reading the reasons of my brothers Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Laskin in this
case, and I am in agreement with the reasons and the conclusions stated by my
brother Ritchie. I only wish to add that, until after reading the reasons of my
brother Hall, I was unaware that any question had arisen or could arise in this
case as to justice not having been administered with impartiality, without
regard to race, colour, creed or ethnic origin.

[Page 290]

I was not previously aware, from the record or
otherwise, of the race, colour, creed or ethnic origin of counsel engaged in
the trial, or of the members of the jury. I was aware by the record that the
appellant was a coloured man, but there is nothing in the proceedings to
indicate that counsel for either side, the trial judge or the jury varied in
any way from proper court procedures and the recognized standards of fairness,
because of that fact, during the hearing of the evidence, the arguments, or the
charge to the jury. Indeed addressing the jury the learned trial Judge said:—

Now, during the course of the trial counsel
for the accused, Mr. Lindsay, referred to the fact that his client, the accused
man Arthurs is coloured. Now, gentlemen, you must disregard that altogether,
because in our administration of justice in Canada, all are equal before the law, regardless of race, colour and
creed, and it makes no difference whether a man is black, white, yellow or red,
they are all entitled to the same consideration.

My brother Hall says, quite properly, that he
does not suggest at all that the trial judge was actuated by malice or
prejudice and that he is sure that the trial judge was not so motivated. I
would infer from this that it is his view that the errors which he finds in the
charge to the jury did not result from the fact that the trial judge knew that
the accused was a coloured man.

The substantial criticism which is made is
stated as follows:—

“His failure was that he did not hold the
scales of justice in balance in a situation in which it should have been made
apparent to all that he was so doing.” The latter part of this sentence, I
assume, relates back to an earlier statement that “there could be racial
overtones to the proceedings” and to “a delicate situation”.

My view is that the duty of the trial judge to
hold the scales of justice in balance exists in

[Page 291]

every case. What would be a proper charge to the
jury in a case in which there are no racial overtones does not become an improper
charge in a case involving the same facts merely because such overtones exist.
Racial overtones are only of importance in the event that they result in a
charge in which racial prejudice is manifested, in which case the charge is not
a proper one. But in the absence of such a manifestation, racial overtones
surrounding the trial do not make a proper charge into an improper charge.
There is no suggestion that there was any manifestation of racial prejudice in
the charge in the present case. That being so, in my opinion, any racial
overtones which may have existed at the time of the trial have no relevance to
this appeal.

I agree with the disposition of this appeal
proposed by my brother Ritchie.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of Ontario rendered without recorded reasons, affirming the
conviction of the appellant after a trial held before His Honour Judge Walter
Martin, sitting with a jury, on a charge that he

on or about the 22nd of September, 1968, at
the Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle
caused bodily harm to one Robert Latus, contrary to the Criminal Code .

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
two following questions:

(1) Did the learned trial judge err in
refusing to grant the application of the defence made at the close of the
Crown’s case to dismiss the charge on the ground that the evidence adduced by
the Crown did not support a charge under section 193  of the Criminal
Code ?

[Page 292]

(2) Did the learned trial judge err in
failing to outline to the jury in his charge the theory of the defence?

Section 193  of the Criminal Code  (now
section 204 ) reads as follows:

Every one who by criminal negligence causes
bodily harm to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for ten years.

“Criminal negligence” for the purposes of the Criminal
Code  is defined in section 202  (formerly 191) as follows:

202. (1) Every one is criminally negligent
who

(a) in doing anything, or

(b) in omitting to do anything that
it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

The evidence in this case is to be tested in
accordance with the provisions of the last-quoted section which is to say
that conduct disclosing wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
others constitutes prima facie evidence of criminal negligence.

The Crown’s “case” proved against the appellant
was that between 4 and 5 a.m. on September 22, 1968, the appellant drove his
car south on Avenue Road in the City of Toronto in the centre lane of three
south-bound lanes and upon reaching Webster Avenue he turned left into this
side street, turned off his lights and slowed down as if to park, but a minute
or two later he accelerated and pulled to the right so as to mount the curb and
hit Robert Latus who had just crossed the street and reached the sidewalk.
Having hit Latus and knocked him four or five feet into the air, the
appellant’s car, which had gone about three feet six inches up on the sidewalk,
continued towards Hazelton Avenue where it proceeded in the wrong direction
down a one-way street. Included in the Crown’s evidence was a statement made by
the appellant to the police after he had been duly cautioned, in

[Page 293]

which he admitted that he drove his car down Webster Avenue and that when he glanced
down at his passenger who was injured, he drove into the curb and that there
was a possibility he might then have hit a pedestrian.

In the face of this evidence, counsel for the
defence submitted that there was no case to go to the jury in support of the
charge as laid, upon which the learned trial judge made the following ruling
with which I agree:

THE COURT: Oh well, there is an abundance
of evidence, the accused’s statement to the police officer, Constable Laing,
and Detective Stevenson, and the other officer, and he admits he was driving
the car and the evidence of the witnesses who saw the man struck, so there is
certainly plenty of evidence to go to the jury so your motion is dismissed; of
course, it is noted.

It was, however, contended before this Court
that the Crown’s evidence and the theory of the prosecution were consistent
only with the appellant having run over Latus deliberately and that, while this
evidence might support a more serious charge, it negatived “criminal
negligence” and thus afforded a good ground for granting the motion for
non-suit made by the appellant’s counsel. The only authority cited in support
of this proposition was a decision of Crisp J., who, when sitting alone in the
Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in the case of Regina v.
Barnard[1], held
that an indictment charging the offence of causing bodily harm by wanton
driving could not be supported in a case where the bodily harm occasioned by
the wanton driving resulted in the death of the victim.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
Barnard case, Crisp J. indicated that his reasoning and conclusions in
this regard differed from those of his brother Judge, Gibson

[Page 294]

J., who had occasion to make a contrary ruling
on the same point in a prior trial of the same accused on the same charge. That
Crisp J. was reluctant to disagree with his brother judge is apparent from the
following excerpt from his judgment:

…normally I would wish to follow the
decision of Gibson J., not only because of the very real respect that I feel
for his judgments, but also because of the necessity to maintain the principle
of stare decisis. But there are, I feel, some very strong considerations
in this matter the other way. The first is that this is a matter which had not
been tested in any appellate court or any other superior court that I am aware
of,…

Since Mr. Justice Crisp’s decision, the matter
does not appear to have been made the subject of an appeal to a higher court,
and whatever the law may be under the applicable statute in Tasmania, I have no
hesitation in expressing the view that the proposition propounded by counsel
for the appellant in reliance on Mr. Justice Crisp’s reasoning is without any
substance in relation to a charge under s. 193  (now s. 204) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

As I have indicated, I think that the learned
trial judge had no option but to dismiss the motion for a non-suit made by
appellant’s counsel and I would accordingly answer the first question in the
negative.

I think that the second question must be
governed by the test which I indicated at the outset, and that question
therefore is whether the learned trial judge failed to outline to the jury any
theory of the defence which was consistent with the appellant having acted
otherwise than with wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of
others.

The appellant gave no evidence and his defence
was based, as it had to be, on the statement he had given to the police which
his counsel interpreted as evidence of a simple accident that occurred when his
attention was momentarily distracted from his driving by the condition of his
injured passenger. The state-

[Page 295]

ment speaks for itself and the most relevant
portions of it are at the beginning and end.

The appellant opened his statement by saying,
with respect to the report that a pedestrian had been hit by his car on Webster Avenue: “Well, there is a
possibility that I may have hit him”. He then gave an account of a fight which
had taken place in a restaurant on Avenue Road in which a “coloured fellow” had
been hurt and continued:

…I left the restaurant and went and sit in
the car that was parked on Avenue Rd., just beside the restaurant. A few
seconds later the coloured fellow came staggering out and had blood all over
his face. So I managed to get him into my car and started up and turned around
to go along Webster Avenue and further up the avenue these two fellows were
crossing the road, and its a bit hazy what happened there but I can remember
them running across the road and the fellow beside me was groaning and I
remember glancing at him and I realized I was going into the curb and there was
a light post there and I swerved out and there was a impact and I knew the
fellows they jumped across and there was a possibility that I might have hit
one of the fellows. During this period I realized that one of the fellows was
the one who picked on me in the restaurant and out of fear I kept going until I
reached the Western Hospital where I phoned the Police. I later learned from one of the officers
that one of the fellows was injured thats about all so far.

This statement had been read to the jury by
Detective McCleave towards the close of the Crown’s case, it had been made the
subject of extensive comment by counsel for the accused in his address to the
jury which was concluded less than an hour before the judge started his charge,
and the written statement was left with the jury. I do not think that the
learned trial judge erred in not reading it to them again. In this regard,
Judge Martin told the jury that he had admitted the statements made by the
accused and he continued:

…you are to take the statements as
evidence, and you will treat them exactly the same as you treat any

[Page 296]

other evidence. In other words, you may
believe the statements made by the accused to the police, you may disbelieve
them or believe part and disbelieve the remaining part. You treat them exactly
the same as you do any other evidence which has been given by witnesses in the
witness box during the course of this trial.

And he later said:

I am not going to go over all the contents
of the written statement of the accused man because it is quite lengthy. You
will have it with you in the jury room and you will have ample opportunity to
consider it. He admits he was driving the car. There is no suggestion that he
was ill. There is no suggestion that there was something wrong with the car.
There was some talk about being hazy. I don’t know what hazy means. The first
officer didn’t say anything about being hazy. I think I indicated to you before
that insofar as the fight that took place in the restaurant, that does not
justify the accused or any other person in running a man down with a car.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the learned trial judge did not sufficiently instruct the jury as to the theory
of the defence and in particular that the defence of simple accident which had
formed the basis of the motion for a non-suit made by appellant’s counsel was
not adequately placed before them.

After this motion had been dismissed, no
evidence was called on behalf of the defence and, as I understand it, in such a
case the theory of the defence must of necessity be based either on some Crown
evidence which is capable of affording a defence or upon the more general
submission that the Crown has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The appellant’s statement had been included in
the Crown’s case after the holding of a voir dire which was occasioned
by his counsel objecting to its admissibility. As I have indicated, any theory
of the defence had to be based on the contents of that statement and in my view
the learned trial judge left the matter to the jury on this basis.

[Page 297]

The theory of the defence must be considered in
light of the case as submitted by the Crown whereby Crown counsel treated the
charge as one which necessarily involved proof that the accused had
deliberately run Latus down. In my view, this was a wrong approach which placed
an unnecessarily heavy burden on the Crown, but it was the case which the
appellant was required to meet.

The theory of the defence as outlined by counsel
was that the Crown had failed to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,
that it was the duty of the Crown to prove motive and that this was not proved
because the jury should believe the statement made by the accused.

In instructing the jury the learned trial judge
adopted the approach taken by the Crown and by the defence that in order to
succeed the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
deliberately ran Latus down and he also instructed the jury that they must
treat the statement of the accused as they would any other evidence; that they
could believe it, disbelieve it, believe part of it or disbelieve part of it.
It was the same as evidence given in the witness box and they would have it with
them in the jury room, and would have ample opportunity to consider it.

In my view the theory of the defence that
absence of motive (i.e. intent) is established by the statement, was made clear
in the judge’s charge. This was the only defence urged before the jury on
behalf of the appellant and having regard to the course of the trial and the
whole of the evidence tendered by the Crown (including the statement) I do not
think that any other realistic theories of defence were open to him, or that
the learned trial judge erred in failing to outline any other such theory in
his charge.

[Page 298]

As deliberation is not, in my opinion, a
necessary ingredient of the offence here charged, I consider the learned judge
erred in instructing the jury that in order to find the appellant guilty they
must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he “did deliberately run
down Robert Latus thereby causing him serious injuries”.

I do not regard this misdirection as dealing
only with the burden of proof upon the prosecution, but rather consider it to
be a statement of the learned trial judge’s opinion as to the essential
ingredient of the offence with which the appellant was charged. In all the
circumstances it is difficult to conceive of a misdirection which would be more
favourable to the accused, but the jury’s verdict must be construed as meaning
that they were satisfied that the appellant not only showed wanton or rockless
disregard for the lives or safety of others, but that he ran into his victim
deliberately.

As I have indicated, I am, with the greatest
respect for those who may hold a different view, unable to find any error
prejudicial to the appellant in the charge of the learned trial judge and I
would accordingly answer the second question in the negative.

As I understand it, it has long been the
practice of this Court that upon leave being granted in respect of specific
questions of law, the Court hearing the appeal will confine itself to those
questions, and this is particularly so in my view when an attempt is made
before the Court hearing the appeal to raise a further question of law which
was proposed to and rejected by the Court hearing the application for leave. As
I do not consider the question of whether the judge ought to have directed the
jury on the offence of dangerous driving to be one which arises under the
second question of law upon which leave was granted, I do not find it necessary
to deal with that question.

[Page 299]

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Since writing the above I have had the advantage
of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice, with which I
am in respectful agreement.

HALL J. (dissenting)—The facts and
circumstances involved in this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother
Laskin and I agree with him that there should be a new trial and with his
reasons therefor. There is an additional aspect to the case which I feel I must
comment upon.

The incident which culminated in the charge
against Arthurs that he

on or about the 22nd of September, 1968, at
the Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle
caused bodily harm to one Robert Latus, contrary to the Criminal Code .

began in the Webster Restaurant in Toronto. Arthurs who is a coloured man entered the restaurant to get
something to eat. He was accosted by Robert Latus, a white man, who, on his own
admission, was somewhat intoxicated. Arthurs ignored Latus and placed his
order. Having eaten and as he was about to leave the restaurant, two other
coloured men entered, one of them being Edward Payne. Latus accosted Payne,
slapped him in the face and a fight ensued. Arthurs left the restaurant and
went to his car which was parked nearby. A few seconds later the coloured man
(Payne) that Latus had fought with came staggering out with blood all over his
face. Arthurs got Payne into his car, intending to take him to Western Hospital. It was immediately after
this that the incident resulting in the charge is said to have occurred and the
Crown’s case was that Arthurs had waited until Latus came out and then
intentionally ran him down. At the hospital Arthurs phoned the police and
Police Constable Donald-

[Page300]

son interviewed him in the parking lot. Police
Constable McCleave came later and the accused was taken into custody.

On arriving at the police station Arthurs gave a
statement which was received in evidence in which he said in part: “Well there
is a possibility that I might have hit him. I’m not too positive about that.”
and later in the statement he said:

So I managed to get him into my car and
started up and turned around to go along Webster Avenue and further up the
avenue these two fellows were crossing the road, and its a bit hazy what
happened there but I can remember them running across the road and the fellow
beside me was groaning and I remember glancing at him and I realized I was
going into the curb and there was a light post there and I swerved out and
there was an impact and I knew the fellows they jumped across and there was a
possibility that I might have hit one of the fellows. During this period I
realized that one of the fellows was the one who picked on me in the restaurant
and out of fear I kept going until I reached the Western
 Hospital where I phoned the
Police.

When Arthurs came on for trial before His Honour
Judge Martin and a jury, charged as aforesaid, it must have been evident to
everyone, and particularly to the presiding judge, that there could be racial
overtones to the proceedings with the added dimension that Arthurs was being
defended by a junior counsel of his own race. Crown counsel was white as were
the jurors. Here was a delicate situation but one ideally structured to
demonstrate that the administration of justice in Toronto could and would be carried out with impartiality and without regard
to race, colour, creed or ethnic origin.

Having dealt in great detail with the evidence
for the prosecution, the trial judge in his charge referred to Arthurs’
statement but did not put the defence of accident to the jury and, in essence,
in my view, denigrated the defence contentions to an extent that vitiated the
trial. The verdict cannot stand; there must be a new trial. Justice requires no
less than this. I do not suggest at all that the judge was actuated by

[Page 301]

malice or prejudice—I am sure that he was not so
motivated. His failure was that he did not hold the scales of justice in
balance in a situation in which it should have been made apparent to all that
he was doing so. This does not mean that, if guilty, Arthurs should go
unpunished, but it does mean that whether guilty or not he was entitled to a
fair trial.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity to peruse the reasons delivered by my brother Laskin and I agree
with his view that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

I do not wish, however, to be taken to have
agreed with the view expressed by my brother Laskin that there was evidence
which justified the learned trial judge in sending the case to the jury at the
close of the Crown’s case. I am rather of the opinion that there was not, but I
find it unnecessary to deal with that issue in view of my concurrence with the
views of my brother Laskin as to the effect of the errors in the charge to the
jury.

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—The appellant
accused was convicted, after trial before His Honour Judge Walter Martin and a
jury, on a charge of causing bodily harm to one Robert Latus by criminal
negligence in the operation of an automobile. A three year term of imprisonment
was imposed by the trial judge. An appeal against conviction and sentence was
dismissed by the Ontario Court of Appeal without recorded reasons. Leave to
appeal to this Court was given on the following two questions of law:

(1) Did the learned trial judge err in
refusing to grant the application of the defence made at the close of the
Crown’s case to dismiss the charge on the ground that the evidence adduced by
the Crown did

[Page 302]

not support a charge under s. 193  of the Criminal
Code ?

(2) Did the learned trial judge err in
failing to outline to the jury in his charge the theory of the defence?

Relevant to both questions and to the issues
raised thereon are the following considerations: (1) the Crown’s case was built
on evidence that could be taken to show that the accused deliberately ran down
one Robert Latus in circumstances recounted below; (2) the Crown adduced in
evidence a statement in writing given by the accused to the police which
indicated not deliberation or recklessness in driving his car at Latus but
inadvertent accident which was not, however, free from ordinary negligence; (3)
no defence evidence was offered; (4) counsel for the accused moved for
dismissal at the close of the Crown’s case, which motion was denied; and (5)
the trial judge charged the jury in terms only of the burden on the Crown,
without express or direct mention of any defence, referable either to the
evidence adduced by the Crown or to the statement of the accused, and without
indicating whether a verdict on a lesser charge, that of dangerous driving, was
open. I shall refer in more detail to the charge as well as to the evidence,
but the foregoing enumeration provides the backdrop for the questions on which
leave to appeal was granted.

The accused, a married man with two young
children, who was steadily employed prior to his conviction and without any
previous record, was in a restaurant in Toronto in the early hours of September
22, 1968, when a fight broke out involving Latus and another person named
Payne. The restaurant was on the east side of Avenue Road at the corner of Webster Avenue which runs east from Avenue
Road for one block to Hazelton Avenue, a one-way street for north-bound traffic. The restaurant had a
front entrance on Avenue Road and a side door on

[Page 303]

the north side of Webster
 Avenue. Payne was injured in the fight which was seen
from the street by a taxi driver parked on the west side of Avenue Road
opposite the restaurant.

The taxi driver radioed his dispatcher to
contact the police, and shortly afterwards a greenish car heading south on
Avenue Road stopped near his cab. The accused was driving and had as his
passenger Payne whose face was bloodied. The passenger door had been opened and
a third person, unknown to the taxi driver and not identified later, joined the
accused and Payne, and they discussed taking Payne to the hospital. The accused
then drove off, but instead of heading due south on Avenue Road he turned left
to go east on Webster Avenue,
at the same time turning off his lights. Thereafter the taxi driver heard the
sound of a collision, and on driving to the scene he saw Latus on the south
side of Webster Avenue lying
partly on the sidewalk and partly on the grass.

Evidence of what occurred on Webster Avenue was given by another taxi
driver who happened to be walking east on the north side of Webster Avenue at the material time. He
heard a car coming from behind him, and noticed when it passed him that it had
no rear lights on. The car, which proved to be that driven by the accused,
veered slightly to the right and struck a pedestrian, then continued to the end
of Webster Avenue and turned south on Hazelton Avenue in the wrong traffic
direction. The injured pedestrian was Latus who had left the restaurant by the Webster Avenue door and was crossing that
street at an angle when he was hit as he reached the south side. In his
statement, the accused said that he thought it possible he had struck someone;
and he kept going out of fear after the impact until he reached the Toronto Western Hospital and there he telephoned the police. He was found by them at the
emergency parking lot of the hospital, standing

[Page 304]

beside his car which had headlights and
windshield damage and a missing aerial, all on the right side.

After the Crown had completed its case, counsel
for the accused moved for a dismissal on the ground that “the Crown… failed to
establish a sufficient case to go to the jury”, that is, that there was no
evidence to go to the jury in that “the only evidence we have here, what we
have here is an accident and that is about all”. This motion was given short
shrift, with the trial judge stating “there is an abundance of evidence, the
accused’s statement to the police officer… and he admits he was driving the car
and the evidence of the witnesses who saw the man struck so there is plenty of
evidence to go to the jury…”.

The charge, to which the evidence had to be
related, appears to have been an amalgam of the offences created by ss. 193  and
221(1)  of the Criminal Code  (now ss. 204  and 233(1) ); the former makes
it an offence to cause bodily harm by criminal negligence; the latter makes it
an offence to be criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle; the
indictment in this case charged that the accused “by criminal negligence in the
operation of a motor vehicle caused bodily harm to one Robert Latus”. However,
it is better viewed as charging an offence under s. 193  with an added
particular of the criminal negligence that was alleged. Counsel for the Crown
and for the accused both treated the charge as one under s. 193 . The trial
judge, in charging the jury, made a passing reference to s. 193  as having been
read by defence counsel, then read to the jury s. 191 of theCriminal Code (now
s. 202 ), which he went on to paraphrase, and towards the end of his charge he
read to the jury s. 221(1)  and repeated s. 191 . He then went on to tell
the jury what was “the degree of negligence that the Crown must prove before an
accused may be convicted of criminal

[Page 305]

negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle”.
I shall return to this instruction shortly but I note that this exposition
followed earlier statements in the charge that the two issues in the case were:
“Was the accused driving this car at five o’clock in the morning on September
22 on Webster Avenue and was he driving it in a criminally negligent manner”;
and that “the theory of the Crown is that the accused deliberately ran down
Latus on Webster Avenue causing him serious injuries”.

It is manifest that the trial judge did not
present any clear picture of the offence which the jury had to consider; and,
if anything, he left them to consider criminal negligence in the operation of a
motor vehicle, but associated with the infliction of personal injury upon
Latus.

Criminal negligence, as defined in s.191 is as
follows:

(1) Every one is criminally negligent who

(a) in doing anything, or

(b) in omitting to do anything that
it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

(2) For the purposes of this section,
“duty” means a duty imposed by law.

The trial judge, after telling the jury that
there is a duty in law upon the operator of a motor vehicle “to use reasonable
care to avoid endangering the lives and safety of other people on the roads”,
instructed them on criminal negligence as follows:

[Page 306]

I direct you gentlemen that the Crown must
prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused acted
either:—

(a) with the deliberate intention of
doing something or omitting to do something which was his duty to do, the
consequence of which he knew or should have known would endanger the lives or
safety of others, or

(b) with such disregard for the
lives and safety of others as would indicate that he was heedless of what the
consequences of his conduct would be.

From the foregoing it will be seen that as
regards the offence with which the accused Arthurs is charged, the Crown to
succeed must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, each and
every one of the following items—

Item I.—that the
accused on the 22nd day of September 1968 while driving a motor vehicle along Webster Avenue in the City of Toronto, the accused did deliberately run
down Robert Latus thereby causing him serious injuries.

Item II.—that at the place and time
aforesaid the accused Arthurs showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives
or safety of Latus and other persons.

This instruction is in the words of the late Mr.
Justice Morden speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v.
Titchner[2], an
instruction which does not appear to have been followed, in respect of its
first branch, in other provincial jurisdictions: see, for example Regina v.
Belbeck[3], and Regina
v. Rogers[4]; and
there appears to have been a recession from that instruction by the Ontario
Court of Appeal itself: see Regina v. Torrie[5]. Indeed, I am of the opinion that the
instruction as to deliberate intention puts the obligation of the Crown at too
high a level in respect of a charge to which criminal negligence is basic.
Although the question of the type of mens rea involved in criminal
negligence, as defined in s.191(1), was not directly in issue in the judgments
of this Court in O’Grady

[Page 307]

v. Sparling[6], Binus v. The
Queen[7], and Peda
v. The Queen[8], these
cases support the conclusion that subjective intent is not a necessary
ingredient of criminal negligence.

This assessment has a bearing on the position
taken by appellant’s counsel on the first question on which leave to appeal was
granted. Counsel’s submission was that having regard to the purport of the
Crown’s evidence, to the theory of the Crown, and, indeed, to the like view of
the case taken by the trial judge (as revealed, for example, in his remarks
when imposing sentence), the ascription of deliberation to the accused
negatived criminal negligence and hence entitled him to an acquittal. The
principal pressed upon this Court was that expounded in Regina v. Barnard[9], where it was held by a single judge
(differing from the view of a brother judge on the same point in a prior trial
of the accused on the same charge) that an indictment charging the offence of
causing bodily harm by wanton driving could not be supported where the evidence
showed that the victim died as a result of the wanton driving. Accordingly, at
the conclusion of the Crown’s case, the jury was directed to bring in a verdict
of not guilty.

I do not find it necessary to consider here
whether the Barnard decision states a principle applicable in this case,
or how far it turned on particular provisions of Tasmanian law or whether the
fact that the evidence tended to

[Page 308]

show culpable homicide meant, in the light of
the local law, that it should have been charged as such, or whether it is
central to the submission of appellant’s counsel that he be able to show that
the appellant would be deprived of the right to plead autrefois convict or
acquit, as the case may be, if tried on a charge on which the evidence,
as lead, would show a graver offence. As to this last observation, reference
may be had to s. 519(1)  of the Criminal Code  (now s.538(1) ) which reads
as follows:

Where an indictment charges substantially
the same offence as that charged in an indictment on which an accused was
previously convicted or acquitted, but adds a statement of intention or
circumstances of aggravation tending, if proved, to increase the punishment,
the previous conviction or acquittal bars the subsequent indictment.

What is clear here is that at the close of the
Crown’s case—and it is with this point of the trial that we are concerned—there
was evidence in the statement of the accused denying intent. It was proper,
therefore, to send the case to the jury, even on the erroneous instruction
given to them, since it could not be said that any conviction, if made, must necessarily
rest on evidence which would establish a more serious offence than that
charged. This is enough to dispose of the point raised under the first question
without embarking on any discussion of the Crown’s discretion to lay a lesser
charge than what the evidence that it has, if fully accepted, would support.

Turning to the second question, I am of the
opinion that the trial judge failed lamentably to put before the jury the
defence of the accused. There is not a single sentence in the entire charge
that goes to any defence of the accused under the law and, especially in
respect of the parts of his statement that would be exonerating, if believed.
Accused’s counsel raised the

[Page 309]

issue of accident when making his motion for
dismissal, and, in his address to the jury, read the accused’s statement and
asked that it be believed. Accident, as a defence, required not only mention
but explanation since it could have more than one meaning, including complete
absence of negligence as well as momentary inattention. The statement given by
the accused was as follows:

Well there is a possibility that I might
have hit him. I’m not too positive about that. It started with me going into
the restaurant and after entering the restaurant I was confronted by this fellow
who asked me what was I doing there? I asked him what that has to do with him
and he insisted to know what did I come in the restaurant for and he appeared
to be drunk. So I ignored him and placed my order. I was served and started to
go out and these two coloured guys was coming in and this fellow went over to
one of the fellows and wanted to know what he was doing in the restaurant also.
At one stage when he confronted me he told me that I was black and he was white
I replied that I knew this. Now, when he asked this coloured fellow what he was
doing inside this fellow smiled and the white fellow got nasty and slapped the
coloured fellow and then he slapped back and a fight broke out and I left the
restaurant and went and sit in the car that was parked on Avenue Rd., just
beside the restaurant. A few seconds later the coloured fellow came staggering
out and had blood all over his face. So I managed to get him into my car and
started up and turned around to go along Webster Avenue and further up the avenue
these two fellows were crossing the road, and its a bit hazy what happened
there but I can remember them running across the road and the fellow beside me
was groaning and I remember glancing at him and I realized I was going into the
curb and there was a light post there and I swerved out and there was an impact
and I knew the fellows they jumped across and there was a possibility that I
might have hit one of the fellows. During this period I realized that one of
the fellows was the one who picked on me in the restaurant and out of fear I
kept going until I reached the Western Hospital where I phoned the Police. I
later learned from one of the officers that one of the fellows was injured
thats about all so far.

[Page 310]

In his charge the trial judge first referred to
the statement to support the identification evidence of Crown witnesses. He
then told the jury that it was to be regarded in the same way as any other
evidence in the case; it could be believed or disbelieved in whole or in part.
Pages of the charge were devoted to a minute repetition of the evidence of the
Crown witnesses, and this recital was associated with express reference to the
theory of the Crown. Towards the end of the charge he came back to the
statement in these words:

I am not going to go over all the contents
of the written statement of the accused man because it is quite lengthy. You
will have it with you in the jury room and you will have ample opportunity to
consider it. He admits he was driving the car. There is no suggestion that he
was ill. There is no suggestion that there was something wrong with the car.
There was some talk about being hazy. I don’t know what hazy means. The first
officer didn’t say anything about being hazy. I think I indicated to you before
that insofar as the fight that took place in the restaurant, that does not
justify the accused or any other person in running a man down with a car.

The only other reference to the accused’s
position was this sentence:

So far as the defence is concerned Mr.
Lindsay [accused’s counsel] says that the Crown has failed to prove this case
beyond a reasonable doubt and he says that Latus is not to be believed.

A trial judge does not put the defence to the
jury merely by emphasizing that the Crown carries the ultimate burden of proof
to the end of the case or by telling the jury what the issues are under the
applicable law. Courts have said time and again that an accused is entitled to
have any defence, however poor it may be, which is raised by the evidence, put
directly to the jury; and this, whether or not his counsel has advanced it and
whether or not defence evidence was offered: see Henderson v. The

[Page 311]

King[10]. A fortiori is
this so where a defence has been advanced, as in this case, and where, if
accepted or if taken to raise a reasonable doubt when measured against the
Crown’s evidence, the verdict must be one of acquittal.

It is of no consequence in a jury trial that the
trial judge does not believe in the defences which the evidence raises. If he
sends the case to the jury he must send it evenhandedly, with equal fairness to
the accused, according to the evidence, and to the Crown. This was not done
here; in fact, the charge can best be described as drawing an obscuring curtain
over any exonerating factors telling in favour of the accused, keeping them
from the jury’s view. Of course, the jury heard the evidence; of course, the
accused’s statement was in its hands as an exhibit produced by the Crown (a
statement which the trial judge mentioned in its features adverse to the
accused when it was mentioned at all). These considerations are not a
substitute for the trial judge’s obligation to conduct the case fairly between
state and individual. He must tell the jury what is the legal significance of
the evidence put in by way of the accused’s statement. If they are to take the
law from him (and this is basic to our view of a criminal trial before judge
and jury), he cannot default in his duty to bring it into relation to the
evidence.

I do not say that the trial judge is under
obligation to give a meticulous review of the evidence, although as I have
pointed out he did this here in respect of the Crown’s case. From this point of
view, I do not dwell, in relation to the present case, on the situation which
this Court faced in Azoulay v. The Queen[11]. The paraphrase of the evidence, the
question of put-

[Page 312]

ting it substantially to the jury, is only one
part of the composite obligation of making clear to the jury what are the
defences to a charge. The other part is to give a legal characterization of the
evidence. There will be cases where greater or lesser attention is necessary to
the details of evidence supporting one or more defences. I cannot, however,
conceive of cases where, upon a trial after a plea of not guilty, it is
unnecessary to tell the jury what the defence is. In Provencher v. The Queen[12], Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking
for the Court, said (at p. 100) “The theory of the defence was simple
enough and no elaborate direction was called for; it was however
incumbent on the trial judge to point out to the jury [what] this theory was…”
[The Italics are mine]. Dispensation with an elaborate direction is one thing;
failure to give any direction is something else, and that is the present case.

I would, on this ground, allow the appeal, set
aside the conviction and direct a new trial.

One further point was taken by appellant’s
counsel under the second question of law, namely, that the trial judge ought to
have directed the jury on the offence of dangerous driving, as an included
offence, on which a verdict was open under the charge as laid and on the
evidence adduced in support of it. I would not construe the second question so
narrowly as to exclude this ground, which, indeed, was raised on the application
for leave. In any event, it is open to the Court to expand the grounds of
leave; and in this case, as its factum shows, the Crown was not taken by
surprise and responded fully in its factum to this ground, albeit it was very
shortly stated in the appellant’s factum.

[Page 313]

That dangerous driving may be an included
offence under a charge of an offence under s.193  is expressly stipulated in s.
569(4) (now s. 589(5)) which, so far as material, provides that “Where a count
charges an offence under section…193…arising out of the operation of a motor
vehicle…and the evidence does not prove such offence but does prove an offence
under subsection 4 of section 221…the accused may be convicted of [the latter]
offence…” The only question then is whether the evidence, including the
statement of the accused, could be viewed as supporting a conviction of
dangerous driving if it was not sufficient to prove the offence charged. In my
opinion, such a view was open; and I do not think that the mere assertion of
accident, which has a range of meanings, is enough to disentitle the accused to
have a direction on the lesser offence. I cannot accept what was said by
Richards J. in Regina v. Billingsley[13],
as stating a general principle, without regard to the nature of the offence to
which a defence of accident is raised.

This second defect in the charge reinforces the
direction I would make for a new trial; and I repeat that the appeal should
accordingly be allowed and a new trial directed. It would not be proper on the
record before us to accede to the request of appellant’s counsel to substitute
a conviction of dangerous driving, albeit there is power in this Court so to
do.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Game—Cheating—Milk bottle toss
at fair—Three bottles similar in appearance—Heavier bottles at bottom of pyramid—No
indication of varying weights—Difficulty of knocking them over—Whether “game of
skill”—Whether fraudulent intent—Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 168 (1)(f), 181.

The appellant operated a game known as the
milk bottle toss at a fair. To play this game, the player throws a ball at
three metalic bottles so arranged on a platform as to form a pyramid, and tries
to knock down all three bottles. The bottles were all similar in appearance but
the two bottles at the foot of the pyramid were much heavier than the one on
top. The appellant was convicted of cheating while playing a game with intent
to defraud, contrary to s. 181  of the Criminal Code . The conviction
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this
Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

If the game of bottle toss had been what it
appeared to be to the patron, it would have been a game of pure skill. But, by
the device of making the two bottles on the lower layer of the pyramid heavier
than the upper bottle, the operator turned a game of pure skill into a game of
mixed skill and chance. It is by the use of bottles varying so markedly in
weight that the game of skill which appeared to face the patron was changed to
a game of mixed skill and chance. The weighing of the bottles would have
constituted the addition of a requirement for a higher degree of skill if the
varying weights of the three bottles had been plainly indicated thereon. In the
present case the intent of the accused was not only to induce a state of mind
in the player but to induce a course of action by the instilling of that state
of mind. The trial judge was therefore correct in finding that the accused had
the

[Page 279]

intention to defraud. The weighing of the
bottles, without knowledge of the patron, constituted cheating.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.

H.E. Stafford, Q.C., for the appellant.

Ian Cartwright, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal by leave of this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on May 17, 1971. In that judgment the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissed the appeal from the conviction of the appellant by the
Provincial Court Judge on December 10, 1970, upon the charge that

Richard McGarey you are charged that on or
about the 9th day of May in the year 1970 at the town of Ajax in the County and Province of Ontario
you unlawfully did with intent to defraud one Barry Nolan, cheat while playing
a game to wit: milk bottle toss contrary to S. 181  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

Section 181  of the Criminal Code  of Canada (now R.S.C. 1970, c. C-74, s. 192)
provides

Every one who, with intent to defraud any
person, cheats while playing a game or in holding the stakes for a game or in
betting is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
two years.

The appellant as an employee of one Watson was
operating at a Canadian Legion fair in the town of Ajax a game known as the milk bottle toss. The complainant Constable
Nolan attended the fair upon the instructions of his superiors and was watching
this milk bottle toss when he was solicited by the accused to play the game. He
did so throwing four balls and paying a total

[Page 280]

of 75c being at the regular rate of 25c for the
first throw and then 50c for the next three throws.

Milk bottle toss was played on this occasion as
follows: Three metallic bottles were arranged on a platform, the platform being
about 1½ inches off the ground with two bottles set side by side some little
distance apart and the third bottle set on the top of the two to form the apex
of the pyramid. The player stood about 8½ feet to 10 feet away from this
pyramid of bottles which all had exactly similar appearance and threw a ball
much like the softball used in baseball at the pyramid in an attempt to knock
down all three bottles. Should the player be successful in doing so he was
awarded a prize which was said to be of a value of $2.75. As I have said the
bottles were all similar in appearance but that appearance was deceptive. The
bottle which sat on top of the two others at the apex of the pyramid weighted a
little less than 3 lbs. The actual one used in the game which the constable
played was 2 lb. 15 oz. The two bottles at the foot of the pyramid and upon
which the light bottle rested were very much heavier, in this particular case 8
lb. 7 oz. and a similar variation of weight appeared in the other two game
setups standing one on either side of the one actually used by the constable.
The constable on his first throw struck the right hand lower bottle and the top
bottle, both of which fell but the left hand lower bottle remained standing and
on a second throw he missed the pyramid entirely. On a third throw he missed
the actual pyramid and struck the base. In both these throws of course no
bottles fell. On the fourth and final throw the constable knocked off the top
bottle and left the two bottom bottles standing. The constable called for other
members of the police force. The accused man was arrested and charged. After a
trial the learned Provincial Court Judge registered a conviction and gave one
year’s suspended sentence to the appellant. The appellant appealed to the Court
of Appeal for Ontario and his
appeal was dismissed without written reasons. The appellant then by leave
appealed to this Court. The appellant took four

[Page 281]

grounds of appeal in his argument to the Court.
These grounds are as follows:

(1) That no offence was committed by the
Appellant in view of the evidence that Constable Nolan played the bottle toss
as a result of receiving certain information and instructions from persons
other than the Appellant.

(2) That the bottle toss is a game of skill
and not a game as contemplated by s. 181  and defined by s. 168 (1)  (f)
of the Criminal Code .

(3) That the Appellant was not actually “playing
a game” in accordance with the wording of s. 181  of the Criminal Code .

(4) That the placing of the two heavier
bottles on the bottom of the pyramid merely had the effect of raising the
degree of skill necessary to win and did not constitute a fraudulent intent to
obtain money from Constable Nolan by a deceitful practice while playing a game.

It is my intention to deal with these grounds seriatim.
Firstly, the appellant submits that due to the fact that Constable Nolan
went to this fair on instructions to watch this game and to play it that the
representation made by the appellant had no bearing on the constable engaging
in the milk bottle toss. I think this submission is answered completely by consideration
of the words of the Section creating the offence “Every one who, with
intent to defraud any person, cheats”. It is the intent of the accused not the
intent of the victim which is the issue under the Section. The accused had no
knowledge that Constable Nolan had attended and played the game upon
instructions from his superiors. So far as he was aware Constable Nolan was
simply another member of the public who could be induced to spend his money in
playing this game and the accused with the intent to obtain money from the
person who turned out to be Constable Nolan did induce that person to pay money
and to play the game. The second ground of appeal is that the bottle toss game
was a game of skill and therefore not a game as contemplated by s. 181  and
defined by s. 168 (1)  (f) of the Criminal Code . The latter

[Page 282]

subsection defines “game” for the purpose
of Part 5 of the Criminal Code  to be:

“game” means a game of chance or mixed
chance and skill

I am ready to agree with counsel for the appellant
that if the game of bottle toss had been what it appeared to be to the patron
who stepped up to the booth, paid his fee and engaged in the game, it would
have been a game of pure skill. With the exception that the bottle was thrown
rather than rolled, it much resembles a game of bowls. Of course, the bowl
rolled by the player down the alley would not hit all of the pins whether there
were five or ten. In fact, to do so would have been impossible. Yet the skill
of the bowler very frequently causes all the pins to fall. This results from
what bowlers term the “action” when one pin hit by the bowl is thrown against
another pin and that pin against a third or fourth or fifth, resulting in all
of them falling. So, to outward appearance, the player of this game of milk
bottle toss could count on the “action” between three bottles alone which
composed the “set up” to cause all of the bottles to fall despite the fact that
only one of the bottles had been hit by the bell. The difficulty which the
appellant faces and with which I shall deal later when I discuss the fourth
ground of appeal was that this was not a situation which the patron faced. The
two bottles on the lower layer of the pyramid were many times heavier than the
upper bottle. Therefore, there could not be the “action” upon which a bowler
was entitled to rely and upon which the player in this game was entitled,
judging by all appearances, to rely, so that all the bottles would be knocked
down if only one bottle were struck, whether that bottle were the one on the
top of the pyramid or either one on the base of the pyramid. Therefore, by this
device, the operator, the employer of the accused, had turned a game of pure
skill into a game of mixed skill and chance. A lucky hit between the two lower
bottles might knock down all three bottles, but such a hit would be no more
skilful than one which struck the outer edge of either of the lower bottles and
which, if they were evenly weighted, would have caused

[Page 283]

inevitably the “action” resulting in all three
of the bottle falling. In Ross, Banks and Dyson v. The Queen[1], Pigeon J. said at p.791:

However, when the statute speaks of chance
as opposed to skill, it is clear that it contemplates not the unpredictables
that may occasionally defeat skill but the systematic resort to chance involved
in many games such as the throw of dice, the deal of cards.

It is by the use of bottles varying so markedly
in weight that the game of skill which appeared to face the patron was changed
to a game of mixed skill and chance and, in fact, the chance all weighed
against the patron.

As its third ground the appellant submits that
he was not actually playing the game and that the only player was Nolan. In his
Factum the counsel for the appellant describes the appellant’s act as being
mere passive presence while the game was being played. I am of the opinion that
the circumstances do not support such a contention. It was the accused who
solicited the constable to engage in the game. It was the accused who collected
the constable’s money when he paid the required fee. It was the accused who was
in charge of the placing of the bottles in the three-bottle pyramid and it was
the accused who would have had to part with a prize had the constable been so
fortunate as to knock down the three bottles. In my view the accused was an
active participant not a mere passive bystander.

The fourth ground of appeal submitted by the
counsel for the appellant that the placing of the two heavier bottles on the
bottom of the pyramid merely had the effect of raising the degree of skill
necessary to win and did not constitute a fraudulent intent to obtain money
from Constable Nolan by a deceitful practise while playing a game, I have
already dealt with in part. In

[Page 284]

my opinion, the placing of the heavy bottles in
such a fashion did much more than constitute the addition of a requirement for
a higher degree of skill. That would have been so if the varying weight of the
three bottles had been plainly indicated thereon. When the weights were not so
indicated, as I have pointed out, the game of pure skill had added to it, or to
put it another way, built into it an element of chance and in fact a very
unlikely chance. Did this weighing of the bottles without knowledge of the
patron constitute cheating? Again reference should be made to the actual words
of the section under which the appellant was charged “Every one who, with
intent to defraud any person, cheats”. The intention to defraud was dealt with
in the Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side of the Province of Quebec in Re Rosen[2].
There Martin J. giving the majority judgment of the Court was dealing with a
game of three card Monte and at page 382 said:

The gist of the offence here charged is
cheating that is to say, perpetrating some fraud or ill-practice of making use
of some unlawful device in the act of playing.

The offence is cheating with intent to defraud
and defrauding is dealt with by Buckley J. in Re London & Globe Finance
Corporation, Ltd.[3]:

To deceive is, I apprehend, to induce a man
to believe that a thing is true which is false, and which the person practising
the deceit knows or believes to be false. To defraud is to deprive by deceit:
it is by deceit to induce a man to act to his injury. More tersely it may be
put, that to deceive is by falsehood to induce a state of mind; to defraud is
by deceit to induce a course of action.

Although such a statement was obiter it
has received wide acceptance as being the distinction between deceiving and
defrauding. In the present case the intent of the accused was not only to
induce a state of mind in the player but to induce a course of action by the
instilling of

[Page 285]

that state of mind and I am of the opinion that
the learned Provincial Judge therefore was correct in finding the accused had
the intention to defraud. Then the question arises whether the accused did
cheat. I have quoted supra Martin J.’s definition of cheating in Re
Rosen, the “perpetrating of a fraud or ill-practice or making use of some
unlawful device.” Here the accused man caused three metallic bottles exactly
similar in appearance to be arranged so that the two which were much heavier
sat on the bottom and the light bottle on the top. The appearance of this
pyramid was such that anyone would believe that it would be very easy to knock
over these three bottles. One witness Slavnick said that if all the bottles
were the same weight and if they were all light the operator could not stay in
business as a four year-old child could knock them over. That was however, the
exact visual impression given to any prospective player of the game as he
looked at the pyramid and it was that visual impression which induced the
prospective player to play the game. That was the “perpetrating of the fraud or
ill-practice” to use again the words of Martin J. It was this feature which the
learned Provincial Court Judge stressed in his reasons for judgment when he
said:

The cogent matter is what they [a
tremendous lot of young people] believe and what they are not told. I think the
average youngster takes a look at those dozen bottles and they would
say—without examining them because they don’t get that opportunity—they would
say they were all the same… In reality they are not the same. If there were a
sign or some advertisement on these bottles saying this one is several times
heavier than this one, or if it were posted up on a board so the public knew
what they were doing, there would be no fraud.

The learned Provincial Court Judge found that
the like appearance of bottles which in fact were varied very markedly in
weight constituted a deceit and that the deceit was intended to induce the
player to part with his money and that therefore the operator did cheat the
player. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Admissibility—Conspiracy—Acts and declarations of one conspirator
acquitted—Criminal code , ss. 592 (1) (b)(iii), 619 .

The appellants, G and P, together with Z and
M, were tried on a charge that they, with W.S. and M.S. and persons unknown,
conspired to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in a narcotic. The
jury convicted M and acquitted Z, but were unable to agree as to a verdict
respecting the two appelants. The indictment was amended so as to charge only
the two appellants of conspiring together, and with Z, M, W.S. and M.S. and
persons unknown, to commit the said indictable offence. Prior to the trial,
M.S., who had been a witness for the Crown, had died. By leave of the trial
judge, pursuant to s. 619  of the Criminal Code , the evidence of
M.S., given at the earlier trial, was read as evidence in the proceedings. A
portion of that evidence related to acts and declarations of Z in the absence
of the appellants. The convictions of the appellants having been affirmed by
the Court of Appeal, the appellants obtained leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The evidence as to Z’s acts was properly
admissible. It is not necessary to express an opinion on the admissibility of
the evidence as to Z’s declarations, in the absence of the appellants, because,
even if that evidence was inadmissible, it was unimportant and s. 592(1)  (b)(iii)
could properly be applied.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1]
affirming the convictions of the appellants. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 274]

H. Walsh, Q.C., and Jack McGivern, for
the appellants.

S.M. Toy, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which dismissed the appellants’ appeal from conviction for
conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in a narcotic.

In January, 1970, the appellants, together with
Ido Zamai and John McKeoff, were tried before a judge and jury on the charge
that they, with William T. Smith, Murray Theodore Spreckley and persons
unknown, conspired to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in a
narcotic. The jury was unable to agree, and a new trial on the same indictment
was held in May, 1970. At this trial, the jury convicted McKeoff and acquitted
Zamai, but were unable to agree as to a verdict respecting the two appellants.

On September 8, 1970, the indictment was amended
so as to charge only the two appellants of conspiring together, and with Zamai,
McKeoff, Smith and Spreckley and persons unknown, to commit the said indictable
offence. They were tried before a judge and jury and convicted.

Prior to this third trial, Spreckley, who had
been a witness for the Crown, had died. At this trial, by leave of the trial
judge, pursuant to s. 619  (now s. 643) of the Criminal Code , the
evidence of Spreckley, given at the earlier trial, was read as evidence in the
proceedings.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Bull J.A. and
Taggart J.A. applied the provisions of s. 592 (1)  (b) (iii) (now
s. 613(1) (b) (iii)) of the Code and dismissed the appeals. Tysoe
J.A., dissenting, would not have applied this provision.

[Page 275]

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
three questions of law:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia err in failing to allow the appeal of the appellants and quash the
verdict when the charge on which the appellants were found guilty was one in
which Ido Zamai was a named co-conspirator?

2. Was the learned trial judge wrong in law
in permitting the evidence of Murray Theodore Spreckley given at a previous
trial to be read as part of the Crown’s case under the provisions of
s. 619  of the Criminal Code ?

3. Was the learned trial judge wrong in law
in having failed to exclude from the evidence of Murray Theodore Spreckley,
given at a previous trial and read in at the trial of the appellants under
s. 619  of the Criminal Code , those portions of the evidence in
which Murray Theodore Spreckley testified to the acts and declarations of Ido
Zamai in the absence of the appellants?

After the submissions of counsel for the
appellants had been made to this Court in respect of these three questions,
counsel for the respondent was advised that he need only submit argument in
respect of Question 3.

With respect to the matter raised in this
question, Bull J.A. had this to say:

As to Zamai, I have no difficulty in
concluding that the not inconsiderable evidence of his associations with each
of the appellants and with Smith and Spreckley and the evidence of the latter
as to the purchases of narcotics from him was admissible and properly admitted
notwithstanding that, because of his earlier acquittal, the appellants could
not properly be found to have committed the crime of conspiracy with him.
That evidence was relevant and material to the Crown’s case unfolded to the
jury with respect to conduct and actions of the other persons alleged to be
parties to or participants in the charged conspiracy. It was evidence that
could have been admitted even if Zamai had not been tried for the conspiracy or
included in the charge as a named co-conspirator. It was evidence which was
relevant and admissible as key links in the chain in the carrying out of the
purposes and common design of the alleged conspiracy, quite aside from the
question of whether or not

[Page 276]

Zamai was a member of, or co-conspirator
in, that conspiracy.

However, in my view the situation is
different with respect to a certain conversation entered into evidence which
might have been prejudicial and which would have been admissible only on the
basis of Zamai being a co-conspirator with the appellants. See Paradis v.
The King [1934] S.C.R. 165; Koufis v. The King [1941] S.C.R. 481.
The evidence arose out of the deceased Spreckley’s testimony (read into
evidence by the Crown) in which a discussion between him and Zamai was related.
After recounting certain transactions and dealings with Zamai, Spreckley
testified:

“Well, on second plant that I got from
Zamai he told me next to get in touch with Dave Ponak, gave me a phone number
that, and so then…”

The reference was of course to the
appellant Ponak, and in my view that portion of the evidence should not have
been admitted. In fairness, I must say that Crown counsel offered to edit
Spreckley’s testimony being read into evidence by deleting that answer, but the
offer was not accepted by defence counsel. The evidence raised no prejudice to
the appellant Gunn, but obviously, on the surface, was prejudicial to the
appellant Ponak. However, the evidence of what occurred later demonstrates that
the error was of small moment. Spreckley went on to say that he did in fact
later communicate with Ponak by telephone, made arrangements for a rendez-vous and
purchased from him, directly, on two occasions in the next two or three weeks a
total of 800 capsules of heroin for $4,800.00 cash. In view of this direct and
admissible evidence of dealings with Ponak, the fact that Zamai told him to go
to that appellant becomes almost immaterial and certainly of little
consequence. I do not overlook that there were other incidents of conversations
related between Zamai and Smith and between Zamai and Spreckley, but, although
inadmissible, none of them can be said to have been prejudicial in the
slightest degree to either appellant. They all had references to transactions
between Zamai and Smith or Spreckley, the evidence of which I have determined
was admissible, and had no reference to the appellants.

In my respectful opinion, the evidence
improperly admitted into evidence was of insufficient importance to affect the
verdict, and I consider that its omission

[Page 277]

could not have affected the jury’s verdict
in any way. I would certainly apply to the error of law in question the
provisions of Code section 592(l)(b)(iii), about which I
will deal further later in this judgment.

We are all of the opinion that evidence as to
Zamai’s acts was properly admissible. If there was any error at all, it could
only be in respect of the admission of evidence as to Zamai’s declarations, in
the absence of the appellants. It is not necessary to express and we do not
express any opinion on this point, because, even if that evidence was
inadmissible, we agree with the view expressed by Bull J.A. as to its
unimportance, and we agree that s. 592(1) (b)(iii) could properly be
applied.

Accordingly, we are of the opinion that this
appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO

Criminal law—Trial—Discharge of
counsel—Refusal of trial judge to allow discharge—No error.

The appellant was indicted on six counts of
arson and related offences. He was convicted on five counts. He was represented
by counsel at the preliminary hearing. The same counsel appeared for him at the
trial. The first day was taken up by two motions, one for severance of the
counts and the other, for a change of venue. Both motions were denied. Counsel
participated in the selection of the jury. The next morning, before any
evidence was called, the appellant requested a postponement of the trial and a
change of counsel. The trial judge stated that he would not permit the accused
to discharge his counsel at the last minute and would not permit counsel to
withdraw. Counsel represented the accused throughout the rest of the trial,
cross-examined, lead the accused’s own evidence, addressed the jury and spoke
as to sentence. The conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court
of appeal. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ: There was no request by the accused or by counsel
representing him that the accused should be permitted to defend himself. The
request was for a change of counsel and a postponement of trial until new
counsel could be retained. With all that had happened, the accused was not
entitled to this. If he wished to discharge counsel at this stage, he had the
right to proceed with the trial and conduct his own defence. The ruling made by
the trial judge was in the accused’s own interest. There was no unequivocal
discharge of counsel, there was a manoeuvre to frustrate the ruling of the
trial judge that there would be no change of venue and no severance of the
counts and, finally, there was a

[Page 254]

reaffirmation of the retainer. The evidence
against the accused was overwhelming.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The intention of the appellant to discharge his counsel was
made clear and unequivocal. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to
refuse to permit any postponement of the trial. However, the refusal to permit
any litigant to discharge his counsel whether during the course of a proceeding
in Court or on another occasion is a very different matter. The breach of the
accused’s right to make full answer and defence and of his fundamental right to
the conduct of his own trial is a miscarriage of justice and not a mere error
in law, and therefore, s. 592(1)(b)(iii) cannot be applied.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: It was the trial judge’s duty to consider the request of the
accused even if in the result the accused might have to conduct his own
defence. It is not suggested that an accused has an absolute right to interrupt
and delay a trial by a belated desire to be represented by another counsel, but
neither has a trial judge an absolute right to force an accused to continue
with his counsel. The trial judge dealt with this issue in too peremptory a
manner, and in consequence, erred in a material matter going to the rights of
the accused.

APPEAL from a judgement of the Court of
appeal for Ontario[1],
affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed, Spence and Laskin
JJ. dissenting.

C.R. Thomson, for the appellant.

D.A. McKenzie, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

JUDSON J.—This case, which involves an attempt
by an accused person to have his trial postponed and an opportunity to retain
fresh counsel, must be unique on its facts. The appellant was indicted on six
counts of arson and related offences. He was convicted on five counts. He was
represented by counsel at the

[Page 255]

preliminary hearing. The same counsel appeared
for him at the trial. The first day was taken up by two motions, one for a
severance of the counts, and the other for a change of venue. Both motions were
denied. The jury panel was called and the jury selected, counsel for the
accused participating in the selection of the jury. The remainder of the panel
was then discharged.

The next morning, before any evidence was
called, the following exchange took place between counsel and the accused on
one side and the Bench on the other:

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, I wonder if I
might have some time?

THE COURT: Take whatever time you need. You
take whatever time you require. We will adjourn if Mr. MacKay wants to
consult with his client about some matter.

THE ACCUSED: I want a postponement.

THE COURT: Oh, well, the case now is being
tried, Mr. Spataro. I mean, there will be no… (interrupted.)

THE ACCUSED: (Interrupting) Change of
lawyer.

THE COURT: I beg your pardon?
Mr. MacKay?

MR. MACKAY: Had we better adjourn for ten
minutes?

…

MR. MACKAY: Just before the Jury return I
wonder if Mr. Spataro might be… oh, I see… just one moment…

THE COURT: Yes, Mr. MacKay, you take
your time. —(Mr. MacKay and accused off the record.)

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, Mr. Spataro
instructs me that he wishes to discharge me. He is not prepared to accept my
advice on a matter.

THE COURT: Mr. Spataro?

MR. MACKAY: Under the circumstances I’d ask
Your Honour’s permission to withdraw from the matter. I don’t know if I am
following these… those rules that are set out.

THE COURT: I may say, so far as Spataro,
you have been acting for him all along and, Mr. Spataro, I don’t permit
the accused to discharge his coun-

[Page 256]

sel at the last minute and I don’t permit
counsel to withdraw and so the case will go on and Mr. MacKay will act for
you. That is my order.

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, for the sake of
the record I am not precise on what those new rules of the Law Society are.

THE COURT: So far as withdrawing it must be
done in such time as to notify the Crown Attorney’s office and all other
officials.

MR. MACKAY: For the sake of the record
might I… I think I should perhaps object to that.

THE COURT: Oh, that’s fine. Oh, yes, that
is perfectly all right, Mr. MacKay. It’s on the record.

It is apparent from this exchange that the first
request made by the accused was for a postponement. Then he mentioned change of
counsel. Then there was a clear statement by counsel that his client had
informed him that he wished to discharge him, the client not being prepared to
accept his advice on a matter. This is all that we know about the reason for
the request. The request was not one either by counsel or the accused that the
accused wished to conduct his own defence. It was in essence a further request
for a postponement which had been involved in the motion for a change of venue.

After this incident, counsel represented the
accused throughout the rest of the six-day trial and made representations as to
sentence on another date. On the third day of the trial, counsel renewed his
motion for a change of venue and for a halt to the proceedings. The accused permitted
counsel to cross-examine, to lead the accused’s own evidence, to address the
jury and, finally, to speak as to sentence.

Following conviction and sentence, the accused
retained the same counsel to act for him on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Ontario.
Due to a misunderstanding between the accused and his counsel, this appeal was
not

[Page 257]

instituted. The next step was a prisoner’s
appeal, prepared with the assistance of a Legal Aid Counsel. Later, this was
converted into a solicitor’s appeal by the withdrawal of the prisoner’s appeal
and the filing and service of a new Notice of Appeal by the new solicitor.
Neither Notice of Appeal mentioned the matter now complained of. It appeared
for the first time in the appellant’s factum filed in the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal[2] was divided but in the result the appeal
was dismissed. Jessup J.A. held that there was error in law in the ruling of
the learned trial judge that he would not permit the accused to discharge his
counsel at the last minute and would not permit counsel to withdraw. However,
he was satisfied that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
and applied s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

Kelly J.A. agreed with Jessup J.A., that there
would have been error in the judge’s ruling if he had refused to permit the
accused to terminate the retainer of counsel but he held that there had never
been an unequivocal discharge of counsel by the accused and that in effect he
had reaffirmed the retainer and continued to be represented by him throughout
the trial. I agree with this assessment of the situation which confronted the
trial judge.

Brooke J.A., dissenting, held that the accused
had the right to proceed without this particular person as his counsel, that
this right was wrongly denied him, and that there had been a mistrial.

There was no request by the accused or by
counsel representing him that the accused should be permitted to defend
himself. My opinion is that the request was for a change of counsel and a
postponement of trial until new counsel could be retained. With all that had
happened, the accused was not entitled to this. If he wished to discharge
counsel at this stage,

[Page 258]

he had the right to proceed with the trial and
conduct his own defence.

I am satisfied, after consideration of the whole
record, that the ruling made by the trial judge was in the accused’s own
interest. This accused was totally incapable of adequate self‑representation
in a trial of this magnitude, and had he been told that he must conduct his own
defence and that this was his only alternative, I feel sure that an Appellate
Court would have had reason to question whether justice had been done. No
criticism can be made of the manner in which counsel conducted the defence. It
is so stated by Kelly J.A., in the Court of Appeal. We are not faced here with
problems which arise when counsel is assigned at the last minute and the
accused takes the position that counsel is inadequately instructed and prepared
or that he is dissatisfied for good reason with the conduct of his defence.

In the circumstances of this case, I would hold,
first, that there was no unequivocal discharge of counsel; second, that what
happened was a manoeuvre to frustrate the ruling of the trial judge that there
would be no change of venue (which would involve a postponement of the trial)
and no severance of the counts; and third, that there was a reaffirmation of
the retainer. The words used by the learned trial judge must be understood in
relation to the particular situation with which he was confronted. He obviously
decided that the application was not made in good faith but for the purpose of
delay, and I agree with him. The right of defence is not a licence to obstruct
the course of justice and the trial judge was right that this was the real
issue.

The determination of this appeal is not helped
by the decision in R. v. Barnes[3]. This
was a plain case of improper judicial interference with

[Page 259]

the conduct of the defence. During the course of
that trial, the judge, in the absence of the jury, said that the accused was
plainly guilty and that the time of the court was being wasted. He went on to
comment on the growing frequency of hopeless defences and invited defending
counsel to reconsider his position. Under this outburst, counsel disclosed the
advice that he had given to his client and asked for leave to withdraw. The
judge then said that any other counsel would be bound to give the same advice
to the accused. He asked the accused whether he wished present counsel to
defend him or whether he would prefer to defend himself. He said that he would
defend himself and asked for a short adjournment. Being refused the
adjournment, he then agreed to continue to be represented by his present
counsel and maintained his plea of not guilty. The jury, which had been
excluded while all this was going on, brought in a verdict of guilty.

The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and
refused to apply the proviso, counsel for the prosecution himself having
expressed doubts as to the propriety of applying it in such a case as this. The
ratio of the Court of Appeal on the point that is of concern in Spataro’s
present appeal was that the conduct of the judge had made it impossible for
defending counsel to do justice to the defence; that the judge had attempted to
interfere with the independance of counsel in advising his client and, finally,
that counsel had been compelled to disclose what advice he had in fact given to
the accused with the consequence that the relation of confidence between
counsel and client had been destroyed. There is, in Spataro’s case, no
interference from the Bench with counsel in the performance of his duty to his
client.

The problem with which we are faced in this
appeal is very similar to the one in Vescio v. The King[4]. Counsel for the accused had represented

[Page 260]

him at a long preliminary hearing. When the
accused was arraigned, counsel moved to have the trial adjourned to the next
assize and said that he was contemplating a motion for a change of venue. The
trial judge refused the motion. Counsel then withdrew from the case and the
judge said that he would appoint someone if the accused did not appoint counsel
within a day or two. The trial judge did make this appointment and fixed a date
for the trial. On this date, another counsel appeared stating that he was
“appearing on behalf of the accused, retained by his family”. He was not heard.
It is clear from the record that his function was to ask for a further
adjournment. The trial proceeded with the assigned counsel acting for the
accused. The verdict of the jury was guilty.

The reasons delivered in this Court clearly show
that there was no good reason for delaying the trial. They approve of the
determination of the trial judge not to allow the judicial process to be
frustrated by the tactics of counsel to bring about a delay. They contain a
finding that when these tactics failed, there was a ratification of the counsel
chosen by the Court. Vescio’s case goes further than the present case,
where there was an attempt at delay which was recognized for what it was worth.
The trial then proceeded with the same counsel who had represented the accused
from the very beginning.

The evidence against the accused was
overwhelming. If it had been necessary to apply s. 592(1)  (b)(iii)
in order to decide this appeal, I would have done so.

I should mention that after the judgment of the
Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal had been entered, Kelly J.A., not knowing
that this had been done, delivered fresh reasons, holding that the learned
trial judge had made an error in

[Page 261]

law and that the case was not within the
proviso. The reasons that are before us on this appeal are those delivered from
the Bench orally at the conclusion of the hearing. The judgment of the Court of
Appeal was properly entered and I agree with the reasons given by Kelly J.A.
from the Bench.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5] pronounced on April 27, 1971, whereby that
Court dismissed the appeal of the accused from his conviction on April 15,
1970, at the General Sessions of the Peace in the County of York.

The accused had been convicted on five serious
charges connected with attempted arson and had been sentenced to a total
imprisonment of fourteen years in the penitentiary. Although there were various
grounds of appeal urged before the Court of Appeal for Ontario that Court
considered only one ground and the appeal to this Court is only in reference to
that one ground.

The trial commenced before W.M. Martin, Co.Ct.
J., on April 7, 1970, and continued through that day. On April 8, 1970, or so
soon as the Court opened, the following circumstances occurred and I quote from
the evidence:

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, I wonder if the
Jury may be just held for the moment.

THE COURT: Yes, surely, you want to see
your client? Do you want to see your client?

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, I wonder if I
might have some time?

THE COURT: Take whatever time you need. You
take whatever time you require. We will adjourn if Mr. MacKay wants to
consult with his client about some matter.

THE ACCUSED: I want a postponement.

[Page 262]

THE COURT: Oh, well, the case now is being
tried, Mr. Spataro. I mean, there will be no… (interrupted.)

THE ACCUSED: (Interrupting) Change of
lawyer.

THE COURT: I beg your pardon?
Mr. MacKay?

MR. MACKAY: Had we better adjourn for ten
minutes?

THE COURT: There is a lady in distress.

MR. MACKAY: Matron, would you assist that
lady, please.

THE COURT: Tell the Jury there has been a
short delay.

MR. MACKAY: Just before the Jury return I
wonder if Mr. Spataro might be… oh, I see… just one moment…

THE COURT: Yes, Mr. MacKay, you take
your time.

….(Mr. MacKay and accused off the
record.)

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, Mr. Spataro
instructs me that he wishes to discharge me. He is not prepared to accept my
advice on a matter.

THE COURT: Mr. Spataro?

MR. MACKAY: Under the circumstances I’d ask
Your Honour’s permission to withdraw from the matter. I don’t know if I am
following these… those rules that are set out.

THE COURT: I may say, so far as Spataro,
you have been acting for him all along and, Mr. Spataro, I don’t permit
the accused to discharge his counsel at the last minute and I don’t permit
counsel to withdraw and so the case will go on and Mr. MacKay will act for
you. This is my order.

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, for the sake of
the record I am not precise on what those new rules of the Law Society are.

THE COURT: So far as withdrawing it must be
done in such time as to notify the Crown Attorney’s office and all other
officials.

MR. MACKAY: For the sake of the record
might I… I think I should perhaps object to that.

THE COURT: Oh, that’s fine. Oh, yes, that
is perfectly all right, Mr. MacKay. It’s on the record.

The trial thereafter continued with
Mr. MacKay continuing to act as counsel for the accused and to
cross-examine witnesses and make submissions throughout the trial. At the

[Page 263]

close of the evidence for the Crown,
Mr. MacKay determined to adduce evidence and called the accused as the
only defence witness. Mr. MacKay addressed the jury on behalf of the
accused and after the accused was convicted made representations as to sentence
on his behalf.

Following the conviction and sentence, it would
appear from the legal aid file that the accused was advised by Mr. MacKay
that he had sufficient grounds for appeal and he therefore expected that
Mr. MacKay would take an appeal on his behalf. Upon discovering that
Mr. MacKay had not done so, the accused filed a notice of appeal on a
printed form without aid of counsel. In that notice of appeal, the only grounds
of appeal set out by the accused were these:

1. The conviction was against the evidence
and the weight of the evidence.

2. The Trial Judge failed to fairly and
adequately put to the jury, the defence of the appellant.

3. The sentence imposed was unduly
excessive and harsh.

Thereafter, the present counsel was retained,
applied for leave to withdraw the notice of appeal filed by the accused and for
an extension of time to file a new notice of appeal. On receiving such leave,
counsel proceeded to file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal dated
October 5, 1970, and again the ground of appeal dealt with in the Court of
Appeal and urged in this court was not mentioned.

Upon the appeal coming before the Court of
Appeal for argument, the other grounds set out in the notice of appeal filed by
counsel were urged in vain. The various members of the Court of Appeal then
considered whether the appeal by the accused should be allowed on the ground
that the learned trial judge had refused to permit the accused to discharge his
counsel during the course of the trial and had refused to permit the said
counsel to withdraw. All three members of the Court of Appeal were agreed that
if such was the effect of the learned trial

[Page 264]

judge’s ruling then it was a serious error in
law. Jessup J.A. said in an oral judgment given at the conclusion of the
argument:

I have no doubt that the learned trial
Judge seriously erred in law when he purported to direct counsel for the
accused that he could not withdraw from the case, notwithstanding the fact that
the accused, his client, apparently wished to discharge him.

And Kelly J.A. in his oral reasons given at the
close of the trial, concurring with Jessup J.A., said:

While I am in agreement with my brother
Jessup that it would have been a serious error for the trial Judge to have
refused to permit the accused to terminate the retainer of his counsel at
trial, as I read the transcript there was never an unequivocal discharge of
counsel by the accused.

Brooke J.A., again in an oral judgment at the
close of the trial, dissenting, based his judgment upon such error in law.

Despite his statement as to the error, Jessup
J.A. was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis of the
proviso contained in s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , now
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii). Kelly J.A. was of the
opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons which I have
already quoted, i.e., that the record did not demonstrate that the appellant
had unequivocally discharged his counsel.

On May 26, 1971, evidently in ignorance of the
fact that the formal judgment dismissing the appeal had been issued by the
Registrar on April 27, 1971, Kelly J.A. gave written reasons for judgment which
he commenced with the paragraph:

At the conclusion of the argument I
indicated that I was of the view that the appeal should be dismissed, giving
orally my reasons for that conclusion. In the interim, as a result of further
consideration, I have decided that, in dismissing the appeal, I was in error
and that, for the reasons that follow, the appeal against conviction should be
allowed.

Counsel for the Attorney General in this Court
urged as his first ground in the opposing of the appeal that the accused had
not

[Page 265]

unequivocally discharged his counsel, that is,
he adopted the position taken by Kelly J.A. in his oral reasons delivered at
the close of the argument. With respect, I am in agreement with the conclusion
expressed by Kelly J.A. in his written reasons, unfortunately delivered after
the formal judgment had been issued and which, therefore, were quite
ineffective, when he said:

While I was originally of the opinion that
the accused could be taken to have re-affirmed his earlier choice of
Mr. MacKay, on further consideration I find myself unable to say that, in
the absence of the mis-statement to him of the law, he would voluntarily have
elected to proceed with the trial represented by counsel whom he had expressed
the wish to discharge.

I have quoted above, the words of both the
accused and his counsel at the trial. It is true the words of the accused were
very brief, i.e., “Change of lawyer”, but the matter was put accurately by his
counsel when he said:

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, Mr. Spataro
instructs me that he wishes to discharge me. He is not prepared to accept my
advice on a matter.

Under such circumstances, there can be no doubt
that the intention of the appellant to discharge his counsel was made clear and
unequivocal on that occasion and the learned trial judge’s ruling which was as
clear and unequivocal:

…I don’t permit the accused to discharge
his counsel at the last minute and I don’t permit counsel to withdraw and so the
case will go on and Mr. MacKay will act for you. This is my order.

It is true that the trial proceeded in the
ordinary fashion with Mr. MacKay acting as counsel for the accused
throughout and doing so, as Jessup J.A. noted, with outstanding skill and ability.
However, there is little else that the appellant or Mr. MacKay, as his
counsel, could have done. For Mr. MacKay to have attempted to withdraw
after the judge’s ruling would have

[Page 266]

left him open to immediate proceedings for
contempt of court and counsel would have every reason to expect such a result
were he to attempt to withdraw. As for the appellant, he was a prisoner in the
box and the trial was proceeding. He was plainly told that he could not
discharge his counsel and that the counsel would continue to represent him and
the trial would proceed. I do not think it could have been expected of him that
he continue to interrupt the trial by raising objections to the learned trial
judge’s ruling.

It was also alleged by counsel for the Attorney General
that the subsequent procedures indicated that the accused had become reconciled
to his counsel Mr. MacKay and therefore must be taken in some fashion to
have withdrawn his discharge of such counsel and reaffirmed his retainer. As I
have pointed out, the accused himself gave evidence and it was said during
argument that his course in doing so was approved by the accused himself. Once
the continued services of Mr. MacKay had been forced upon the accused then
one would expect that Mr. MacKay would advise the accused and the accused
acting on his advice determined to give evidence in his own defence. I see, in
the accused’s giving evidence, no indication that he had recanted from his
previous decision to discharge his counsel but that his decision had simply
been overruled by the learned trial judge. Counsel for the appellant in this
Court made an affidavit, which was sworn on September 30, 1970 in support of an
application permitting late service and filing and setting down of the appeal
to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and paragraph 6 of that affidavit declared:

6. The information in the Legal Aid file
indicates that Mr. Spataro was advised by his trial counsel that he had
sufficient grounds for appeal. Mr. Spataro apparently expected that an
appeal would be taken but no appeal was taken…

Counsel for the Attorney General argued that the
circumstances that the appellant had accepted the services of Mr. MacKay
and had

[Page 267]

instructed him to proceed to an appeal to the
Court of Appeal confirms his submission that the appellant had never
unequivocally discharged Mr. MacKay. I cannot accede to such submission.
The question is whether the appellant had discharged Mr. MacKay during the
trial and not whether he had re-retained him to present the appeal and the
paragraph of the affidavit which I have quoted goes no further than to say that
Mr. MacKay had advised that there were sufficient grounds for appeal and
that the appellant presumed an appeal would be taken on his behalf. Even if one
could read into the paragraph a statement that Mr. MacKay had been
retained to conduct that appeal but had failed to do so, and Mr. MacKay’s
failure to file an appeal would indicate he did not so understand those
instructions, then it is more than possible that the appellant would consider
that the person best able to act for him on the appeal was the counsel who had
appeared at the trial and who would be familiar with the situation in reference
to the other grounds of appeal as he had been present when those grounds of appeal
arose during the trial despite the fact that he was present only on the order
of the learned trial judge and against the plain words of his client who had
sought to discharge him.

The evidence may be taken to indicate that the
reason that the accused sought to discharge his counsel was that he desired a
postponement of the trial although the evidence which I have quoted, and which
was the only evidence on the subject, merely leaves that to be conjecture and
it might well be that the accused had other serious disagreement with his
counsel. It is true that it was perfectly within the discretion of the learned
trial judge to refuse to permit any postponement of a trial which already had
gone a full day, for which the jury had already been chosen and sworn, and
where counsel had submitted and obtained rulings on two different applications.
The refusal to permit postponement, however, is one thing and is a decision
quite within the discretion of the learned trial judge, a discretion which will
not be interfered

[Page 268]

with at trial unless it was reached without
regard for proper principles. The refusal to permit any litigant to discharge
his counsel whether during the course of a proceeding in Court or on another
occasion is a very different matter. With respect, I agree with Brooke J. when
he said:

In any event, I think it is fundamental in
our law that the accused man has this right.

Keith J., in Regina v. Mulligan[6], put the matter succinctly when he said:

The case before me raises one of
considerable difficulty inasmuch as the courts over many cases and many years
have reiterated the right of an accused to be represented by counsel of his own
choice.

In Regina v. Barnes[7], Parker L.C.J. said at p. 107:

However, the matter does not rest there,
because in the result the appellant was forced to continue with counsel in whom
he had lost confidence, and counsel who himself felt that it was in the
appellant’s best interests that he should no longer continue to act. It is
clear that in those circumstances counsel would be gravely handicapped in
conducting the defence, especially before a judge who had expressed his strong
view as to the appellant’s guilt, and as to the waste of time involved in
fighting the case.

The latter elements have no application to the
present appeal.

For these reasons, I have come to the conclusion
that I agree with the unanimous views of the members of the Court of Appeal
that the refusal to permit an accused man to discharge his counsel was a
serious error in law and I agree with the view expressed by Brooke J.A. at the
close of the argument and Kelly J.A. in his later written reasons that there
can be no doubt this accused did attempt during the trial to discharge his
counsel and was prevented from doing so by the ruling of the learned trial
judge. I, therefore, am of the opinion that only one question remains, that is,
whether such a fault at trial may be corrected under the provisions of s.

[Page 269]

592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  as
it was then known.

In Regina v. Barnes, supra, the learned
Chief Justice Parker considered the application of a like section in the
United Kingdom statute, the Criminal Appeal Act of 1968. That provision
read:

Provided that the court may,
notwithstanding that they are of the opinion that the point raised in the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

And at p. 107-8 said:

Having said that, the Court has anxiously
considered whether to apply the proviso on the basis that it is difficult to
think that the result of the trial would have been any different had counsel
not suffered from these added difficulties. Very frankly, counsel for the
prosecution expressed doubts as to the propriety of applying the proviso in
such a case as this, and the Court shares his doubts. There are cases, of which
this is one, in which the principles involved are more important than the case
itself.

The appeal was quashed.

A detailed reference to the section in the Criminal
Code  is of considerable importance. By its words, it is limited in its
application to cases in which any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii)
of the same section might be applied in deciding in favour of the
appellant. Subparagraph (a)(ii) reads:

the judgment of the trial court should be
set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law,

In my view, the action of the learned trial
judge in this case was not a wrong decision on a question of law but was rather
an action within subparagraph (iii) of the same subsection (a),
i.e., “on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice”.

As was noted by Brooke J.A. in his oral reasons
for judgment, the course taken by the learned trial judge not only goes to the
accused’s right to make full answer and defence but also to the accused’s
fundamental right to the conduct of his own trial. A breach of the accused’s
right to make full answer and defence

[Page 270]

and of his fundamental right to the conduct of
his own trial is a miscarriage of justice and not a mere error in law, and
therefore s. 592(1) (b)(iii) cannot be applied because it is only
applicable to errors in law when no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred. Moreover even if the subsection could be
applied, I am unable to understand how an appellate court could say that no
substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. Had the accused been permitted
to act for himself, having discharged his counsel, or to have obtained the
services of some other counsel who would proceed with the trial immediately,
not requiring a postponement, no one could tell what the course of the trial
might have been. It might well have been that the accused without the aid of
Mr. MacKay’s advice or with the advice of some other counsel would have
determined that he should not give evidence in his own defence and subject
himself to a searching cross-examination and, therefore, the result of a trial
which would have been carried on in such a different fashion can only be
conjecture.

As I summarized the series of cases in this
Court upon that section in Colpitts v. The Queen[8] I adopted the test:

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

I am of the opinion that the Crown cannot
discharge that onus when we are called upon to conjecture the course of a trial
if the accused had represented himself, as he was entitled to do, or had
obtained other counsel to replace the counsel he had discharged.

I, therefore, would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and direct a new trial.

[Page 271]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—I agree with my
brother Spence, both as to his analysis of the facts, arising under the portion
of the transcript reproduced in his reasons and in those of my brother Judson,
and as to the application of the “harmless error” proviso of the then s.592(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code . There are two points that I wish to take, more by
way of emphasis than by addition to what has been set out in the reasons of my
brothers Spence and Judson.

First, it is not doubted that we are entitled to
look at the second set of reasons delivered by Kelly J.A. in the Ontario Court
of Appeal when they were before us as part of the record on appeal. Of course,
the order in appeal was not affected by them; but in my consideration of
whether that order was a proper one in this case, I find the second set of
reasons delivered by Kelly J.A. more compelling than the first. It is
shibboleth only that an appeal is from the order and not from the reasons; the
latter, where they exist, illumine the order. Kelly J.A. is not alone in having
second thoughts about a matter in appeal; they are endemic in the judicial
office. Although it is rare to have them available (along with the first
thoughts) in the same case, an illustration is provided by the reasons of
Kerwin J. in Boucher v. The King[9] where,
upon application of the accused, a rehearing took place and that judge modified
his previous position. The former Chief Justice of this Court exhibited this
kind of courage in Regina v. Drybones[10],
when he receded from a position that he took as Cartwright J. In Robertson
and Rosetanni v. The Queen[11].

The second point I take has to do with the
dilemma posed by an accused’s right to be represented by a counsel of his
choice and the effect on the orderly conduct of a trial if he

[Page 272]

exercises that right irresponsibly after his
trial has begun. In the present case, the trial judge either saw no such
dilemma or, if he did, made no attempt to explore the situation in order to
determine whether or how the dilemma could be resolved. In my opinion, it was
his duty to consider the request of the accused even if in the result the
accused might have to conduct his own defence. I do not suggest that an accused
has an absolute right to interrupt and delay a trial by a belated desire to be
represented by another counsel; but neither has a trial judge an absolute right
to force an accused to continue with his counsel irrespective of circumstances
that, if considered, would reasonably entitle him to discharge that counsel,
albeit at the risk of carrying on alone!

In my view, the trial judge dealt with the issue
in too peremptory a manner, and in consequence, erred in a material matter going
to the rights of an accused person.

Like my brother Spence, I would allow the
appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.

Appeal dismissed, SPENCE and LASKIN JJ. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Statements—Admissibility—Stolen goods—Recent
possession—Explanation in written statement made by co-accused two hours after
arrest—Crown not tendering statement but relying on doctrine of recent
possession—Co-accused not testifying—Statement properly excluded.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
quashing the respondent’s conviction for possession of stolen goods and
directing a new trial. The respondent was jointly charged with one Patrick
Benedict Graham and the facts of the present appeal appear in the Queen v.
Graham, ante page 206. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

J.H. Cram, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall
and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The respondent and Patrick Benedict
Graham were charged jointly with being in possession of a quantity of jewellery
of a value in excess of $50 knowing that it was obtained by the commission of
an indictable offence. Both accused were convicted at trial and the appeals by
the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia quashing
these convictions were heard successively in this Court, leave to appeal in
both cases having been granted on the following question:

[Page 234]

Did the learned Judges of the Court of
Appeal err in holding that a written statement of the Respondent Graham ought
to have been adduced in evidence in view of the circumstance that the Crown
relied on the presumption flowing from possession by the Respondent of goods
recently stolen?

It was contended on behalf of Miss McKenzie that
the written statement made by Graham was in all respects consistent with her
testimony and that if it had been tendered to the jury it would undoubtedly
have strengthened her evidence, so that she was unfairly prejudiced by the
non-admission of the statement before the jury. In the course of his reasons
for judgment in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Bull dealt with this
submission as follows:

But if Graham’s explanatory statement had
been before the jury, as it should have been, the jury might well have found
(because of the consistency of her sworn story with that statement made after
arrest by Graham ten months earlier, having regard to the testimony of the
Crown witness Mendelman) enough to conclude that her story might reasonably be
true. As it was, the jury merely had Mendelman’s evidence as to the authority
given to Graham, but substantially nothing from the latter (whether by
testimony or admissions) to indicate that he had acted on that authority. It
seems to me that Graham’s written statement which the jury did not have before
them, was, in the unusual circumstances of this case, almost as important to
the appellant McKenzie as it was to the appellant Graham.

For the reasons which I have given in the case
of Graham[2], I am
of opinion that his statement was properly excluded from the evidence at the
joint trial, but other grounds for quashing her conviction were raised on
behalf of the present respondent in the argument before us.

The initial submission made on behalf of the
respondent is that this Court did not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal
under s. 621(1)(b) of

[Page 235]

the Criminal Code  because the ruling as
to the inadmissibility of Graham’s statement did not involve a question of law
alone in that it was based on the particular circumstances in which it was
made.

As to this submission, it is to be observed that
the question of law upon which leave was granted in this case is concerned with
whether when the Crown is relying on the presumption of guilt arising from the
unexplained possession of stolen goods, it is required to adduce evidence of a
self-serving statement made by the accused more than two hours after the goods
were discovered, and whether such a statement can be introduced by cross‑examination
of the party to whom it was made.

Graham did not testity in this case but the
statement which he made, upon the goods being discovered in his possession, was
duly admitted and there is no dispute about the fact that he offered no further
explanation until making his written statement. It is thus clear that the
question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted does not involve any disputed
issue of fact.

It was also contended on behalf of this
respondent as it had been in the Court below, that even if it were found that
Graham’s statement was properly excluded, she was nevertheless entitled to
succeed in her appeal on the ground that the trial judge erred in commenting
adversely as to the credibility of that part of her evidence in which she
stated that she had learned about the whereabouts of the stolen jewellery from
a person who told her that the location of the jewellery in Vancouver had been
reported in the newspapers. The portion of the charge of the learned trial
judge to which objection was taken in this regard is the following comment
which he made concerning the respondent’s evidence:

In cross-examination she said that it was Friday
July 18th when she and Graham went downtown and this

[Page 236]

is ‘when I learned definitely that the
jewellery was in Vancouver and this was because of a Calgary newspaper
clipping.’ Well you may examine that with some care. It could be you may as a
result of your knowledge of life think it rather strange for a newspaper
clipping to be stating where stolen jewellery is. Generally speaking the police
are looking for stolen jewellery. It is not likely that any information coming
from the police would be given to the Calgary Herald or Calgary newspapers to
be published as to the location of stolen jewellery.

In the course of her evidence Miss McKenzie had
stated that she had been told by telephone of a newspaper article stating that
the police believed that the jewellery was on its way to Vancouver and it
appears that there was in fact an item published in the Calgary Herald three
days after the respondent arrived in Vancouver to the effect that the stolen
goods had “been shipped off to Vancouver for distribution through the black
market”.

In my opinion the statements made in the
last-quoted excerpt from the trial judge’s charge are directed exclusively to
the respondent’s evidence as to the source of her information that the goods
were in Vancouver and they are not calculated to reflect on any other part of
her evidence so that they do not affect the central question of her guilt or
innocence which depended entirely upon whether or not the jury accepted her
explanation of the fact that she was found to be in possession of goods which
she knew to have been recently stolen.

Miss McKenzie’s story was that the stolen goods
had been obtained by her from a man, who also knew them to have been stolen, on
the understanding that he would receive $1,000 of Mr. Mendelman’s money
when the goods were returned to Mendelman. The story of her girl friend, Linda
Petrus, who had accompanied her to Vancouver, was a very different one and was
to the effect that on the night of his arrival in Vancouver, Patrick Graham
sent the two young women out to the airport to pick up a suitcase which was
later found to contain the stolen

[Page 237]

goods, and further that Miss McKenzie had later
tried to sell the stolen jewellery in Vancouver but could get no offers because
it was “too hot”.

The portion of the charge to which objection is
now taken has no bearing on the wide divergence between these two stories.

All this evidence was before the jury and it
cannot, in my opinion, be suggested that they were not justified in bringing in
the guilty verdict which they did.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal
and restore the conviction entered at trial.

SPENCE J.—For the reasons which I have given in
the case of The Queen v. Patrick Benedict Graham[3] I am of the opinion that Graham’s statement
was properly excluded from his evidence at the joint trial. Therefore, this
respondent Jeanine McKenzie can have no basis for alleging that such statement
should have been available in aid of her defence.

I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice
Ritchie for refusal to accept the other grounds of appeal advanced by this
respondent in her appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia with which
that Court did not have to deal.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

LASKIN J.—For the reasons I have given in the
appeal of Patrick Benedict Graham[4], a co‑accused
of the appellant Jeanine McKenzie, with whom he was jointly tried, his written
statement of explanation was not admissible to aid her any more than it was
admissible to aid him. On the other matters urged before this Court, I am in
agreement with my brother Ritchie and would, accordingly, allow the appeal

[Page 238]

and restore the conviction.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Statements—Admissibility—Stolen goods—Recent
possession—Explanation in written statement made two hours after arrest—Crown
not tendering statement—Accused not testifying—Statement properly excluded.

The respondent was charged and tried jointly
with one McKenzie with having possession of a quantity of jewellry of a value
in excess of fifty dollars knowing that it was obtained by the commission of an
indictable offence. The evidence disclosed that the respondent and his co‑accused
were found together by the police in a hotel room where an attaché case
containing jewellry recently stolen was found behind a chesterfield. The key to
the attaché case was in the co-accused’s possession and when it was found, the
respondent at once said “I have never seen it before in my life”. The
respondent and his co-accused were both then arrested and as they were leaving
the hotel the respondent told the police officer that he wished to telephone a lawyer
and that he might then have something further to tell about the matter.
Approximately two hours later the same police officer received a message from
the respondent to the effect that he wanted to speak to him. Two police
officers came to the jail where the respondent, in their presence, wrote out a
statement. The substance of that statement was introduced in evidence before
the jury from other sources. In the cross‑examination of one of the
officers, he testified that a written statement had been made to him by the
respondent and that he had read it over, but upon being asked as to the
contents of the statement, Crown counsel objected to its admissibility. The
trial judge ruled that it was inadmissible. Both accused were found guilty by
the jury. The Court of appeal quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.
The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to
whether the written statement should have been adduced in evidence in view of
the circumstance that the Crown relied on the presumption flowing from
possession by the respondent of goods recently stolen.

[Page 207]

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ: The written statement was properly excluded. The
statement was inadmissible under the general rule that self-serving statements
cannot be introduced on the cross-examination of third parties because they
cannot themselves be tested by cross-examination of the accused person who made
them, and their introduction in such a manner deprives the jury of the benefit
of appraising his credibility from observing his demeanor. Explanatory
statements made by an accused upon his first being found in possession
constitute a part of the res gestae and are necessarily admissible in
any description of the circumstance under which the crime was committed.
However, the respondent did not “adduce further evidence by way of explanation”
and his written statement was not made contemporaneously with the discovery but
rather after ample time had elapsed for reflection.

Per Hall and
Laskin JJ: If the case is one where the accused has made a statement explaining
his recent possession, Crown counsel may have the statement go in as part of
the Crown’s case, thus avoiding any ruling on contemporaneity, or he may decide
not to put in the statement and seek to prove his case without the benefit of
any inference from the fact of recent possession. On the other hand, he may
decide not to put in the statement, intending to seek the benefit of the
inference arising upon proof of unexplained recent possession. But if he
proposes to follow this course, the defence must be informed that the statement
was made to enable it to decide whether to seek to adduce it on
cross-examination (subject to a ruling on contemporaneity), or to bring it in
during the examination of the accused (if he decides to testify) to show
consistency. The trial judge was not wrong in refusing to allow the statement
to be brought out in cross-examination having regard to the fact that the
accused made an immediate oral statement and then indicated he might have
something further to say after he saw his lawyer.

Per Spence J:
If the Crown is to rely on the presumption arising from recent possession then,

[Page 208]

under the particular circumstances here, it
was the duty of the Crown to prove the statement made only two hours after his
arrest by the accused and leave it to the jury to find whether that statement
could reasonably have been true. Otherwise, the accused is driven to give
testimony in his own defence. In this case, the Crown was not required to rely
upon any doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods in order to prove its
case and did not so rely. Therefore, the Crown was not required to produce any
explanation and the attempt to adduce such explanation in the cross-examination
of the constable was an attempt by the defence to prove a defence without the
production of evidence from the accused. The trial judge was therefore correct
in his ruling that the written statement could not be produced.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of appeal for British
Columbia[1],
quashing the respondent’s conviction for possession of stolen goods. Appeal
allowed.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, and
Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal by the Crown,
brought with leave of this Court pursuant to s. 621(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code , (formerly 598(1)(b)) from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia quashing the conviction of the respondent for possession of
stolen goods and directing a new trial.

The respondent was charged and tried jointly
with one Jeanine McKenzie with having possession of a quantity of jewellery of
a value in excess of $50 knowing that it was obtained by the commission of an
indictable offence, and upon trial before His Honour Judge Schultz sitting with
a jury, both were found guilty.

[Page 209]

The evidence disclosed that the respondent and
his co-accused, Miss McKenzie, were found together by the police in a hotel
room where an attaché case containing jewellery recently stolen from a shop in
Calgary was found behind a chesterfield. The key to the attaché case was in
Miss McKenzie’s possession and when it was found, the respondent at once said
“I have never seen it before in my life.” The respondent and Miss McKenzie were
both then arrested and as they were leaving the hotel the respondent told the
police officer that he wished to telephone a certain lawyer and that if he
could get in touch with him he might then have something further to tell about
the matter. The Officer replied that they were still conducting the
investigation and as soon as possible they would do what they could for him in
that regard. Approximately two hours later the same police officer received a
message from the respondent to the effect that he wanted to speak to him, and a
short time later two police officers came to the jail where the respondent, in
their presence, wrote out a statement which is reproduced in full in the
reasons for judgment of Bull J.A. in the Court of Appeal and which reads as
follows:

I have a friend in Calgary, Morris
Mendelman, who owns and operates Switzer’s Jewellers. His store was broken into
and some jewellery was stolen. He contacted me and asked me if I could ask
around and see if I could find it for him, as he was not covered by insurance.
He said to offer a reward of one thousand dollars for the return of the
jewellery. I found out through asking around, that the jewellery was possibly
in Vancouver. I had to come to Vancouver for other personal business anyhow.
While I was here I contacted Jean McKenzie who knew of someone who she called
Joe Fields or Shields that knew of some stolen jewellery. I told her I wanted
to do everything through a lawyer and didn’t want to see or touch or have
anything to do with any jewellery in any event that I might come in contact
with jewellery which was stolen, other than the articles which belonged to
Mr. Mendelman. I was going to contact Mr. Nick Mussallem (I believe
that’s a lawyer in the City of Vancouver) this morning, and make arrangements
to have the jewellery taken to his office, if after phoning Mr. Mendelman
in Calgary it proved to be his property, I would have arranged to have it sent
back to him. Miss McKenzie was acting as an agent in my

[Page 210]

behalf and I was acting as an agent for
Mr. Mendelman, the owner of the jewellery. If the jewellery and the sachel
was not the jewellery belonging to Mr. Mendelman, I state that neither of
us would have accepted it. We were only interested in Mr. Mendelman
getting back his merchandise and that’s all. Mr. Mendelman is a personal
friend of mine for many years and a member of the club I operate in Calgary. I
asked for a lawyer when the jewellery was discovered in the hotel and we were
charged and offered to make up a statement at that time. I still—and offered to
make this statement at that time. I still have not seen a lawyer, but am making
a voluntary statement now. The first time I have seen the officers since my
arrest. I had no knowledge that Jean McKenzie had the merchandise in the hotel
room while I was there, and if it is not the merchandise belonging to
Mr. Mendelman I would not have anything to do with it. When the Police
found the sachel Miss McKenzie said that I did not know it was in the room. It
was not my room, I stayed there with McKenzie for the night. This is a
voluntary statement.

Mr. Mendelman, who gave evidence for the
Crown, testified that he had indeed asked the respondent to try and get the
jewellery back because he had no insurance and that he had also offered him
$1,000 if he could return it and Graham’s statement is also borne out by the
evidence given at the trial by his co-accused. It is thus clear that the
substance of Graham’s statement was introduced in evidence before the jury from
other sources, but it is obvious that they did not place any faith in it as a
defence to the crime with which he was charged.

The first reference to this statement was in the
cross-examination of Detective Lifton when he testified that a written
statement had been made to him by the respondent and that he had read it over,
but upon being asked as to the contents of the statement, Crown counsel
objected to its admissibility and the learned trial judge ruled that it was
inadmissible.

[Page 211]

The Court of Appeal found the circumstances of
the present case to be governed by the case of Reg. v. Hodd[2] and therefore held that the learned
trial judge was in error in ruling that the written statement made by the
respondent more than two hours after he had been found in possession of the
stolen property was inadmissible. It is this determination by the Court of
Appeal which is the subject of the sole question upon which leave to appeal was
granted to this Court, namely:

Did the learned Judges of the Court of
Appeal err in holding that a written statement of the Respondent Graham ought
to have been adduced in evidence in view of the circumstance that the Crown
relied on the presumption flowing from possession by the Respondent of goods
recently stolen?

In the present case the respondent did not give
evidence and generally speaking, self-serving statements of accused persons
cannot be introduced by means of cross-examination of others, but in accepting Reg.
v. Hodd as a binding authority, the Court of Appeal adopted the view that
in a case where the Crown relies on the presumption of guilt flowing from the
possession of recently stolen goods, it is fixed with the burden of proving
either that the accused made no explanation or if he did that it was one that
could not reasonably be true. It accordingly becomes necessary to examine the
nature and effect of the presumption referred to.

The presumption flowing from the possession of goods
recently stolen has been considered in this Court in Richler v. The King[3], Ungaro v. The King[4], and Graham v. The Queen[5], per Judson J. at 653, all of which
appear to approve the principle as it was stated by Lord Reading speaking on
behalf of five members of the

 [Page 212]

Court of Criminal Appeal in England in the Schama
case[6], where
he said:

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the
jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether
the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the
explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced that it is
true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not
discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury
beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner’s guilt. That onus never
changes, it always rests on the prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not
pronouncing new law, but is merely re-stating it, and it is hoped that this
re-statement may be of assistance to those who preside at the trial of such
cases.

In commenting on the Schama case, which
is also reported in 79 J.P. Rep. at page 184 and 59 Solicitors’ Journal at 288,
Lord Goddard C.J. stated the rule in the following terms in Rex v. Booth[7]:

In the case of receiving stolen goods, the
prosecution may discharge the onus of showing that the prisoner was in
possession of property recently stolen, and, in the absence of any explanation
given by the prisoner, the jury are entitled, on that evidence alone, to
convict. If, however, the prisoner gives in evidence a story which leaves the
jury in doubt, that is to say, creates a doubt in their minds whether he
received the goods feloniously, they should acquit.

In the Ungaro case, supra, after
reviewing the earlier cases, Mr. Justice Estey concluded, at page 436 that
when these authorities refer to the failure of the accused to explain recent
possession

… they mean no more than that the evidence
of recent possession unexplained raises a prima facie case upon which,
if the accused does not adduce

[Page 213]

further evidence by way of explanation, the
jury may, not must, find the accused guilty.

There is nothing in any of these authorities to
suggest that in relying upon the presumption of guilt flowing from possession
of recently stolen goods, the Crown has the burden of proving that no
explanation has been given by the accused at any time prior to his trial, or
that if such an explanation has been given, it could not reasonably be true. On
the contrary, in all the cases to which I have referred, except the case of
Hodd, the accused had given an explanation on oath at the trial, and this was
also true of the case of Rex v. Hagen, alias Smith[8], to which reference was made in the Hodd
case.

In cases such as that of Schama where the
accused has given an unsworn explanation before the trial and a later
explanation from the witness box in the presence of the jury, I think, with all
respect for those who take a different view, that when the Court of Appeal
refers to the result “if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be
true” they are to be taken to be referring to the sworn explanation which the
jury has heard and seen delivered in the court rather than any unsworn
statement made before the trial.

There may, of course, be cases in which the
prosecution elects to use a declaration made by an accused out of court as a
part of the Crown case and the declaration then becomes evidence for the
prisoner as well as against him (see The King v. Hughes[9]). If in such a case the declaration
is capable of being construed as an explanation which might reasonably be true,
the accused is, of course, entitled to all the advantages of it.

In the present case the respondent’s verbal
statement made when the attaché case was found, that he had never seen it
before in his life, being one which was immediately connect-

[Page 214]

ed with the initial discovery of the stolen
goods, was properly admitted in evidence. Explanatory statements made by an
accused upon his first being found “in possession” constitute a part of the res
gestae and are necessarily admissible in any description of the
circumstances under which the crime was committed, but Graham did not “adduce
further evidence by way of explanation” and his written statement was not made
contemporaneously with the discovery but rather after ample time had elapsed
for reflection. In my view if this statement were to be admitted it would mean
that any person accused of receiving stolen goods could, after due
consideration, devise an explanation which might easily be true for the goods
having been found in his possession and could thus avoid the necessity of
presenting himself as a witness and be afforded the full benefit of his
explanation without being subjected to cross-examination. Such an explanation
is, in my view, inadmissible under the general rule in criminal cases that
self-serving statements made by an accused cannot be introduced on the
cross-examination of third parties because they cannot themselves be tested by
cross‑examination of the accused person who made them, and their
introduction in such manner deprives the jury of the benefit of appraising his
credibility from observing his demeanour.

Unlike the Court of Appeal, we are not bound by
the decision in Reg. v. Hodd, supra, and I have concluded that the
Judges of the Court of Appeal were wrong in holding that the written statement
made by Graham ought to have been adduced in evidence.

I would accordingly allow this appeal and
restore the conviction entered at trial.

The judgment of Hall and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Spence for allowing this appeal and for
restoring the conviction at trial. Although I agree with

[Page 215]

the result they have reached under their
respective treatments of the issues, my appreciation of the so-called doctrine
of recent possession impels me to write separately in concurrence.

The use of the term “presumption”, which has
been associated with the doctrine, is too broad, and the word which properly
ought to be substituted is “inference”. In brief, where unexplained recent
possession and that the goods were stolen are established by the Crown in a
prosecution for possessing stolen goods, it is proper to instruct the jury or,
if none, it is proper for the trial judge to proceed on the footing that an
inference of guilty knowledge, upon which, failing other evidence to the
contrary, a conviction can rest, may (but, not must) be drawn against the
accused.

Although unexplained recent possession will
support such an inference, two separate questions of law may first have to be
disposed of by the trial judge in favour of the prosecution. These involve (1)
the recency of the possession and (2) the contemporaneity of the explanation,
if any. No adverse inference can be made from the fact that an accused is found
in possession without explanation unless the possession was recent, and this
may involve a question of law for the presiding judge according to whether
there is any evidence upon which a finding thereon can be made. Second, if the
accused has made a pre-trial statement in explanation of his recent possession,
it is for the trial judge to decide as a question of law whether that statement
has contemporaneity; and if so, no adverse inference of guilty knowledge is
open if the trier of fact, upon instruction to that effect, should find that
the explanation is one that may reasonably be true.

[Page 216]

The second question of law may arise at the
point where a Crown witness is cross-examined and it is sought to ask him about
any explanation made by the accused which that witness or another did not
disclose in chief. If the trial judge rules that the statement in explanation
was sufficiently contemporaneous, it becomes admissible, and will blunt any
inference of guilty knowledge if it is found as a fact that the explanation was
one that might reasonably be true. No conviction can in such a case be rested
on the doctrine of recent possession alone. If the ruling is against
admissiblity, because the explanation was made beyond the time when it would be
reasonable to expect the person found in possession to give an innocent account
for it, the Crown may rely on the inference, provided the recency of the
possession is established.

The accused may, of course, give evidence at his
trial, and if an explanation of his recent possession is part of his testimony,
it simply goes into the record as part of his defence referable to the burden
on the Crown to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If he had made a
pre-trial explanation, it may be brought out in his examination but only to
show the consistency of his trial evidence, and for no other purpose.

The course of Crown counsel in this branch of
the law is, in my opinion, clear if the case is one where the accused has made
a statement explaining his recent possession. He may have the statement go in
as part of the Crown’s case, thus avoiding any ruling on what I have called
contemporaneity; and any inference of guilty knowledge from the fact of recent
possession will then depend, other evidence aside, on whether the jury or other
trier of fact finds that the statement is one that could not reasonably be
true. He may decide not to put in the statement and seek to prove his case
without the benefit of any inference from the fact of recent possession, so
informing the trial judge. On the

[Page 217]

other hand, he may decide not to put in the
statement, intending to seek the benefit of the inference arising upon proof of
unexplained recent possession, because of his view that the statement would be
inadmissible; but I think that if he proposes to follow this course, the
defence, if not aware of the statement, must be informed that it was made to
enable it to decide whether to seek to adduce it on cross-examination (subject
to a ruling on contemporaneity), or to bring it in during the examination of
the accused (if he decides to testify) to show consistency: see Welstead v.
Brown[10]. If
the accused testifies, the Crown may cross-examine on any pre-trial statement
of explanation to show inconsistency as going to the credibility of the
accused.

Perhaps only a moral dilemma arises where Crown
counsel deliberately refuses to put in an explanatory statement of the accused
which was clearly contemporaneous with his being found in recent possession. I
would myself give Crown counsel the benefit of the doubt on its contemporaneity
and consequent admissibility, so long as there was the protective obligation to
bring it to the attention of the defence to enable counsel for the accused to
deal with it in cross-examination or otherwise, as already indicated. I would
to this extent qualify what was said in Regina v. Hodd[11], with which I otherwise agree.

The inference of guilty knowledge which may be
made upon proof of unexplained recent possession ought not to be magnified as
some

[Page 218]

uniquity which necessarily stands out above all
other evidence in the case. The misuse, in my opinion, of the term
“presumption” in this connection may lead to injustice because of its strong
connotation. Cross-examination of Crown witnesses and examination in chief of
defence witnesses may yield testimony that, if believed, supports a contrary
inference, and the Crown’s burden of proof remains, as always, the resolutive
element.

What is important in this area of the law is to
distinguish between an out-of-court statement of explanation given by the
accused and an explanation which he gives as a witness at his trial. There is
no basis for reliance by the Crown upon the inference of guilty knowledge if
either in its own case in chief or in cross-examination of its witnesses an
out-of-court statement of the accused has been put into the record and it
carries an explanation of his recent possession which may reasonably be true.
This is not then a question of imposing any burden upon the Crown to show at
the trial that no explanation was given prior to trial. If the explanation has
been adduced as aforesaid, being found to be admissible, then, of course, the
issue whether it may reasonably be true must arise and be decided against the
accused if the Crown is to have the support of the inference of guilty
knowledge in meeting its traditional burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
This is what this Court said in Richler v. The King[12].

I do not find it necessary to review all the
facts; they are canvassed in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Spence. My
observations on them will be limited to what occurred at the trial with respect
to the pre-trial statements, one oral and the second written, made by the

[Page 219]

accused. The oral statement made almost
immediately by the accused when he was arrested with his co-accused, after the
stolen jewellery was found in the hotel room that they occupied, was admitted
through a Crown witness, but it was not contended that it provided any
explanation of their possession. The written statement, made by the accused
some two hours later at the police station, and which is at the core of this
appeal, was put in evidence at the preliminary hearing, but Crown counsel
decided not to use it at the trial and so advised defence counsel at the
beginning of the trial.

The latter sought to cross-examine the Crown
witness, a police officer, to whom the accused gave the statement in order to
establish that a statement in writing was given and to have its contents
revealed. Before ruling on its admissibility the trial judge asked Crown
counsel whether the prosecution intended to rely upon the doctrine of recent
possession. The reply was in the affirmative. There was then an adjournment to
give counsel for the Crown and for the accused an opportunity to look into the
law. When the hearing resumed Crown counsel returned to the question put by the
trial judge and, as I read the record, sought to have the best of both worlds.
On the one hand, he said that if the evidence was in the record to support the
doctrine it was not for him to tell the jury not to pay any attention to it;
“we can say it’s a minor part of the case”. On the other hand, he told the
trial judge that there was evidence of guilty knowledge in this case and “so
the Crown doesn’t have to rely on [the doctrine of recent possession] but it’s
simply there”.

What is important for me in this matter is that
the trial judge heard argument and then ruled

[Page 220]

that the contents of the written statement could
not be brought out by the defence in cross‑examination. In charging the
jury he told them that the Crown was relying on the doctrine of recent
possession, and no objection was made to this feature of the charge by either
the Crown or the defence. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia treated the
issue of the admissibility of the written statement as governed by the Hodd case.
On my view, as I have put it in these reasons, the issue on the facts herein
was whether the trial judge’s refusal to allow the statement to be brought out
in cross-examination was a proper one.

In the Hodd case, the statement was made
“at the earliest possible moment to the arresting officer”. That is not this
case. Although the matter is a close one, I cannot say that the trial judge was
wrong in the view that he took, having regard to the fact that the accused made
an immediate oral statement and then indicated he might have something further
to say after he saw his lawyer. It follows that since there was no error in the
way the trial judge dealt with the written statement offered by the accused,
and no other fatal defects occurred, the judgment of the British Columbia Court
of Appeal must be set aside and the conviction restored.

SPENCE J.—I have read the reasons for judgment
delivered upon this appeal by my brother Ritchie and I am ready to accept the
statement of facts as set out therein with some additional facts to which I
shall refer later in these reasons.

As did my brother Ritchie, I have come to the
conclusion that the appeal must be allowed and the conviction entered at trial
must be restored. However, I have come to that conclusion upon reasons which
differ markedly from those of my brother Ritchie and I feel it my duty to
outline those reasons. It will be seen that the whole issue in this appeal is
the application of the

[Page 221]

doctrine of recent possession to the charge of
being in possession of stolen goods and particularly whether the Crown is
required to prove as part of its case the explanation for the fact of
possession given by the accused man at the time of his arrest or shortly
thereafter. It is not my intention to be concerned with cases where such
explanation was given a very long time after the arrest of the accused person
and where quite evidently he had an opportunity to concoct a story.

I note here two matters: Firstly, the statement
given by the accused Graham in the particular case was given not later than at
1:15 p.m. following his arrest at about 11:00 a.m., a matter of some two hours
after his arrest, and, at the time of his arrest, he had indicated that if he
had an opportunity to see a certain solicitor then he would be ready to make a
statement. Secondly, the accused, of course, may give evidence at trial and at
trial give any explanation he deems fit as to his reasons for possession of the
stolen goods. That explanation given at trial, although given when there is
full opportunity to cross-examine the accused, is nevertheless given at a time
long after his arrest and when he has had opportunity to concoct a story and
when he has had an opportunity to obtain the aid of others in such concoction.

It is my view the problem must be solved by
considering exactly what is the doctrine of recent possession. As did my
brother Ritchie, I turn to the authoritative statement made by Lord Reading in Schama’s
case[13], where
he said at p. 49:

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the
jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence
whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury

[Page 222]

think that the explanation may reasonably
be true, though they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled
to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof
imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the
prisoner’s guilt. That onus never changes, it always rests on the
prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not pronouncing new law, but is
merely restating it, and it is hoped that this re-statement may be of
assistance to those who preside at the trial of such cases.

(The italics are my own.)

That statement was adopted by Chief Justice Duff
for this Court in Richler v. The King[14]
and by Estey J. in Ungaro v. The King[15].

It is my view that Lord Reading in Schama, in
the portion which I have quoted above, put the presumption as being one which
arose on the absence of any reasonable explanation by the accused. There is not
one word in the reasons for judgment to indicate whether or not Schama gave
evidence in his own defence and very plainly the explanation to which Reading
L.C.J. referred was an explanation given to the police upon his arrest. In Richler,
it does not appear from the reasons for judgment whether the accused did or
did not give evidence in his own defence. The report of the Schama case
in vol. 79, J.P. Rep., at p. 184, does set out that the accused gave an
explanation both on arrest and in evidence at trial and a search of the records
in this court reveals that Richler gave evidence in his own defence. I find
considerable significance in the fact that although both accused gave evidence
in their own defence at their trials neither Lord Reading in the Schama case
nor Chief Justice Duff in the Richler case thought it was necessary to
so indicate and spoke only of “explanations” and not of evidence. In Ungaro,
although the accused did give evidence, there was deduced from the police
constable the statement given by the accused to

[Page 223]

the police constable at or shortly after the
time of his arrest.

Again, in Rex v. Booth[16], although Lord Goddard did use the
words, “If, however, the prisoner gives in evidence a story which leaves the
jury in doubt …”, the actual statement which the court quoted was a statement
made by the accused at the time of his arrest when he was asked to account for
possession of the stolen goods. In Lopatinsky v. The King[17], Estey J. said at p. 225:

Throughout the evidence of both Taylor and
Congdon there is no suggestion that any explanation was offered on the part of
the accused as to the circumstances under which he was in possession of these
tires which had been stolen but two or three days prior thereto.

The evidence of guilty knowledge in this as
in so many cases is not directly deposed to. The unexplained fact of recent
possession is evidence thereof.

Rex v. Schama, supra.

Taylor had been an R.C.A.F. investigator and
Congdon was the person in whose possession the goods were found.

In Rex v. Hagan, alias Smith[18], Rowlatt J., speaking for the
court, said at pp. 26-7:

… The prisoner’s explanation in such cases
is required not to rebut a presumption of guilt, but to prevent one arising. If
it is thought reasonable, there is no presumption and no onus on the
prisoner. The result is that the conviction is unsatisfactory, and the appeal
must be allowed.

The matter came to a head in Regina v. Hodd[19]. That was a charge of breaking and
entering and having in possession a certain coloured television set knowing
that it had been

[Page 224]

obtained by the commission in Canada of the
crime of theft. At the trial, the accused Hodd did not give evidence and the
Crown refused to put before the jury the explanation which he had given in
writing at the time of his arrest. Branca J.A., after having quoted from the Hagan
case, as I have quoted above, said:

Here, an account was given by the appellant
in relation to the stolen goods which the Crown alleged were in his possession.
At law, therefore, the presumption could not arise if the explanation was one
that might reasonably be true.

Continuing, Branca J.A. said:

In a case such as this the Crown may, it
appears to me, pursue either one of these courses as follows:

(a) lead evidence to prove that the appellant
was in possession of goods recently stolen and if there was no explanation
accounting for his possession, rely upon the presumption which arises because
of the lack of an account explaining his possession, or

(b) if there is an account given by the defendant
then the Crown may conceivably withhold the tendering of that evidence and
elect to prove each and every allegation of the charge beyond a reasonable
doubt without the aid of the presumption discussed, or

(c) lead evidence of all the facts, including
the account given by the accused, and thus leave it up to the jury to decide
the guilt or innocence of the person charged depending upon whether or not the
account given is one which might reasonably be true, despite the fact that the
jury is not convinced that it is true.

In my judgment the Crown cannot, where it
has knowledge that an accused has accounted for his possession of stolen goods,
refuse to tender the explanation given by the accused in evidence and then ask
the jury to assess the guilt of the accused upon the basis that the presumption
applies. That would not only be unfair, but would be against all fundamental
precepts of justice and contrary to the foundation upon which the presumption
of guilt rests, namely, that the accused has given no explanation or an
explanation which is not reasonably true.

[Page 225]

I concur with this statement of the law
applicable to the doctrine. The whole basis of the doctrine is that the guilt
of the accused may be presumed upon proof of (a) the fact that the goods were
stolen, (b) that the accused was found in possession of them shortly
thereafter, (c) that the accused did not give an explanation of his possession
or that if he did give it that explanation could not reasonably be true. With
respect, I concur with the view expressed by Bull J.A. in the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia in the present case when he said:

To my mind, it invokes strange reasoning to
say that it is proper for the prosecution to rely on presumptions arising from
the “unexplained possession” of recently stolen goods under the doctrine to fix
guilt on an accused, but at the same time refuse to give into evidence the very
explanation for that possession which had been given.

One case may be of some interest and, in my
view, supports my understanding of the effect of the presumption, that is R.
v. Frederick Barnes[20]. There,
the accused Barnes had been charged with being in possession of two different
kinds of stolen goods, one, a large quantity of tinned rhubarb and, two, an
electric drill. The evidence as to the possession of the stolen tins of rhubarb
was first dealt with and there it was proved as part of the Crown’s case that
the accused had made a statement with regard to those tins. At the close of the
case for the prosecution, the deputy chairman had ruled that there was not
sufficient identification of those tins to justify the case proceeding any
further and directed the jury, as a matter of law, to acquit the accused which
they did. Evidently then, the charge as to the possession of the stolen
electric drill was proceeded with and a police constable first gave evidence as
to finding that drill in the accused’s own workshop and that he had said, “A
mate of mine asked me to look after it for him”. As Humphreys J. described it,
much later in the case, it appeared that the appellant had made another
statement after he had been taken to the police station and charged and then
said, “I will tell you the name

[Page 226]

of the mate; it is a man named Clifford. That is
the man I got it from”. It does not appear from the case that the appellant,
the accused, ever gave evidence but Humphreys J., giving the judgment of the
Court, said at p. 147:

All that any man can do if, unfortunately
for himself, he is found, three months after it has been stolen, in possession
of some article, is to say where he got it, and if his story is consistent with
innocence, and is not proved to be untrue, he is entitled to be acquitted. If,
therefore, Clifford had not been called as a witness, it is quite plain that
the jury would have had to be told: “You cannot convict the prisoner; he says
he got it from a man named Clifford, and there is not a shred of evidence to
show that is not true, and if he got it from Clifford, why should not he think
he got it honestly?”

In short, there, the accused’s explanation made
not at the time of the arrest but subsequently in the police station, as in the
present case, was given to the jury as part of the Crown’s case and had the
case stopped there it was the opinion of Humphreys J. that the jury would have
had to have been instructed that they must acquit because the accused’s
explanation could reasonably have been true.

So in the present case, if the Crown is to rely
on the presumption arising from recent possession then I am of the opinion that
under the particular circumstances here it was the duty of the Crown to prove
the statement made only two hours after his arrest by the accused man and leave
it to the jury to find whether that statement could reasonably have been true.
Instead, the Crown chose to exclude the statement and was successful in doing
so before the learned trial judge. Under such circumstances, I am of the
opinion that the presumption due to recent possession did not arise.

I am strengthened in my opinion that if the
Crown is to rely upon the presumption arising from recent possession then it
must as part of

[Page 227]

its case either prove that there was no
explanation given by the accused or give that explanation so that the jury may
determine whether it could reasonably be true by consideration of the effect of
an opposite conclusion. If the Crown may rely upon the presumption by proving
simply the theft and the recent possession by the accused and leave to the
accused the task of giving in evidence himself the explanation which he gave at
or shortly after the time of his arrest then it has the result that the accused
is driven to give testimony in his own defence. I find that result unpalatable
for two reasons: firstly, it is, in my opinion, contra to the firmly
established principle in the administration of criminal law that the accused
need prove nothing and that each essential ingredient of the offence must be
proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt; secondly, it submits the accused
to an examination upon his previous record not in reference to the particular
offence charged but generally ranging over the whole history of his conduct
prior to the circumstances which resulted in his arrest on the present charge.
This course may be adopted by the Crown upon the slim argument that the Crown
is entitled to examine the credibility of the accused. Jurors must be warned
that they are only to consider evidence so adduced upon the question of the
accused’s credibility but the effect is inevitably so prejudicial to the
accused person that counsel for the accused will but rarely adduce the evidence
of his client if that client has a record for previous criminal convictions.

In England, the problem was dealt with long ago
in s. 1(f) of the Criminal Evidence Act of 1898, which reads
as follows:

1. (f) A person charged and called
as a witness in pursuance of this Act shall not be asked, and if asked shall
not be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed
or been convicted of or been charged with any offence other than that wherewith
he is then charged, or is of bad character, unless—

(i) the proof that he has committed or been
convicted of such other offence is admissible evidence

[Page 228]

to show that he is guilty of the offence
wherewith he is then charged; or

(ii) he has personally or by his advocate
asked questions of the witnesses for the prosecution with a view to establish
his own good character, or has given evidence of his good character, or the
nature or conduct of the defence is such as to involve imputations on the
character of the prosecutor or the witnesses for the prosecution; or

(iii) he has given evidence against any
other person charged with the same offence.

Unless and until a statutory provision of like
import comes into effect in Canada it would seem that the number of instances
in which an accused person, despite the principle that the accused need prove
nothing, must go into the box to establish a defence should be minimized.

There remains, however, the problem of whether
the Crown was compelled to rely in the present case upon the presumption of
recent possession. It would seem that the best place to determine the course
which the Crown intended to pursue in its prosecution is by consideration of
the testimony of the constable who adduced the evidence upon which the jury
found the two accused, this accused, Graham, and his co-accused, McKenzie, were
in possession of the recently stolen goods. I have read carefully the
examination-in-chief of Detective Lifton, the police officer who gave the
evidence upon which the jury concluded that the two accused were in possession
of the stolen goods. No place in that examination-in-chief did the Crown
counsel make any reference to a statement which had been made at the time of
his arrest or on any other occasion by the accused Graham or infer in any way
that the accused either had or had not made any explanation. Counsel for the
accused McKenzie first cross-examined Detective Lifton and after several short
questions which are not relevant upon this issue asked that the jury be
excluded so that he might submit to the court the question of the admissibility
of other evidence which he hoped to adduce. Counsel for the accused Graham then
sought, in the absence of the jury, permission to obtain from Detective Lifton
evidence as to a statement made by the accused Graham in the

[Page 229]

police headquarters something about two hours
after the arrest. This statement purported to be a complete explanation of the
reason why McKenzie had in her possession the recently stolen goods. The
statement was produced upon the preliminary hearing and it is recited in full
in the reasons of my brother Ritchie so that I need not repeat it here. After a
very extended argument, the court ruled that Detective Lifton could give in
evidence a verbal statement made by the accused when Lifton found the attaché
case hidden behind the chesterfield in which he said, “I have never seen that
before in my life”, and a further statement made by the accused Graham when he
was being conducted from the lobby of the hotel to the Detective’s automobile
to be driven to the police headquarters and which statement was that “If we
could get in contact with Mr. Nick Mussallem he may have something further
to tell us”. The court, however, refused leave to counsel for the accused to
obtain from Detective Lifton the long written statement to which I have made
reference above, although the learned trial judge did permit counsel for the
accused McKenzie to obtain from Detective Lifton in his cross-examination of
the officer in the presence of the jury the evidence that the accused had given
a statement without revealing the contents thereof.

In my view, the learned trial judge perceived
the exact issue for during the argument as to the defence’s right to obtain
from the police constable the evidence as to the contents of this long written
statement the learned trial judge asked counsel for the accused, “May I ask you
this, does the prosecution rely upon the doctrine of recent possession of
stolen goods in this case?”. Although the Crown counsel answered that question,
after some discussion, in the affirmative, some short time later, the Crown
counsel said:

Your Honour asked me whether the Crown
relies upon the doctrine of recent possession with respect to these two accused
and, to clarify our position, I think I should put it this way—this is the
position I take although I have not researched this: whether recent possession
is a fact or not in a case is a matter of law and it is not possible for the Crown
to say we

[Page 230]

do or don’t rely on it. It is there as
evidence and it’s all very well for me to say to Your Honour or perhaps even
say to the jury, it’s not necessary for our case, yet, Your Honour, it is
there, and I submit that the Crown cannot take a piece of the case and say, now
to the jury, don’t pay any attention to that because the Crown is not relying
on it; we can say it’s a minor part of the case. Now, in this particular case,
as far as that goes, I submit that the doctrine of recent possession goes to
the question of knowledge and there is other evidence of knowledge that the
goods were stolen on the part of Graham and McKenzie in this case, and so the
Crown doesn’t have to rely on it but it’s simply there.

I have come to the conclusion that the Crown did
not intend to rely upon any doctrine of recent possession but the Crown was of
the view that it was adducing evidence to prove (a) the theft, (b)
possession by the accused of the recently stolen goods, and (c) that the
accused knew those goods had been obtained by the commission of an offence
within Canada, and that any reliance upon the doctrine of recent possession was
a mere make‑weight in the Crown’s case. It is perhaps significant that
the learned trial judge, in his charge to the jury, did not say that the Crown
did rely on the doctrine of recent possession but rather said

Now, the prosecution is entitled to invoke
what is called in law the doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods.

The learned trial judge said, later in his charge:

If you the jury do not believe the
explanation of the accused, Graham, then the presumption arising from recent
possession of stolen goods is not rebutted and the jury may, not must, convict
the accused, Graham.

It is to be noted, of course, that Graham did
not give evidence at the trial and any explanation of Graham’s as referred to
by the learned trial judge must have been taken from Mussallem’s evidence,
McKenzie’s evidence and from

[Page 231]

the address to the jury given by the accused
Graham who appeared without counsel and who, therefore, on his own behalf,
addressed the jury after the close of the evidence.

From my survey of the course of the trial, I
have come to the conclusion that the Crown, in the particular case, was not
required to rely upon any doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods in
order to prove its case and did not so rely. Under those circumstances,
therefore, the Crown, so far as it was able, excluded from the evidence any
statement or explanation given by the accused for his possession. The Crown did
not, therefore, attempt to adduce the fact of either no explanation or the fact
that the explanation although given could not reasonably be true in order to
establish the basis for the application of the doctrine of recent possession.
Under such circumstances, the attempt to adduce such explanation in the cross‑examination
of the constable was an attempt by the defence to prove a defence without the
production of evidence from the accused. In a case where the Crown does not rely
upon the presumption arising from the unexplained possession of recently stolen
goods, then the Crown is not required to produce any explanation and if there
is to be the production in defence of that explanation then it must be in
accordance with the ordinary rules of evidence. I am, therefore, of the opinion
that the trial judge was, under the particular circumstances in this case,
correct in his ruling that the explanation in this long written statement could
not be produced from the constable in cross-examination and that it had to be
subject to ordinary rules of evidence, that is, it had to be given in sworn
testimony and not in breach of the hearsay rule.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and restore
the verdict at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Appeal—Powers of Court of
Appeal—Aquittal set aside and conviction entered—Power to impose
sentence—Accused respondent not present in Court—Respondent not given
opportunity to make submissions in respect of sentence—Canadian Bill of Rights,
1960 (Can.), c. 44, ss. 1,2—Criminal Code , ss. 615(4) , 613(4) , 577(1) .

The appellants were aquitted at trial on
charges of unlawful assault upon four peace officers engaged in the execution
of their duty. The Court of Appeal convicted the appellants and, at the same
time, imposed upon each of them a sentence of six months imprisonment. The
sentence was imposed without the appellants being present and having an
opportunity to make submissions in respect of that matter. At the conclusion of
the argument of Counsel for the appellants, this Court ruled that there had
been no error made by the Court of Appeal in setting aside the acquittal of the
appellants. However, there remained the issue as to whether the Court of Appeal
was entitled to impose sentence in this case.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed on the merits and the case remitted to the Court of
Appeal to pass sentence after receiving submissions from the appellants.

The Criminal Code  does not require
that the accused must be present when sentence is passed by a Court of appeal
under s. 613(4) (b)(i). In the light of the history of s. 594
(4) , it cannot be concluded that the enactment of s. 594 (4)  in 1955,
enabling the Court of Appeal to impose sentence notwithstanding that the
appellant is not present, can be interpreted also as leading to the illogical
result that when sentence is imposed after a Crown appeal from an aquittal the
accused must be present.

[Page 196]

However, in the imposition of sentence under
s. 613 (4) , the Court of appeal must, by virtue of s. 2 (2) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, give the accused an opportunity to make, or to have made on
his behalf, any submission on this matter. A “fair hearing” of a criminal trial
includes the matter of sentence, and, accordingly, the power to pass sentence
is a power which can only be exercised after a fair hearing on that issue. This
Court has jurisdiction to deal with this matter. The case should therefore be
remitted to the Court of appeal to pass sentence, after the appellants have
been given the opportunity to make submissions to that Court on that matter.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba[1],
setting aside the acquittal of the appellants and imposing upon them a sentence.
Appeal dismissed on the merits and case remitted to Court of Appeal to pass a
new sentence.

R. Penner, Q.C., and R. Carbert, for the
appellants.

W. Morton, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellants appealed to this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, which allowed an
appeal by the respondent from the judgment at trial acquitting the appellants
on charges of unlawful assault upon four peace officers while engaged in the
lawful execution of their duty. The Court of Appeal convicted the appellants on
the said charges and, at the same time, imposed upon each of the appellants a
sentence of six months imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to be
concurrent. The appeal to this Court was made pursuant to s. 597 (2) (now
s. 618 (2)) of the Criminal Code , which gave them an appeal as of
right on a question of law.

At the conclusion of the argument of counsel for
the appellants, counsel for the respondent was advised that it was not necessary
for him to submit argument in respect of the decision of the Court of Appeal to
allow the respondent’s

[Page 197]

appeal from the acquittal of the appellants, as
this Court was unanimously of the opinion that there had been no error by the
Court of Appeal on a question of law.

There remains, however, the issue raised by the
appellants that the Court of Appeal was not entitled, upon convicting the
appellants, to impose sentence upon them without their being present and having
the opportunity to make submissions in respect of that matter.

In support of the contention that the Court of
Appeal could not impose sentence in the absence of the appellants, reference
was made to the provisions of s. 594 (4) (now s. 615 (4)  of the Criminal
Code , which provides that:

The power of a court of appeal to impose
sentence may be exercised notwithstanding that the appellant is not present.

It was submitted that the maxim “expressio
unius exclusio alterius” was applicable and that, as the present appellants
were not appellants before the Court of Appeal, but were respondents, the power
of that court to impose sentence could not be exercised unless they were
present.

I do not agre with this contention, in the light
of the history of this provision. Prior to 1923, the 1892 Criminal Code  provided
for the reservation of questions of law for the opinion of the court of appeal,
and for appeals to the court of appeal against a refusal to reserve such a
question. The Crown enjoyed the same rights as the accused in respect of these
matters. In 1923 these provisions were replaced by what was practically a
verbatim copy of the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c.
23), save that provision was made for a right of appeal against sentence, by
the Crown, and for directing a new trial when a conviction was quashed.

In s. 1012 (a) “appellant” was
defined as including a person who has been convicted on indictment and who
desires to appeal. Section 1021A (4) provided that:

The power of the court of appeal to pass
any sentence under section 1015 of this Act may be

[Page 198]

exercised notwithstanding that the
appellant is for any reason not present.

The result of the 1923 amendment was to take
away the previously existing right of appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, on
a question of law, apparently through inadvertence, since the provision for
appeals to this Court “by any person whose acquittal has been set aside” was
left intact.

The Crown’s right of appeal on a question of law
was restored in 1930 (20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28) by enacting new subs.
(4) and (5) in s. 1013, as follows:

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Act
contained, the Attorney General shall have the right to appeal to the court of
appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect
of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of
law alone.

(5) The procedure upon such an appeal and
the powers of the court of appeal, including the power to grant a new trial,
shall mutatis mutandis and so far as the same are applicable to appeals
upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed and the
powers given by sections one thousand and twelve to one thousand and
twenty-one of this Act, inclusive, and the Rules of Court passed thereto, and
to section five hundred and seventy-six of this Act.

In the 1955 Criminal Code  the 1923 and
1930 amendments were reproduced, without changes in substance. The definition
of “appellant” was omitted. The “mutatis mutandis” provision of
s. 1013 (5)  disappeared, appropriate changes being made in some other
sections. But s. 1021A (4) was reproduced as s. 594 (4) , previously
cited, leaving the word “appellant” unchanged. It would appear that, through
oversight, modification of this provision, required by the suppression of the “mutatis
muntandis” provision, was overlooked.

In the light of this history, I cannot conclude
that the enactment of s. 594 (4) in 1955, enabling the court of appeal to
impose sentence

[Page 199]

notwithstanding that the appellant is not
present, can be interpreted also as leading to the illogical result that when
sentence is imposed after a Crown appeal from an acquittal the accused must be
present.

The power of the court of appeal on such an
appeal is defined in s. 613 (4) , formerly s. 592 (4):

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal
the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the
verdict and

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

Referring to this subsection, Martin, in his
1955 Criminal Code , says: “Subsec. (4) is the former s. 1013 (5)  and
sets out what is there incorporated by reference.”

Where it is intended by the Criminal Code  that
the accused must be present, it specifically so provides. Section 577(1) 
(formerly s. 577 (1) ) states that, subject to subs. (2) (which covers the
case of interruption of proceedings by the accused, or permitting his absence)
“an accused other than a corporation shall be present in court during the whole
of his trial.”

In my opinion the Code does not require
that the accused must be present when sentence is passed by a court of appeal
under s. 613 (4)  (b) (i).

The next question which arises is as to the
power of the Court of Appeal to impose sentence without having given to the
appellants an opportunity to make, or to have made on their behalf, any
submission on this matter. We were advised by counsel for the appellants that
submissions on the matter of sentence had not been made before the Court of
Appeal, apart from his suggestion that, if the appeal were allowed, the matter
of sentence might be referred back to the magistrate. This course

[Page 200]

commended itself to Chief Justice Smith, but the
majority of the Court decided to impose sentence.

In R. v. Lunn[2], the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (in banco),
at p. 362, held that, in a case where the court had allowed an appeal from
an acquittal, the accused “should be given the right to be heard” before
sentence was imposed.

The subsequent enactment of the Bill of
Rights (S.C. 1960, c. 44 ) strengthens this view. Section 1  declares the
right of an individual not to be deprived of his liberty without due process of
law. Section 2  requires the law of Canada to be construed and applied so as not
to abridge or infringe on such right and, in particular, under para, (e)
so as not to “deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights
and obligations.”

The opinion has been expressed in the judgment
of the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in R. v. Russell[3], that s. 2(e) of the Bill of
Rights does not apply where the issue is guilt or innocence under the
criminal law. The same opinion was expressed by Jessup J.A. in the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Duke[4].
However, the other two members of the Court in that case preferred to express
no opinion on this point.

In my opinion, the application of s. 2 (e)
should not be restricted in this way. It is clear that paras, (a), (b),
(c), (d), (f) and (g) of s. 2 all have
application in criminal proceedings and, this being so, it is difficult to see
why Parliament should have intended to limit the application of one paragraph
out of this group of provisions to civil cases, particularly when it is
remembered that Parliament cannot legislate in

[Page 201]

the field of civil procedure in provincial
courts. The impact of para. (e), on the interpretation suggested,
would be limited, as indicated in the Russell case, to hearings before
federal administrative boards or tribunals exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions.

The various paragraphs in s. 2
particularize aspects of those human rights and fundamental freedoms defined in
s. 1. Paragraph (a) of s. 1 refers to the right to life,
liberty and security of the person, as well as to enjoyment of property and the
right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law. The right to a
fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the
determination of rights and obligations, provided for in s. 2 (e),
relates back to those rights guaranteed by s. 1. In my opinion it includes
the right to a fair hearing in criminal proceedings.

When s. 613 (4) of the Code is to be
construed, it must be done in a manner which does not abridge or infringe those
rights. In my opinion a fair hearing of a criminal trial includes the matter of
sentence, and, accordingly, the power to pass sentence is a power which can
only be exercised after a fair hearing on that issue. The appellants had the
right to be heard on that issue before sentence was passed.

Counsel for the respondent contended that this
Court was without jurisdiction to deal with this matter, in the light of the
judgment of this Court in Goldhar v. R.[5],
in that the issue involved was as to sentence. That case concerned an
application for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario on an appeal from sentence. The issue before the Court of Appeal was as
to whether the sentence imposed at trial was one which, in law, could legally
be imposed on conviction of the offence charged. Leave to appeal to this Court
was refused on the ground that this Court did not have jurisdiction to
entertain an appeal against a

[Page 202]

sentence imposed for the commission of an
indictable offence.

In the present case the appellants are before
the Court by virtue of their right of appeal under s. 618 (2) (a)
(formerly s. 597 (2) (a)), which provides as follows:

(2) A person

(a) who is acquitted of an
indictable offence other than

(i) an offence punishable by death, or

(ii) by reason of the special verdict of
not guilty on account of insanity, and whose acquittal is set aside by the
court of appeal,

may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
on a question of law.

This provision gives an appeal as of right to a
person whose acquittal at trial has been set aside by a court of appeal, on a
question of law. There has been no question of an appeal on sentence to the
Court of Appeal since there was no sentence passed at trial. The first
imposition of sentence was made by the Court of Appeal.

The basic issue presently under consideration
does not relate to the length of the sentence imposed, nor as to the power of
the Court of Appeal to impose a sentence of that length, but rather relates to
the right of the Court of Appeal to deal with the matter of sentence at all
without first having given to the appellants the opportunity to exercise their
right to be heard.

I am not prepared to interpret the Goldhar case
as authority for the proposition that this Court, in relation to an appeal
properly before it, has no power to interfere where a court of appeal has acted
improperly, under the Criminal Code , solely because the matter in issue
affected the imposition of sentence. This appeal is properly before the Court,
and, that being so, the Court is entitled to make any order which the Court of
Appeal might have made, or any order necessary to give effect to the judgment
of this Court (s. 623).

[Page 203]

In R. v. McKay[6], this Court dealt with a criminal appeal
from the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, with one judge dissenting, had set
aside a conviction on the ground that there was no evidence, implicating the
accused, to go to the jury. The appeal to this Court was allowed. The Court of
Appeal had not determined whether or not, if there were evidence, the verdict
should be set aside as unreasonable. If the Court of Appeal had set aside the
verdict on that ground, there could have been no appeal to this Court, that
question not being one of law. This Court held, however, that it had power to
restore the jury verdict, rather than to remit the case to the Court of Appeal
to consider that issue. This conclusion was reached on the basis that this
Court, once seized of the appeal, has complete authority to direct the remedy
which the court appealed from ought to have granted.

Reference was made in the majority judgment in
that case to the reasons of Sir Lyman Duff in the case of Manchuk v. R.[7]. In that case, the appellant had been
convicted of murder at a second trial, after a conviction of murder at the
first trial had been set aside by the court of appeal. His appeal to the court
of appeal after the second conviction failed, but his appeal to this Court
succeeded. This Court held that it had authority, instead of ordering a new
trial, to substitute a verdict of manslaughter, and also to impose a sentence
of life imprisonment.

The McKay case was followed recently in
this Court in the case of R. v. Borg[8].

[Page 204]

In the present case the Court is seized of the
appeal. An outright dismissal of the appeal would result in the maintenance of
the order of the Court of Appeal imposing sentence which, for the reasons
already given, I do not think it could properly make. In my opinion this Court
has jurisdiction to make an order appropriate to these circumstances.

It is then necessary to consider what is the
appropriate order to be made. Counsel for the appellants asks that the matter
of sentence be remitted to the magistrate, which was the course suggested by
Chief Justice Smith in the Court of Appeal. Counsel points out that such a
course was adopted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Ashcroft v. R.[9]. A similar procedure was followed by the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the case of Wild v. R.[10], which came to this Court[11], on another issue.

However, the imposition of sentence, under
s. 613 (4) , is a duty primarily placed on the court of appeal. In the
present case the majority of the Court of Appeal decided to pass sentence after
allowing the appeal from acquittal. I do not think it would be proper for this
Court to order that the matter of sentence be referred back to the magistrate.
In my opinion the case should be remitted to the Court of Appeal to pass
sentence, after the appellants have been given the opportunity to make
submissions to that Court on that matter.

In the result, I would dismiss this appeal on
the merits, but remit the case to the Court of Appeal to pass sentence, after
receiving any submissions which the appellants wish to make, or to have made on
their behalf, with respect to that matter.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Statutes—Juvenile
delinquents—Meaning of “child”—Proclamation of the Governor in Council pursuant
to Juvenile Delinquents Act—Whether ultra vires.

The respondent, being seventeen years of age,
was charged with theft over fifty dollars and unlawful possession of stolen
property. The Provincial judge held that he had no jurisdiction to deal with
the respondent on the ground that the latter was a juvenile. The judge accepted
the argument that the proclamation of the Governor in Council, dated October 6,
1970, seeking to fix the age of a juvenile in British Columbia as “any boy or
girl apparently or actually under the age of seventeen” and revoking a previous
proclamation, dated February 8, 1950, which had fixed the age as under
eighteen, was ultra vires the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 160. The Crown was granted a mandamus to compel the Provincial
judge to proceed with the trial. This order was set aside by the Court of
Appeal. The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the
judgment directing the writ of mandamus to issue restored.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ: The power of the Governor in Council to issue
the proclamation of 1970 is well defined by the Juvenile Delinquents Act. It
is to be found in s.2 (1) (a): the definition of “child” is twofold,
first, a boy or girl under the age of sixteen years, and second, such other age
as may be directed in any province pursuant to subsection (2). In making
the proclamation of 1970, the Governor in Council was acting within the limits
of s.2 (1) (a) of the Act. It follows that the proclamation was intra
vires. The lesser power to define “child” one under seventeen is to be
implied in the larger power to define “child” to mean one under eighteen.

[Page 186]

Per Hall,
Spence, and Laskin JJ, dissenting: The Governor in Council did not have
the power, by virtue of the provisions of s.2 (2) of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act, to pass the order in council of 1970. The section does not
provide an implied power to fix an age other than sixteen or eighteen. It
cannot be implied that it was the intention of Parliament to permit a
proliferation of the age of juvenile delinquents from province to province at
anything up to eighteen years of age.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
reversing a judgment granting a mandamus. Appeal allowed, Hall, Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

S.F. Sommerfeld, Q.C., for the Attorney
General of Canada.

S.D. Jolliff, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and
Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.—The respondent, Douglas Frederick
McEwen, was charged with theft over $50 and unlawful possession of stolen
property. When he came on for trial before Anderson Provincial Judge, his
counsel took the objection that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with him
on the ground that he was seventeen years of age and therefore a juvenile. This
argument was founded on the assertion that a proclamation of the Governor in
Council, dated 6 October, 1970, was ultra vires. This proclamation
sought to fix the age of a juvenile in British Columbia as “any boy or girl
apparently or actually under the age of seventeen.” A previous proclamation,
dated 8 February, 1950, had fixed the age as under eighteen. Anderson
Provincial Judge accepted this argument and declined jurisdiction. The next
step was an application for a Writ of Mandamus to compel the provincial judge
to proceed with the trial. Macfarlane J. granted this application. On

[Page 187]

Appeal1, the order of Macfarlane J.
was set aside and that of the provincial judge restored. The submission of the
Crown on this appeal is that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that
the Order-in-Council dated 6 October, 1970, was ultra vires.

The proclamation reads in part as follows:

And Whereas the Attorney-General of British
Columbia has requested that a proclamation be issued directing that in the
Province of British Columbia the expression “child” in the said Act means any
boy or girl apparently or actually under the age of seventeen years. Now Know
Ye that We, by and with the advice of our Privy Council for Canada, do by this
Our Proclamation (a) revoke the direction made with respect to the Province of
British Columbia by Our Proclamation dated the 8th day of February, 1950; and
(b) declare and direct that in the Province of British Columbia the expression
“child” in the Juvenile Delinquents Act means any boy or girl apparently or
actually under the age of seventeen years.

The appeal turns upon the interpretation of
s. 2 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, and on
the two proclamations of the Governor in Council already mentioned.

In s. 2 (1) (a) of the Act, “child”
is defined in the following terms:

“child” means any boy or girl apparently or
actually under the age of sixteen years, or such other age as may be directed
in any province pursuant to subsection (2);

Section 2(2) of the Act sets out the powers of
the Governor in Council with respect to direction of the age limits. It reads:

2. (2) The
Governor in Council may from time to time by proclamation

(a) direct that in any
province the expression “child” in this Act means any boy or girl apparently or
actually under the age of eighteen years, and any such proclamation may apply
either to boys only or to girls only or to both boys and girls, and

[Page 188]

(b) revoke any direction made with
respect to any province by a proclamation under this section, and thereupon the
expression “child” in this Act in that province means any boy or girl
apparently or actually under the age of sixteen years.

The operative part of the 1950 proclamation is
in the following terms:

Now Therefore Know Ye that by and with the
advice of our Privy Council for Canada we do hereby proclaim and direct that
for the purposes of the said Act in the said Province of British Columbia the
term “child” shall mean any boy or girl apparently or actually under the age of
eighteen years.

In my opinion, the power of the Governor in
Council to issue the proclamation of 1970 is well defined by the Act. It is to
be found in s. 2 (1) (a) above-quoted—the definition of “child” is
twofold, first, a boy or girl under the age of sixteen years, and second, such
other age as may be directed in any province pursuant to subs. (2).

What the Governor in Council did in the 1970
proclamation was to revoke the old designation of under eighteen and substitute
one of under seventeen. The judgment under appeal holds that he could not do
this, that by the section he was limited to making a designation of under
eighteen, which had already been done by the 1950 proclamation. It further held
that the revocation of the 1950 proclamation fell with the new designation and
that consequently, the designated age remained at under eighteen.

I do not think that the section limits the
power of the Governor in Council in this tight way. Even according to the
judgment under appeal, he could have revoked the designation of 1950 of under
eighteen. This would have left the age at under sixteen. These are the limits,
under eighteen and under sixteen. If the proclamation goes on to act within
these limits, as it did in this case, it is, in my opinion, intra vires. The
lesser power to define “child” one under

[Page 189]

seventeen is to be implied in the larger power
to define “child” to mean one under eighteen.

I am strengthened in this conclusion by
s. 3 (2) of the Act, which provides that a delinquent child “shall be
dealt with, not as an offender, but as one in a condition of delinquency and
therefore requiring help and guidance and proper supervision”, and also by the
observations of this Court in Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Smith[2] on the direction in s. 38 of
the Act, which is in the following terms:

38. This Act
shall be liberally construed in order that its purpose may be carried out,
namely, that the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent shall
approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by his parents, and
that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be treated, not as
criminal, but as a misdirected and misguided child, and one needing aid,
encouragement, help and assistance.

I would set aside the direction of the Court of
Appeal that the proclamation of 1970 is ultra vires, and restore the
judgment of Mr. Justice Macfarlane directing the Writ of Mandamus to
issue.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] pronounced on June 21, 1971. By that
judgment, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed an appeal from the
judgment of Mr. Justice Macfarlane pronounced on April 5, 1971, whereby he
had granted a mandamus directed to His Honour J.J. Anderson, the Judge of the
Provincial Court, directing the latter to proceed with the trial of an
information.

[Page 190]

I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons
for judgment herein prepared by my brother Judson and I therefore need not
repeat the facts which are outlined in those reasons. It will be seen that the
sole question for determination in this appeal is whether or not the Governor
in Council had power, by virtue of the provisions of s. 2 (2) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, now R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, to pass the
Order in Council dated October 6, 1970, and if the Governor in Council did not
have such power to pass that Order in Council what was the effect of such lack
thereof.

Robertson J.A., giving reasons for the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia, came to the conclusion that the Governor in
Council did not possess the power to enact that Order in Council in so far as
it purported to reduce the age of the person defined as a “child” under the
provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act from that fixed by a previous
Order in Council, i.e., a boy or girl apparently or actually under the age of
eighteen years, to that fixed in the Order in Council in question, i.e., a boy
or girl apparently or actually under the age of seventeen years, and further
concluded that the Order in Council being ultra vires to such an extent
there should not be a severance of that paragraph of the Order in Council from
the paragraph which revoked the previous declaration so that the Order in
Council was held to be ultra vires in total and the matter governed by
the previous Order in Council fixing the age of a child within the provisions
of the statute at being apparently or actually under the age of eighteen not
seventeen years. I agree with the conclusions reached by Robertson J.A. and I
have but little to add to the reasons wherein he set out with such clarity his
conclusions.

As did Robertson J.A., I have come to the
conclusion that the sole power to make the Order in Council in question must be
found in s. 2 (2) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. That
subsection provides:

(2) The Governor in Council may from time
to time by proclamation

[Page 191]

(a) direct that in any province the
expression “child” in this Act means any boy or girl apparently or actually
under the age of eighteen years, and any such proclamation may apply either to
boys only or to girls only or to both boys and girls; and

(b) revoke any direction made
with respect to any province by a proclamation under this section, and
thereupon the expression “child” in this Act in that province means any boy or
girl apparently or actually under the age of sixteen years.

The operative words in para. (a) are
“means any boy or girl apparently or actually under the age of eighteen years”.
The power, therefore, is most limited in its extent and the circumstance that
in s. 2 (1) “child” is defined in the words “means any boy or girl
apparently or actually under the age of sixteen years or such other age as
may be directed in any province pursuant to subsection (2)” (the
underlining is my own) does not add to the power granted to the Governor in
Council in subs. (2), although I agree that those underlined words in subs. (1)
may be used to interpret the meaning of the words in the power granting subs.
(2). It was argued that the words in this power-granting subs. (2) should not
be interpreted as being limited to a power to fix the age at under eighteen and
not an age between sixteen and eighteen because that was the sole power granted
in the proviso to s. 2 (a) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act as
originally enacted in Statutes of Canada, 1929, c. 46, and that had it not been
intended to vary such a provision then the section would simply have been
continued in the form in which it appeared in the original statute. And
further, that the intention to vary the power and to extend it so that an
intervening age might be chosen was indicated in the provisions of s. 1 (a)
of the present statute. The interpretation must be of the statute as it
exists today and it must be noted that the new section, for the first time,
contained a power of revocation of the previous Order in Council and that,
therefore, this rearrangement was necessary. Again, emphasis is placed on the
words “such other age” and it is argued that if the “other age” could only be
that of being

[Page 192]

under eighteen years then it would have been
much simpler to have said so exactly. On the other hand, the statute plainly
provides for the proclamation of different ages as to boys and girls, so it
would be quite possible to have a proclamation made under the statute fixing
the age of a juvenile delinquent girl at sixteen years of age and that of a
juvenile delinquent boy at eighteen years of age or vice versa, and, therefore,
the word “other” is an appropriate word in s.2 (1) in the definition of
“child”.

It was also argued in this Court that the
greater includes the lesser and that when the Governor in Council was empowered
to fix the maximum age at which a person should be considered a child within
the Act at “apparently or actually under the age of eighteen years” there was
implied the power to fix at a lower age. I am of the view that that simply is
not what s. 2 (2) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act provides and
that, on the other hand, such section simply provides that the Governor in
Council may declare any boy or girl “apparently or actually under the age of
eighteen years” to be a juvenile delinquent. I cannot imply that it was the
intention of Parliament to permit a proliferation of the age of juvenile
delinquents from province to province at anything up to eighteen years of age
for it should be noted that if the power in subs. (2) (a) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act is interpreted to permit designation of an age of less than
eighteen years then there is nothing in the subsection which will limit
that power to the designation of a child at some age between sixteen and
eighteen years and it would seem that on the argument advanced as to the
interpretation of the section a province might well request a proclamation
of fourteen years. Surely it was the intention of Parliament that there should
be two ages alone which would apply to the fixation of who was and who was not
a juvenile and that those two ages were under sixteen years and under eighteen
years.

[Page 193]

I have not been assisted in my consideration of
this appeal by the provisions of either s. 3 (2) or of s. 38 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. It is true that s. 3 (2) directs that a child shall
not be dealt with as an offender but one in a condition of delinquency and
therefore requiring help and guidance and proper supervision but that
section does not direct, and I do not think can be taken to have implied,
that a child is any person other than a person falling within the definition or
the strict powers of proclamation given to the Governor in Council by s. 2
(2) of the statute. Again, that the direction in s. 38 of the statute that
the Act shall be liberally construed in order that its purpose may be carried
out would not seem to require a construction which would permit the Governor in
Council to reduce the number of persons who may be within the classification of
“juvenile delinquent” from those who are apparently or actually under the age
of eighteen years to those who are apparently or actually under the age of
seventeen years.

I am also in agreement with the conclusion of
Robertson J.A. that the provisions of the Order in Council enacted in 1970 purporting
to revoke the Order in Council first made in 1950 should also be found to be ultra
vires as being inseverable from the provisions of the Order in Council of
1970 purporting to lower the age of the child to seventeen years. The preamble
to the Order in Council plainly shows that it was enacted at the request of the
Attorney General of British Columbia for the fixation of the age of seventeen
years and if the revocation of the earlier Order in Council is held to be an
effective revocation, despite the lack of effect of the provision fixing the
purported new age at seventeen years, then the effect will be, under subs. (2)(b)
of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, to lower the age at which a child may
be considered a juvenile delinquent to under sixteen years of age. Certainly
the Attorney General of British Columbia evidenced no such intent in his
request.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Armed robbery—Person
accidentally injured by police officer—Officer not liable for damages—Criminal
Code , 1970 (Can.), c. C-34, s. 25(4).

Appellant, who is a chartered accountant, was
accidentally injured by a shot fired by respondent, a police officer, during
the perpetration of an armed robbery on certain business premises where he was
engaged in auditing the company’s books. The accident occurred in a corridor
where boxes were stacked along one wall, thus leaving a narrow passage.
Respondent, having got to the entrance of the corridor, saw two of the three
gunmen at the other end turning to the left in order to escape into another
corridor. He then fired three times in their direction hitting the appellant
whom he had not seen and who was immobilized in the corridor after being forced
by one of the gunmen to remain there while he was making his escape. The
decision of the Superior Court ordering respondent to pay damages was reversed
by the Court of Appeal. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The justification created by the provisions
of s. 25(4)  of the Criminal Code  relieves the police officer of any
civil or criminal liability, not only in respect of the fugitive but also in
respect of any person who accidentally becomes an innocent victim of the force
used by such an officer in the circumstances described in those provisions and
established by the evidence.

With regards to negligence attributed to
respondent in the Superior Court, it might be inferred without doing violence
to the evidence that appellant was partially or totally out of the view of
respondent while he was in the clear space between boxes allowing access to an
office and before he turned around in the direction of the shots fired. Even if
appellant was temporarily within respondent’s range of view, in law this could
not be grounds for holding the latter liable

[Page 176]

and requiring in such circumstances a
standard of care greater than that required of a reasonable man. Respondent was
not engaged merely in performing an act permitted by law, but he was engaged in
the hazardous performance of a grave duty imposed on him by law. And he incurs
no liability for damage caused to another when without negligence he does
precisely what the legislature requires him to do.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal
Side, Province of Quebec, reversing a decision of the Superior Court. Appeal
dismissed.

Jules O. Duchesneau, for the plaintiff,
appellant.

Hervé Bélanger, for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Appellant is appealing against
a decision of the Court of Appeal reversing a judgment of the Superior Court
which ordered respondent, an officer of the Montreal City Police, to pay him
the sum of $39,049.25 in damages. These damages resulted from an injury
accidentally inflicted on appellant by a short fired by respondent in the
course of a police action, during the perpetration of an armed robbery on the
business premises of the Slater Shoe (Canada) Company.

The two lower courts were in substantial
agreement on the facts relevant to a consideration of the questions of law
raised in this appeal. I need only summarize these facts with reference to the
following diagram, produced at the hearing as Exhibit P-6:

[Page 177]



The offices of the Slater Shoe (Canada) Company
are on the second floor of a building situated at the corner of de Normanville
Street and Rosemont Boulevard. The entrance on Rosemont Boulevard leads by a
stairway to a waiting room, adjoining which are an information desk and the
office of the Secretary-Treasurer of the company, André Giguère. In the centre
of the premises are the main office and the sample room, which may be reached
either by corridor “A” on one side or corridor “C” on the other. These two
corridors are connected at the rear by corridor “B”, which has three offices
opening onto it, one of which, that in the centre, is the office of
Mr. Gibault, the company president. The accident in question occurred in
corridor “A”, which had on its entire length, against the wall adjacent to the
main office and the sample room, boxes stacked six to seven feet high and two
feet wide, thus leaving a passage of only three feet six inches.

On the day in question, December 21, 1962, at
about three-thirty or three forty-five in the afternoon, there were at least
ten persons on the premises, including appellant Poupart, Jean-Guy Hétu and Richard
Brunet, all three being chartered accountants, who were engaged in auditing the
company’s books. Poupart was talking to Giguère in the latter’s office, when
three gunmen, subsequently identified as Bernier, Bonnin and Périneau, and
armed respectively with a machine gun, a.45 calibre revolver and a

[Page 178]

.22 calibre revolver, suddenly burst in and
spread out through the premises. They assembled all those present, if not
everybody, into the main office at gunpoint, physical violence being used if required,
and made them line up against the wall adjacent to corridor “A”. They
immediately demanded to know where the “payroll money” was. The auditors
Poupart, Hétu and Brunet, to whom their question was mainly directed, replied
that they did not work for the firm and so knew nothing about it. While Bernier
kept the group covered the other two gunmen searched the premises, gun in hand,
but without finding any money. In front of the group gathered in the main
office Bernier singled out Hétu and, pointing the machine gun towards the
latter’s legs, told him he would count to five, by which time someone had
better provide the information required; he counted to five; drew the trigger
of his weapon; a click was heard; but no shot was fired. At this point officers
Lafortune and Picard, alerted by radio to the fact that an armed robbery was in
progress at this location, arrived and rushed into the office. Someone shouted
“Police”. The officers were greeted by shots and subsequently exchanged shots
with the gunmen.

The following, according to the part of
Lafortune’s testimony cited in the judgment at trial, is a summary of what
happened between the arrival of the police officers and the time the accident
took place. As he entered the firm’s offices Lafortune, looking through the
glass partition adjoining the information desk, he saw a group of people in the
main office with their hands up. He crouched down as he went round the counter
of the reception desk, intending to surprise the thieves from behind. When he
got to the end of the counter he saw Bernier and Bonnin, who were rather
standing midway between the second and third columns in corridor “C”. He aimed
his gun at them to hold them at bay, and as he did so Périneau came out of
Giguère’s office and fired in his direction. Lafortune returned the fire and
shouted “Everybody down”. Then, as he turned back towards Bonnin and Bernier,
he saw the latter raise his machine

[Page 179]

gun and try to fire at him. Lafortune fired
again and Bernier and Bonnin ran through the main office towards corridor “A”.
Lafortune was acquainted with the premises, having been there in response to an
earlier call, and knew that corridor “A” could be reached through the waiting
room at the front, without going through the main office. He ran that way to
cut off the retreat of the two gunmen. When he got to the entrance of the
corridor, he saw them at the other end turning to the left in order to escape
into corridor “B”. Lafortune fired three times in their direction. Immediately
after his third shot, he saw in corridor “A” for the first time an individual
clutching his left shoulder: this was appellant, who, as we shall see from his
testimony, had just been hit, and who took refuge in the entrance to the room
where the stationery is kept, at point X on the diagram. As the two gunmen had
disappeared, Bonnin jumping outside through a window and Bernier continuing
along corridor “B”, Lafortune immediately went to lend assistance to his
associate Picard in disarming and capturing Périneau, who was in Giguère’s
office.

Lafortune summarized what occurred on the
premises after the accident as follows. As Périneau had been captured,
Lafortune went into the main office and ordered the employees to stay down,
telling them that a third gunman was still on the premises. Waiting for
developments, he concealed himself behind the third column in corridor “C”. A
few moments later, he at first saw the barrel of Bernier’s machine gun
protruding past the corner of corridors “B” and “C”, then the head of Bernier himself,
who immediately disappeared as Lafortune fired at him. Lafortune remained where
he was while Picard left the premises to take steps for the arrest of Bonnin,
who had escaped. When Picard returned with police reinforcements he proceeded
to join Lafortune in corridor “B”. Picard broke down the door of Gibault’s
office, and the two men found Bernier inside, holding Gibault hostage. Bernier
was then apprehended.

[Page 180]

On his part appellant Poupart testified, in
short, concerning the circumstances immediately preceding the accident, that as
Bernier was backing out of the main office while facing him, Bernier forced
Poupart, using his machine gun, to follow him into corridor “A” and remain
there while he was making his escape towards the rear of the corridor; that
while being then immobilized in the corridor opposite the entrance to the main
office, Poupart heard shots coming from the front end of the corridor behind
him; and as he turned around in this direction he was hit in the left shoulder.
He indicated at point Y on the diagram where he was hit, and point X, the
entrance to the stationery room where he took refuge.

It is hardly necessary, but very relevant
nonetheless, to add to this brief account of the circumstances essential for
consideration of the questions of law that the foregoing events, especially
those which took place between the time the police officers arrived and the
moment the accident occurred, developed swiftly in an atmosphere of collective
tension, which, be it noted, was quite properly regarded by several witnesses
as responsible for the few discrepancies or conflicts of minor importance
contained in the evidence;

In his defence to the damage suit brought
against him respondent pleaded the following provisions of s. 25  of the Criminal
Code :

25. (1) …

(2) …

(3) …

(4) A peace officer who is proceeding
lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, any person for an offence for
which that person may be arrested without warrant, and every one lawfully
assisting the peace officer, is justified, if the person to be arrested takes
flight to avoid arrest, in using as much force as is necessary to prevent the
escape by flight, unless the escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a
less violent manner.

The Superior Court justified as follows its
judgment ordering officer Lafortune to pay compensation for the damage
resulting from this

[Page 181]

unfortunate accident: (i) Relying on the rule
followed by the courts in automobile accident cases, and stated in Swartz v.
Wills[1] as
follows:

Where there is nothing to obstruct the
vision and there is a duty to look, it is negligence not to see what is clearly
visible

and also being of the opinion that, even in
circumstances where the atmosphere is heightened by tension, a police officer
should, by reason of the training he has received, show more “sang-froid” and
control than another person would, it held that the fact that officer Lafortune
did not see appellant in the corridor constituted an act of negligence; (ii) it
then attributed a second element of negligence to the officer, on account of
his so-called lack of skill with shooting firearms, inferred from the fact that
each of the three bullets fired by him in corridor “A” hit a target other than
the gunmen; (iii) finally, after examining the question of whether the gunmen
were in fact fleeing at the time Lafortune fired in their direction, and
whether the officer was in law protected by the aforementioned provisions of
s. 25  against a damage suit by an innocent victim, as he is against an action
by the fugitive whose escape he seeks to prevent, the learned judge stated his
adoption of the position most favourable to respondent, referred to the
decisions of this Court in Prietsman v. Colangelo et al.[2] and Beim v. Goyer[3], and held that in view of the two
elements of negligence previously mentioned, Lafortune could not avail himself
of the protection of these provisions of the Code.

In the Court of Appeal Rivard J.A., in reasons
concurred in by Choquette J.A., after summarizing the facts clarified the
meaning and scope of the decisions of this Court in the Priestman and Beim
cases, as well as the distinctions attaching to the particular
circumstances of each of these cases and the present one, declared that this
was an emergency situation compelling resort to severe measures, that the
firearm was the means Lafortune had to adopt to protect those

[Page 182]

present, and himself, as well as to prevent the
gunmen from escaping and ensure their arrest, and that having regard to the
circumstances he was dealing with, the reproach made against Lafortune by the
Superior Court, of having negligently performed his duty, could not be
justified. Owen J.A., dissenting, only stated that in his opinion no error in
the Superior Court judgment had been shown on behalf of Lafortune.

Hence the appeal by Poupart against that
judgment dismissing his action.

Two observations must be made at once, with the
greatest respect, regarding certain doubts expressed in the reasons for
judgment of the learned trial judge. First, I should say that if only because
of the decision of this Court in the Priestman case supra, there
is no reason to doubt, in my view, that the justification created by the
aforementioned provisions of s. 25  relieves the police officer of any
civil or criminal liability, not only in respect of the fugitive but also in
respect of any person who accidentally becomes an innocent victim of the force
used by such an officer in the circumstances described in those provisions. And
I would add that, if only because of the evidence that Bonnin leapt from a
second-storey window when Lafortune fired at him and Bernier, there seems
little doubt that the two gunmen were really taking flight.

In short, subject to consideration of the
allegation of negligence, I feel that all the circumstances necessary for
Lafortune to be entitled to the justification provided in the aforementioned
provisions of s. 25  are present and fully established by the evidence.

The allegation of negligence: Poupart’s
testimony indicates that he was hit in his left shoulder by a bullet when,
after standing still in the corridor opposite the entrance to the main office,
he turned around in the direction of the first two shots fired at the gunmen.
Before making this movement, was he in the clear

[Page 183]

space left almost at the centre of the row of
boxes to allow access to the main office, and was he therefore, for a moment or
so, out of the view of Lafortune, partially or totally, so that he could not be
said to have been “clearly visible” to the latter, who, running, was arriving
at the end of the corridor to cut off any possible retreat by the gunmen? This
might certainly be inferred without doing violence to the evidence. Lafortune
asserted that he did not see appellant while trying to prevent the escape of
the gunmen by firing in their direction. Indeed, even if Poupart was at that
moment temporarily within Lafortune’s range of vision, I am respectfully of the
opinion that in law this could not be grounds for holding the police officer
liable by relying, moreover, on an analogy which cannot be regarded as valid,
and by requiring in addition, in such circumstances, a standard of care greater
than that required of a reasonable man.

With regard to the analogy drawn by the trial
judge between the case of the driver of an automobile, and the case of a police
officer placed in the circumstances under consideration, I would say that in
contrast with the driver of an automobile, Lafortune was not engaged merely in
performing an act permitted by law, but, which is quite a different matter, as
was pointed out at p. 618 in the Priestman case supra, he
was engaged in the hazardous performance of a grave duty imposed on him by law.
In carrying out such a duty a peace officer must undoubtedly refrain from
making any unjustifiable use of the powers relating to it. This principle was
recognized in Regina v. Waterfield and Another[4], at p. 170 et seq., and
recently recalled in this Court in the as yet unpublished decision of Knowlton
v. The Queen. However, while a police officer is not relieved of a duty to
take reasonable care, that is care the degree of which must be determined in
relation to the particular

[Page 184]

circumstances of the case to be decided, the
actions of Lafortune cannot, in a case like that before the Court, be evaluated
as they would be if it were a case in which the precautions to be taken in
accordance with the duty not to injure others were not conditioned by the
requirements of a public duty. In short, the police officer incurs no liability
for damage caused to another when without negligence he does precisely what the
legislature requires him to do; see Priestman case supra. Interpreted
otherwise the justification provided by s. 25(4)  would be reduced to a
nullity.

In all defence, therefore, I would say with
regard to the legal grounds given in support of the judgment of first instance
that the Court of Appeal properly intervened to reverse that judgment, and, for
the reasons given above and in the judgment a quo, I would dismiss the
appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal Law—Non-capital murder—Trial—Crown
counsel’s conduct—Inadmissible and inflammatory poem read by Crown counsel in
presence of jury—Refusal of trial judge to discharge jury.

The appellant was convicted of a non capital
murder which occurred in the course of a violent encounter between two
motorcycle gangs. It was alleged that the appellant struck the victim on the
side of the head with a metal logging chain. The appellant gave evidence and
towards the end of his cross-examination, Crown counsel read to the jury an
inadmissible and inflammatory poem which depicted the gang of which the
appellant was a member as being motivated by violence and contempt of the law.
The trial judge refused to declare a mistrial and gave the jury express
instructions that the poem was not evidence and should not influence them. The
Court of appeal affirmed the conviction. The appellant was granted leave to
appeal to this Court on the question as to whether the trial judge should have
discharged the jury.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Abbott,
Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ: The administration of justice in our courts
would be greatly hampered if it were not recognized that a trial judge has a
wide discretion as to the manner in which a trial is to be conducted, and it
has long been accepted that a trial judge’s ruling on the question of whether
or not to discharge the jury is one which a Court of appeal should approach
with great caution. There was nothing in the poem to advocate the kind of
murderous assault to which the appellant himself admitted in his direct
examination. It could not have prejudiced the jury any more than the evidence
of the appellant himself. The clear instructions in the trial judge’s charge
served effectively to erase it from the minds of the jury. In any event, there
was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

[Page 134]

Per Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting: On the facts of this case it would
appear that the appellant was seriously prejudiced in his trial. The not very
careful warning issued by the trial judge could not possibly have allayed the
very serious prejudice caused by the incomprehensible conduct of the Crown counsel
in putting this so-called poem to the accused in the presence of the jury. It
could not be said that the jury, as reasonable men, would have done otherwise
than find the appellant guilty.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta[1],
Appellate Division, affirming the conviction of the appellant for non-capital
murder. Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

L.A.L. Matt, for the appellant.

E.P. Adolphe, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon
JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for the
non-capital murder of Ronald George Hartley whose death occurred as the result
of injuries which he received when the appellant struck him on the side of the
head with a metal logging chain in the course of a violent encounter between
two motorcycle gangs composed of youths living in and around the City of
Calgary. One of these gangs was referred to as the “Outcasts” and the other, of
which all but two of the accused were members, carried the name of the “Grim
Reapers”.

The appellant, together with twelve other young
men, was convicted at a trial before Primrose. J. sitting with a jury, on a
charge

…that they, at or near Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, Alberta, on or about the 7th day of March, A.D.
1970, did unlawfully murder Ronald George Hartley in that each and everyone of
the

[Page 135]

accused formed an intention in common to
carry out the unlawful purpose of assaulting persons with offensive weapons and
to assist each other therein and that each of them knew or ought to have known
that the commission of the offence of non-capital murder herein alleged against
them would be a probable consequence of the carrying out of the common purpose
and did thereby commit non-capital murder, contrary to the Criminal Code .

All of the accused appealed to the Appellate
Division and by a unanimous judgment of that Court one of them was acquitted
and a new trial was directed in respect of all the others except the present
appellant whose conviction was affirmed.

The circumstances surrounding the attack on
Hartley were that the two gangs had agreed to meet at a place called “Little
Rock” about 15 miles southeast of Calgary at about 8 o’clock on the 7th of
March 1970. There had been bad blood between the two groups and it appears that
at least some of those concerned had hoped that the meeting might result in
sorting out their differences. Some of the “Grim Reapers” came to the meeting
armed with bull whips and logging chains, whereas the “Outcasts” carried no
weapons. The “Grim Reapers”, occupying four cars, were the first to arrive at
the meeting place and finding no one there started back towards Calgary, but
very soon encountered the other group who were occupying a car and a panel
truck and were accompanied by six girls including the wife of Ronald Hartley.

As the first of the “Outcasts” arrived, the
appellant got out onto the highway and according to the wife of the deceased,
he came over to their car and asked who was the president of the “Outcasts”.
Upon Ronald Hartley identifying himself, Mrs. Hartley says that he was
told to get out and when he did so was struck on the side of his head with a
chain wielded by Emkeit whereupon Hartley exclaimed “God man, why?” and
Mrs. Hartley appears to have been able to divert Emkeit who by this time
was surrounded by members of his gang. The ensuing events are described by the
learned Chief Justice in the course of his reasons for judgment

[Page 136]

which he delivered on behalf of the Appellate
Division as follows:

Hartley got in his car to drive but
couldn’t do so. He stiffened up and was becoming paralysed. He was placed on a
mattress in the back of the panel truck and was taken to hospital as quickly as
possible. He was obviously seriously hurt and mouth to mouth resuscitation was
attempted on the way to hospital. He was breathing during the most of the
journey to the hospital but was dead on arrival. Mrs. Hartley described
the chain ‘as a logging chain with 1” links’. When Ronald Emkeit hit Hartley he
said ‘Everything around the panel truck just exploded and there was fighting
and screaming and hollering.’

Of all the accused the appellant alone gave
evidence in the course of which he gave his own version of his conduct towards
Hartley:

So I walked up and as, you know, I seen the
guy was not with us, so, you know, I says, ‘Who are you?’ And he says, ‘I am
president of the Outcasts.’ So I said, ‘Outcasts?’ and I kind of snickered, you
know, because, well, I have a very bad manner with people. And he looks at me
and he says, ‘Who are you?’ I told him, ‘Ron Emkeit,’ and he took a swing at me
but he missed, so I pushed him and he went back against the door, and he
started to come to me. Now, when I pushed him I turned sideways, and that
night, as usual, I had a chrome chain around my neck, it had an iron cross on
it. I always wear this thing. So when I pushed him, you know, and as I turned
sideways and he was coming back on me, I grabbed the chain and I swung it like
that, you know. I hit him with it and he fell back against the car door, and I
moved in, I was going to hit him again, and he threw up his hands and he says,
‘No more.’ so I didn’t hit him.

The following excerpt from the cross-examination
of Emkeit also appears to me to be relevant:

Q. Did you tell the police that you
defended yourself against Hartley or a person at that fight?

A. I didn’t tell them nothing, sir.

Q. You said nothing?

A. Nothing.

Q. Is this the first time you have told
anyone about defending yourself?

[Page 137]

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That’s what you are saying, Hartley took
a swing at you and you used your chain on him?

A. Yes.

Q. Right around his head?

A. Yes. I only hit him once….

Q. Had he a weapon in his hand?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you knew it?

A. That’s right.

Q. He was alone beside his car?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you knew that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were not alone beside him, you had
friends with you?

A. That’s right.

Even if it be accepted that Hartley “took a
swing” at him, Emkeit’s statement nevertheless amounted to an admission that he
beat an unarmed man over the head with a chrome chain and from the other
evidence it appears that the man died as a result of this beating. The plea of
self defence was put to the jury, but under the circumstances I think that any
twelve men properly instructed would necessarily have found that no weight
could be attached to it.

Towards the end of his cross-examination of
Emkeit, the Crown Prosecutor saw fit to ask the following unfortunate
questions:

Q. Yes. I will tell you why I asked you if
George was a poet, that’s George Lowe. It seems to me he had a club poem with
him. Did you ever hear it?

A. I don’t know.

Q. This
is Grim Reapers, I will put it to you.
“A flash of chrome and flying hair,
The Reapers ride with fearless stare,
Citizens scream, daughters beware,
When Reapers ride there is fear in the air.
In the deep of night, with thundering crash,
Deep throated Harleys and Hortons flash.
Out of the night, the wind in their hair,
The Reapers are riding, so citizens take care.

[Page 138]

Bikes
are their life, they don’t give a damn,
They scorn the world and laugh at the man.
Riding choppers from dawn till dawn,
Knowing damn well they are Satan’s spawn,
Their creed is lust, their bible is hate,
They fuck the world and hell is their fate.”

Is that your poem?

A. No, sir.

As the learned trial judge observed, none of the
eight counsel representing the various accused took any objection to the poem
as it was going into evidence, but shortly afterwards a motion was made on
behalf of all the accused that the judge should discharge the jury on the
ground that the evidence was both inadmissible and inflammatory. The learned
trial judge was then faced with being required to exercise his undoubted
discretion in determining whether the fact that this evidence had been heard by
the jury constituted such a fatal defect in the proceedings as to justify him
in declaring a mistrial, after 26 witnesses had testified over a period of 3
days.

The trial judge asked himself the question: “Am
I justified in declaring a mistrial because something which is perhaps not
relevant at all has gone in on cross-examination?” and having heard argument
from counsel he concluded: “I am not going to discharge the jury. Carry on.”
This ruling is the subject of the sole question upon which leave to appeal to
this Court was granted, namely:

Did the learned trial judge err in refusing
the motion of counsel for the appellants to discharge the jury after counsel
during the cross-examination of the appellant read the poem ‘Grim Reapers’?

It was conceded in this Court that the so-called
poem was inadmissible and this was

[Page 139]

clearly recognized by the trial judge, but the
question for him to decide was whether it was so damaging as to require that he
order a mistrial or whether, under all the circumstances, it could be cured in
the course of his charge to the jury. Having decided to let the trial proceed,
the trial judge gave the most express instructions to the jury concerning this
evidence saying:

In the course of his cross-examination
there was reference made to a poem. Crown counsel read it. Now that may be
inflammatory and of a derogative nature. Don’t let it influence you. It is
not evidence. It is not a statement of the aims of the Grim Reapers. It is
a poem, so what?

The italics are my own.

In my opinion the administration of justice in
our courts would be gravely hampered if it were not recognized that a trial
judge has a wide discretion as to the manner in which a trial is to be
conducted, and it has long been accepted that a trial judge’s ruling on the
question of whether or not to discharge the jury is one which a court of appeal
should approach with great caution.

This is made clear in the judgment of Rinfret
J., as he then was, in Paradis v. The King[2], to which reference was made by the Chief
Justice of Alberta in the Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Rinfret in that
case, in referring to a submission that the jury should have been discharged
because of the wrongful admission of evidence, said, at page 172:

Objection was taken immediately. A long
discussion ensued at the conclusion of which the trial judge ruled that the
reference to Paradis should be struck from the deposition. Notwithstanding the
learned judge’s ruling, the appellant strongly contends that the reference was
so prejudicial to the accused that the jury should have been discharged and the
prisoner tried before a fresh jury.

There may be extreme cases where the
suggested procedure might be adopted, although we apprehend the question whether
such a course ought to be fol-

[Page 140]

lowed is primarily for the trial judge
to decide upon the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal
will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that
decision.

The italics are my own.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant in
the present case that the so-called poem depicted the gang of which the
appellant was a member as being motivated by violence and contempt of the law
and that it might thus predispose the jury to look upon the appellant as one
capable of committing the crime of which he was charged and thus give rise to
prejudice which might affect the jury’s verdict and could not be erased from
their minds notwithstanding the trial judge’s specific direction to disregard
it. In this regard it is to be remembered that the only serious defence put
forward by the appellant was that the attack was justified by way of self
defence because Hartley had taken a swing at the appellant and was coming back
at him after having been pushed away. The violent assault was admitted and it
is difficult for me to see how the introduction of the poem could have affected
the jury in determining whether it was justified by anything suggested in
Hartley’s conduct.

Counsel for the appellant cited the cases of Boucher
v. The Queen[3]; Regina
v. Vallières[4], and Regina
v. Armstrong[5] in
support of his contention, but in my opinion none of these cases can be said to
apply to a trial in which the accused himself has testified that he beat an
unarmed man over the head with a chain in such a way as to result in the death
of his victim. The Boucher case, in which the evidence was entirely
circumstantial, turned in large measure on the impropriety of the opinions
expressed by Crown counsel as to the guilt of the accused. In the Vallières case
a new trial was granted because the publicly expressed terrorist beliefs of the
accused were found to have been presented to the jury in such a manner as to
relate them to a

[Page 141]

specific bombing incident resulting in death to
which the accused was not directly connected by the evidence. In the Armstrong
case evidence had been wrongfully admitted of a statement made by the
accused that he had committed the crime, and Mr. Justice Coffin, speaking
on behalf of the majority of the Appeal Division of Nova Scotia said:

The words ‘and he said what he had done and
how he had confessed and that he had signed a statement’ constituted the
‘blurt’ that was fatal. Again with deference it is my opinion that once these
words were sounded—the ‘mischief was done and no warnings of the learned trial
Judge could effectively erase them from the minds of the members of the jury.

Nothing of this kind happened in the present
case.

In my opinion the so-called poem is descriptive
of fearless motorcyclists riding “in the deep of night” in such fashion as to
disturb the peace, terrify other citizens and generally display their scorn for
the rest of the world, and in the last three lines, in an outburst of bombastic
vulgarity, the author claims for these youths the title of “Satan’s spawn”
whose creed is lust and whose fate is hell. Revolting though all these
sentiments are, there is nothing in that poem to advocate the kind of murderous
assault to which the appellant himself admitted in his direct examination, and
it seems to me that this admission, given against the background of all the
other evidence, would necessarily dominate the minds of the members of the
jury, and that nothing in the so-called poem could paint a blacker picture of
his conduct than the accused himself described.

I do not think that the learned trial judge
erred in refusing the motion of counsel for the appellants to discharge the
jury. The poem did not relate to or substantiate the accused’s guilt of the
crime with which he was charged and could have no bearing on the issue of self
defence, and it could not, in my opinion, have prejudiced the jury any more
than the evidence

[Page 142]

of Emkeit himself. Unlike the evidence of the
confession in the Armstrong case, supra, I do not think that the
poem was evidence which could not be effectively erased from the minds of the
jury in considering the guilt or innocence of the accused, and in my opinion
the clear instructions in the trial judge’s charge served to fulfill this
purpose.

In the case of Pisani v. The Queen[6], which was recently decided in this Court,
a new trial was granted because of serious breaches of duty exhibited by Crown
counsel in the course of his address to the jury, but in my view, that case can
have no bearing on the circumstances here disclosed because, as
Mr. Justice Laskin said in the course of the reasons for judgment which he
delivered on behalf of the Court: “The trial judge did nothing to erase the
effect of Crown counsel’s remarks.”

Like the Chief Justice of Alberta, I am also of
opinion that this is, in any event, a case in which the jury’s verdict would
necessarily have been the same if the offensive poem had not been admitted in
evidence, and this is the test which has been used repeatedly in this Court in
applying the provisions contained in s. 592(1)(b)(iii) by
concluding that “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.”

For all the above reasons I would dismiss the
appeal.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
by Emkeit from the decision of the Appellate Division of Alberta[7] confirming his conviction after a trial
before Primrose J. and jury upon the

[Page 143]

charge of non-capital murder. By order of this
Court made on June 28, 1971, Emkeit was given leave to appeal in respect of the
following question of law, namely:

Did the learned trial judge err in refusing
the motion of counsel for the appellant to discharge the jury after counsel for
the respondent, during his cross-examination of the appellant, read the poem
“Grim Reapers”?

I have had the opportunity of reading the
reasons for judgment given by my brother Ritchie and I wish to adopt the
statement of facts outlined in those reasons adding thereto only reference to
such additional facts as are required for my consideration.

Although counsel for the Attorney General of
Alberta devoted a considerable portion of his factum to the submission that the
introduction of the so-called poem was admissible, during the argument of the
appeal in this case and with some considerable reluctance, the said counsel
admitted that the production of that alleged evidence was inadmissible and
therefore this court need only consider the question of whether the trial judge
erred in refusing to discharge the jury after such inadmissible evidence had
been before the jury.

In the Appellate Division of Alberta, Smith
C.J.A. relied on Paradis v. The King[8],
and particularly the statement of Rinfret J., as he then was, at p. 172:

There may be extreme cases where the
suggested procedure might be adopted, although we apprehend the question
whether such a course ought to be followed is primarily for the trial judge to
decide upon the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal
will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that
decision. In this instance, at all events, there are clearly no adequate
grounds for holding that the learned judge ought to have acted otherwise than
he did.

[Page 144]

Of course, that statement does reflect the
proper position of an appellate court. It has often been repeated and has been
described as being the modern practice by Sachs L.J. in Regina v. Weaver[9], where the learned Lord Justice spoke for
the Court of Criminal Appeal.

Nevertheless, there have been cases in this
court and in the provincial courts of appeal in which the court has come to the
conclusion that the admission of inadmissible evidence or such faults as
inflammatory addresses to the jury by counsel for the Crown caused such serious
prejudice to the accused that the trial should have been stopped immediately
and that the trial judge exercised his discretion in error when he failed to
assent to an application by the defence that such course be adopted and that
therefore the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed. Some of
these cases deal with accidents during examination or cross-examination of a
witness where the witness blurts out an answer obviously inadmissible and in
such cases the appellate court, particularly when the trial judge has warned
the jury as to the inadmissible character of the evidence, has, whenever
possible, approved the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge in
refusing to terminate the trial. Even, however, in such a case, if the
appellate court is of the opinion that the prejudice was a serious one and that
it could not be assured that the warning of the trial judge had wiped out that
prejudice, it quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.

In Regina v. Armstrong[10], the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court considered a case where in cross-examination of a Crown witness
counsel for the accused, evidently upon a misunderstanding of the evidence
given by that Crown witness on a preliminary, put to the witness questions
which elicited obviously inadmissible answers. Coffin J.A., at
p. 146, said:

[Page 145]

The words “and he said what he had done and
how he had confessed and that he had signed a statement” constituted the
“blurt” that was fatal. Again with deference it is my opinion that once these
words were sounded—the “mischief” was done and no warnings of the learned trial
Judge could effectively erase them from the minds of the members of the jury.

And Cooper J.A. said at p. 151:

In my view the words of Mrs. Oickle
uttered in the presence of the jury “and he said what he had done and how he
had confessed and that he had signed a statement” may well have influenced the
jury. If they had not been spoken it cannot be said that the jury would not
have come to a different conclusion. With deference it is my opinion that once
these words were said, the mischief was done and warnings of the learned trial
Judge could not effectively erase them from the minds of the jury. Nor can the
fact that defence counsel did not move for dismissal of the jury and a new
trial affect the matter—Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1944]
2 All E.R. 13—Viscount Simon, L.C., at pp. 18, 19; R. v. Hortopan, [1964]
2 C.C.C. 306, 42 C.R. 191, [1964] 2 O.R. 157—Roach, J.A., at p. 312.

In cases in which the inadmissible material has
been placed before the jury by the Crown either in the adducing of evidence or
in the Crown’s inflammatory address, I am of the opinion that the appellate
court takes a much stricter view and the court would have to be convinced
indeed that the fault was a minor one adequately corrected by the trial judge
in his charge before it would refuse the relief of a new trial.

In this court, the improper addresses by the
Crown counsel have been dealt with particularly in two cases. In Boucher v.
The Queen[11], the
court was concerned with a case in which the accused was charged with a
particularly brutal murder. Counsel for the Crown, first in his address to the
jury, stressed that the Crown had

[Page 146]

only proceeded with the charge after a careful
investigation and that the Crown officers were satisfied that the crime had
been committed by this particular accused, and then ended his address by the
words, and I translate only the sense: and if you return a verdict of guilty,
for once it almost gives me pleasure to ask that the death penalty be assessed
against him. Rand J., at p. 23, used words which have been repeated and
which I think set out the view of this court:

It is difficult to reconstruct in mind and
feeling the court room scene when a human life is at stake; the tensions, the
invisible forces, subtle and unpredictable, the significance that a word may
take on, are sensed at best imperfectly. It is not, then, possible to say that
this reference to the Crown’s action did not have a persuasive influence on the
jury in reaching their verdict. The irregularity touches one of the oldest
principles of our law, the rule that protects the subject from the pressures of
the executive and has its safeguard in the independence of our courts. It goes
to the foundation of the security of the individual under the rule of law.

It cannot be over-emphasized that the
purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay
before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what
is alleged to be a crime. Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal
proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its
legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly. The role of prosecutor
excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public
duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal
responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of
the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings.

On December 21, 1970, this court gave judgment
in the appeal of Bruno Pisani v. The

[Page 147]

Queen[12], which I cite
because I believe it is most relevant for the present consideration. There,
counsel for the Crown in his address proceeded in effect to give evidence in
which he explained the reason why, in his view, the accused had acted in the
fashion which the evidence had shown he had acted and did so by referring to
the practice of persons accused of like offences. This court, relying on Boucher
v. The Queen, supra, unanimously granted a new trial.

The Court of Appeal of Quebec in Regina v.
Vallières[13] was
concerned with a charge of manslaughter against a person who was a well-known
advocate of terrorist tactics. During the trial, the Crown used the writings of
the accused person in order to show that he was intimately concerned with all
the affairs of an organization with such aims and that he would, therefore,
have been among those who took part in a decision to plant a bomb the explosion
of which caused the victim’s death. The trial judge told the jury that the fact
that the accused was a terrorist did not necessarily mean that he took part in
placing the bomb at the factory on the date in question but in his address the
Crown counsel quoted from a book containing an appeal to violence and ended his
address by stating, “Gentlemen, free the accused and you know what will
happen”. The Quebec Court of Appeal, in a unanimous decision, directed a new
trial. Hyde J.A. gave the principal judgment and short concurring judgments
were given by the other justices on appeal. Brossard J.A. said at pp. 81-82:

[TRANSLATION] In Canada, the fundamental
right to a defence is enjoyed by all those persons arrested and charged with
offences allegedly committed by them, and this right is based on common law
principles

[Page 148]

implanted in the mores of society by a very
ancient, profoundly humane, and virile judicial tradition.

However serious may be the offences with
which they are charged, whatever nefarious effect these offences may have upon
citizens for whom law and respect for the law constitute the fundamental
elements upon which protection of individuals and the maintenance of order and
peace in society are built, and whatever dangers are created by the brutality
and animalistic characteristics of the violence involved in such crimes, those
charged with them are, in so far as the judicial authorities are concerned,
entitled to the protection afforded by the following great principles of our
criminal law: no one can be presumed to be guilty: no one can be convicted of
an offence unless his guilt is established beyond all reasonable doubt; in a
trial before a jury, no evidence can be presented, and no statement may be made
by counsel for the Crown, which might induce a jury to base a conviction upon
psychological or passionate grounds which might affect the most objective and
just treatment of the accused, in accordance with cold reason; in such a trial,
no direction, erroneous in fact or in law, may be given to a jury, if it is
seriously likely to affect the latter’s decision with respect to the reasonable
doubt, to the benefit of which the accused is entitled.

Essentially it is to ensure the complete
respect for these principles that I, like my colleague, Mr. Justice Hyde,
and for the reasons given by him, would order a new trial.

And Turgeon J.A. said at p. 83:

[TRANSLATION] I concur with
Mr. Justice Hyde, because I cannot convince myself that the jury would
necessarily have reached the same verdict,

…

I need not repeat examples of where an appellate
court has viewed the fault at trial, whether by the admission of inadmissible
evidence or by the inflammatory address of Crown counsel, as causing a breach
so serious that a new trial must be directed. I turn to make some reference to
the facts in this particular appeal. There is no doubt that Ronald Hartley, the
victim, came to his death because the accused struck him across his head
violently with a chrome chain which the accused had worn around his neck for
over two years regarding it in some peculiar fashion as ornamentation. The
defence of the accused

[Page 149]

was that this was an act of self-defence and
testified that the act of self-defence was taken after the deceased had first
aimed a blow at the accused but missed him. The fatal accident occurred during
a fracas between two groups which may be generally described as “motorcycle
gangs” and took place during a road-side meeting when the gang of which the
accused was a prominent member and which was known as the Grim Reapers were
returning from a place where they had attended, they alleged, at the invitation
and suggestion of the second group, the Outcasts. The Grim Reapers having
attended this place found no one there, turned around, and met the Outcasts
driving toward it. The usual senseless fracas occurred with violence on both
sides. Now, under such circumstances, the establishment of the defence of
self-defence called for a very careful analysis of the steps taken by the
deceased, by the accused and his fellow-accused, and by the other members of
the deceased’s group. Inevitably, the credibility of the various witnesses was
much in issue. There is no doubt that the accused struck the fatal blow. Of the
accused, Emkeit alone gave evidence and he admitted it in his evidence,
alleging, however, as I have said, that he acted in self-defence.

The charge upon which the appellant and his
co-accused were arraigned was:

that they, at or near Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, Alberta, on or about the 7th day of March, A.D.
1970, did unlawfully murder Ronald George Hartley in that each and everyone of
the accused formed an intention in common to carry out the unlawful purpose of
assaulting persons with offensive weapons and to assist each other therein and
that each of them knew or ought to have known that the commission of the
offence of non-capital murder herein alleged against them would be a probable
consequence of the carrying out of the common purpose and did thereby commit
non-capital murder, contrary to the Criminal Code .

And it was the aim of the accused Emkeit’s
counsel to adduce evidence tending to show that Emkeit and his co-accused could
not have formed an intention in common to carry out the

[Page 150]

unlawful purpose of assaulting persons with
offensive weapons. Under these circumstances, counsel for the Crown, in the
course of his cross-examination of the accused, without any foundation or
introduction, suddenly asked the accused, “Is George Lowe a poet?” which
question the accused answered with “Pardon me?”. And then counsel repeated, “Is
he a poet?” to which the accused answered, “I have no idea whether he is a poet
or not”; then counsel left the subject and some five pages later returned to
the subject by saying:

Q. Yes, I will tell you why I asked you if
George was a poet, that’s George Lowe. It seems to me he had a club poem with
him. Did you ever hear it? A. I don’t know.

Q. This is Grim Reapers, I will put it to
you:

“A flash of chrome.”

It’s entitled “Grim Reapers”.

“A flash
of chrome and flying hair,
The Reapers ride with fearless stare.
Citizens scream, daughters beware,
When Reapers ride there is fear in the air.
In the deep of night, with thundering crash,
Deep throated Harleys and Hortons flash.
Out of the night, the wind in their hair,
The Reapers are riding, so citizens take care.
Bikes are their life, they don’t give a damn,
They scorn the world and laugh at the man.
Riding choppers from dawn till dawn,
Knowing damn well they are Satan’s spawn,
Their creed is lust, their bible is hate,
They fuck the world and hell is their fate.”

Is that your poem?

A. No, sir.

Q. It is not? You never heard it before?
Are you saying you never heard the thing before?

[Page 151]

A. I might have heard it, I don’t know. Am
I supposed to remember everything that ever happened in my life?

Counsel for the Crown on this appeal, who also
appeared for the Crown as counsel at the trial, never explained how it seemed
to him that Lowe had a club poem with him. There was no evidence whatsoever as
to how the so-called poem was obtained and there was simply no evidentiary
foundation that the poem had the slightest connection with the accused or any
of his co-accused except the words “Grim Reapers” which counsel for the Crown
in his question had stated was the title of the poem. The document never was
produced. As Brossard J.A. remarked in Regina v. Vallières, supra, it is
understandable that during the course of a long trial counsel for the Crown may
have allowed a passionate appeal to the jury to escape from him when his
attitude towards the accused may subconsciously have been affected by reading
vitriolic articles. In that particular case, the accused had admitted, even
boasted, that he was the author of the articles. In the present case, the
accused denied even any knowledge of the so-called poem.

With the confused state of the evidence as to
the fatal fracas and considering the form of the charge laid in the particular
case, I am of the opinion that the submission made by counsel for the accused
in his factum that this comment by the Crown was calculated to do nothing less
than inflame and prejudice the jury against the accused Emkeit, and the poem
was quoted only for the purpose of showing that Emkeit and the others
implicated were bad men possessed of propensities or dispositions to commit the
crime of murder, is a just comment and I am in accord with it. Therefore, it
would appear that the accused was seriously prejudiced in his trial. An
application to stay the trial was made within a few minutes after the Crown
counsel had put the so-called poem to Emkeit in his cross-examination and that
application was refused by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge, in
his charge, referred to the matter in a few lines in these words:

[Page 152]

In the course of his cross-examination
there was reference made to a poem. Crown counsel read it. Now that may be
inflammatory and of a derogative nature. Don’t let it influence you. It is not
evidence. It is not a statement of the aims of the Grim Reapers. It is a poem,
so what?

Smith, C.J.A., in giving reasons for the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, said:

The jury, having been so warned, I would
dismiss this objection on the ground that the decision whether to discharge the
jury and order that the appellants be tried before a fresh jury is “primarily
for the trial judge to decide upon the circumstances of the particular case”,

relying on the judgment of Rinfret J. in this
court in Paradis v. The King, supra.

With respect, I am of the opinion that the not
very careful warning issued by the trial judge could not possibly have allayed
the very serious prejudice caused by the incomprehensible conduct of the Crown
counsel in putting this so-called poem to the accused in the presence of the
jury. To use the words of both Coffin J.A. and Cooper J.A. in Regina v.
Armstrong, supra, “once the words were sounded the mischief was done”.
Here, the accused man and his co‑accused were charged with forming an
intent to assault persons with deadly weapons and with thereby causing the
death of the deceased man. To attribute to the group a diatribe in which lust
and violence were extolled was not only prejudicial it was reprehensible and it
was a denial of the whole basis for the trial of accused persons in accordance
with the Canadian criminal law, which demands absolute fairness on the part of
the Crown. I refer again to the words of Rand J. in Boucher v. The Queen, which
I have quoted.

I turn to the question of whether the fault in
the trial may be excused by the application of s.

[Page 153]

592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . That
section may be applied and the appeal dismissed if the court “is of the
opinion that notwithstanding the error of law no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred”. This court has reviewed, in many cases,
the application of that subsection or its predecessor and those cases were
summarized and considered in Colpitts v. The Queen[14], where, at p. 755, I adopted the
statement from Brooks v. The King[15],
as follows:

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

Applying that principle to the facts in this
case, the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the court that if the jury had heard
only admissible evidence without the insertion into the trial of this so‑called
poem they could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than found the
accused guilty. In view of the confused evidence as to the fracas, the
character of all the persons involved in the fracas, and all of the
circumstances which had preceded the accidental meeting on the roadside, I
cannot say that reasonable men with proper evidence only before them could not
have had reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. I, therefore, would
not apply s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

I would allow the appeal and direct that this
accused have the same new trial as had been granted already to his co-accused
by the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.

Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL

Extradition—Extradition crimes—Conspiracy to
import cocaine into the United States—Crime against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in
narcotics—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, s. 423(1)(d).

The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed
applicant’s application for the cancellation of a warrant of committal under
the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, following indictment by
a Federal grand jury in the United States for violation of ss. 173 and 174 of Title 21, United States Code. This Court granted leave to appeal only on the question as to
whether conspiracy to import a narcotic is an extradition crime within the Extradition
Act . Appellant argued that this Court’s jurisdiction under s. 31(3)  of
the Federal Court Act  did not permit this Court to limit the grounds
upon which an appeal might be argued and was limited to either granting or
refusing such appeal. This Court pointed out that s. 31(3)  of the Federal
Court Act  was to the same effect as s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court
Act which provides that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant leave
to appeal only on the specific question of law set out in its order, and was
subject to a similar course. Appellant submitted the argument that the charge
of conspiracy to import a narcotic drug was not listed in Schedule I of the Extradition
Act , and that even if he had been charged in Canada, he could have been
charged only under s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Supplementary Convention of 1925, which
was added to the Extradition Act  was an extradition arrangement;
therefore, if the crime of conspiring to import a narcotic is a crime “against
the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics”, it is a crime

[Page 220]

within the definition of “extradition crimes”
described in the Convention. This is the case here. It matters not that had the
indictment been laid in Canada,
it would have been laid under the Criminal Code  or the Narcotic
Control Act. The test is what is the essence of the crime charged.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Federal Court
of Appeal[1] dismissing
an application for cancellation of a warrant of committal. Appeal dismissed.

Kenneth C. Binks, Q.C., and William J.
Simpson, for the appellant.

L.P. Landry, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Federal Court of Appeal pronounced on January 25, 1974. The appellant
applied to this Court for leave to appeal and set out therein several grounds
of appeal which he wished to argue before this Court. This Court did not grant
leave to appeal on any of those grounds but by its order pronounced on April 29, 1974, did grant leave to appeal upon
the following question of law:

Is conspiracy to import a narcotic an
extradition crime within the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21?

At the opening of the argument of the appeal,
counsel for the appellant sought to argue the other grounds set out in his
application for leave to appeal and submitted that this Court’s jurisdiction
under s. 31(3)  of the Federal Court Act , 1970 (Can.), c. 1, did
not permit this Court to limit the grounds upon which an appeal might be argued
and that this Court’s jurisdiction upon such an application for leave to appeal
was limited to either granting or refusing such leave. Section 31 (3)  of the Federal
Court Act  reads:

[Page 221]

An appeal to the Supreme Court lies with
leave of that Court from any final or other judgment or determination of the
Federal Court of Appeal, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
has been refused by the Federal Court of Appeal.

The Court pointed out to counsel for the
appellant that the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, in
s. 41(1) provides:

Subject to subsection (3), an appeal
lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other
judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge
thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be
appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court has been refused by any other court

and that, therefore, the two sections would
seem to be exactly to the same effect and that over the course of many decades
this Court had exercised the jurisdiction in s. 41(1) of the Supreme
Court Act to grant leave to appeal only on the specific question of law set
out in its order. We were all of the opinion that s. 31(3)  of the Federal
Court Act  was subject to a similar course and we therefore confined the
appellant to argument upon the ground of appeal for which leave to appeal had
been granted and which I have recited above.

The appellant was indicted by a Federal Grand
Jury in the United States District in the State of New
 York on October 9, 1973, and charged that the
appellant had conspired with others to import cocaine, a narcotic drug, into
the United States contrary to
Title 21, United States Code, ss. 173 and 174. The appellant was also indicted
with another charge with which this appeal is not concerned.

The appellant submitted the argument that the
charge of conspiracy to import a narcotic drug was not listed in Schedule I to
the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, although certain other
conspiracies were listed in the said Schedule I, and that the offences with
which the appellant was charged in the United States courts if charged in
Canada could not have been the subject of a charge under

[Page 222]

the provisions of the Narcotic Control Act but
only under the provisions of s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. 34. The said Extradition Act  deals with
“extradition crimes” and extradition crimes are defined in s. 2  thereof as
follows:

“extradition crime” may mean any crime
that, if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of
the crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the application of this Act to the
case of any extradition arrangement, “extradition crime” means any crime
described in such arrangement, whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule.

Although the crime of conspiracy to import a
narcotic is not, as I have pointed out, in Schedule I of the Extradition
Act , in the year 1925 by a Supplementary Convention there was added a
classification described in s. 17  thereof as follows: “Crimes and offences
against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics”.

Referring to the definition of extradition
crimes which I have cited above, it will be seen that such crimes are defined
as including two different classes, firstly, those which were listed in
Schedule I and, secondly, those which were described in such an arrangement, i.e.,
an extradition arrangement. The Supplementary Convention of the year 1925
was an extradition arrangement within that subsection and therefore if the
crime of conspiring to import a narcotic is a crime “against the laws for the
suppression of the traffic in narcotics” it is a crime within the definition of
“extradition crimes” and the Honourable Mr. Justice Lamb had jurisdiction
to consider the application for an extradition order made before him.

I am of the opinion that it matters not whether
the particular indictment, had it been laid in Canada, would have been laid under the provisions of the Criminal Code  or
the Narcotic Control Act or in fact any other statute. The test is what
is the essence of the crime charged. I am also of the opinion that the essence
of the crime charged in the indictment by the United States Grand Jury

[Page 223]

was and only could be for a crime against the
laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics. I am therefore of the
opinion that Mr. Justice Lamb had jurisdiction.

I have been assisted in coming to this
conclusion by referring to the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. in Re Brisbois[2], where the learned Chief Justice
considered on an application for habeas corpus the case of an applicant
who had been convicted in the United States on a charge of “wilfully and
knowingly conspiring to defraud the United States of its governmental functions
to have the lawful function of the United States Customs Service administered
free from obstruction, corruption and improper influence, etc., and conspiring to
violate the United States Narcotic Laws. (Title 18, Sec. 371 U.S.C.) as
charged…” It is the last words “and conspiring to violate the United States
Narcotic Laws” with which we are concerned.

The accused had been convicted and was allowed
out on bail pending the hearing of his appeal but he did not surrender to his
bail and after an abortive attempt to obtain his extradition from the Bahamas the applicant was arrested in Canada and held for examination. The
learned Chief Justice of the High Court considered the issue in a very
carefully reasoned judgment, dealt with all the matters which were alleged in
our Court and said at p. 193:

In my view the criminal law of Canada has to be examined as a whole to
find what laws are designed for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics.
Since a conspiracy to commit breaches of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act is
not exempt from the provisions of s. 408, nor was it exempt from the
provisions of the former s. 573, a conspiracy to commit any of the
indictable offences set out in the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act must be
taken to be included in the laws for the suppression of the traffic in
narcotics.

[Page 224]

The learned Chief Justice of the High Court
concluded that the applicant had been convicted of an offence which came within
the terms of the Treaty existing between Canada and the United States of
America and dismissed the application for habeas corpus.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm
the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

MOTION TO QUASH AND MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
APPEAL

Criminal law—Obscenity—Forfeiture
order—Prevailing community standards of tolerance—Evidence—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 159(8), 160

Proceedings were taken under s. 160  of
the Criminal Code  for the seizure and forfeiture of a certain issue of a
magazine on the ground that it was obscene. An order of forfeiture was made and
an appeal therefrom to the Alberta Appellate Division was dismissed by a
majority judgment with Sinclair J.A. dissenting. In his dissent Sinclair J.A.
was of the opinion that the dominant characteristic of the particular issue of
the magazine was the exploitation of sex but he concluded that the evidence did
not satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that the exploitation was “undue” so
as to meet the statutory test of obscenity under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code . In this Court, the Crown moved to quash the appeal by the accused and
the latter applied for leave to appeal in the event that the motion to quash
succeeded.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The motion to quash should be granted and the
application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Dickson JJ.: Section 160(6)  of the Criminal Code  provides
that “an appeal lies from an order [of forfeiture] …(a) on any
ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone, (b) on
any ground of appeal that involves a question of fact alone, or (c) on
any ground of appeal that involves a question of mixed law and fact, as if it
were an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal, as the case may be, on a question of law alone under Part XVIII and
sections 601  to 624  apply mutatis mutandis.” The submission of the
appellants that, by virtue of s. 160(6) , the appellants are given the same
right of appeal to this Court as if the dissent of Sinclair

[Page 90]

J.A., on a question of fact, had been
converted into a dissent on a question of law, was not accepted. Subsection (6)
provides for a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal, but the wording is not
apt to describe an appeal to this Court.

The appellants’ submission, on the
application for leave to appeal, that the failure of the Crown to adduce
evidence as to prevailing community standards of tolerance should have resulted
in the dismissal of the Crown’s case at its conclusion, also failed. The
appellants’ contention, i.e., that a court cannot, in law, make an order
of forfeiture under s. 160(4) unless the Crown has led evidence as to
prevailing community standards of tolerance, was not supported by any
authority, and in any event the point did not arise in the present case. The
trial judge did have before him evidence from both sides respecting the matter
of community standards to assist in reaching his conclusion.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: The motion to quash should be dismissed
but, if necessary, leave to appeal should be granted if only to bring to this
Court the question of required proof by the Crown to establish “undue”
exploitation of sex by way of evidence to show contemporary or prevailing
community standards.

Section 618(1)(a) gives an appeal as
of right to this Court from a conviction which has been affirmed on appeal
(offences punishable by death are treated separately), “on any question of law
on which a judge of the Court of Appeal dissents”. Section 160(6)  enjoins that
the rights of appeal given thereunder are to be treated “as if” they were
appeals on a question of law alone. Therefore where there is a dissent on any
ground stated in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of
s. 160(6) , it is to be treated as if on a question of law alone for the
purposes of an appeal to this Court. In the result, the apppeal taken here on
the basis of the dissent of Sinclair J.A. comes here as of right.

Also, it is s. 160(6)  that is the
dominant provision for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction, and, as provided,
ss. 601 to 624 are to be read conformably to give effect to what s. 160(6) 
decrees.

and Spence J. dissenting.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The
question on this application to quash is the scope of the appellate
jurisdiction of this Court under s. 160(6)  of the Criminal Code . The
facts out of which the application arises may be briefly stated. Proceedings
were taken under s. 160  for the seizure and forfeiture of the February
1973 number of Penthouse magazine on the ground that it was obscene. An order
of forfeiture was made and an appeal therefrom to the Alberta Appellate
Division was dismissed by a majority judgment with Sinclair J.A. dissenting. In
his dissent Sinclair J.A. was of the opinion that the dominant characteristic
of the particular issue of the magazine was the exploitation of sex but he
concluded that the evidence did not satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that
the exploitation was “undue” so as to meet the statutory test of obscenity
under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code .

The dissent of Sinclair J.A. was not on a
question of law, and this is underscored by the fact that the formal order of
the Alberta Appellate Division dismissing the appeal does not specify any
dissent

[Page 92]

on a ground of law, which would have been
necessary under s. 606  of the Criminal Code , if there had been a
dissent on that basis. Notwithstanding this, the appellant filed a notice of
appeal, asserting an appeal as of right by virtue of s. 160(6) . If
s. 160(6) does not carry beyond this Court’s normal jurisdiction to
entertain an appeal as of right, as specified in s. 618(1) (a) then
the motion to quash must succeed. I may say here that the appellant responded
to the motion to quash by a counter-application for leave to appeal but I leave
this for later consideration. If there is no appeal as of right under
s. 160(6) , that is not therefore the end of this matter. I am of the view,
however, that wittingly or not, Parliament has given an appeal as of right to
this Court under s. 160(6)  where it would not lie if taken under
s. 618(1) (a) alone.

Section 160(6) reads as follows:

An appeal lies from an order made under
subsection (4) or (5) by any person who appeared in the proceedings

(a) On any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

(b) on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of fact alone, or

(c) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of mixed law and fact,

as if it were an appeal against conviction
or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, on a
question of law alone under Part XVIII and sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis
mutandis.

Because proceedings under s. 160  are, so to
speak, proceedings in rem it is understandable that there be some
express mention of appeals, “as if”, to use the words of s. 160(6), they
were appeals against conviction or acquittal. The specification in clauses (a),
(b) and (c) of grounds of appeal is followed by the
declaration that appeal on those grounds is to be treated as if the appeal was
on a question of law alone under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code , the
Part that deals with appeals to the provincial Court of Appeal and to this
Court in respect of

[Page 93]

indictable offences. There is, moreover, the
important reference in the concluding words of s. 160 (6) that
“sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis mutandis”.

If reference is made to Part XVIII respecting
appeals to the provincial Court of Appeal on a question of law alone where
there has been a conviction, it will be seen that under s. 603(1)(a)
an appeal on a question of law alone can be brought as of right but an appeal
on any other ground, whether of fact or mixed law and fact or otherwise,
requires leave. (I leave out of consideration an appeal based on a certificate
of the trial judge.) Section 160(6) says, however, that an appeal on any of the
grounds specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c)
thereof lies as if it were on a question of law alone, and hence it appears quite
clear to me that appeals under those clauses do not require leave because none
is required under s. 603(1)(a)(i) where a question of law
alone is involved.

Moving then to s. 618 which governs appeals
to this Court from conviction or acquittal, s. 618(1)(a) gives
an appeal as of right from a conviction which has been affirmed on appeal
(offences punishable by death are treated separately), “on any question of law
on which a judge of the Court of Appeal dissents”. Section 160(6) enjoins that
the rights of appeal given thereunder are to be treated “as if” they were
appeals on a question of law alone. I cannot therefore escape from the
conclusion that where there is a dissent on any ground stated in clauses (a),
(b) or (c) of s. 160(6), it is to be treated as if on a
question of law alone for purposes of an appeal to this Court. In the result,
the appeal taken here on the basis of the dissent of Sinclair J.A. comes here
as of right.

It is not only the enveloping words “as if” that
compel this conclusion, but as well the direction

[Page 94]

that ss. 601  to 624  of the Criminal Code  be
read mutatis mutandis for the purposes of s. 160(6) , that is with
the necessary changes in points of detail. It is s. 160(6)  that is the
dominant provision for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction, and ss. 601  to
624  are to be read conformably to give effect to what s. 160(6)  decrees.

If I am correct in this assessment of the scope
of appellate jurisdiction, I do not think that the appellants require any
further leave to raise other points; it seems to me they are already involved
in the appeal as of right. However, if I am wrong, I would be disposed to give
leave to appeal if only to bring to this Court the question of required proof
by the Crown to establish “undue” exploitation of sex by way of evidence to
show contemporary or prevailing community standards. I take this both from the
judgment of Judson J. in Brodie, Dansky and Rubin v. The Queen[2] and the judgment of Freedman J.A.,
as he then was, in R. v. Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd.[3], adopted unanimously by this Court[4]. In the present case, the Crown led no
evidence at all of community standards. I think it important for this Court to
decide whether on a question of obscenity the trial judge can proceed unaided
by Crown evidence to determine for himself, as if a question of law alone was
involved, whether there was undue exploitation of sex. I refrain from any
further exposition of this matter on an application for leave.

I would dismiss the motion to quash but, if
necessary, I would give leave to appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Dickson JJ.
was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The circumstances which led up to
the respondent’s motion to quash and to the appellants’ motion for leave to
appeal are set out in

[Page 95]

the reasons of the Chief Justice. I agree with
him that the dissenting reasons of Sinclair J.A., in the Appellate Division,
did not constitute a dissent on a question of law within the meaning of
s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

The submission of the appellants in response to
the motion to quash is that, by virtue of s. 160(6)  of the Criminal
Code , the appellants are given the same right of appeal to this Court as if
the dissent of Sinclair J.A., on a question of fact, had been converted into a
dissent on a question of law.

The relevant portions of s. 160  provide as
follows:

160. (1) A
judge who is satisfied by information upon oath that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that any publication, copies of which are kept for sale
or distribution in premises within the jurisdiction of the court, is obscene or
a crime comic, shall issue a warrant under his hand authorizing seizure of the
copies.

* *
*

(3) The owner and the author of the matter
seized and alleged to be obscene or a crime comic may appear and be represented
in the proceedings in order to oppose the making of an order for the forfeiture
of the said matter.

(4) If the court is satisfied that the
publication is obscene or a crime comic, it shall make an order declaring the
matter forfeited to Her Majesty in right of the province in which the
proceedings take place, for disposal as the Attorney General may direct.

(5) If the court is not satisfied that the
publication is obscene or a crime comic, it shall order that the matter be
restored to the person from whom it was seized forthwith after the time for
final appeal has expired.

(6) An appeal lies from an order made under
subsection (4) or (5) by any person who appeared in the proceedings

(a) on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

(b) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of fact alone, or

(c) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of mixed law and fact,

[Page 96]

as if it were an appeal against conviction
or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, on a
question of law alone under Part XVIII and sections 601  to 624  apply mutatis
mutandis.

I do not agree with this submission. Section
160(6)  gives the right to “an appeal”, in the singular. The grounds for such an
appeal are defined in paras, (a), (b) and (c); i.e.,
grounds involving: (a) a question of law alone; (b) a question of fact
alone; or (c) a question of mixed law and fact. These are the grounds on which
a person convicted by a trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal “against
his conviction” to the court of appeal under s. 603(1)(a)(i) or
(ii). The first ground, (a), is one on which the Attorney General may appeal
under s. 605(1)(a) against “a judgment or verdict of
acquittal” of a trial court in proceedings by indictment.

Proceedings under s. 160  do not result in a
conviction or a judgment or verdict of acquittal, and therefore the right of
appeal given by ss. 603(1)(a)(i) and (ii) and 605(1)(a) would not
be available to a party affected by an order made under subs. (4) or subs. (5)
of that section. For this reason, subs. (6) goes on to provide “as if it were
an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as
the case may be”.

An appeal against conviction by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment, under s. 603(1)(a)(ii), does not lie in
respect of a question of fact alone or in respect of a question of mixed law
and fact unless leave is obtained from the court of appeal or a judge thereof
or upon the certificate of the trial judge that the case is a proper case for
appeal. The Attorney General cannot appeal from a judgment or verdict of
acquittal in proceedings by indictment, pursuant to s. 605(1)(a),
save on a ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone.

[Page 97]

Subsection (6) obviates the need to obtain
leave or a certificate for an appeal on a question of fact alone or on a
question of mixed law and fact and eliminates the limitation on the right of
the Attorney General to appeal only on questions of law by providing that an appeal
under s. 160(6)  lies as if it were an appeal “on a question of law alone”.

Because subs. (6) relates to “an appeal” and
because the phraseology used in defining that appeal is taken from those
provisions of the Criminal Code  which govern the right of appeal to the
court of appeal in proceedings by indictment, it is my opinion that that
portion of subs. (6) which I have so far discussed provides, and provides only,
for a right of appeal to the court of appeal. The wording is not apt to
describe an appeal to this Court. Subsection (6) uses the words “as if it
were an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal”. An appeal by the accused to the court of appeal under s. 603 
is an appeal “against his conviction”. An appeal by the Attorney General to the
court of appeal under s. 605  is an appeal “against a judgment or verdict
of acquittal”. An appeal to this Court by an accused person in respect of an
indictable offence (other than an offence punishable by death) is brought under
s. 618  which provides, in subs. (1), for an appeal by a person convicted
of an indictable offence whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal,
and in subs. (2) for an appeal by a person who is acquitted of an indictable
offence whose conviction, is set aside by the court of appeal. An appeal to
this Court by the Attorney General in respect of an indictable offence is
brought under s. 621  “where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a
conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under section 603  or 604  or
dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph 605(1) (a) or
subsection 605(3) ”. An appeal to this Court under s. 618  or
s. 621  is not an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal. It is an appeal from a judgment by a

[Page 98]

court of appeal affirming or setting aside a
conviction or an acquittal.

The concluding words of subs. (6) “and
sections 601  to 624  apply mutatis mutandis”, which
sections include those which provide for appeals to this Court, are not
sufficient to permit an appeal to this Court on a question of fact. In so far
as this Court is concerned they only mean that ss. 618  to 624  are applicable in
respect of an appeal from the court of appeal in forfeiture proceedings under
s. 160 . I do not construe them as meaning that those sections are to
be applicable to an appeal to this Court from a court of appeal in forfeiture
proceedings under s. 160  with the added proviso that in such appeal the
words “any question of law” wherever they appear in ss. 618  to 624  shall
include “any question of fact”.

For these reasons it is my opinion that the
motion to quash should be granted.

The appellants applied for leave to appeal to
this Court in the event that the motion to quash succeeded. The appellants’
submission is that the failure of the Crown to adduce evidence as to prevailing
community standards of tolerance should have resulted in the dismissal of the
Crown’s case at its conclusion. In essence, the contention is that a court
cannot, in law, make an order of forfeiture under s. 160 (4) unless the
Crown has led evidence as to prevailing community standards of tolerance.

Counsel for the appellants did not cite any
decided case which has so held. In this Court, in Brodie v. The Queen[5], forfeiture proceedings under
s. 150A  of the Criminal Code  (now s. 160 ) were under
consideration and the issue was as to whether the book “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover” was obscene within the meaning of s. 150  (now s. 159 ). The
Crown rested its case on the mere production of the book. Evidence on behalf of
the defence was

[Page 99]

submitted as to its literary merit. There is no
suggestion in that case that the Crown could not establish a case without
calling supporting evidence. Judson J., whose reasons were supported by three
other members of the majority, held only that the defence evidence was
admissible and had assisted him in reaching the conclusion that the book was
not obscene.

In Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd. v.
The Queen[6], this
Court agreed with the reasons of Freedman J.A. (as he then was) who had
dissented in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[7],
at p. 125. In that case also the Crown had relied upon the contents of the
publications themselves as proof of their obscenity. The defence called one
witness to testify as to community standards of morality. Again there was no
suggestion in the judgments rendered that, in law, the Crown had to adduce
evidence of that kind. Freedman J.A. stated that, in determining the issue of
obscenity, contemporary standards of tolerance should be applied, but in
reaching his conclusion on this issue it appears that he did not base it upon
the defence evidence on this point, but upon his own consideration of the
contents of the publications.

In R. v. Great West News Ltd., Mantell and
Mitchell[8],
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba held that the magazines in question were
obscene. The main point raised by the defence was that the Crown must fail
because it had not led evidence as to prevailing community standards. Dickson
J.A. (as he then was), with whom Smith C.J.M. concurred, held (at p. 314)
that such evidence is admissible but not essential. Freedman J.A., the other
member of the Court, while he wrote separate reasons, which did not deal with
this point, concurred in the dismissal of the defendants’ appeal.

[Page 100]

Apart from the merits of the point raised by the
appellants, I do not think that it arises in the present case. The appellants
raised this issue at the conclusion of the Crown’s case on a motion for
dismissal, but, when that motion was refused, the appellants did not rest their
case upon this point, but, instead, elected to call evidence. The Crown then
called in rebuttal an administrative officer of the Department of Culture,
Youth & Recreation, who was the secretary of the Advisory Board on Objectionable
Publications in Alberta. He gave evidence that such Board had considered the
publication in question along with other issues of the same work and had found
them to be objectionable.

In the result, the trial judge did have before
him evidence from both sides respecting the matter of community standards to
assist in reaching his conclusion.

I would dismiss the application for leave to
appeal.

appeal dismissed, LASKIN C.J. and SPENCE J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Theft—Indictment—Charge
alleging ownership in “Westwood Jewellers Limited”—Evidence establishing owner
as individual carrying on business under name of “Westwood Jewellers”—Whether
ground for acquittal.

The appellants were charged with stealing two
diamond rings, the property of Westwood Jewellers Limited. The evidence
established that the store from which the rings were taken was known as
“Westwood Jewellers”, owned and managed by a Mr. Nuytten. At the
conclusion of the Crown’s case, the defence moved for dismissal of the charge
on the submission that the Crown had failed to lead evidence of ownership of
the rings in Westwood Jewellers Limited, as charged in the indictment.
The judge entered an acquittal on the ground that the Crown had charged
ownership in West-wood Jewellers Limited and proven ownership in
Mr. Nuytten. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and
convicted the two accused. Appeals by the accused were then brought to this
Court.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ.: If the owner of an object allegedly stolen is
mentioned in an indictment and if his ownership is not proven and there are no
other circumstances to indicate to the accused the true nature of the charge,
an acquittal should be entered. However, when, as in the present case, there
cannot be any possibility for the accused to fail to identify the transaction
about which they are charged, there is no reason to discharge the accused for
the sole reason that the owner mentioned in the indictment has not been
mentioned in the evidence.

Per Dickson
and Beetz JJ.: On a charge of theft, save in exceptional circumstances as, for
example, when theft can be inferred from the suspicious circumstances of the

[Page 21]

accused’s possession, an allegation of
ownership is not mere surplusage. If such an allegation is contained in an
indictment and not proven, the charge must be dismissed.

The present case fell within the narrow
compass of whether it was fatal to the position of the Crown to allege
ownership in X Company Limited and prove ownership in X Company. On a charge of
theft the identity of the owner of the property alleged to have been stolen is
sufficiently established, in instances in which the owner is named in the
indictment, when, as in this case, (i) the evidence adduced by the Crown
reasonably identifies the owner with the person named in the indictment as
owner, and (ii) it is clear that failure to prove the identity of the owner
with greater precision has not misled or prejudiced the accused in preparation
or presentation of the defence.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1], allowing the
Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the accused, by Hewak Co. Ct. J., on a
charge of theft. Appeals dismissed.

P. Schulman, for the appellants.

J. Guy, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—The appellants were indicted as
follows:

That the said Richard William Wolski, and
Robert Gary Little, on or about the 22nd day of July in the year of our Lord
one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two, at or near the City of Winnipeg in
the Eastern Judicial District in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully

[Page 22]

steal two diamond rings to a total value
exceeding two hundred dollars, the property of Westwood Jewellers Limited
situate at 3298 Portage Avenue
in the aforesaid City of Winnipeg and did thereby commit theft.

At the conclusion of the evidence presented by
the Crown, the accused moved for a dismissal on the ground that there was no
evidence to show that Westwood Jewellers Limited was the owner of the diamond
rings mentioned in the indictment. Hewak Co. Ct. J., after a full review of the
authorities, found himself “compelled to discharge the accused”.

The trial judge had posed the problem in the
following terms:

I am satisfied on the totality of the
evidence before me that Little and Wolski not only knew one another but had
entered the premises of Westwood Jewellers Limited for the purpose of
committing a theft. I am satisfied that the accused Little acted as a decoy
while Wolski made his way to the jewel case and removed the rings from the case
after which time both accused fled the scene.

The only question that must be resolved is
the question of the ownership specified in the indictment.

To resolve the question, he sought guidance in a
principle which he expressed in the following terms:

While it is well-settled law that proof of
ownership can be proven not only by direct evidence but by circumstantial
evidence, the fact remains that there must be evidence proving ownership in the
person alleged to be the owner in the indictment.

In that light, he looked at the evidence which
contains, amongst others, the following:

Q. I understand, Mr. Nuytten, you are
the manager of Westwood Jewellers, located at 3298 Portage Avenue, in the City
of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Were you the owner and manager of
Westwood Jewellers on July 22nd, 1972?

A. Yes, I was. 

and he concluded:

[Page 23]

Here, however, Westwood Jewellers Limited
was specified as the owner in the indictment whereas the evidence established
Nuytten as the owner. Nuytten and West‑wood Jewellers Limited, in law,
are two separate and distinct individuals.

On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal
came to the conclusion that a point of law existed enabling a Crown appeal to
be taken, and had this to say on the substance:

No one, throughout the case, referred to
the entity of “Westwood Jewellers Limited” but there is no question that the
premises where the offence was alleged to have taken place were called
“Westwood Jewellers”, that the premises were situate at 3298 Portage Avenue, in
Winnipeg, and that the rings were stolen from those premises.

Matas J., speaking for the Court, re-examined
all the relevant cases and concluded:

In the case at bar, use of the corporate
name in the indictment did not mislead in any way: the accused had sufficient
knowledge, by the indictment, of the circumstances of the offence; they had
reasonable information with respect to the act alleged in the indictment
sufficient to identify the transaction. There was no prejudice to them. This is
not a case of a charge against a company where status and exact terminology
would be an important detail. (cf. R. v. Pelissiers Limited, [1926] 1
W.W.R. 189 (Man. C.A.).)

With respect, acquittal, under the
circumstances of the case, would be in direct contravention of the plain words
of s. 512(g) of the Code and would negate the clear
intention of Parliament.

I agree with this result.

The crime of theft is defined in s. 283  of
the Criminal Code  and I quote the relevant paragraph:

283. (1)
Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or
fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of
another person, anything whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

(a) to deprive, temporarily
or absolutely, the owner of it or a person who has a special property or
interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it,

[Page 24]

To be fair to the accused and to bring home to
him the offence with which he is charged, the Code has enacted various
provisions as to counts and indictments of which the following should be quoted
here:

510. (2) The
statement referred to in subsection (1) may be

(a) in popular language
without technical averments or allegations of matters that are not essential to
be proved,

(b) in the words of the
enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an
indictable offence, or

(c) in words that are
sufficient to give to the accused notice of the offence with which he is
charged.

(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail
of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable
information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to
identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or insuficiency
of details does not vitiate the count.

512. No
count in an indictment is insufficient by reason of the absence of details
where, in the opinion of the court, the count otherwise fulfils the
requirements of section 510 and, without restricting the generality of the
foregoing, no count in an indictment is insufficient by reason only that

(b) it does not name the
person who owns or has a special property or interest in property mentioned in
the count,

(g) it does not name or
describe with precision any person, place or thing, or

The purpose of these provisions is clearly, on
the one hand, to avoid undue technicalities and, on the other hand, to permit
the accused to know exactly the transaction which is the basis of the charge.
On this latter aspect of the matter, Rinfret J., as he was then, speaking for
the Court, had this to say in Brodie v. The King[2], at p. 194:

Those are the very words of the section;
and they were put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its
main objects being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that
the indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or
acts with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of

[Page 25]

the particular offence alleged against him
and prepare his defence accordingly.

Once this aspect has been covered and the
accused has been assured of a fair trial because he has been made aware of the
substance of the charge and of the circumstances of the transaction, the other
aspect must be looked at, namely the desire of Parliament not to burden the
administration of justice with a narrow, technical and legalistic approach. On
this point, it is worth comparing the wording of s. 283 , para. 1, and
that of s. 512, para. (b); both these sections refer to
the owner of a thing or to a person having a special property or interest
therein.

If, however, the name of the alleged owner is
mentioned in the indictment, is it correct to state that, unless ownership in
that person is proven by the Crown, the charge must be dismissed? I am not
ready to accept that this is a true statement of the law.

All of the relevant cases having been discussed
in the Courts below, it would serve no useful purpose to review them here.
However, it should be noted that many of these cases rely on the Australian
case of Trainer v. The King[3], where
Griffith C.J. expressed the following view:

The Law of England, and it is the same
here, requires the ownership of the property to be laid in the indictment and
proved. There is ample power of amendment, but in the absence of amendment it
must be proved as laid.

In my opinion, this view does not take into
consideration what is now ss. 510  and 512  of the Criminal Code , sections which,
in substance, have been in existence since 1892 and which do create in Canada a situation different from that
summarized by Griffith C.J. above. This situation, of course, brings to mind
the following note of caution to be found at the end of the Brodie case,
supra, at p. 199:

[Page 26]

We do not want to part with this appeal,
however, without saying that our decision is strictly limited to the points in
issue. We would not like to be taken as subscribing to certain generalities
contained in some of the judgments to which we have been referred and which
would tend to convey the idea that, notwithstanding the coming into force of
the Criminal Code , the criminal law in this country should continue to be
administered as though there were no Code.

There is no doubt that, if the owner of the
object allegedly stolen is mentioned in the indictment and if his ownership is
not proven and there are no other circumstances to indicate to the accused the
true nature of the charge, an acquittal should be entered. However, when, as in
the present case, there cannot be any possibility for the accused to fail to
identify the transaction about which they are charged, there is no reason to
discharge the accused for the sole reason that the owner mentioned in the
indictment has not been mentioned in the evidence.

In the present case, the following factors have
to be underlined:

(1) the jewellery store where the offence was
alleged to have taken place was situated in the Westwood Shopping Centre;

(2) this store was known, and proven to be so,
as Westwood Jewellers;

(3) the premises were situated at 3298 on Portage Avenue in Winnipeg;

(4) Little gave a statement to the police,
statement which was accepted in evidence, wherein he admitted having been in
Westwood Jewellers at the time of the alleged theft;

(5) Wolski, on his part, although denying to the
police having been inside Westwood Jewellers, was brought by the police to the
Shopping Centre and had his attention directed to West-wood Jewellers.

In my opinion, on the whole of the evidence, it
is clear that the accused have been given sufficient information about the
circumstances of the alleged offence and were at all times in a position to
identify the transaction referred to in the indictment. Accordingly, it is my
view that they have received a fair trial.

[Page 27]

It is obvious from the foregoing that the appeal
by the Crown to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba raised a point of law so there was jurisdiction in that Court.

On the whole, I would confirm the judgment
appealed from and would dispose of the matter in accordance with the order of
the Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Dickson and Beetz JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—This case raises a short but
interesting point as to proof of ownership on a charge of theft. The appellants
were charged with stealing two diamond rings the property of Westwood Jewellers
Limited, situate at 3298 Portage Avenue in the City of Winnipeg. The evidence
established that the store from which the rings were taken was known as
Westwood Jewellers, that it was situate at 3298 Portage Avenue in the City of
Winnipeg and that the owner and manager of Westwood Jewellers on the day of the
alleged offence was a Mr. Nuytten. At the conclusion of the Crown’s case,
the defence moved for dismissal of the charge on the submission that the Crown
had failed to lead evidence of ownership of the rings in West-wood Jewellers Limited,
as charged. On the specific point of ownership, one finds this evidence of
Mr. Nuytten:

Q. I understand, Mr. Nuytten, you are
the manager of Westwood Jewellers, located at 3298 Portage Avenue, in the City
of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Were you the owner and manager of
Westwood Jewellers on July 22nd, 1972?

A. Yes, I was.

Mr. Nuytten was not cross-examined on this
point.

The judge, Hewak Co.Ct.J., said:

As previously stated, in this case the
indictment alleges ownership to be in a corporate entity, Westwood Jewellers
Limited. The evidence, however, establishes that the ownership of the goods is
in a person, i.e., Nuytten. The Court cannot and should not bridge this gap by
inferring that since Nuytten described himself as

[Page 28]

manager and owner of Westwood Jewellers
situated at 3298 Portage Avenue and since the indictment specified the owner to
be Westwood Jewellers Limited situated at 3298 Portage Avenue, the stolen
property in question really belonged to Westwood Jewellers Limited and not to
George Nuytten. Such an inference might have been possible had there been some
evidence that Nuytten owned controlling shares in a company known as West-wood
Jewellers Limited and that Westwood Jewellers Limited was carrying on business
under the firm name and style of Westwood Jewellers. In the absence of such
evidence, however, it is as reasonable to infer that Nuytten, in his personal
capacity, was carrying on business under the firm name and style of Westwood
Jewellers at that address rather than the limited company.

The judge entered an acquittal on the ground the
Crown had charged ownership in Westwood Jewellers Limited and proven ownership
in Mr. Nuytten. He applied such cases as R. v. Carswell[4]; R. v. Cassils[5]; and R. v. Scott[6], all decisions of the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which support the proposition that if A is
named as owner of property alleged to have been stolen the Crown cannot succeed
if it is established in evidence that B is in fact the owner. The judge would
seem to have been under the impression that the Crown had alleged ownership in
one person and had proven ownership in another person. With respect, I do not
think that is what occurred in this case. The charge alleged ownership in
Westwood Jewellers Limited; the evidence established that the owner was
Westwood Jewellers, or more precisely, Nuytten carrying on business under the
firm name and style of Westwood Jewellers. The question which emerges,
therefore, is whether failure of the Crown to prove “Limited” results in an
acquittal. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba answered this question in the
negative, I think correctly.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
prepared by my brother de Grandpré and I agree with him that these appeals must
fail. I regret, however, I am unable to agree with him that if the

[Page 29]

name of an alleged owner is stated in an
indictment and ownership in that person is not proven by the Crown, the charge
will none the less stand if there is no possibility for the accused to fail to
identify the transaction referred to. In my opinion, save in exceptional
circumstances as, for example, when theft can be inferred from the suspicious
circumstances of the accused’s possession, an allegation of ownership is not
mere surplusage. There are many authorities which support the proposition that
if such an allegation is contained in an indictment and not proven, the charge
must be dismissed. See, for example, R. v. Meloche[7], in which Schroeder J.A., at
p. 189, said:

It is well settled that on a charge of
theft the Crown is required to prove ownership of the thing alleged to have
been stolen in some person other than the accused. In a case such as the
present, where the Crown names a person in the indictment as owner, it must
prove that person’s ownership and no other person’s: R. v. Carswell (1916),
26 C.C.C. 288, 29 D.L.R. 589, 10 Alta. L.R. 76; R. v. Cassils, 57 C.C.C.
366, 26 Alta. L.R. 180, [1932] 1 W.W.R. 572; R. v. Bagshaw (not yet
reported) [since reported [1970] 3 O.R. 3, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 193, 10 C.R.N.S.
245], decided by this Court on February 25, 1970.

Nor can I agree with my brother de Grandpré that
this is a case in which the name of the alleged owner is mentioned in the
indictment and the Crown has failed to mention that owner in the evidence. It
seems to me that the case falls within the narrower compass to which I have
referred, namely whether it is fatal to the position of the Crown to allege
ownership in X Company Limited and prove ownership in X Company. The question
is one of sufficiency of proof, not absence of proof, of, in this case, an
essential ingredient of the charge. It should also be observed that we are not
here concerned with an attack upon the indictment, the sufficiency of which is
conceded by counsel for the appellants.

The first of the authorities to which I would

[Page 30]

refer is R. v. Sheppard[8], decided by the Ontario Court of
Appeal, in which the charge was for alteration of a cheque and named W.J.
Lintell and Sons, whereas in fact the cheque was that of W.J. Lintell & Sons
Ltd. The facts were the converse of the present case. Roach J.A., delivering
the judgment of the Court, made this comment, p. 302:

Even under the old common law a person
might be described by his or her real name or that by which he or she was
usually known.

Here in Toronto if one is heard to speak of
“The T. Eaton Company”, is any doubt left in the mind of the listener as to
what firm is meant? The same applies when people speak of “Simpsons” or
“Ryrie-Birks”.

In R. v. Meloche, supra, the charge was one
of theft from Steinberg’s Miracle Mart. In dismissing the charge, the
Provincial Court judge said there was reasonable doubt in his mind as to
whether Steinberg’s Miracle Mart had capacity to own anything. The Ontario
Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal. Schroeder J.A. said, p. 192:

The Crown having made out a prima facie case
against the accused by establishing de facto possession of the goods in
question in a firm known to the public as Steinberg’s Miracle Mart, that firm’s
ownership of the property was never put in issue and the prima facie proof
stands unassailed. If the issue had been raised, it would then have been
incumbent on the Crown to prove the name of the owner of the goods with
precision—a task of very little difficulty.

Meloche s case
was followed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Francis (1970),
unreported, in which the respondent was charged with theft of eight canvas mail
bags containing money the property of Modern Music Co. Ltd., and acquitted by a
Provincial Court judge at Sault Ste. Marie. On appeal, Gale C.J.O. for the
Court said:

There was evidence to the effect that some
canvas bags containing money were stolen from “Modern Music Company” or “Modern
Music”. However, no witness actually stated that the bags were owned by

[Page 31]

“Modem Music Co. Ltd.”, and hence the
learned judge decided that the charge should be dismissed. We are all of the
view that he was quite wrong in coming to that conclusion, and need only refer
to the provisions of s. 498  of the Criminal Code , and to a recent
judgment of this Court in R. v. Catherine Anne Meloche delivered on June
10, 1970, as yet unreported.

In R. v. Pelletier[9], decided by the Appeal Division of
the New Brunswick Supreme Court, the charge was one of theft of copper wire
from Fraser Companies Limited. Various witnesses referred to the Company as
“Fraser Company”, “Fraser”, “Fraser’s” and “Fraser Pulpmill”. The Court held
this to be adequate evidence of ownership by Fraser Companies Ltd. There was no
necessity to prove the corporate status of the company or that it was in good
standing. In R. v. Emmons[10], Allen
J.A. of the Appellate Division of the Alberta Supreme Court reviewed many of
the authorities. In this case the owner of the stolen goods was described in
the charge as “Taylor Pearson and Carson Electronics Ltd.” The facts
established by the evidence showed there was no such company. The owner of the
stolen property was Taylor Pearson & Carson Ltd. which carried on business
under three “division” names, including that of Taylor Pearson & Carson
Electronics Division. It was argued on the appeal that the true identity and
existence of the alleged owner of the stolen property was not established at
the trial but the Court dismissed the appeal. Finally, I might refer to R.
v. Schemenaur[11], in
which the British Columbia Court of Appeal held there was sufficient
identification of Kelly Douglas & Co. Ltd., owner of the stolen property,
by references to the Kelly Douglas Company or Kelly Douglas.

One can discern throughout these cases support
for the proposition that on a charge of theft the identity of the owner of
property alleged to have been stolen is sufficiently established, in instances
in which the owner is named in the indictment, when (i) the evidence adduced by
the Crown rea-

[Page 32]

sonably identifies the owner with the person
named in the indictment as owner, and (ii) it is clear that failure to prove
the identity of the owner with greater precision has not misled or prejudiced
the accused in preparation or presentation of his defence. In my view the
evidence in this case reasonably identified the owner of the stolen diamond
rings with the person named in the indictment as owner, and the accused were in
no way misled or prejudiced in their defence by failure to prove identity with
greater precision.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeals.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Prolonged
record of offences against property—No crimes of violence involved—Whether
expedient for protection of public to impose sentence of preventive
detention—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 688.

The appellant appealed to this Court from a
majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing his
appeal from a sentence of preventive detention, imposed on May 22, 1973,
pursuant to s. 688  of the Criminal Code , in lieu of a sentence of
two years imposed on May 11, 1971, following conviction on a charge of breaking
and entering and theft of automobile keys. The appellant was 44 years of age at
the time the habitual criminal proceedings were taken, and since 1948 he had
been convicted of 28 criminal offences. These involved crimes against property
and did not involve violence. The majority of the convictions related in some
manner to automobiles.

In 1968, on his 24th conviction, habitual
criminal proceedings were commenced against the appellant. The magistrate found
him to be an habitual criminal but did not find that it was expedient for the
protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention. The magistrate
dismissed the application. Subsequent to those proceedings, the appellant was
convicted of possession of a stolen vehicle and still later of three further
automobile-related offences.

Held (Martland
and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the case remitted
to the Court of Appeal to pass sentence in respect of the substantive offence.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: Habitual
criminal legislation and preventive detention are primarily designed for the
persistent dangerous criminal and not for those with a prolonged record of
minor offences against property.

[Page 40]

The dominant purpose is to protect the public
when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for crimes of
violence against the person, and there is a real and present danger to life or
limb. That is not to say that crimes against property can never be cause for
the invocation of preventive detention legislation.

The appellant’s irrational, senseless conduct
was no doubt of annoyance to everyone, incommoding owners and vexing
authorities, but it partook more of the quality of a nuisance than of a menace.
The appellant was a bane rather than a danger to society.

Per Martland
and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The special feature about this case
was the finding, in 1968, that the appellant was an habitual criminal,
although, at that time, it was not considered expedient to impose preventive
detention. Notwithstanding this warning, the appellant continued to commit
crimes, and his conduct was such as could not be dismissed as being merely a
nuisance.

This was a case of an incorrigible criminal,
whose criminal activities will continue indefinitely if he is not detained. If
s. 688 can be applied so as to protect the public from continued crimes
against property, and there is nothing in the section which says that it
cannot, then, this was clearly a case for its application, as found by the
Courts below.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], dismissing the
appellant’s appeal from a sentence of preventive detention pursuant to
s. 688  of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed, Martland and Ritchie
JJ. dissenting.

J.B. Clarke, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

[Page 41]

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This is an appeal from a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Robertson and Bull JJ.A.)
dismissing an appeal by Robert William Hatchwell from a sentence of preventive
detention imposed by Judge Johnson on May 22, 1973, at the City of Vancouver,
pursuant to s. 688  of the Criminal Code , in lieu of a sentence of
two years imposed by Judge Anderson on May 11, 1971, following conviction of
the appellant on a charge of breaking and entering and theft of automobile
keys. McFarlane J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and, exercising
the power conferred on the Court by Code s. 695(3), quashed the
sentence of preventive detention and imposed a sentence of six years’
imprisonment consecutive in lieu of the two-year sentence.

From the admissions of facts it appears the
appellant was 44 years of age at the time the habitual criminal proceedings
were taken, and since 1948 he has been convicted of 28 criminal offences, of
which 22 were related in some manner to automobiles, such as theft of a motor
vehicle, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, breaking and entering to steal
automobile keys and driving offences. The five non-automobile-related offences
are: escaping lawful custody (May 1949); dealing with a forged cheque in the
amount of $176.01 (April 1960); theft of a skill saw (December 1965);
possession of a stolen electric razor and stamps (December 1965); possession of
housebreaking instruments, to wit, a flashlight, pair of gloves and screwdriver
(November 1967).

In 1968, on his 24th conviction, habitual criminal
proceedings were commenced against the appellant. On June 11, 1968, Magistrate
Isman found him to be an habitual criminal but did not

[Page 42]

find that it was expedient for the protection of
the public to sentence him to preventive detention. The magistrate dismissed
the application. Subsequent to those proceedings, the appellant was convicted
in July 1969 of possession of a stolen vehicle and in early 1971 of three
further offences committed during “a single spree” while on a three-day work pass
from custody, namely, possession of a stolen vehicle; break, enter and theft of
automobile keys (the substantive offence giving rise to the habitual criminal
proceedings commenced on July 15, 1971); driving a motor vehicle with more
than 80 mgs. per 100 mls. of alcohol in his blood.

Section 688 of the Code has two arms.
Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence, the Court may,
upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any
other sentence that might be imposed for the offence for which he was
convicted, if (a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal and (b) the
Court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention. There can be no doubt the appellant satisfies the habitual criminal
criteria (s. 688(2)(a)) in that he, since the age of 18 years, on at
least three separate and independent occasions has been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or
more and he is leading persistently a criminal life. That leaves, therefore,
for determination only the question whether the Crown has established, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that because the appellant is an habitual criminal it is
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention.

The broad test to be applied in these cases is
that framed by Cartwright C.J.C., speaking for the majority of the Court, in Mendick
v. The Queen[2], at
p. 872:

[Page 43]

On the whole, I am of opinion that,
although it is impossible to say that the appellant is merely a nuisance, he
does not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public
requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life,
subject only to the provisions of s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and
the Parole Act.

and adopted in somewhat different phraseology by
Martland J., speaking for the Court, in Bingham v. The Queen[3], at p. 373:

“The object of this section is to
protect the public from people who have shown by their history that they are a
menace, not just a nuisance to society, and when this situation is clear, the
question is not one of punishment since that has proven to be a futile
exercise, but rather it is a matter of putting them away, so to speak, for the
protection of the public. In my opinion it is important that the public be
protected from criminals, not only from crimes involving violence against the
person, but as well from crimes against property, which are in themselves very
serious.”

Is Hatchwell a menace to society or just a
nuisance? Should he be confined to prison for the rest of his life, subject
only to annual review of his case by the Parole Board and release from custody
only in the absolute discretion of that Board? These are not easy matters of
decision for one must balance the legitimate right of society to be protected
from criminal depredations and the right of the man to freedom after serving
the sentence imposed on him for the substantive offence which he committed.
Habitual criminal legislation and preventive detention are primarily designed
for the persistent dangerous criminal and not for those with a prolonged record
of minor offences against property. The dominant purpose is to protect the
public when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for
crimes of violence against the person, and there is a real and present danger
to life or limb. In those cases the way is clear and the word “menace” seems
particularly apt and significant. That is not to say that crimes against
property can never be cause for the invocation of preventive detention
legislation, for the legislation contains no such exclusion and society is
undoubtedly entitled to reasonable protection against crimes involving

[Page 44]

loss of or damage to property. It would seem to
me, however, that when one is dealing with crime of this type, seeking to
distinguish between that which is menace and that which is nuisance, there is
greater opportunity and indeed necessity to assess carefully the true nature
and gravity of the potential threat. For it is manifest that some crimes
affecting property are very serious and others are not.

There are no crimes of violence in the record of
the appellant. This is not conclusive but it is important. There is no evidence
of association with known criminals during periods of freedom from custody.
During these sometimes brief periods, the appellant has been gainfully
employed. One former employer spoke in laudatory terms of his ability and
attitude as a worker and expressed willingness to re-employ him at any time.
The appellant is emotionally unstable and immature. The great majority of
crimes committed by him appear to proceed from an uncontrolled aberration or
fixation about cars. They are not motivated by gain nor by any destructive
urge, for in every case, according to the evidence, the property taken was
recovered undamaged. The appellant simply drives the stolen vehicles, until
such time as he is apprehended. Of late he has shown a preference for large
tractor-trailer units. This sort of irrational, senseless conduct is no doubt
of annoyance to everyone, incommoding owners and vexing authorities, but it
would seem to me that it partakes more of the quality of a nuisance than of a
menace. Hatchwell is a bane rather than a danger to society.

Other cases afford little assistance in making
what is essentially a factual decision, but with that reservation, I would be
of the view that this case is more that of Mendick in which the sentence
of preventive detention was set aside than of Bingham in which the
sentence of preventive detention was upheld. In Mendick, 47 convictions
were set

[Page 45]

out in the notice of application, of which 27
related to the unlawful possession and use of gasoline credit cards. Of the
remaining offences, eight related to the theft or unlawful possession and use
of automobiles. In 1957 Mendick was convicted of armed robbery, in 1965 he was
convicted of theft of money and there were other offences. Upon this record,
which would seem to have been at least as formidable as that of the present
appellant, an appeal to this Court against a sentence of preventive detention
was successful.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence
of preventive detention and remit the case to the Court of Appeal to pass
sentence in respect of the substantive offence, after receiving any submissions
as to sentence by or on behalf of the appellant.

The judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—This appeal is
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which, by a
majority, confirmed the judgment at trial imposing sentence of preventive
detention on the appellant. In my opinion, the facts of this case do not justify
this Court in disturbing the conclusion reached by the trial judge and
confirmed by the Court of Appeal that, the appellant being an habitual
criminal, it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention.

The appellant has, since 1948, been convicted of
28 Criminal offences. These involved crimes against property and did not
involve violence. On the other hand, the majority of these crimes did not
involve petty thefts. A number of the convictions were in relation to thefts of
automobiles, which were not limited only to passenger vehicles, but included
thefts of trucks.

In 1968, upon his 24th conviction, proceedings
were taken for preventive detention. At that time, on June 11, the magistrate
found that the appellant was an habitual criminal, but did not go on to

[Page 46]

find that it was expedient for the protection of
the public to sentence him to preventive detention. The reason for this
decision is suggested by Robertson J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
majority in the Court of Appeal, as follows:

His record over some four and a half years
from 1955 to 1960, during which he was married and lived with his wife, was
clear, and during that time he was gainfully employed; he was also gainfully
employed during a number of his short periods of freedom from gaol. The only
substantial one of those periods was one of a year and a half following his
release from the penitentiary in May 1964. In the 1968 proceedings he was found
to be an habitual criminal, but the magistrate was not of the opinion that it
was expedient to sentence him to preventive detention and did not do so. No
doubt the magistrate was impressed by the absence of convictions during the
four-and-a-half year and one-and-a-half year periods mentioned and by the work
record that I have mentioned, and hoped that the shock of being found to be an
habitual criminal would bring the appellant up short and deter him from further
crime.

Robertson J.A. then goes on to add this:

Unfortunately that hope was not realized.
While the appellant was on parole from the December 1967 conviction, lèss than
a year after being found to be an habitual criminal, he had in his possession a
stolen tractor; and he was convicted of this offence in July 1969. In
April 1971 the appellant was out on a three-day pass from the Agassiz
Correctional Work Camp and he used the opportunity to commit three more
offences, of which he was convicted: he broke and entered the premises of a
milling company and stole some automobile keys and money, he was in possession
of a truck belonging to and stolen from the milling company, and he drove the
truck while he had a blood alcohol reading in excess of. 08.

After citing the cases of Mendick v. The
Queen[4], and
Bingham v. The Queen[5], Robertson
J.A. gives reasons for concluding that preventive detention should be imposed:

[Page 47]

Guided by these principles, the question
that I must put to myself in the circumstances of this case is whether the
appellant constitutes so grave a menace to the property of the public as to
require that he be “put away” under s. 688 . My answer must be that he
does, for it is clear on the evidence that the appellant has an uncontrollable
urge to commit crimes which, among other things, involve the deprivation of
others of valuable property, often of a vulnerable nature. Further, while he
has so far committed no crimes involving violence against the persons of
others, the types of crimes he has committed often do result in violence or
injury to the persons of others. The appellant’s history makes it all too clear
that he cannot be at liberty for any substantial time without committing
another crime; his capability to work gainfully is exercised only until his
compulsion to revert to crime asserts itself.

In 1968, the medical testimony held but
little hope, and what has transpired since has confirmed that prognosis. He is
far from being merely a nuisance. A personable thief, with periods of gainful
work, who unerringly and surely reverts to crime against property is, in my
view, a grave menace to the public and one from whom the public is entitled to
protection. Years in gaol have failed to stop his depredations when free, and I
consider he should be put away permanently, subject only to release into
society under parole procedures and safeguards.

I have little difficulty in concluding
beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the protection of the
public that this habitual criminal be subjected to preventive detention. On the
facts of this case, in my opinion, the learned provincial court judge was
warranted in having that opinion and imposing that sentence.

What I shall next mention has weighed
heavily with me in reaching that conclusion. On the hearing in the current
proceedings in May 1973 the appellant had read in the evidence given on the
hearing in 1968 by a psychiatrist (whose evidence was not too helpful to the
appellant and held out no particular hope for a change in conduct) and by a
Mr. Dickey, his friend and employer. The appellant called no evidence and
did not himself give evidence and there is no record of any work since 1968.
All we know is that the appellant was released on parole about a year after the
1968 hearing and within three months was convicted of the possession of stolen
property and sentenced to a consecutive term of two years; and that then, when
released on a three-day pass

[Page 48]

less than two years later, he committed the
several offences that I have already described.

I agree with Robertson J.A. that the special
feature about the present case is the finding, in 1968, that the appellant was
an habitual criminal, although, at that time, it was not considered expedient
to impose preventive detention. Notwithstanding this warning, the appellant
continued to commit crimes, thereby showing that the opinion of
Dr. Lipinski, given at the 1968 hearing, that it was unlikely that the
appellant’s criminal pattern would change, was correct. One of the crimes
committed after that hearing was breaking and entering to obtain the keys of a
three-ton Ford van which he then operated in New
 Westminster while he had a blood alcohol reading well
in excess of. 08. In my opinion, conduct such as this cannot be dismissed as
being merely a nuisance.

In the present case we have an incorrigible
criminal, whose criminal activities will continue indefinitely if he is not
detained. If s. 688 can be applied so as to protect the public from
continued crimes against property, and I find nothing in the section which
says that it cannot, then, in my opinion, this is clearly a case for its
application, as found by the Courts below. I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Plea of guilty at trial—Duty of
trial judge—Legal aid duty counsel—Discretion of trial judge to hear evidence.

The appellant pleaded guilty to several
charges of false pretences, a charge of fraud, and a charge of break, enter and
theft. He was represented by legal aid counsel. After plea had been entered,
the facts giving rise to each charge were related by a police officer and the
appellant was afforded an opportunity to explain. The appellant was convicted.
No request for the change of plea was made during the hearing. The appellant
appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal as to one of the
charges and dismissed the appeal as to all other charges. The issue is whether,
having heard the explanation, the judge erred in failing to strike the guilty
pleas and direct trial on the charges.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Judson,
Ritchie and Dickson JJ.: There are two stages in the proceedings in which a
trial judge has a discretion so far as accepting a plea of guilty is concerned,
first, when the charge is read and the plea is entered and, second, following
the hearing of evidence, if the judge chooses to hear evidence. A trial judge
is not bound, as a matter of law, in all cases to conduct an inquiry after a
guilty plea has been entered. If however evidence is heard it may indicate that
the accused never intended to admit to a fact which is an essential ingredient
of the offence with which he is charged or that he may have misapprehended the
effect of the guilty plea or never intended to plead guilty at all, in any of
which events the judge may in his discretion direct that a plea of not guilty
be entered or permit the accused to change his plea to not guilty. This
discretion if exercised judicially will not lightly be interfered with. An
appel-

[Page 427]

lant can however later change his plea if he
can satisfy the Appeal Court
that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so.

On reviewing the charges to which the
appellant pleaded guilty neither the facts admitted nor the statements made
following the guilty pleas justify disturbing the exercise of discretion by the
trial judge.

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The issue here and the foundation of the appeal
to the Court of Appeal was whether the trial judge erred in law in permitting
the guilty pleas to stand. The accused did not have counsel until, on his third
appearance in Court and on his trial at that time, duty counsel stood with him.
The Legal Aid Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 239, as amended does not deal in any
detail with duty counsel but the effect of s. 21(b) which
provides for duty counsel is quite different from the central provisions of the
Act which entitle persons charged with indictable offences to apply for legal
aid certificates and to obtain full representation by counsel. The trial Court
was aware that it was a duty counsel who appeared for the accused. The fact
that the trial judge did not inquire if duty counsel had had an opportunity to
consult with the accused and to ascertain the factual bases of the charges and
whether the accused was willing to be represented by him should there be a plea
of guilty was sufficient to require that the convictions be set aside and a new
trial ordered. The duty of a trial judge respecting an inquiry into the facts
on a plea of guilty is to satisfy himself that the accused understands the
nature of the charge and its consequences and is unequivocal in his plea of
guilty but this must be complemented by the duty of the Crown to adduce facts
which, taken to be true, support the charge and conviction. In the present case
on the facts narrated by the Crown there was sufficient doubt on the elements
of the offence to warrant striking the plea.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an
appeal from conviction on several charges of fraud and of breaking, entering
and theft, appeal dismissed, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

E.L. Schofield, for the appellant.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie and Dickson JJ.
was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant pleaded guilty before a
Provincial Court Judge to several charges of false pretences, a charge of
fraud, and a charge of break, enter and theft. The appellant was represented by
legal aid counsel. After plea had been entered, the facts giving rise to each
of the charges were related by a police officer and the appellant was afforded
an opportunity to explain. The issue in this appeal is whether, having heard
the explanation, the judge erred in failing to strike the guilty pleas and
direct trial upon the charges. No request for a change of plea was made during
the hearing.

The judge accepted the guilty pleas on all
charges and sentenced the appellant to three months on the charge of break,
enter and theft. On all of the other charges, the appellant was sentenced to
one year probation with suspended sentence and ordered to make restitution. The
appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal as to one of the charges and dismissed the appeal as to all other
charges.

There are two stages in the proceedings in
which, so far as accepting a plea of guilty is concerned, the discretion of the
trial judge comes into play: first, when the charge is read to the accused and
a plea of guilty is entered, and, second, following the hearing of evidence, if
the judge chooses to hear evidence. When a

[Page 429]

plea of guilty is entered by the accused or
someone on his behalf, the trial judge may or may not accept that plea. This
Court has decided in Brosseau v. The Queen[1], that a trial judge is not bound, as
a matter of law, in all cases to conduct an inquiry after a guilty plea has
been entered. In that case the accused was an Indian with a Grade II education.
He was charged with capital murder to which he originally pleaded not guilty.
Later, after several interviews with counsel, he pleaded guilty to non-capital
murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He later appealed on the ground
that he did not understand that a conviction for non-capital murder entailed a
sentence of life imprisonment and that he had agreed to plead guilty to the
reduced charge because of his fear of hanging. Cartwright C.J. stated (pp.
188-9):

No doubt when a plea of guilty is offered
and there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing,
the judge or magistrate will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does so and
the extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge to which
the accused is pleading.

Cartwright C.J. approved the statement of Sidney
Smith J.A. in Rex v. Milina[2],
and concluded at p. 190:

Failure to make due inquiry may well be a
ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the
plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not
fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the
matter is left in doubt; but in my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in
the case at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of
guilty to non‑capital murder, the trial Judge before accepting it is
bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate the accused.

[Page 430]

If the trial judge chooses to hear evidence, for
the purpose of satisfying himself that the charges are well founded or in order
to have a factual background prior to imposing sentence, the evidence may
indicate the accused never intended to admit to a fact which is an essential
ingredient of the offence with which he is charged or he may have
misapprehended the effect of the guilty plea or never intended to plead guilty
at all, in any of which events the judge may, in his discretion, direct that a
plea of not guilty be entered or permit the accused to withdraw his original
plea and enter a new one.

The discretion exercised by the trial judge is
one which “if exercised judicially, will not be lightly interfered with.” per
Cartwright J. (as he then was) in Thibodeau v. The Queen[3], at p. 654.

Counsel for the Crown submitted that the test to
be applied was that formulated by Avory J. in R. v. Forde[4].

A plea of guilty having been recorded, this
Court can only entertain an appeal against conviction if it appears (1) That
the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge, or did not intend to
admit that he was guilty of it; or (2) That upon the admitted facts he could
not in law have been convicted of the offence charged.

With respect, in my view this defines the rule
too narrowly. I see no reason why the Court’s right to permit a withdrawal of a
plea of guilty should be necessarily limited to the “admitted” facts.
Statements made in the course of the inquiry following a guilty plea may,
although not admitted by the Crown, justify the Court in rejecting the guilty
plea and proceeding to trial.

[Page 431]

This Court in The Queen v. Bamsey[5], at p. 298, held that an accused may
change his plea if he can satisfy the Appeal Court “that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so.” It
would be unwise to attempt to define all that which might be embraced within
the phrase “valid grounds”. I have indicated above some of the circumstances
which might justify the Court in permitting a change of plea. The examples
given are not intended to be exhaustive.

Turning now to the charges to which the
appellant pleaded guilty; those relating to false pretences may be disposed of
without difficulty. They relate to a ring obtained from Henry Birks & Sons
Limited in Oshawa for $150 by
means of a worthless cheque. The ring was subsequently returned to Birks. The
appellant gave no explanation with respect to this charge. Two charges
concerned obtaining merchandise by false pretences from S.S. Kresge Company.
The officer testified that the merchandise had been obtained by N.S.F. cheques.
The appellant explained he knew when he wrote the cheques he did not have
enough money in the bank to cover them. He intended to obtain money from his
aunt and deposit it the next day to cover the cheques. Two other charges
related also to obtaining merchandise by false pretences by N.S.F. cheques. No
explanation was given by the appellant. So far as this group of charges is
concerned, therefore, the position is that the accused pleaded guilty and
either offered no explanation or the explanation that he intended to get money
from his aunt. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to accept or
reject that explanation in deciding whether to strike the pleas of guilty. I
would not disturb the exercise of his discretion.

Another charge which, in my view, can also
readily be disposed of is that the appellant defrauded Texaco Oil Ltd. and
Peter Farano of

[Page 432]

merchandise to the value of $674.30. The officer
testified that the appellant, in about April 1970, was in partnership with one
Rene Cornu. The partnership was dissolved about the end of April and
Mr. Cornu permitted appellant to use Cornu’s vehicle. He furnished the
appellant with a Texaco credit card to provide gas for the car. The period of
the loan was to be for two days only. The car was returned after two days but
Cornu’s attempts to recover the card were unsuccessful. The appellant used the
card to have extensive repairs made to his own motor vehicle. The appellant
said he did not understand the loan of the card to be only for a two day
period, but did not deny the purpose of the loan was limited to the purchase of
gas for the car which Cornu had loaned to him. In my view the judge was correct
in accepting the appellant’s plea of guilty to the charge.

Finally, the appellant was charged with
unlawfully breaking and entering the cottage of Rene Cornu and committing theft
therein. The officer testified that the Ontario Provincial Police found the
appellant and a young woman in Cornu’s cottage and that the appellant had consumed
a quantity of Cornu’s liquor. Mr. Cornu had returned from Cornell University unexpectedly. The
appellant explained to the Court that he and Cornu had previously been business
associates. It had been intended that the cottage would be rented for the summer,
but about seven days before Cornu left for Cornell he and the appellant had an
argument and, in the words of the appellant, “I found out he wasn’t my friend
any more”. Notwithstanding, the appellant, according to his explanation,
went to the cottage for some unexplained reason, found the grass to be waist
high, told Cornu’s girl friend that he was going to cut the grass and make the
cottage liveable. He was at the cottage from a Tuesday morning until Friday
when Cornu returned unexpectedly, accompanied by a police officer. Cornu asked
the appellant what he was doing there, and in the words of the appellant, “I
didn’t know what to say”. In

[Page 433]

explaining how he entered the appellant stated
that the door of the cottage was locked but the lock did not catch. He had had
a key but Cornu had apparently taken it from him.

In considering whether the judge erred in not
striking the plea entered by the appellant, the significance and effect of a
guilty plea must be acknowledged. In pleading guilty an accused admits having
done that with which he is charged. By his plea in the instant case, the
appellant admitted he broke and entered the cottage owned by Cornu and
committed theft therein. His explanation served to confirm the breaking and the
entry; he did not deny the theft. The highest footing upon which the appellant
can put his case is that he thought he had some colour of right to do what he
did. The cottage, however, belonged to Cornu. The earlier business relations
and friendship had ended. Cornu had relieved the appellant of the key to the
cottage. When the appellant was asked to explain his presence to Cornu and the
police officer, he did not know what to say. In these circumstances it is
difficult to discern any foundation upon which a claim to colour of right could
properly rest: see The Queen v. Shymkowich[6].

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—This appeal,
brought here by leave of this Court, raises the questions whether pleas of guilty,
offered by the accused to a number of charges on which he elected to be tried
by a provincial judge, should not have been entered without previous inquiry or
should have been struck out and pleas of not guilty entered. When he appeared
before the provincial judge on February 10, 1971, the accused faced ten
charges, one of fraud, one of break, enter and theft, five of obtaining by
false pre-

[Page 434]

tences, one of theft under $50, one of unlawful
possession and one of careless driving. The theft charge and the possession
charge were related, and the former was dropped as a result of what the accused
said when his plea was taken. He was convicted on all the other charges. On
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, his conviction on the possession charge
was set aside and an acquittal entered, but the appeal was otherwise dismissed.

In this Court, issue was taken with the
convictions on the charge of break, enter and theft, the charge of fraud and
the five charges of obtaining by false pretences. The accused, who was
twenty-one years of age at the time and had no previous criminal record, was
represented by duty counsel present in the Court on February 10, 1971. Counsel for the Crown
very fairly conceded that the trial judge did not deal with the charges seriatim
and ask accused what he had to say as to each, and also that the entire
proceedings were somewhat imperious. After the pleas of guilty, a police
inspector was called by the Crown to give an account of the investigations into
the various matters out of which the charges arose. When he concluded his
narration, Crown counsel appeared to take over, asking the accused whether he
disputed any of those matters, and after receiving the answer “no” asked him
“All right. What’s your version?”. Accused began to speak and was then told by
the trial judge “Come on up here if you wish to say anything”. The record then
states that the accused was called and sworn, and gave testimony which is
reproduced in the transcript. He was questioned by the trial judge only. Crown
counsel then said that he had no questions, and the Court asked duty counsel if
he wished to question the accused and he answered that he had no questions but
wished to make some submissions, and he directed them to sentence.

[Page 435]

This is not a case where the accused sought to
withdraw his pleas of guilty and his request was denied, nor is it a case where
the trial judge gave consideration to a change of plea and in his discretion
refused to allow it. What is alleged here, and what was the foundation of the
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, is that the trial judge erred in law in
permitting the guilty pleas to stand.

The accused did not have counsel until, on his
third appearance in Court and on his trial at that time, duty counsel stood with
him. The record does not show when the duty counsel first spoke to the accused
or what opportunity he had to confer with the accused or with Crown counsel on
his behalf. On the careless driving charge, which is not before this Court, it
was duty counsel who answered, when the accused was asked to plead, that the
accused pleads guilty. Two charges of false pretences were then read, and when
asked to plead to them the accused said “I don’t know about one of them.
Guilty, I guess”. To which duty counsel said, “Don’t guess. Don’t do me a
favour”. Accused then said “Guilty”, but after an intervention by Crown
counsel, he said “I want to explain that. There’s an explanation for that”. The
trial judge made a remark and the accused said “Can I say what happened?”. To
which the Court replied “You can have all morning to say what happened”. This
was followed by the Crown counsel asking the accused how he pleads to the two
charges and the accused said “Guilty”.

[Page 436]

During the course of the narration by the police
officer of the facts as he had them respecting the charge of break, enter and
theft, he spoke of a voluntary statement made by the accused whereupon Crown
counsel interrupted to say “We won’t bother going into that. We are agreed that
he did not have anyone’s permission to be there. Go ahead”. There is nothing to
show who was meant by “we”, but if taken literally to refer to an agreement,
rather than being an observation about the conclusion of the prosecuting
authorities from their inquiries, it must be a reference to an agreement with
duty counsel. Not only did the latter remain mute, but the accused, when sworn,
gave an account of the circumstances under which he entered the premises in
question (a cottage owned by a former business partner) and these indicated a
possible defence of colour of right. It is difficult in these circumstances to
hold that the accused was foreclosed by any agreement with his duty counsel, if
indeed he agreed on the accused’s behalf to what Crown counsel said.

I have gone into these matters because, in my
opinion, where an accused is asked, as here, to plead to a succession of
charges, the fact that he is or is not represented by counsel is material to
the duty that lies upon a trial judge in relation to pleas of guilty. On the
record of proceedings in this case, I am of the opinion that even if the
accused had been represented by retained counsel, the trial judge would have
erred in law in failing to enter pleas of not guilty in respect of any charge
where the accused had indicated at the time of plea that he wished to challenge
the charge, or where it later appeared that the facts did not support the
charge and the plea of guilty thereto. This is entirely apart from the prior
obligation that rests upon a trial judge to seek assurance, especially from an
unrepresented accused, that any plea of guilty is voluntary and based on an
appreciation of the nature of the charges and of the consequences of such a
plea. On the foregoing view of the law (and I propose to examine the authorities)
the two questions

[Page 437]

that arise are whether the accused should have
been treated here as if he was represented by retained counsel when it was duty
counsel who appeared with him and, if so, whether the course of proceedings
obliged the trial judge not to enter or to re-open the pleas.

The Legal Aid Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 239, as amended does not deal in any detail with
duty counsel. Section 21(b) provides for the establishment of a
panel of lawyers to act as duty counsel. This is something quite different from
the central provisions of the Act which entitle persons charged with indictable
offences to apply for legal aid certificates and to obtain full representation
by counsel. It is the Regulations under the Act that spell out the functions of
duty counsel. Section 69 of the Regulations (R.R.O. 1970, Reg. 557)
provides:

Where a person has been taken into custody
or summoned and charged with an offence, he may obtain before appearance to the
charge the assistance of duty counsel who shall,

(a) advise him of his rights
and take such steps as the circumstances require to protect his rights,
including representing him on an application for remand or adjournment or for
bail or on the entering of a plea of guilty and making representation with
respect to sentence where a plea of guilty is entered…

I have already stated that the record in the
present case does not show when duty counsel became involved with the accused.
It does, however, indicate that the Court was aware that it was a duty counsel
who appeared for and with the accused. In such a case, I think it mandatory for
the trial judge to inquire if duty counsel has had an opportunity to consult
with the accused and to ascertain the factual bases of the charges, and whether
the accused is willing to

[Page 438]

be represented by him and to have him speak on
his behalf if there should be pleas of guilty on duty counsel’s advice. The
record discloses no such inquiry in the present case.

This, in my view, is itself sufficient to abort
the proceedings and to require that the convictions be set aside and a new
trial ordered. But even on the assumption that the accused was as fully
represented as if he had retained counsel, I am of the opinion, on the second
question posed above, that in the circumstances of the present case the pleas
of guilty should not have been entered. It is convenient to begin my canvass of
the authorities with the well-known statement of Avory J. in R. v. Forde[7]. We are here in the field of
judge-made law alone because the Canadian Criminal Code says nothing
about any procedure to be followed by a trial judge either before accepting or
on accepting or after accepting a plea of guilty. By contrast, Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the United
 States is as follows:

A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty
or, with the consent of the court, nolo contendere. The court may refuse
to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or a plea of nolo
contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining
that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the
charge and the consequences of the plea. If a defendant refuses to plead or if
the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant fails to appear,
the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The court shall not enter a
judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual
basis for the plea.

And in Australia, s.600 of the Criminal Code  of Queensland (there is a similar provision in Western Australia) provides:

If he pleads that he is not guilty, the
Court, upon being satisfied that he duly admitted before the justices that he
was guilty of the offence charged in the

[Page 439]

indictment, is to direct a plea of guilty
to be entered, notwithstanding his plea of not guilty. A plea so entered has
the same effect as if it had been actually pleaded.

If the Court is not so satisfied, or if,
notwithstanding that the accused person pleads that he is guilty, it appears to
the Court upon examination of the depositions of the witnesses that he has not
in fact committed the offence charged in the indictment or any other offence of
which he might have been convicted upon the indictment, the plea of not guilty
is to be entered, and the trial is to proceed as in other cases when that plea
is pleaded.

Under the foregoing respective provisions, the
trial judge is put under a duty to inquire into the propriety of a guilty plea;
the nature of the inquiry is, in the language of the respective provisions,
different under each of them.

R. v. Forde involved
an appeal against conviction on a plea of guilty to a charge of indecent
assault of a girl under age sixteen in an indictment which also charged carnal
knowledge of the same girl. The prosecution elected not to proceed further on
the indictment, and the question on appeal was whether the conviction could
stand if the accused had a complete defence in law and in fact to carnal
knowledge. Addressing himself to the question whether the Court of Criminal
Appeal could entertain the appeal in view of the plea of guilty, Avory J.
stated two propositions (which are in fact three) as follows:

A plea of Guilty having been recorded, this
Court can only entertain an appeal against conviction if it appears (1.) that
the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to
admit he was guilty of it, or (2.) that upon the admitted facts he could not in
law have been convicted of the offence charged.

Under these propositions, an appellate Court
should interfere to set aside a conviction made

[Page 440]

upon a plea of guilty if it be the case that (1)
the accused did not understand the nature of the charge before pleading; or (2)
the accused did not unequivocally plead guilty to the charge as properly
understood; or (3) the accused, on the facts offered in support of the charge,
could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged.

The first two propositions above-noted point to
a duty of the trial judge prior to entering any plea to satisfy himself that
the accused understands the nature of the charge or charges against him and is
unequivocal in offering a plea of guilty to them. The third proposition
involves a different aspect of the matter, relating as it does not to the
nature of the charge or to the unmistakable character of the plea, but rather
to the facts necessary to support a conviction; in short, it relates to the
factual accuracy of the plea and not to its voluntariness and its appreciation.
Moreoever, this third proposition depends on facts being put before the trial
judge following the plea.

A plea of guilty carries an admission that the
accused so pleading has committed the crime charged and a consent to a
conviction being entered without any trial. The accused by such a plea relieves
the Crown of the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, abandons his
non-compellability as a witness and his right to remain silent and surrenders
his right to offer full answer and defence to a charge. It is important,
therefore, that the plea be made voluntarily and upon a full understanding of
the nature of the charge and its consequences and that it be unequivocal. In
these respects, representation by counsel is an important consideration; but
since the plea is that of the accused and not of his counsel, a trial judge
should still satisfy himself of the matters above-mentioned. These do not
immediately engage any factual issues which might, however, arise if the
accused seeks to qualify his guilty plea by explanatory

[Page 441]

comments either at the time it is entered or
later before termination of the proceedings.

The foregoing duty of the trial judge, more or
less in the terms stated, was considered in a series of cases in the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, culminating in R. v. Milina[8] which distinguished, properly in my
view, between the duty as I have put it and the factual underpinning of the
guilty plea. As to the latter, it was the view of the Court (in the words of
Sidney Smith J.A. for the majority, at p. 381) that “when an accused person
pleads guilty it is not the law that the magistrate must go into the facts in
order to satisfy himself that the accused is in fact guilty”. In short, the
view taken in Milina is that although there is an affirmative duty of
the trial judge to satisfy himself that the accused understands the nature of
the charge and its consequences and is unequivocal in his plea of guilty, there
is no such duty to be satisfied of the accuracy of the plea, that is of its
factual support. Since, ordinarily, facts are presented by the Crown with
respect to sentence and there may be a narration as well by the accused, the
question arises whether the trial judge should at that stage be required to
assess conflicting versions in order to decide whether there is a factual basis
for the plea.

If the trial judge has such a duty, as expressed
in Milina, to be satisfied of the accused’s understanding and
appreciation of a plea of guilty, how is it discharged? In Milina itself
the Court said that “the cases will be rare indeed in which a magistrate will
feel himself obliged to make any special inquiry when the accused, as here, is
represented by counsel” (at p. 381 of 86 C.C.C.). I confess to some difficulty
in understanding what is meant by “special inquiry”, but I assume that the
Court did not

[Page 442]

mean dispensation with any inquiry where the
accused has counsel. Whatever the Court in Milina may have meant, this
Court in Brosseau v. The Queen[9],
appears to have said exactly that. In Brosseau, the question of law
upon which leave to appeal was given was as follows:

Did the trial judge err in law in accepting
the appellant’s plea of guilty to non-capital murder without making inquiry to
satisfy himself that the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the
effect of such a plea?

That was a case where the accused, a Cree
Indian, was illiterate (he had a grade 2 education) and was described by his
counsel as a “primitive”. He had been charged with murder but at the opening of
trial the indictment was amended to read “non-capital murder”, and to this the
accused pleaded guilty. In his appeal to the provincial appellate Court he
alleged that he was told by his lawyer that if he did not plead guilty to the
charge he would be sentenced to hang, that he was scared and pleaded guilty
although he was drunk at the time of the offence and drunk when he gave a
statement to the police.

This Court, with Spence J. dissenting, dealt
with the question of law before it in these terms:

Failure to make due inquiry may well be a
ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the
plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not
fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the
matter is left in doubt; but in my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in
the case at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of
guilty to non‑capital murder, the trial Judge before accepting it is
bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate the accused.

In his dissenting reasons, Spence J. adverted to
what was said in Milina that an inquiry may be

[Page 443]

proper where “the accused may be a foreigner, or
illiterate, or the charge is one of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave
nature”; and he concluded that in the case before him the trial judge could not
rely merely on the fact that the accused was represented by counsel as making
any inquiry unnecessary before recording the guilty plea.

If in the Brosseau case no inquiry at all
was required because the accused was represented by counsel, I can think of no
case in which an inquiry would be necessary when there is counsel, unless the
inquiry is precipitated by some remonstrance by the accused at the time he
pleads guilty or later in the proceedings, as, for example, when the Crown
narrates facts relevant to sentence. If the sentence is mandatory, the
narration becomes unnecessary although it was given in Brosseau; and if
there is no narration, then, according to Brosseau, matters so grave as
whether an accused understands the charge against him, and appreciates the
consequences and voluntarily accepts them without trial, require no initiative
of inquiry by the trial judge but are satisfied by the mere presence of counsel
when the accused pleads guilty. This is a situation which, in its generality, I
find unacceptable.

A trial judge cannot, of course, be faulted if
he makes some inquiry, but it is conceivable that he may as a result wrongly
conclude that a plea of guilty should be recorded. If he makes no inquiry at
all, in reliance on the presence of counsel of whatever experience, Brosseau
indicates that an appeal based on facts which might have moved the trial
judge to refuse a plea of guilty, or at least to seek some assurance about the
plea, will fail. What is left then, as a basis for contesting a plea of guilty
by a represented accused, is any remonstrance by the accused or any obvious
factual defect in the Crown’s case in respect of the charge, revealed in the
post-

[Page 444]

plea or post-conviction proceedings before the
trial judge. If a proper inquiry is made, any subsequent remonstrance would
lose its force unless sufficiently weighty to require the trial judge to
reconsider the recorded plea of guilty.

No doubt, a trial judge must have regard to the
factual accuracy of a plea of guilty if facts to underpin it are offered. If
those advanced by the Crown do not sustain the charge and conviction, then the
plea of guilty must be struck out, and there is nothing in Brosseau that
is at odds with this conclusion. I readily agree, moreover, that if the accused
gives a version of the facts, after a narration by the Crown, which is
different from that of the Crown, the trial judge would in effect be holding a
trial after a plea of guilty if he was bound to assess the respective versions
as to their credibility and weight. However, either the narration by the Crown
or by the accused or by both may raise a question not only as to the factual
accuracy of the plea but as well as to the propriety of the plea of guilty in
terms of the accused’s understanding and appreciation of it and its unequivocal
character. This is not a point that was involved in Brosseau. Nor is it
likely to arise very frequently if there is the prior inquiry, to which I have
already referred, when the accused is arraigned.

The duty of the Court respecting an inquiry as
to the “legality” (if I may make such a compendious reference) of the plea of
guilty, must, it seems to me, be complemented by a duty of the Crown to adduce
facts which, taken to be true,

[Page 445]

support the charge and conviction in that aspect
of the matter. It would, in my view, be unsatisfactory to leave to the
discretion of the Crown whether or not to adduce facts supportive of the charge
and conviction. The trial judge could undoubtedly call for them, but the issue
at that stage ought not to involve him in anything more than being satisfied
that what is alleged, taking it to be true, completes the elements of a
conviction on a plea of guilty; and this would be so even where the facts could
have no bearing on sentence because, in the particular case, it is mandatory.

In the present case, I am of the view that on
the facts narrated by the Crown, if believed, there is sufficient doubt on the
elements of the offence of break, enter and theft to warrant the striking of
the plea. The offence requires proof that what was done was knowingly done
without consent of the owner, and I hold that the Crown’s narration does not
carry that element. The situation is different with respect to the other offences
that are involved in this appeal. As to them, if the success of the appeal
depended on alleged shortcomings in the factual accuracy of the plea, they are
not made out.

The overriding concern is, however, the failure
of the trial judge to make any inquiry at all of the accused or his counsel as
to whether he understood the charges, whether he appreciated the consequences
of a plea of guilty to them and whether he was unequivocal in admitting guilt.
On the footing that he was represented by retained counsel, the inquiry could
be short. I see no denigration of the reputation of counsel if such an inquiry
is made. The trial judge should have no difficulty in making the inquiry in a
manner that does not give the impression that counsel is either being bypassed or
that his qualification is challenged. The matter is one of the trial judge, who
is called upon to enter a conviction without a trial, being certain that the

[Page 446]

accused is fully aware of what is involved in,
and is content to stand by, his plea of guilty.

In McCarthy v. United States[10], the Supreme Court of the United States considered Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, quoted above, in a nonconstitutional
context (as contrasted with the later case of Boykin v. Alabama[11] and emphasized its provision that
the accused must be addressed personally, although in that case he was
represented by retained counsel. I do not see this as an invariable requirement
under the procedure that I would envisage here, but it does indicate that the
Rule is not regarded as demeaning counsel’s position. I cannot conceive that
any counsel recognizing the gravity to an accused of a plea of guilty, would be
affronted simply because reassurance is sought by the trial judge.

There is data in the United
 States that shows that “guilty pleas and not trial
serve as the major mechanism for disposition of criminal defendants”: see Note,
The Trial Judge’s Satisfaction as to Voluntariness and Understanding of Guilty
Pleas, [1970] Wash.U.L.Q. 289. We are short of such data here. Statistics Canada does not, or rather does not yet,
keep statistics on the subject. Some attempts on a modest scale have been made
in this country to provide data on guilty pleas. Professor M.L. Friedland in
his book, Detention Before Trial (1965), includes a study of the work of
the Toronto Magistrates’ Courts (as they were then) for the six month period
September 1, 1961 to the end of February, 1962 and this shows that 70 per cent
of the cases involving indictable offences were disposed of on guilty pleas.
Professor John Hogarth in a recent book, Sentencing as a Human Process (1971),
includes a study of seven indictable offences reflected in 2396

[Page 447]

cases, and in these nearly four out of five
offenders pleaded guilty (see p. 270). These are very small samples, and I
refer to them as the merest indicators of a situation which has been more fully
documented in the United States.
I note that in the McCarthy case, the Supreme Court of the United States
stated that in 1968 eighty-six per cent of all convictions in federal district
courts were the result of pleas of guilty or nolo contendere: see 394
U.S. 459, at p. 463, n. 7.

In my opinion, the reasons for having
confirmation of the voluntariness, understanding and appreciation of
consequences where guilty pleas are offered stand above any need of statistical
support that such pleas are the means by which most charges of indictable
offences are disposed of. In the present case, which is one where the trial
judge made no inquiry at all and hence did not record the guilty pleas in the
exercise of any discretion (indeed, there was even no indication of any
discretion on whether there should be an inquiry), I would allow the appeal and
direct a new trial on the charges which were the subjects of the appeal to this
Court. I do not think that this is a case for the application of s. 613 (l)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL

Extradition—Judicial review by Federal
Court—Extradition judge, persona designata—“Federal board, commission or other
tribunal”—“Decision or order”—Standing of demanding State to seek review of
refusal of extradition—Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 10—Extradition Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, ss. 18, 23—Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23,
s. 11.

On an information sworn by an R.C.M.P.
officer, that the respondent had, while on bail on a charge of murder, left the
jurisdiction of Puerto Rico and was in Canada, a warrant was issued for his
apprehension. After an extradition hearing the judge discharged the respondent
holding that there was no probable cause to believe him guilty of the crime
charged, with the added finding that the offence was not of a political
character. Application was made to the Federal Court under s. 28 of the Federal
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 for a review of the order of the extradition
judge. This application was dismissed for want of jurisdiction on the view that
the matter was determined by a decision of this Court on its own jurisdiction.

Held (Abbott,
Judson, Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Fauteux
C.J., Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.: A decision on the construction
of the Supreme Court Act is not determinative of the construction of the
Federal Court Act . The two statutes are not similarly framed and worded
and s. 28  of the Federal Court Act  contemplates a general right of
review of the decisions of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”.
This right of review is applicable to “a decision or order, other than a
decision or order of an administrative nature not required by law to be made on
a judicial or quasi judicial basis”.

[Page 229]

The scope of the new remedy given by the Federal
Court Act  must be ascertained by consideration of the language of the act
which established a new jurisdiction in federal matters while continuing the
jurisdiction formerly exercised by the Exchequer Court of Canada. The Federal
Court is a “superior court” in the sense of a court having supervisory
jurisdiction. This is not limited to civil matters.

An extradition judge should not be considered
as excluded from the definition of “federal board, commission or other
tribunal”. The Federal Court Act  is a self contained code. When the
powers of an extradition commissioner are exercised by a county court judge he
is not acting as a judge appointed under s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act, but
as a persona designata deriving his authority from a special act of
Parliament. This is especially clear since the same powers may be exercised by
commissioners who are not judges.

The refusal to commit by the learned Judge
was a “decision or order”; those words in s. 28(1)  of the Federal Court
Act  have to be given their plain ordinary meaning and s. 18(2)  of the Extradition
Act  provides that “…the judge shall order him to be discharged”.

The demanding state is a “party directly
affected by the decision or order” within the meaning of s. 28(2)  of the Federal
Court Act .

Section 11 of the Interpretation Act is
especially applicable to an enactment establishing a new jurisdiction and a new
remedy.

Per Abbott,
Judson and Laskin JJ., dissenting: Prior to the passing of the Federal
Court Act , 1970, (Can.), c.
1, there was no appeal from or any other review of the discharge of a person in
extradition proceedings. Where an order of committal for extradition was made
against a person, his only remedy was habeas corpus. There is support
for the rejection of the submission that this long standing position has been
abruptly reversed by general words in s. 28(1)  in the scheme of the Federal
Court Act . Undifferentiated references to federal boards, commissions or
other tribunals ought not to be read as capturing extradition matters when such
matters are not expressly mentioned.

[Page 230]

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The position taken by the respondent that the foreign state
has no status to appear on an application for review, if such review were
possible, is soundly taken.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Federal Court
of Appeal[1],
holding that that Court had no jurisdiction. Appeal allowed, Abbott, Judson,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Gordon P. Killeen, Q.C., and Gerald R.
Morin, for the appellant.

Clayton C. Ruby, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

[Page 231]

PIGEON J.—Under date October 22, 1971, an
officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police swore an information stating that
the respondent had committed a murder in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, one
of the territories of the United States of America, that he had been arrested, charged
and released on bail, that he had fled the jurisdiction and that he was
presently in Canada. It was added that the United
 States of America would make a request to the
Government of Canada for the extradition of the fugitive. A warrant of
apprehension was issued by Judge Honeywell, a county court judge acting under
The Extradition Act . After a hearing, the same judge discharged the
respondent, holding that there was not probable cause to believe he was guilty
of the crime charged. In his written reasons he added a finding “that the
offence of murder in this case was not an offence of a political character”.

Subsequently, an application was made to the
Federal Court of Appeal under s. 28  of the Federal Court Act  by
counsel for the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico who had been acting at the hearing under The Extradition Act . On
August 2, 1972, the Federal
Court of Appeal dismissed this application holding that it had no jurisdiction.
This is the judgment under appeal by special leave of this Court.

The reasons for judgment in the Court below rest
exclusively on the view that “the matter is determined by the decision of this
Court in The United States of America v. W.H. Link and H.H. Green[2]. In that case, an application for special
leave to appeal under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act was dismissed
from the bench, the Chief Justice stating:

…that the Members of the Court were
unanimously of the opinion that there was no jurisdiction, as the refusal of
Chief Justice Scott was not a judgment, as defined by s. 2(d)
within the meaning of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

[Page 232]

With respect, I fail to see on what basis a
decision on the construction of the Supreme Court Act could be
determinative of the construction of the Federal Court Act . The two
statutes are not similarly framed and worded. The Supreme Court Act has
always been concerned only with appeals from courts, although appeals from some
boards were exceptionally provided for under the special statute governing each
of those boards. On the contrary, s. 28  of the Federal Court Act  contemplates
a general right of review of the decisions of a “federal board, commission or
other tribunal”, a classification excluding courts (s. 2 ). This right of review
is applicable to “a decision or order, other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis”.

The proper scope of the new remedy must
therefore be ascertained by a consideration of the language used by Parliament
in the context of a statute enacted in 1970 which established a new
jurisdiction in federal matters, while continuing the jurisdiction formerly
exercised by the Exchequer Court of Canada. Prior to that time, it is clear
that supervisory jurisdiction over federal boards was, as a rule, vested in the
superior courts of the provinces (Three Rivers Boatman Ltd. v. Conseil
canadien des Relations ouvrières[3]).

I do not suggest that the concluding words of
s. 3  of the Federal Court Act : “shall continue to be a superior
court of record having civil and criminal jurisdiction” are to be read as
making, in federal matters, the Federal Court a “superior court” within the
same meaning of that expression as applied to the superior courts of the
provinces, that is courts having jurisdiction in all cases not excluded from
their authority or, as Ritchie C J. put it in Valin v. Langlois[4] at p. 19, “Courts, bound to take
cognizance of and execute all laws…”. The Exchequer
 Court was not a “superior court” in that sense. Section
3 

[Page 233]

of the Exchequer Court Act , c. 98,
described it as a “court of record” only. Its inclusion in the definition of
“superior court” in the Judges Act, R.S.C. c. 159, s. 2 would
certainly have no effect on its jurisdiction. The word “continue” in s. 3 
negates any intention to turn it, under its new constitution, into a court of
general jurisdiction in all federal matters. The provisions of s. 26(1)  of
the Federal Court Act  also imply that the Federal Court has jurisdiction
only where provided by the Act or by another federal act, whether referring to
the Court “by its new name or its former name”. In view of all this, it appears
to me that the Federal Court is a “superior court” in the sense of a court
having supervisory jurisdiction. This is a meaning often used, as appears from
the numerous authorities reviewed in Re Macdonald[5] and it is significant that such
jurisdiction is conferred by the Act.

Provisions dealing with jurisdiction are found
under two headings: “JURISDICTION OF TRIAL DIVISION” and “JURISDICTION OF
FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL”. Under the first heading, s. 18 confers to the
Trial Division of the Federal Court supervisory jurisdiction over “any federal
board, commission or other tribunal”. The language used is clearly intended to
transfer this jurisdiction entirely from the superior courts of the provinces
to the Federal Court. Paragraph (a) mentions declaratory relief in
addition to four prerogative writs, and paragraph (b) covers “any
application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated
by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney
General of Canada…”

[Page 234]

However, under the second heading, s. 28  in
effect provides that the supervisory jurisdiction of the Federal Court is
generally to be exercised, not by the Trial Division through the modes of
relief heretofore available, but by means of a new remedy that is newly created
and defined. This new remedy is an application to the Court of Appeal to
“review and set aside a decision or order, other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis”, when the federal board, commission or tribunal

(a) failed to observe a principle of
natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its
jurisdiction;

(b) erred in law in making its
decision or order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record;
or

(c) based its decision or order on
an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or
without regard for the material before it.

I see no reason for reading those provisions as
applicable only in civil matters. They are framed in the most general terms and
they apply to a “superior court of record having civil and criminal
jurisdiction” (s. 3 ). Of course, criminal jurisdiction is generally
exercised by courts, not by “boards, commissions or other tribunals” and,
therefore, relief must still be sought in most cases before superior courts of
criminal jurisdiction in accordance with the principles laid down in Re
Storgoff[6].
However, when the decision to be reviewed in criminal matters was made, not by
a court but by a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”, then, it seems
to me, the clear meaning is that the jurisdiction shall be exercised by the Federal
Court, not by the other superior courts. In fact, the Federal Court has
exercised jurisdiction in criminal matters, not only under s. 28  in the
matter of the request for extradition of Karleton Lewis

[Page 235]

Armstrong[7], but also under
s. 18 in Sedore v. Commissioner of Penitentiaries[8], Lingley v. Hickman[9] and In re Frank David Ellis[10], citing only reported cases that have come
to my attention.

The writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus
mentioned in s. 18  of the Federal Court Act  have always been
available in civil and criminal matters without distinction. They are
enumerated with habeas corpus under the heading “Extraordinary Remedies”
in s. 708  of the Criminal Code  which is in the following terms:

708. This
Part applies to proceedings in criminal matters by way of certiorari, habeas
corpus, mandamus and prohibition.

This wording restricting the application of Part
XXIII to “proceedings in criminal matters” is to be contrasted with
s. 18  of the Federal Court Act  which provides that “The Trial
Division has exclusive original jurisdiction (a) to issue an injunction, writ
of certiorari, writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo
warranto, or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board,
commission or other tribunal;…” The scope of this enactment is limited by
reference to the persons or bodies amenable to it, not as in the Criminal
Code  by reference to the nature of the proceedings before them. To the
extent that those matters are criminal, this involves a transfer to the Federal
Court of the jurisdiction of the superior courts of criminal jurisdiction as
against federal boards, commissions or other tribunals. In civil matters, the
effect of the provision is also to take away the jurisdiction of the superior
courts of the Provinces (Pringle v. Fraser[11]).

[Page 236]

I cannot agree that prior to the enactment of
the Federal Court Act  there was no possible form of review of the
discharge of a person in extradition proceedings. There does not appear to be
any reported case in which such review was sought but, on principle, I fail to
see why a mandamus would not have been available in a situation similar
to that in which this remedy was held available against the judge who had
erroneously quashed the indictment in Kipp v. Attorney General for Ontario[12]. I am not suggesting that this is a
similar case, but Parliament did not only transfer to the Trial Division of the
Federal Court all available remedies against federal boards, commissions and
other tribunals, it also created an extended remedy by way of a general right
of review to be exercised by the Federal Court of Appeal in broadly defined
cases.

It does not appear to me that an extradition
commissioner or judge sitting under the Extradition Act  should be
considered as excluded from the definition of “federal board, commission or
other tribunal” because the Act is a self contained code. Supervisory
jurisdiction is a common law remedy which can only be excluded by explicit
enactment. It is unnecessary to review the cases dealing with privative clauses
which have always held them ineffective as against jurisdictional defects. I
fail to see how this Act could be considered different in that respect from the
other acts governing other federal agencies coming within the definition.

I also fail to see why the fact that habeas
corpus is not mentioned in the Exchequer Court Act  and therefore
remains within the jurisdiction of superior courts of criminal jurisdiction,
would make the new remedy unavailable to the person sought to be extradited. As
Rinfret C.J.

[Page 237]

said In re Brown[13], “habeas corpus is not available to
review the judgment…” It always was subject to special rules. It remains quite
independent of the remedy by certiorari although the two may sometimes
be joined, but not when there exists a right of appeal excluding certiorari.

It is quite true that the superior courts never
had the jurisdiction contemplated in s. 28  of the Federal Court Act , but
this is a new remedy. While, to a certain extent, it is a substitute for
previously existing remedies before other courts, it is obviously much broader
in scope. I can see no reason for restricting the language used because this
alters a situation that has remained unchanged for a long period of time. In Gaynor
and Green v. U.S.A.[14]
Sedgewick J. said (at p. 249):

…It would appear from the perusal of the
criminal law of Canada and of
cognate legislation that the whole policy of Parliament has been to prevent
prolonged litigation particularly in matters of a criminal nature.

Clearly, this cannot be said of present day
legislative policy. There is no necessity to review all the enactments that
have enlarged and extended the right of appeal in criminal cases including the
right of appeal by the Crown and retrials contrary to the common law rule. For
centuries, when a man was discharged on habeas corpus, this was final.
There is now a right of appeal under s. 719.5  of the Criminal Code  enacted
in 1965 (13-14 El. II ch. 53 s. 1).

It seems clear that an extradition commissioner
is a “federal board, commission or other tribunal” because he is a person
exercising jurisdiction or powers “under an Act of the Parliament of Canada”
and is not “appointed under or in accordance with the law of a province or
under s. 96 of the British North America

[Page 238]

Act 1867”.
However, the judge who acted on the information in this case is a county court
judge, which means that he was appointed under s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act.
Does this mean that he is excluded from the definition? In my view, the
exclusion applies to such appointees when they are acting as such, that is when
exercising the jurisdiction of a county court judge. This is not the case under
the Extradition Act . When the powers of an extradition commissioner are
exercised by a county court judge, he is acting as persona designata, that
is a person deriving his authority, not from his appointment, but from a
special act of Parliament.

The criteria defining the situation of a judge
acting as persona designata were considered in numerous cases including C.P.R.
v. Little Seminary of Ste. Thérèse[15];
Gordon v. The City of Toronto[16]; St. Hilaire
v. Lambert[17]; Canadian
Northern Ontario Railway v. Smith[18]; Plante
v. Forest[19]; Heinz
v. Swartz[20]. It is
a well established distinction and under the Extradition Act  it is
especially clear that a judge acts as persona designata because the same
powers may be exercised by commissioners who are not judges.

Respondent contended that the appellant was not
a “party directly affected by the decision or order” relying on the following
words of Lord Coleridge C.H. in R. v. Justices of the County of London[21] at p. 361:

…Is a person who cannot succeed in getting
a conviction against another a person “aggrieved”? He may be annoyed at finding
that what he thought was a breach of law is not a breach of law; but is he
“aggrieved” because some one is held not to have done wrong?…

[Page 239]

I would point out that s. 749 of the old Criminal
Code  read:

749. Unless it is otherwise provided in any
Act under which a conviction takes place or an order is made by a justice for
the payment of money or dismissing an information or complaint, any person who
thinks himself aggrieved by any such conviction or order or dismissal, the
prosecutor or complainant, as well as the defendant, may appeal.

There was a similar wording in s. 761
concerning appeals by way of stated case and in Scullion v. Canadian
Breweries Transport Ltd.[22], this
Court held that the further right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against any
decision given by s. 769A (enacted by 1948 ch. 39 s. 34) availed
to the complainant. Subsection (1) of s. 769A was as follows:

769A. (1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal,
as defined in section one thousand and twelve, against any decision of the
court under the provisions of section seven hundred and fifty-two or section seven
hundred and sixty-five with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof may
be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone.

After quoting it, Kellock J. said:

As the right of appeal thus given is
against any decision made under s. 752 or s. 765, such right
is plainly conferred upon the person who was unsuccessful below, whether he was
a person convicted or the complainant.

In the present case, the result of the decision
reached under the Extradition Act  was to make it impossible for the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to make, through the United States of America, a
demand for the surrender of the respondent so that he could be tried in
accordance with the laws of the State. Throughout the proceedings counsel for
the State has enjoyed the status of counsel for a party in accordance with
established practice and I can see no

[Page 240]

reason for which a foreign state would not have
status for instituting proceedings under s. 28  of the Federal Court Act 
as well as under any other law. Foreign states may not as a rule be
summoned before our courts against their will (La République démocratique du
Congo v. Venne[23]), but
nothing prevents them from appearing as parties before our courts if they so
desire. I can see no basis for the application in such cases of the rule that
criminal prosecutions are instituted in the name of the Crown. This rule
applies to prosecutions for crimes against our laws. In respect of crimes
committed abroad, the proper prosecuting authority is the authority of the
state in which the crime was committed. Of course, the Attorney-general of Canada could act in the present case by
virtue of the express terms of s. 28(2)  of the Federal Court Act , but
this certainly does not exclude the right of each party to make the
application.

it was strenuously contended that the refusal to
commit the respondent was not a decision or order. In this respect, it should
be noted that the learned judge acted under a provision of the Extradition
Act  reading as follows:

18. (2) If
such evidence is not produced, the judge shall order him to be
discharged. (Emphasis added).

No reason was advanced for reading the words
“decision or order” in s. 28(1)  of the Federal Court Act  otherwise
than in their plain ordinary meaning. As previously pointed out, decisions of
this Court in the interpretation of the Supreme Court Act are of no
assistance in that respect. In my view, the rule of s. 11 of the Interpretation
Act is especially applicable to an enactment establishing a new
jurisdiction and a new remedy.

11. Every
enactment shall be deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and
liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its
objects.

[Page 241]

I would allow the appeal and return the case to
the Federal Court of Appeal for hearing on the merits.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson and Laskin J.J.
was delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—It is common
ground in this appeal that prior to the passing of the Federal Court Act , 1970
(Can.), c. 1, effective June 1, 1971, there was no appeal from, or any other
form of review of the discharge of a person in extradition proceedings; he was
only at the risk of a renewal of such proceedings. Again, where an order of
committal for extradition was made against a person, his only remedy was habeas
corpus. This has been the law in Canada for over one hundred years, from
the first enactment of an extradition statute by 1868 (Can.), c. 94, governing
extradition between Canada and the United States, and for the ninety-five year
period since the enactment of the first general extradition statute by 1877
(Can.), c. 25. What falls to be decided here, leave to appeal having been
given, is whether the law has been changed by s. 28(1)  of the Federal
Court Act , at least where the extradition judge has refused to direct that
the subject of the proceedings be held for extradition and has discharged him.

Section 28(1)  reads as follows:

Notwithstanding section 18 or the
provisions of any other Act, the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine
an application to review and set aside a decision or order, other than a
decision or order of an administrative nature not required by law to be made on
a judicial or quasi-judicial basis, made by or in the course of proceedings
before a federal board, commission or other tribunal, upon the ground that the
board, commission or tribunal

(a) failed to observe a principle of
natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its
jurisdiction;

[Page 242]

(b) erred in law in making its decision
or order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or

(c) based its decision or order on
an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or
without regard for the material before it.

Section 2 (g) of the Federal Court Act  defines
“federal board, commission or other tribunal” in these terms:

“federal board, commission or other
tribunal” means any body or any person or persons having, exercising or
purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of
the Parliament of Canada, other than any such body constituted or established
by or under a law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under
or in accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of The
British North America Act, 1867.

In the present case, the respondent was the
subject of a request by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for extradition on a
charge of murder. Puerto Rico was entitled to make that request to the Minister
of Justice under the extradition treaty in force between Canada and the United
States. An information was sworn against the respondent by a member of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a hearing was held before Judge Honeywell
pursuant to the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21. That judge found
the evidence insufficient to warrant holding the respondent for extradition and
he discharged him. On an application by Puerto Rico for review under
s. 28(1) , the Federal Court of Appeal held unanimously[24] relying on a judgment of this Court in U.S.A.
v. Link and Green[25], that
there was no “decision or order” involved in the discharge within the meaning
of those words in s. 28(1) , and it declined jurisdiction. The Federal
Court of Appeal held in a subsequent case, Re State of Wisconsin and

[Page 243]

Armstrong[26], where committal
for extradition was directed, that it did have jurisdiction to entertain an
application for review at the suit of the detainee, and it subsequently
dismissed his application on the merits in a judgment delivered on January 5,
1973. This Court refused leave to appeal on March 5, 1973, but, of course, no
interference can be drawn that the refusal implied approval of the taking of
jurisdiction by the Federal Court of Appeal.

I do not think that U.S.A. v. Link and Green,
supra was determinative for the Federal Court of Appeal of the issue of its
jurisdiction. It was concerned with the jurisdiction of this Court under
s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259 to grant leave
to appeal, and the fact that it arose out of an extradition matter was, in my
view, merely a factor for the Court to consider. Whether U.S.A. v. Link and
Green depended, as counsel for the appellant urged, on the fact that what
was sought to be appealed was not a “judgment of the highest court of final
resort in the Province… in which judgment can be had in the particular case”,
or whether it depended, as counsel for the respondent urged, on the definition
of “judgment” in s. 2(d) of the Supreme Court Act, in either
case I see nothing that bound the Federal Court of Appeal in respect of the
application of s. 28(1) of its constituent Act. I am, however, of the
opinion that a reason going beyond any definition of terms supports the
conclusion of the Federal Court of Appeal in the present case and, further,
that Re State of Wisconsin and Armstrong, supra was wrongly decided by
that Court on the point of jurisdiction.

I take the holding of this Court in Gaynor
and Green v. U.S.A.[27] to be
that extradition proceedings are proceedings of a criminal character,

[Page 244]

arising as they do out of a criminal charge, and
hence no appeal lay, under the relevant appeal provisions then in force, from
the affirmation of a refusal of prohibition to an extradition commissioner.
This characterization of extradition proceedings is quite plain under the terms
of the Extradition Act  which then, as now, preserved the right to habeas
corpus of a fugitive who had been committed for surrender. Section 23 of
the present Extradition Act  is almost word for word with s. 17 of
the original Act of 1877 and reads as follows:

A fugitive shall not be surrendered until
after the expiration of fifteen days from the date of his committal for
surrender, or, if a writ of habeas corpus is issued, until after the decision
of the court remanding him.

Extradition proceedings involve an intimate
relation between the executive and extradition judges arising out of a treaty
with a foreign country which commits the executive to provide an opportunity to
the foreign state to seek the return of a fugitive to answer there a charge of
a crime covered by the treaty or the return of a fugitive convicted there of an
extradition crime. If a fugitive is committed for extradition the Minister of
Justice must be so notified by the extradition judge (see s. 19 of the
Act) and it is nessary for the foreign state to make a requisition to the
Minister of Justice for the surrender of the fugitive. It is for the Minister
to determine if there should be a surrender, and I doubt whether mandamus would
lie to compel him to that act, even in a situation not falling within ss. 21 
and 22  of the Extradition Act , which forbids surrender in the case of a
crime of a political character, or entitles the Minister on that ground to
refuse it upon his determination either that the offence is of that character
or that is what lies behind the proceedings. Indeed, the Minister, acting under
s. 22 , may discharge the fugitive from custody.

[Page 245]

I have referred to the scheme of the Act (and it
is the same scheme that we have had for some one hundred years) in order to
emphasize the special character of extradition proceedings and the concern
shown for the liberty of persons in Canada as against foreign claims for their
surrender, supported by provisions for habeas corpus in favour of the fugitive
and without rights of appeal or review otherwise. This policy, if I may so call
it, was the subject of comment in Gaynor and Green v. U.S.A. supra where
reference was made to the present s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. S-19 which excludes any appeal to this Court under ss. 36, 38 or 39 in
respect of, inter alia, judgments in a criminal cause or proceedings
arising out of habeas corpus in an extradition matter.

I cannot accept the submission of the appellant
that the policy to which I have referred has been abruptly reversed by general
words in s. 28(1)  when such words have ample subject matter without
construing them to embrace extradition proceedings. There is support for this
opinion in the scheme of the Federal Court Act  and, particularly in the
specification of jurisdiction of the Trial Division and of the Federal Court of
Appeal, and in the interaction of the jurisdiction of each under ss. 18  and
28(1)  to review decisions of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”.

None of the specified classes of jurisdiction
reposed in the Trial Division under the Federal Court Act  deal with
jurisdiction in criminal matters. True enough, the Federal Court (consisting of
two divisions, trial and appeal) is, by s. 3 , declared to be a continuation
of the Exchequer Court of Canada and to continue to be a supe-

[Page 246]

rior court of record having civil and criminal
jurisdiction. This, however, represents merely a capacity to exercise criminal
jurisdiction when conferred. The Exchequer Court of Canada originated as a
statutory court respecting claims by or against the Crown in right of Canada
(see 1875 (Can.), c. 38, and 1887 (Can.), c. 16) with no general common law
jurisdiction and no criminal jurisdiction. It first acquired criminal jurisdiction
in 1960 under amendments to the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 314, made by 1960 (Can.), c. 45, ss. 17 and 19. The conferring of the
particular criminal jurisdiction was accompanied by a provision (which became
s. 46(1) of R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23) that “for the purposes of such
prosecution or other proceedings the Exchequer Court of Canada has all the
powers and jurisdiction of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code  and under this Act”. I refer to the judgment of this Court in The
Queen v. Hemlock Park Co-Operative Farm Ltd.[28], where there is a discussion by Pigeon J.
of certain aspects of this new jurisdiction.

The foregoing provision in the 1960 amendments
to the Combines Investigation Act appears to be the source of the
reference in s. 3  of the Federal Court Act  that the Federal Court
shall continue to be a superior court of record having civil and criminal
jurisdiction. It has, indeed, a very limited character as a court of criminal
jurisdiction. The jurisdiction originally reposed in the Exchequer Court, as
carried into s. 46 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-23, was transferred to the Trial Division of the Federal Court by
R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10, s. 65, item 9, and there was added a provision
for an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, with a further appeal to this
Court. I know of no other jurisdiction of a criminal

[Page 247]

character that has been reposed in the Federal
Court in either of its divisions. Accordingly, I would find it strange that
jurisdiction in extradition matters can be comprehended, by a sidewind so to
speak, within s. 28(1) .

If there is such jurisdiction that has been
conferred in such an exceptional manner, I cannot see any basis for the
distinction that the Federal Court of Appeal has made between review where
there has been a committal and no review where there has been a discharge. If
the whole matter is not there, I would find it difficult to accept a situation
where the half that is there is in respect of a person who has been committed
for extradition. He is already protected by a right to resort to habeas
corpus under s. 23  of the Extradition Act ; and if it cannot be
said (as I think it cannot) that this right is implicitly displaced by
s. 28(1)  of the Federal Court Act  I see no merit in a view that
seeks to provide a somewhat parallel remedy by invocation of very general words
while denying any remedy at all under the same words where there has been a
discharge.

Section 27  of the Federal Court Act  confers
a straight right of appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal from final and
interlocutory judgments of the Trial Division. Applications for review under
s. 28(1) , having regard to the wide grounds of review do not differ
materially from appeals; but the scope of review distinguishes the jurisdiction
of the Federal Court of Appeal over decisions of judicial or quasi-judicial
federal boards, commissions or other tribunals from the prerogative writ
jurisdiction conferred upon the Trial Division by s. 18 . There is, even
apart from the difference in scope of review, the displacing phrase with which
s. 28(1)  begins, namely, “Notwithstanding section 18 or the
provisions of any other Act”, and the displacement of the Trial Division is
emphasized by s.

[Page 248]

28(3). I do not read s. 18 as conferring
jurisdiction upon the Trial Division to interfere by any of the prerogative
writs with decisions in criminal matters; it is aimed at federal administrative
agencies, although without limitation to agencies of a judicial or quasi-judicial
nature. Similarly, having regard to the interaction of ss. 18  and 28(1) , I do
not view s. 28(1)  as involving review of decisions or orders in criminal
matters.

Although issue was taken by counsel for the
respondent with the right of Puerto Rico to apply for review, the contention
being that it was not a “party directly affected” within s. 28(3), I do
not think that a ruling in favour of Puerto Rico’s standing to invoke
s. 28(1)  carries the appellant over the main hurdle to which I have alluded.
Similarly with a holding that an extradition judge comes within the definition
of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”. It is one thing to do what
ss. 18  and 28(1)  have done, that is to transfer out of the provincial superior
courts the jurisdiction that they theretofore had to review decisions of
federal administrative agencies. It is quite another thing to read the
transferring words, merely because of their generality, as endowing the Federal
Court of Appeal with a jurisdiction that the provincial superior courts never
had.

The Extradition Act  has been since its
enactment a self-contained code. There is no common law of extradition as there
is a common law of judicial review of the decisions of administrative agencies.
Hence, undifferentiated references, as in ss. 18  and 28(1) , to federal boards,
commissions or other tribunals ought not to be read as capturing extradition

[Page 249]

matters when there is no express mention thereof
in the definition of such agencies.

For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion
that the Federal Court of Appeal is without jurisdiction to entertain an
application to review either the discharge or the committal of a person in
extradition proceedings taken against him. I would, accordingly, dismiss the
appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity to read the reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin and I agree
with him that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons which he has
given. However, I do not wish to be understood to be of the opinion that the
decision of this Court in Gaynor and Green v. U.S.A.[29] was not, at any rate, a very persuasive
authority to the Federal Court of Appeal that a refusal of a commissioner under
the Extradition Act  to hold an accused for extradition was not a matter
subject to review under the provisions of 28(1) of the Federal Court Act . On
the other hand, I am of the opinion that the decision of this court in the Gaynor
and Green case might well be sound authority for the view that such a
refusal was no more a decision under the provisions of the Federal Court Act 
than it was a judgment under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act.

I am also of the view that the position taken by
the respondent in the present case in this Court that the foreign state has no
status to appear on an application for review, if such review were possible, is
soundly taken and that the applicant for such review should have been either
the informant or more probably the Attorney General for Canada. It is
unnecessary in the present case to base the decision of this Court on that
point and I merely mention it at the present time.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Narcotics—Possession—Apartment
door forced open by police after being shut by accused—Accused standing in
livingroom—Smell of hashish—Another person found in bathroom attempting to
dispose of drugs—Plastic straw found to contain residue of hashish—Inevitable
and overwhelming conclusion that other person had possession of drugs with
consent and knowledge of accused.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba setting aside
acquittals of the accused on charges of (1) possession of cannabis resin for
the purpose of trafficking and (2) unlawful possession of LSD. Appeal
dismissed.

M. Kaufman, for the appellant.

S.F. Sommerfeld, Q.C., and J.E. Hodges,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.—The accused was charged on two counts:
first, possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and second,
unlawful possession of a restricted drug, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide. He was
acquitted at trial on both counts. The Manitoba Court of Appeal unanimously set
aside these acquittals, made a finding of possession on each count and remitted
for trial the issue whether the possession of cannabis resin was for the
purpose of trafficking, in accordance with s. 8 of the Narcotics
Control Act.

These are the facts on which the charges were
based. Shortly after midnight January 18, 1970,

[Page 122]

the police went to the apartment of the accused.
They knocked on the door and after a few moments’ delay, the door was opened by
the accused to the extent of the night chain. He was then informed that the
callers were police and was requested to open the door. He slammed the door
shut. The police again identified themselves, told the accused that they had a
warrant and after a very short wait, forced open the door, which was still on
the chain. When the police entered the suite the accused was standing in the
livingroom near the door. No one else was in that area. They heard the toilet
being flushed in the bathroom. The door to the bathroom was locked. It was
forced open and the police found one Robert Pike, who lived at another address,
on his knees with his hands in the toilet, attempting to force a plastic bag
down it. They seized this bag and the contents were later analysed and found to
contain cannabis resin (hashish) and Lysergic Acid Diethylamide. When he was
shown the contents of the plastic bag, the accused said that it was the first
time that he has seen it, that he guessed it belonged to Pike, and that his
roommate Desjardins knew nothing about it. In the bedroom of the suite the
police found one Ronald Desjardins, who was in bed and apparently asleep.

A further search was made of the suite, and
behind the chesterfield in the livingroom was found a plastic straw which, on
analysis, was found to contain a residue of hashish. The evidence of one of the
detectives was that when he entered the suite, there was a smell of hashish in
the livingroom. On cross-examination, he refused to agree that this smell might
have been the smell of incense. The content of an ashtray in the suite were
also seized and analyzed but the analysis did not disclose that these contents
contained any narcotic or drug. This was the sum total of the evidence. The
accused did not testify nor did he call any evidence.

On this evidence the trial judge refused to make
a finding that the accused had possession

[Page 123]

either of the hashish or LSD. He held that there
was no evidence that the accused was aware of the presence of these drugs, and
also, that when the police officer said that he smelled hashish, what he
actually smelled might have been incense. The Court of Appeal, on the facts as
proved, held that the conclusion was inevitable and overwhelming that Pike (the
person who was trying to dispose of the drugs) had possession of the hashish
and LSD with the consent and knowledge of the accused, and that in refusing to
act on the evidence, the trial judge was resorting to speculative, irrational
and conjectural conclusions.

I am in complete agreement with the reasons
delivered in the Court of Appeal. I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conviction on charge of
non-capital murder—Appeal—Application of s. 613(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

The appellant was found guitly of non-capital
murder. The essential witness for the Crown was the wife of the murdered man.
She identified the accused at a line-up three days after her husband was
killed, but there were some discrepancies between her statement of the facts
and some relevant physical facts observed by other witnesses shortly after the
crime. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal, and the only difference of
opinion there was as to the application of s. 613 (1)  (a) (i) of
the Criminal Code  which provides that a Court of Appeal may allow an
appeal where it is of the opinion that the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.: If the judges of the majority in the
Court of Appeal had held that their function under s. 613(1) (a)(i)
was only to decide whether there was evidence, this would be reversible error.
The Court of Appeal must satisfy itself not only that there was evidence
requiring the case to be submitted to the jury, but also that the weight of
such evidence is not so weak that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This
cannot be taken to mean that the Court of Appeal is to substitute its opinion
for that of the jury. The word of the enactment is “unreasonable”, not
“unjustified”. The jurors are the triers of the facts and their finding is not
to be set aside because the judges in appeal do not think they would have made
the same finding if sitting as jurors. This is only to be done if they come to
the conclusion that the verdict is such that no twelve reasonable men could
possibly have reached it acting judicially.

[Page 276]

Section 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , which
provides that the failure of a person charged, to testify, “shall not be made
the subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution”, does
not prevent the jury from taking the fact into account without being told. No
one can reasonably think that a jury will fail, in reaching a verdict, to take
into account the failure of the accused to testify. This being so, it is a fact
properly to be considered by the Court of Appeal when dealing with the
question: “Is this a reasonable verdict?”

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The difference between the question
whether there is any evidence upon which a jury may convict and the
question whether “the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”
is not only the difference between s. 613(1) (a) (ii) and
s. 613(1) (a)(i) but is the central matter that must engage the
provincial appellate Court when its jurisdiction is invoked on an appeal from
conviction on the grounds stated in s. 613(1) (a)(i). The majority
of the Court of Appeal rested their dismissal of the accused’s appeal on the
ground that there was evidence upon which the jury could convict.

The jury must have treated the wife of the
victim as a credible witness. But the credibility of a witness to a jury cannot
alone invalidate the contention that their verdict is unreasonable or cannot be
supported on the evidence as a whole. This was the mistake that the majority of
the Court of Appeal made in their approach to s. 613(1) (a)(i). The
members of a provincial appellate Court must weigh the evidence in bringing
their own judgment to bear on the issue whether the jury’s verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence and they are entitled to
substitute their opinion for that of the jury on that issue.

Failure to testify, if it can have any
significance at all on an appeal by an accused, can go only to the dismissal of
the appeal on the ground that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, a matter that is related not to s. 613(1) (a)(i) but to
s. 613(1) (a)(ii) relating to a wrong decision on a question of law.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], dismissing an
appeal from a conviction on a charge of noncapital murder. Appeal dismissed,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

T.A. Dohm, Q.C., for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson, Pigeon
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—Appellant was found guilty of
non-capital murder after a trial before Aikins J. and a jury at Prince George, B.C., on November 9, 1971.
The essential witness for the Crown was the wife of the murdered man, one
Mac-Donald. She was herself hit by three bullets fired at her by the murderer
immediately after shooting her husband. She identified the accused at a line-up
three days later, but there were some discrepancies between her statement of
the facts and some relevant physical facts observed by other witnesses shortly
after the crime.

In the Court of Appeal, there was unanimity as
to the fairness of the address to the jury and the only question on which a
difference of opinion arose was the application of subparagraph (a)(i)
of s. 613.1  of the Criminal Code . This subparagraph provides that
the Court of Appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

The conclusion of the formal judgment of the
Court of Appeal was:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
Motion for Leave to Appeal conviction aforesaid be and the same is hereby
granted, the appeal from conviction aforesaid be and the same is hereby
dismissed, the Honourable Mr. Justice Robertson who would have allowed the
appeal dissenting

[Page 278]

with respect to the function of the Court
under subparagraph 613 (1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code .

The appeal to this Court was taken under
s. 618.1(a) whereby a person convicted may appeal “on any question
of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents”.

In my view, the reasons for judgment delivered
by Branca and Taggart JJ.A. for the majority, and by Robertson J.A. dissenting,
clearly show that the dissent is not on a question of law but solely on the
application of the law. This is why it was found impossible to specify the
grounds of law for the dissent, as required by s. 606.

Counsel for the accused, in his thorough
argument, was equally unable to formulate any question of law arising out of
the dissent. Here is how he stated the issue in the memorandum summarizing his
submissions:

The error in law alleged is that the
majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in their approach to their function
under Section 613.

It is submitted that the majority did not
reach their own conclusions on the weight of the evidence as they must do in an
appeal under Section 613 (1) (a)(i).

The Appellant urges that he is by law
entitled to have the Provincial Appellate Court arrive at its own opinion
judicially under this Section after a review of all the evidence in the case.

It is not sufficient for the Judges of the Provincial Appeal Court to consider only
whether there is any evidence to support the conviction.

Of course, if the judges of the majority had
held that their function was only to decide whether there was evidence, this
would be reversible error. The Code expressly provides that the appeal may be
allowed, not only when the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence but also
when it is unreasonable. In other words, the Court of Appeal must satisfy
itself not only that there was evidence requiring the case to be submitted to
the jury, but also that

[Page 279]

the weight of such evidence is not so weak that
a verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This cannot be taken to mean that the
Court of Appeal is to substitute its opinion for that of the jury. The word of
the enactment is “unreasonable”, not “unjustified”. The jurors are the triers
of the facts and their finding is not to be set aside because the judges in
appeal do not think they would have made the same finding if sitting as jurors.
This is only to be done if they come to the conclusion that the verdict is such
that no twelve reasonable men could possibly have reached it acting judicially.

I cannot read the reasons of the majority judges
as implying that they did not apply the proper test and solely considered
whether there was evidence. The two grounds of appeal dealing with this point
were stated as follows in the notice of appeal:

3. The verdict of the jury should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable and perverse and such that no
twelve men, properly directed, should reasonably have found.

4. The verdict of the jury should be set
aside on the ground that it cannot be supported by the evidence.

On these, Branca J.A. said:

This Court cannot retry this case or
substitute itself for the jury and find facts. That was the particular task of
the jury. The function of this Court is purely to review the evidence and the
directions of the learned trial Judge to the jury and to see whether or not the
evidence reasonably supported the finding of the jury and to satisfy itself
that the charge of the learned trial Judge was free of misdirection or
non-direction and fairly related the evidence to the issues to be solved by the
jury.

Can it be said that the verdict of the jury
in this case is perverse, that is, that the verdict is so patently unreasonable
and unjust as to satisfy this Court that

[Page 280]

no reasonable jury of twelve men,
considering the evidence as a whole and acting judicially in accordance with
judicial instructions, would reach the verdict in question? It is only on this
basis that a verdict given by a jury may be considered as perverse. However, a
verdict cannot be said to be perverse where there is evidence to support the
conclusion arrived at by the jury particularly where the instructions from the
learned trial Judge are as full and as fair and as lucid as they were in the
instant case.

In my view, there is nothing from which it might
be deduced that the learned judge only considered whether there was evidence.
If there had been no evidence, it would have been the duty of the trial
judge to withhold the case from the jury. This is not what was considered. The
point dealt with assumed that the case was properly before the jury. It was
asked in effect whether they could reasonably answer “Guilty” and, in my
opinion, that was the proper test before the Court of Appeal.

At the end of his reasons, Branca J.A.
added:

….The accused did not testify. He was under
no duty to do so and was entitled to rely upon the presumption of innocence and
the fact that the Crown had to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The
fact that he did not testify did not relieve the Crown of the duty of
proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but where as here there was
evidence of a direct nature which inculpated him and which the jury accepted as
truthful then this Court may well consider his failure to testify as a
factor in disposing of this appeal.

Assuming that the correctness of that statement
is a question of law that may be considered on this appeal, I can find no
reason for disagreeing with it. Section 4.5  of the Canada Evidence Act  provides
that the failure of a person charged “shall not be made the subject of comment
by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution”, it does not prevent the jury
from taking the fact into account without being told. No one can reasonably
think that a jury will fail,

[Page 281]

in reaching a verdict, to take into account the
failure of the accused to testify, specially in a case like this. This being
so, it is a fact properly to be considered by the Court of Appeal when dealing
with the question: “Is this a reasonable verdict?”

The other opinion for the majority was given by
Taggart J.A. With respect to the reasonableness of the verdict, he said:

Undoubtedly there was evidence tending to
weaken Mrs. MacDonald’s evidence of identification but in the final
analysis it was for the jury, after directions from the presiding Judge which I
can only describe as being scrupulously fair to the appellant, to decide whether
to accept or reject the evidence of identification. In these circumstances I
cannot say that the jury were perverse in accepting evidence of identification
nor is this a case where this Court should apply the provisions of Code
s. 613(1)(a)(i).

From this it is abundantly clear that the
learned judge did not confuse the function of the Court in considering the
reasonableness of a verdict with its function in deciding whether there was any
evidence at all. Therefore, neither he nor Branca J.A. differed in law from the
view expressed by the dissenting judge, Robertson J.A., who said:

It being the duty of the court to reach a
conclusion whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence, the court must consider the weight of the evidence. Here undoubtedly
the court can properly be influenced by the weight that the jury must have
given to it (particularly where there is conflict between the evidence of
different witnesses but this does not relieve the court of the duty to reach
its own conclusion. For the court to say, “Yes, it is our conclusion that
the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, but the
jury is the finder of facts and obviously thought that the verdict was
reasonable and could be so supported, and so we shall not interfere” is, in
my opinion, to exercise the Court’s function in something less than a judicial
fashion. In the final analysis, it is an abdica-

[Page 282]

tion by the Court in favour of the jury, an
abnegation by the Court of its judicial duty. By such an attitude the Court is
declining to give effect to conclusion and opinion that the appellant was
entitled to have it arrive at.

I do not read the above as meaning that the duty
of the Court of Appeal is to reach its opinion on the basis of what its members
think they would have decided if sitting as the jury so that, if they are not
convinced that they would have rendered the same verdict, they are to find it
unreasonable. If that is what the learned judge meant, then I must disagree
with him because that is not the proper test. As previously noted, the question
is whether the verdict is unreasonable, not whether it is unjustified. The
function of the court is not to substitute itself for the jury, but to decide
whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially,
could reasonably have rendered.

I do not find it necessary to review the
authorities cited by Robertson J.A. because none of them appears to me to
differ from what I have stated to be the proper view of the law and it does not
appear to me that the learned judge intended to depart. In my view, his dissent
was solely based on a different view of the facts, which he expressed in the
closing paragraph of his reasons in the following words:

Summing up my view, the testimony put
forward in support of the Crown’s case was too unsafe, its nature was too
dubious, to rest a conviction on it, and the verdict was, therefore,
unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—There are two
issues in this appeal by the accused from the affirmation by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal (Branca and Taggart JJ.A., Robertson J.A. dissenting)
of his conviction of non-capital murder.

[Page 283]

The first issue is a jurisdictional one,
involving the authority of this Court to entertain the appeal under
s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The second issue, which
arises only if there is jurisdiction, is whether this Court should properly
dispose of the appeal on the merits of the substantive contentions or whether,
if there be error in law in the position taken and the disposition made by the
majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the case should be remitted
to that Court or there should be a new trial. Counsel for the accused and for
the Crown in this Court were at one in stating that if there was such error in
the provincial appellate Court as to give this Court authority to intervene,
the case should go back to the provincial appellate Court to be dealt with on a
proper application of s. 613(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal Code . It
is in respect of this provision that the question of jurisdiction of this Court
to entertain the appeal under s. 618(1) (a) arises.

Section 618(1) (a) reads as
follows:

A person who is convicted of an indictable
offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose conviction is
affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, …

Whether there has been a dissent by Robertson
J.A. on a question of law may be gleaned both from the formal judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and from the reasons for judgment of the three
members of that Court who sat on the accused’s appeal from his conviction.

The formal judgment, so far as relevant, is in
these words:

This Court Doth Order and Adjudge that …
the appeal from conviction aforesaid be and the same is hereby dismissed, the
Honourable Mr. Justice Robertson who would have allowed the appeal
dissenting

[Page 284]

with respect to the function of the Court
under subparagraph 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code .

Section 613(1) (a)(i) is as follows:

On the hearing of an appeal against a
conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of
insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty on
account of insanity, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is
of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

What is said by counsel for the appellant to be
the question of law upon which Robertson J.A. dissented is the
misinterpretation of s. 613(1) (a)(i) in the exercise by the
majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal of its function thereunder. In
considering this issue, it is necessary to avoid blurring it by reliance on the
unobjectionable (and in this case, indeed, exemplary) charge of the trial judge
to the jury. Whether the trial judge has properly discharged his function is
one thing, and is not disputable here; whether the Court of Appeal has done so
is quite a different thing.

There is a similar need, on the question under
consideration, of distinguishing the function of the jury and the function of
the Court of Appeal in examining the jury’s verdict under the prescriptions of
s. 613(1) (a)(i). If there is no evidence upon which a
properly-instructed jury could convict, that would raise a question of law
under s. 613(1) (a)(ii); and, moreover, if at the close of the
Crown’s case the trial judge concludes that there is no case to go to the jury
he would direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered. However, if the case
goes to the jury, either after election by the accused not to offer evidence
(as in this case) or after evidence is also given by the defence, the fact that
the jury convicts on the evidence is not, ipso facto, determinative of
the inapplicability of s.

[Page 285]

613(1)(a)(i). The difference between the
question whether there is any evidence upon which a jury may convict and
the question whether “the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence” (and I emphasize the words “any” and “the”) is not only the
difference between s. 613(1) (a)(ii) and s. 613(1) (a)(i)
but is the central matter that must engage the provincial appellate Court when
its jurisdiction is invoked on an appeal from conviction on the grounds stated
in s. 613(1) (a)(i). Otherwise, the invocation of the provincial
appellate Court’s power under s. 613(1) (a)(i) becomes an exercise
in futility and obliges an appellant to limit himself or herself to resort to
s. 613(1) (a)(ii) on a question of law.

The distinction that I have noted in the powers
vested in the provincial appellate Court under s. 613(1) (a)(i) and
(ii) has been part of the Criminal Code  since the introduction of those
provisions, in substantially the same wording, by 1923 (Can.), c. 41,
s. 9. The fact that it would generally be a narrow jurisdiction that a
provincial appellate Court would exercise under s. 613(1) (a)(i)
does not permit it to abdicate judgment, however tempting or comforting it
would be to rest on a jury’s verdict simpliciter. Certainly, it could
become a nice question of judgment whether the evidence, although sufficient to
permit the case to go to a jury, is yet not enough to support the verdict, or
whether, on the evidence as a whole the verdict is unreasonable.

The dissent of Robertson J.A. is on this very
point, namely, that his brethren of the majority rested their dismissal of the
accused’s appeal on the ground that there was evidence upon which

[Page 286]

the jury could convict. I read their reasons to
say exactly that, whether they meant it or not.

The matter before this Court does not arise in a
trivial case, although I hasten to say that it should make no difference
whether an accused is here, on the point under discussion, in a matter as grave
as non-capital murder or in one infinitely lighter. It arises, moreover, not
upon a verdict based upon a conflict of oral testimony as to whether what the
accused did amounted to non-capital murder but, rather, upon the identification
of the accused by the wife of the victim, uncorroborated in any particular save
by her reiteration, and with her evidence of the occurrence completely shaken
by the evidence of various physical facts which simply do not square with her
narrative. The trial judge said in the course of his charge that “the Crown’s
case is difficult and seems to me a bit puzzling”. There was no motive for the
accused to kill the victim; and the trial judge rightly added in this
connection that “where there is no motive proved the effect is to make it that
much less likely that the man is the man who killed”.

Of course, to convict, the jury must have
accepted the identification evidence; it must have treated the wife of the
victim as a credible witness in that respect. But the credibility of a witness
to a jury cannot alone invalidate the contention that their verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported on the evidence as a whole. It is my view
that this is the mistake that the majority of the Court of Appeal made in their
approach to s. 613(1) (a)(i).

[Page 287]

The reasons of both Branca J.A. and of Taggart
J.A. explicitly recognize the incompatibility of the physical evidence, as, for
example, where in the room the victim was found after the fatal shooting and
where blood was found, with the testimony of the victim’s wife as to what
happened after she admitted the person, said by her to be the accused, to the
motel unit occupied by her and her husband. Branca J.A. dealt with
s. 613(1) (a)(i) as follows:

Can it be said that the verdict of the jury
in this case is perverse, that is, that the verdict is so patently unreasonable
and unjust as to satisfy this Court that no reasonable jury of twelve men,
considering the evidence as a whole and acting judicially in accordance with
judicial instructions, would reach the verdict in question? It is only on this
basis that a verdict given by a jury may be considered as perverse. However, a
verdict cannot be said to be perverse where there is evidence to support the
conclusion arrived at by the jury particularly where the instructions from the
learned trial Judge are as full and as fair and as lucid as they were in the
instant case.

This, in my view, is patent error which is
underlined in the following portion of the dissenting reasons of Robertson
J.A.:

It being the duty of the court to reach a
conclusion whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence, the court must consider the weight of the evidence. Here undoubtedly
the court can properly be influenced by the weight that the jury must have
given to it (particularly where there is conflict between the evidence of
different witnesses), but this does not relieve the court of the duty to reach
its own conclusion. For the court to say, “Yes, it is our conclusion that the
verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, but the jury is
the finder of facts and obviously thought that the verdict was reasonable and
could be so supported, and so we shall not interfere” is, in my opinion, to
exercise the Court’s function in something less than a judicial fashion. In the
final analysis, it is an abdication by the Court in favour of the jury, an
abnegation by the Court of its judicial duty. By such an attitude the Court is
declining to give effect to

[Page 288]

conclusion and opinion that the appellant
was entitled to have it arrive at.

The error of Branca J.A. is compounded by the
concluding sentence of his reasons when he said:

The fact that he did not testify did not
relieve the Crown of the duty of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,
but where as here there was evidence of a direct nature which inculpated him
and which the jury accepted as truthful, then this Court may well consider his
failure to testify as a factor in disposing of this appeal.

The reference to failure to testify, if it can
have any significance at all on an appeal by an accused, can go only to the dismissal
of the appeal on the ground that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice, a matter that is related not to s. 613(1) (a)(i) but to
s. 613(1) (a)(ii) relating to a wrong decision on a question of law.
Indeed, in his concluding sentence Branca J.A. reaffirms what I have said is a
mistaken view of the function of an appellate Court under s. 613(1) (a)(i);
to say, as he does, that the appeal fails because there is evidence inculpating
the accused which was accepted by the jury is to disregard the duty fixed by
s. 613(1) (a)(i).

Even if the reasons of Taggart J.A. did not
disclose the error which is evident in those of Branca J.A., that would not
affect the conclusion that the appeal is properly before this Court under
s. 618(1) (a). In my opinion, however, they do disclose the same
erroneous approach. This is what he said:

Undoubtedly there was evidence tending to
weaken Mrs. MacDonald’s evidence of identification but in the final
analysis it was for the jury, after directions from the presiding Judge which I
can only describe as being scrupulously fair to the appellant, to decide
whether to accept or reject the evidence of identifica-

[Page 289]

tion. In these circumstances I cannot say
that the jury were perverse in accepting evidence of identification nor is this
a case where this Court should apply the provisions of Code s. 613(1)(a)(i).

This is simply a rejection of the contentions of
the appellant under s. 613(1)(a)(i) on the ground that the jury was
entitled to accept the identification evidence, and that acceptance accordingly
excluded perverseness or any interference with their verdict on the ground that
the verdict, on the whole of the evidence, was unreasonable. It is not an
assessment by Taggart J.A. of the weight of the evidence, which is included in
the duty laid upon the provincial appellate Court by s. 613(1)(a)(i).
The members of that Court must surely weigh the evidence in bringing their own
judgment to bear on the issue whether the jury’s verdict is unreasonable or
cannot be supported by the evidence. They are quite entitled to substitute
their opinion for that of the jury on that issue.

I have already adverted to the fact that an
appellate Court may be reluctant to upset a jury verdict on simply a scrutiny
of a lifeless record. Such reluctance must not, however, be translated into a
principle of non-reviewability, and this, in my opinion, is what has happened
in the present case. I readily agree that it is oversimplification to make the
test of interference whether the appellate Court would have given the same
verdict. That cannot be known until there has been full reconsideration of the
record of evidence upon which the verdict was based. Such reconsideration may
very well dispose the appellate Court to say that, although we might not have
arrived at the same verdict, we do not think it is unreasonable, nor do we
think that it is unsupported by the whole of the evidence. On the other hand,
the reconsideration might lead to the conclusion that the verdict should be
upset on one or other of the stated grounds.

[Page 290]

The difficulty that s. 613(1)(a)(i)
presents is in its invitation to verbal formulas which are rationalizations of
conclusions reached otherwise. Section 613(1)(a)(i) is a source of power
which a provincial appellate Court can use liberally or restrictively. The
Supreme Court of Canada cannot monitor that use when the provincial appellate
Court has shown that it is its independent assessment that governs, albeit
there is understandable acknowledgment of the advantages possessed by the jury.
That, however, is not this case.

The majority of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in the present case failed to be responsive to their function under
s. 613(1)(a)(i) which was stated by that Court, differently
constituted, in R. v. Inglehart[2], where
Bull J.A., speaking for the Court, said this (at p. 215):

It is not the function of the Court to
retry an appellant or decide his innocence or guilt. That is for the jury.
However, it is the duty of the Court to decide whether a verdict of the jury is
reasonable, whether it can be supported, having regard to the evidence. It
should set aside a verdict of a jury, even if there is some evidence upon which
the latter could find guilt, if it is determined that the charge is not proved
with a certainty necessary to support a verdict of guilty and on the facts a
conviction would be unsafe and the verdict on the whole unsatisfactory.

Branca J.A. took this approach in the later case
of R. v. Mohinder Singh Dhillon[3], as
did Robertson J.A. who participated in that appeal. In the present case,
Robertson J.A. followed it again but Branca J.A. did not. In following it,
Robertson J.A. concluded upon an extensive review of the evidence, both
testimonial and physical, that

[Page 291]

“the testimony put forward in support of the
Crown’s case was too unsafe, its nature was too dubious, to rest a conviction
on it, and the verdict was, therefore, unreasonable and not supported by the
evidence”. In the result, he would have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction
and directed an acquittal.

In my opinion, the same result should have been
reached by the majority, had they exercised their reviewing function under a
proper appreciation of the duty demanded of them by s. 613(1)(a)(i).
Their error in this respect was on a question of law upon which there was a
dissent, and this Court thus has jurisdiction in this appeal. Having that
jurisdiction, this Court is empowered by s. 623(1)  of the Criminal Code 
to make the order which the provincial appellate Court might have made upon
a proper appreciation of the law. In this respect, I can add nothing to what
Robertson J.A. has said in his careful judgment, and I would, accordingly,
allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and enter a verdict of acquittal.
Although counsel for the accused and for the Crown were content to have the
case remitted to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration under the view of
s. 613(1) (a)(i) which that Court ought to have taken, I see no advantage
in doing so in this case.

As a postscript to these reasons, I refer to the
recent judgment of the House of Lords in Stafford v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[4], in
which I find support for my view of the independent function of an appellate
Court under s. 613(1)(a)(i). The House of Lords was concerned with
s. 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 19 which, inter
alia, directs

[Page 292]

the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal from
conviction “if they think that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on
the ground that under all the circumstances of the case it is unsafe or
unsatisfactory”. This provision replaced s. 4(1) of the Criminal Appeal
Act, 1907 (U.K.), c. 23, which was the source of our s. 613(1)(a).
Although there is a reference in the reasons of Lord Kilbrandon (reasons were also
delivered by Viscount Dilhorne, by Lord Diplock and by Lord Cross of Chelsea)
to the view that the 1968 provision may have enlarged the authority of the
Court of Appeal beyond that given by the 1907 Act, the reasons of all the Law
Lords make it clear that the Court of Appeal in exercising its appellate
function is to do so according to what “they think”.

The Stafford case was one in which fresh
evidence was adduced on appeal, and it was in the light of that evidence as
well as of the record at trial that the Court of Appeal considered whether the
conviction should be set aside as unsafe or unsatisfactory. It declined to do
so, and the issue on further appeal was whether it ought to have asked itself
whether the jury might have had a reasonable doubt even if the Court of Appeal
itself did not. The House of Lords made it quite clear that it was for the
Court of Appeal, or for the House of Lords on further appeal as in this case,
to make their independent determination.

Lord Kilbrandon did say that, under the 1907
Act, emphasis was laid not so much on unreasonableness of the verdict but on
whether it was unsupported by the evidence; and he stated that verdicts which
were supported by evidence which in law the jury could accept were held to be
unassailable. I do not, as these reasons show, take so narrow a view of the
appellate Court’s function; and Lord Kilbrandon noted that it would have been
possible for the Courts, alter

[Page 293]

1907, to have said that if a verdict was unsafe
or unsatisfactory it was not reasonable. That is my view, and it is illustrated
in the following passage in Lord Kilbrandon’s reasons (at p. 769):

A conviction depending solely on the
fleeting identification by a single stranger could, for example, have been
upheld, though on a different view of the 1907 Act it would have been possible
to condemn it as unreasonable, just as today it would very probably be thought
unsafe or unsatisfactory, and be set aside on those grounds.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—False statement in
extrajudicial proceedings—Answers to questions subsequently recorded in
document—Document signed and certified by affidavit—Affidavit not qualifying as
one permitted, authorized or required by law—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, s. 114.

At the request of a police officer, the
respondent, against whom no charge had been laid, went to the offices of the
police and answered questions put to him about a news item published in a daily
newspaper, to the effect that a witness in a criminal trial had stated that he
wished to change a false testimony he was incited by the respondent to give at
the preliminary hearing. The respondent denied having taken any part in the matter,
and then signed a document in which his answers had been recorded, and
certified its accuracy by affidavit taken by an officer who held a commission
of justice of the peace solely for the purpose of administering oaths. The
respondent was charged under s. 114  of the Criminal Code  with
making a false statement. He was convicted at trial but was acquitted by the
Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The
appellant contends that as the law does not prohibit certifying such a statement
by affidavit, we must conclude that it permits it, since whatever is not
prohibited by law is permitted. Furthermore, the provisions of s. 37  of
the Canada Evidence Act  and of s. 35(21) of the Interpretation
Act, necessarily imply such permission.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

In the circumstances of this case, the
statement made by the respondent was not within the meaning of and having
regard to the true purpose of s. 114 of the Code, a statement which the
person making it was “permitted, authorized or required by law” to make, by
affidavit or orally under oath. In the definition of this indictable offence,
the legislator

[Page 43]

does not have in mind any extrajudicial
statement whatever, made for any and every purpose, by affidavit or orally
under oath. The legislator does not recognize as an ingredient of the
indictable offence mentioned in s. 114 , affidavits which he has not
permitted, authorized or required, in short, affidavits which have no legal
meaning or scope.

Section 37  of the Canada Evidence Act  and
s. 35(21) of the Interpretation Act do not support the Crown’s
claims.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], setting aside the respondent’s conviction
on a charge of making a false statement. Appeal dismissed.

M. Bourassa, Q.C., for the appellant.

Claude Armand Sheppard, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Appellant, having been granted
leave to do so, appeals against a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of
the. Province of Quebec1. This judgment acquits respondent of the
indictable offence described in s. 114  of the Criminal Code , with which
he was charged at trial, and of which he was convicted.

114. Every one who, not being a witness in
a judicial proceeding but being permitted, authorised or required by law to
make a statement by affidavit, by solemn declaration or orally under oath,
makes in such a statement, before a person who is authorised by law to permit
it to be made before him, an assertion with respect to a matter of fact,
opinion, belief or knowledge, knowing that the assertion is false, is guilty of
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

The circumstances leading to the foregoing
charge are not in question. Following a news item published in a Montreal
daily, to the effect that a witness in a criminal trial had stated that he
wished to change a false testimony he was incited by Boisjoly to give at the
preliminary inquiry, an officer of the Quebec Provincial Police, Inspector
Armand Houle, contacted Boisjoly and asked him if he had any objection to
coming to

[Page 44]

the offices of the Police to answer questions
about the news item. Boisjoly, against whom no charge had been laid, went to
the offices of the Police and answered questions put to him by officers
Thibault and Lawton. He denied having taken any part in the matter, then,
having been invited to do so by the officers, he signed a document (Exhibit
P-3) in which his answers had been recorded, and certified its accuracy by
affidavit taken by Inspector Houle. The latter, incidentally, then held a
commission of justice of the peace solely for the purpose of administering
oaths.

Eventually the authorities came to the opinion that,
in the circumstances, Boisjoly had knowingly made false statements, and brought
the aforementioned charge against him. He was found guilty at his trial but was
acquitted by the Court of Appeal, for the following reasons, given on behalf of
the Court by Casey J.:

As Appellant points out C.C. 114 does not
contemplate any affidavit; it contemplates only those that are “permitted,
authorised or required by law.” This means statements that are required for one
purpose or another and that the relevant provision of the law allows the person
involved to make in this manner. These are affidavits that have legal
significance and as examples I suggest the provisions relating to Bulk Sales
(C.C. 1569), to the nomination of candidates for office in the City of
Montreal (Charter sec. 256) and to the sworn declaration that must
accompany certain applications under the Highway Code (sec. 64).

In this case Appellant was asked for
certain information. He could have refused. Instead he complied and gave
answers that do not, by any stretch of the imagination, qualify as statements
that are permitted, authorized or required by law.

The only importance that I attach to the
facts of this case, particularly those relating to the manner in which P-3 was
prepared and signed and to the manner in which Houle appeared at the last
minute is that they give us an example of the informality that is so often
present in matters of this sort. They may also explain why in so many cases
affidavits are treated with little if any respect.

[Page 45]

Thus, the question of law forming the basis of
this appeal is whether the statement made by Boisjoly, in the circumstances
mentioned above, is or is not, within the meaning of and having regard to the
true purpose of s. 114  of the Criminal Code , a statement which the
person making it is “permitted, authorised or required by law” to make, by
affidavit or orally under oath.

In support of the affirmative, appellant relies
on the word “permission” in the French version, or “permitted” in the English
version. It contends that as the law does not prohibit certifying such a
statement by affidavit, we must conclude that it permits it, since, it is said,
whatever is not prohibited by law is permitted. Furthermore, contends the
appellant, the provisions of s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act , and
of s. 35(21) of the Interpretation Act, necessarily imply such
permission.

I do not think appellant’s claims can be
accepted as valid, in the light of the historical and legal context of the
question to be determined.

We must at this point observe that if it may be
generally correct to assert that all that is not prohibited by law is
permitted, it follows that it is also equally correct to say that any
permission given by the legislator implies a measure of exception to a rule or
principle in effect. Otherwise, we would have to conclude that the legislator
had acted to no purpose in permitting what was already permitted. This is
certainly not the case with respect to the right to use the oral oath, the
affidavit or the solemn declaration to attest the truth of a statement of fact.

We must first remember that originally,
understanding and acceptance of the religious obligation resulting from the
oath was a condition of the competence of any witness; and that with time the
rigidity of this rule was relaxed to allow, first of all, different religious
forms of attestation, and eventually, on certain conditions or in certain
specified cases, the solemn affirmation. In Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal
Law, 19th ed., page 511, at number 584, the matter is stated thus:

584. The value added to testimony by its
being given under supernatural sanctions is frequently so

[Page 46]

great that the law formerly made it
essential to the competency of every witness that he should know and accept the
religious obligation of an oath. Increased intercourse with the East led in the
seventeenth century to the recognition of Mohammedans, and in the eighteenth to
that of Hindus, as satisfying this condition, and being entitled to be sworn
with their own sacred ceremonies. But now, even in the case of adult witnesses,
the requirement of an oath is no longer universal; for, by the Oaths Act, 1888,
‘every person objecting to be sworn, on the ground either that he has no
religious belief or that the taking of an oath is contrary to his religious
belief, shall be permitted to make his solemn affirmation in all places and for
all purposes where an oath shall be required by law’.…

The provisions of the Imperial and Canadian
statutes noted below, which have dealt with the point, indicate, among other
things, one of the historical reasons, and one of the quite affirmative
meanings, of the word “permitted” or “permis”, which is not used by the
legislator in the negative sense ascribed to it by appellant. Thus, in these or
similar terms, it is provided that a witness “shall be permitted to make a
solemn affirmation instead of an oath,” or, as we see in the French version,
“qu’une affirmation solennelle est permise au lieu d’un serment.”

Canada Evidence Act —(1952)
R.S.C., c. 307, see ss. 14 and 15.

It is not inappropriate to note that under ss.
22  and 24  of The Canada Evidence Act  (1893), 56 Vict., c. 31 and ss. 14 
and 15  of the Canada Evidence Act , the option or permission granted to a
witness or deponent to attest the truth of a statement of fact by a solemn
affirmation, rather than on oath, is not absolute, but subject to certain
conditions which qualify it and limit its extent.

Thus we see that the word “permis” and the word
“permitted” imply the existence of an exception to a general principle whereby,
legally, the oath is the rule and the solemn affirmation the exception.

Though pertinent to consideration of the
principal premise on which appellant’s case is founded, these observations on
the right to elect between the oath and the solemn affirmation do not reach to
the heart of matter: this is whether, in s. 114 , in the definition of this
indictable offence, related to that of perjury and, like the latter, punishable
by imprisonment for fourteen years, the legislator has in mind any
extrajudicial statement whatever, made for any and every purpose, by affidavit
or orally under oath, or whether he is considering merely those which he
permits, authorizes or requires to be so attested.

[Page 48]

In 1769, in the 4th volume of his Commentaries
on the Laws of England (cf. p. 137 of the reprint made in 1966 of the
first edition), Sir William Blackstone writes:

The law takes no notice of any perjury but
such as is committed in some court of justice having power to administer an
oath; or before some magistrate or proper officer invested with a similar
authority, in some proceedings relative to a civil suit or a criminal
prosecution; for it esteems all other oaths unnecessary, at least, and
therefore will not punish the breach of them. For which reason, it is much to
be questioned how far any magistrate is justifiable in taking a
voluntary affidavit in any extrajudicial matter, as is now too frequent
upon every petty occasion; since it is more than possible that by such idle
oaths a man may frequently, in foro conscientiae, incur the guilt, and
at the same time evade the temporal penalties, of perjury.

Subsequently, in 1835 in England, and in 1874 in
Canada, the legislator took action against the custom which had emerged of
administering and receiving oaths and affidavits voluntarily taken and made in
proceedings which are not the object of a judicial inquiry, or in any way
required or authorized by any statute. Legislation was introduced to put an end
to the practice: see the Imperial statute, (1835) 5-6 William IV, c. 62,
s. XIII, and the Canadian statute (1874) 37 Victoria, c. 37, ss. 1
and 2. It is worth setting out here the text of s. XIII of the Imperial
statute:

XIII. And whereas a practice has prevailed
of administering and receiving oaths and affidavits voluntarily taken and made
in matters not the subject of any judicial inquiry, nor in anywise pending or
at issue before the justice of the peace or other person by whom such oaths or
affidavits have been administered or received: And whereas doubts have arisen
whether or not such proceeding is illegal: For the more effectual suppression
of such practice and removing such doubts, be it enacted, that from and after
the commencement of this Act it shall not be lawful for any justice of the
peace or other person to administer or cause to allow to be administered, or to
receive or cause or allow to be received, any oath, affidavit, or solemn
affirmation touching any matter or thing whereof such justice or other person
hath not jurisdiction or cognizance by some statute

[Page 49]

in force at the time being: Provided always,
that nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to any oath,
affidavit, or solemn affirmation before any justice in any matter or thing
touching the preservation of the peace, or the prosecution, trial, or
punishment of offences, or touching any proceedings before either of the Houses
of Parliament or any committee thereof respectively, nor to any oath,
affidavit, or affirmation which may be required by the laws of any foreign
country to give validity to instruments in writing designed to be used in such
foreign countries respectively.

In the English version, our 1874 Canadian
statute has the heading Unnecessary Oaths Suppression. We can see there
the language of Backstone in the above quotation. The statute reproduces, with
some variations, the preamble, the main provision and the reservation of
s. XIII of the 1835 Imperial statute. When our criminal law was codified
in 1892, these provisions of the 1874 statute were quite substantially
reproduced in s. 153  of the Criminal Code  to become eventually and
again with a few variations, subs. 1 of s. 179 of the Code prior to that
currently in force. It is appropriate to reproduce the English version of
s. 179(1) :

179. Every justice or other person is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a fine not exceeding fifty
dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, who
administers or causes or allows to be administered, or receives, or causes or
allows to be received, any oath or affirmation touching any matter or thing whereof
such justice or other person has not jurisdiction or cognizance by some law in
force at the time being, or not authorized or required by any such law; but
nothing in this section contained shall be construed to extend to any oath
or affirmation before any justice in any matter or thing touching the
preservation of the peace, or the prosecution, trial or punishment of any
offence, or to any oath or affirmation required or authorized by any law of
Canada or by any law of the province wherein such oath or affirmation is
received or administered, or is to be used, or to any oath or affirmation,
which is required or authorized by the laws of any foreign country to give
validity to an instrument in writing or to evidence designed or intended to be
used in such foreign country.

[Page 50]

2….

In short, this section among other things
makes the justice of the peace who administers an oath touching a matter over
which he has no jurisdiction, and of which he cannot have cognizance under a
statute requiring an oath, guilty of an indictable offence. To the provision of
s. 179(1) is added a reservation to prevent its being interpreted so as to
paralyze the taking of proceedings necessary to keeping the peace—which does
not include the attestation by affidavit of a statement like that which
Boisjoly made in the aforementioned circumstances—or the prosecution, trial or
punishment of an offence, or so as to affect cases where oaths or affirmations
are required or authorized by any law of Canada, or by any law of the province
wherein such oaths or affirmations are received, administered or made, or are
to be used, or oaths or affirmations required or authorized by the law of a
foreign country, for the purposes mentioned in the section.

We thus find in these provisions of s. 179(1),
as in those from which they are derived, that it is always in the same spirit
that the legislator considers the oaths which are not permitted, authorized or
required, in short, unnecessary or useless oaths or oaths which have no legal
meaning or scope.

In the last revision of the Code s. 179
became s. 118 of the present Code; the provisions of s. 179(1) were
dropped. While it may be correct to assert that by doing so Parliament wished
to relieve individuals affected by these provisions of the implied obligation
to verify in every case where they are called on to administer an oath or
solemn affirmation, whether they may validly do so, this does not mean that by
dropping the penal sanction laid down in s. 179(1), Parliament was thereby
seeking to validate a practice hitherto condemned over the centuries. The
legislator is not presumed to substantially alter the law beyond what he states
explicitly in precise words or by necessary implication. This is all the more
since, in the present case, the provisions of s. 114  are explicit. They
refer to everyone who “being permitted, authorised or required by law to make a
statement by affidavit…”. The words “by law” qualify equally the words
“permitted, authorised

[Page 51]

or required”. The spirit of the law has not
changed. The legislator does not recognize as an ingredient of the indictable
offence mentioned in s. 114 , affidavits which he has not permitted,
authorized or required, in short, affidavits which have no legal meaning or
scope.

Finally we must consider the provisions of
s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act , and those of s. 35(21) of
the Interpretation Act, which in appellant’s view allow the oaths.
Section 37  reads as follows:

37. Any judge, notary public, justice of
the peace, police or stipendiary magistrate, recorder, mayor or commissioner
authorized to take affidavits to be used either in the provincial or Dominion
courts, or any other functionary authorized by law to administer an oath in any
matter, may receive the solemn declaration of any person voluntarily making the
same before him, in the form following, in attestation of the execution of any
writing, deed or instrument, or of the truth of any fact, or of any account
rendered in writing:

I, A.B. solemnly declare…

In my opinion the purpose of these provisions is
not to authorize the individuals mentioned to take affidavits or administer
oaths, but to authorize such persons, who are already vested with the power to
administer oaths or take affidavits, to also receive solemn declarations for
the purposes, and in the form, prescribed. We cannot find in these provisions
an intention of the legislator to recognize as being contemplated by
s. 114 —an offence carrying a penalty of fourteen years’
imprisonment—affidavits that are not permitted, authorized or required, and
have no legal meaning or scope in themselves.

Section 35(21) of the Interpretation Act provides
that:

35. (21) “oath” includes a solemn
affirmation or declaration, whenever the context applies to any person and case
by whom and in which a solemn affirmation or declaration may be made instead of
an oath; and in like cases the expression “sworn” includes the expression
“affirmed” or “declared”;

[Page 52]

These provisions in fact have no other purpose
than to extend the normal meaning of the expression “oath” and the expression
“sworn”, so as to include the words “affirmation” or “solemn declaration” and
the words “affirmed” or “declared”, respectively. It is also to be noted that
these provisions do not operate inversely, and that moreover they remain
subject to those of s. 2(1) (a) of the same Act, which makes them
inapplicable in so far as they are inconsistent with the intent or object of
the Act to which it is sought to apply them.

In my opinion, ss. 37  and 35(21) do not support
appellant’s claims.

In short, for the foregoing reasons and
conclusions, the effect of which I feel it is advisable to limit to the
circumstances of this case, I would, with respect, find that the Court of
Appeal correctly quashed as being unfounded in law the conviction against
respondent. I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Owner of goods named in
charge—Proof of ownership—Circumstantial evidence—De facto possession.

Appeal—Criminal law—Dissent—Question of
law—Conjectural possibility or rational conclusion—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 598(1) (a).

The respondent was employed as a truck driver
for C.P. Ltd. A police officer observed the respondent and another man standing
in the foyer of a restaurant. He then saw them walk to the company’s truck. The
respondent opened the rear doors and the other person removed three cans of
peanut cooking oil from the truck and carried them into the restaurant where he
was handed something which the police officer believed to be money. That other
person then left the restaurant and entered the truck which was driven away by
the respondent. The latter denied taking any peanut oil to the restaurant and
also that anyone else had been in his truck. He was charged with theft of three
cans of peanut cooking oil, the property of C.P. Ltd. The loading sheet showed
that only two cans of oil had been placed in the truck. These were consigned
and delivered to another restaurant. The evidence established also that the
company was the only wholesale outlet for the produce and that no cans of
peanut cooking oil of the size in question had been sold to any employee on the
previous day. The respondent’s conviction was set aside by a majority judgment
of the Court of Appeal, which took the view that there was a rational conclusion
to be drawn from the evidence which was consistent with the goods having been
obtained from a source other than the company. The Crown appealed to this
Court.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Court of Appeal did not distinguish
between a con-

[Page 3]

jectural possibility, arising from the facts,
and a rational conclusion arising from the whole of the evidence. This was an
error on a question of law on which there was a dissent within the meaning of
s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

There is a prima facie presumption of
law that the person who has de facto possession has the property. There
was evidence that the three cans of peanut cooking oil here in question were
the property of C.P. Ltd. The facts were inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The only difference between the majority of the Court of
Appeal and the dissenting judge, was whether or not the other possible
conclusion, i.e., that the cans of oil were not the property of C.P.
Ltd., was a rational conclusion or merely a speculative one. That difference is
a difference upon a question of fact and not in any way a question of law.
There was therefore no dissent in the Court of Appeal upon a question of law
alone and, consequently, no appeal lay to this Court under s. 598(1) (a)
of the Code.

However, if this Court had jurisdiction, that
other conclusion suggested in the judgment of the majority of the Court of
Appeal was not a conjectural one but was based on a careful consideration of
all the evidence and was, therefore, a rational conclusion but not consistent
with the guilt of the respondent charged with stealing the property of C.P.
Ltd. Although it was quite conclusive that the cans had been produced by C.P.
Ltd. they might well have been sold by it to one of those innumerable concerns
which bought oil from C.P. Ltd. and stolen by the friend of the respondent from
one of such concerns. At is was not proved that these cans were in the
possession of C.P. Ltd. the doctrine of possession could not be applied to
prove property in C.P. Ltd.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside the
respondent’s conviction for theft of goods, the property of Canada Packers Ltd.
Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.

Archie Campbell, for the appellant.

Robert S. Hart, for the respondent.

[Page 4]

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] setting
aside a conviction entered against the respondent on the charge that he “did
steal three cans of peanut cooking oil of a value not exceeding $50.00, the
property of Canada Packers Limited.” The judgment of the majority of the Court
of Appeal was rendered by Aylesworth J.A., but a dissenting opinion was
filed by Schroeder J.A. and it is in relation to the question of law on which
Mr. Justice Schroeder dissented that the present appeal is brought
pursuant to s. 598 (1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

The respondent was employed as a truck driver by
Canada Packers Limited and on June 9, 1969, was driving one of that company’s
delivery trucks which had been loaded with merchandise during the previous
night. A loading sheet was prepared upon which was entered a list of goods, and
a copy of this sheet was handed to the respondent before he started on his
delivery route. The loaded truck was sealed and the seal broken by the driver
on making his first delivery.

The Division Superintendent of Canada Packers
Limited testified that the records of the company showed that on the day in
question only two 45-pound cans of peanut cooking oil were placed in the truck
driven by the respondent. They were consigned to the Happy Palace Company
restaurant, 108 Dundas Street West, Toronto, and were duly delivered.

At about 1:55 p.m. on the day in question
Detective Greer, who was then off duty, was walking east on Dundas Street when
he observed the respondent and a man named Terry Graham standing in the foyer
of the Golden City restaurant at 175 Dundas Street. Graham was holding the
restaurant door open and talking to a Chinese standing behind the cash register
when the police officer heard him say: “Will $25 be okay”? or words to that
effect, to which the Chinese replied “yes, it would be all right”, whereupon
the respondent and Graham walked to the Canada

[Page 5]

Packers truck, the respondent opened the rear
doors and Graham removed three cans of peanut cooking oil from the truck and
carried them into the restaurant where he had a further conversation with the
Chinese who handed him something which the police officer believed to be money.
Graham then left the restaurant and entered the truck which was driven away by
the respondent.

The Division Superintendent of Canada Packers
was shown the cans identified by the police officer who had seized them from
the Chinese restaurant and he stated that Canada Packers Limited refined the
peanut cooking oil in question and that it was the only wholesale outlet for
the produce which had a retail value of approximately $15.30 per can. The
Division Superintendent also testified that no cans of peanut cooking oil of
the size in question had been sold to any employee on the previous day but that
it was possible that the respondent could have got it elsewhere although his
company was the only wholesale source.

By the time that the respondent returned to the
Canada Packers Limited plant, the police officer had alerted his superiors, and
Inspector Cole was on hand to interview the respondent who there and then
denied taking any peanut oil to the Golden City restaurant and denied also that
anyone else had been in his truck. At that time he had a $20 bill folded up
small in the bottom of his wallet which he explained that he always carried in
case he had to pay for out-of-town repairs to his truck.

In commenting on the conduct of the respondent,
Mr. Justice Aylesworth, in the course of his reasons which were delivered
on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, said:

While the whole conduct of the appellant,
in particular his denial of the presence upon the truck of the 3 cans of peanut
oil seized by the police and of the removal of those cans and delivery thereof
to the Golden City Restaurant (see Mawaz Khan v. Reginam, (1967) 1
A.E.R. 80), loudly proclaims his guilt of theft or illegal possession, that
conduct in no way aids in establishment of the title of Canada Packers Limited
in the stolen goods;…

As I have indicated, the evidence that the
cooking oil was the property of Canada Packers

[Page 6]

Limited was that the three containers were on a
Canada Packers truck which was in charge of its servant or agent, the
respondent, until the moment when they were delivered to the Golden City restaurant.
Mr. Justice Aylesworth observed that this evidence was purely
circumstantial and he took the view that there was a rational conclusion to be
drawn from the evidence which was consistent with the goods having been
obtained from a source other than the company, and that the evidence,
accordingly, did not satisfy the requirements of the rule in Hodge’s case[3].

The rule in Hodge’s case was recently
restated by Mr. Justice Spence, speaking on behalf of the majority of this
Court, in The Queen v. Mitchell[4], where
he said:

To answer this question it is desirable to
recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge’s case. The report
states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of
circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken
alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, “not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person”.

It is quite clear that this direction was
concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person who
had committed the crime…

The Court of Appeal’s finding that there was a
rational conclusion inconsistent with ownership in the company appears to be
based entirely upon the following excerpt from the evidence of the Divisional
Superintendent of Canada Packers Limited, who gave the following evidence in
the course of his cross‑examination:

Q. Then it’s possible Mr. Bagshaw
could have got it elsewhere, your company is not the only source from which he
could obtain this peanut oil?

[Page 7]

A. No, that’s quite true. The only source
he could buy it wholesale would be from our company, Maple Leaf cooking oil.

Q. But he could buy it at a distress sale
somewhere else?

A. Correct.

There is no evidence whatever to suggest that
the respondent did buy the peanut oil either from Canada Packers Limited or
from anybody else.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in The
Queen v. Mitchell, supra, Mr. Justice Spence made the further comment
at p. 479:

The direction in Hodge’s case did
not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal
case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in
applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the
two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct
from the intent which accompanied that act.

Reference may also be made to the reasons for
judgment of Evans J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Torrie[5]. The
following passage from that judgment, which appears at p. 303, was recently
adopted in this Court in Wild v. Her Majesty the Queen[6]:

With the greatest respect, I am of the
opinion that the learned trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s Case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, as to circumstantial evidence in that he
based his finding of reasonable doubt on non-existent evidence. In Regina v.
McIver, [1965] 1 O.R. 306 at 309, [1965] 1 C.C.C. 210, McRuer C.J.H.C.
said:

‘The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it
clear that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is, the facts proved in
evidence and the conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be
rational conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion
would be a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.’

[Page 8]

This statement was approved on appeal to this
Court, [1965] 2 O.R. 475, 45 C.R. 401, [1965] 4 C.C.C. 182 and an appeal
therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed [1966] S.C.R. 254, 48
C.R. 4, [1966] 2 C.C.C. 289.

I recognize that the onus of proof must
rest with the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, but I do not understand this proposition to mean that the Crown must
negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
Wild case, Mr. Justice Martland, who spoke for the majority of this
Court, had occasion to say at page 611:

In the Lemire case, to which
reference was made in the reasons of the Appellate Division, quoted above, it
was stated, in this Court, that on an appeal from a conviction, if an appellate
court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence creates a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper view of the
law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt, there
is an error of law. In my opinion, that proposition applies equally in a case
in which a trial judge, in his reasons, finds that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper
view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his
guilt.

In the penultimate paragraph of his reasons for
judgment in the Wild case, Mr. Justice Martland said, at page 616:

In the present case, the learned trial
judge, in considering the facts to which he referred, failed to appreciate
their proper effect, in law, in that he did not distinguish between a
conjectural possibility, arising from those facts, and a rational conclusion
arising from the whole of the evidence.

In my opinion, the same error is to be found in
the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Aylesworth in the present case and
this was a question of law on which Mr. Justice Schroeder dissented within
the meaning of s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

[Page 9]

In the course of his reasons in the dissenting
judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case, Mr. Justice Schroeder
expressed the further view that the evidence constituted prima facie evidence
of the company’s ownership of the property, and in this regard he cited the
statement made in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 29, para. 731, at
p. 369, where it is said:

731. Possession prima facie title. The
prima facie presumption of law is that the person who has de facto possession
has the property, and accordingly such possession is protected, whatever its
origin, against all who cannot prove a superior title. This rule applies
equally in criminal and civil matters. Thus a person in actual or apparent
possession, but without the right to possession, has, as against a stranger or
a wrongdoer, all the rights and remedies of a person entitled to and able to
prove a present right to possession.

Reference is also made to Wigmore on Evidence,
vol. 9, 3rd ed., para. 2515, and to Pollock and Maitland’s History of English
Law, p. 100.

I agree with Mr. Justice Schroeder that the
paragraph which he quoted from Halsbury’s Laws of England contains an accurate
statement of the law.

I am accordingly of the opinion that there was
evidence that the three cans of peanut cooking oil here in question were the
property of Canada Packers Limited and that the facts are inconsistent with any
other rational conclusion.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[7] pronounced on February 25, 1970, whereby
that court allowed an appeal from the conviction of this appellant by
Provincial Judge Taylor upon the charge:

Albert Charles Wilson Bagshaw, you are
charged that on or about the 9th day of June in the year 1969, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the
County of York, unlawfully did steal three

[Page 10]

cans of peanut cooking oil of a value not
exceeding $50.00, the property of Canada Packers Limited, contrary to the
Criminal Code .

The appelant was arraigned on that charge
and pleaded not guilty. At the same time, he was arraigned on a charge:

You’re further charged that on or about the
9th day of June in the year 1969, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, unlawfully did have in your
possession three cans of peanut cooking oil of a value not exceeding $50.00,
the property of Canada Packers Limited, contrary to the Criminal Code .

and also pleaded not guilty.

The trial proceeded without any statement by the
Crown or by the Provincial Judge as to which charge was being considered. The
Provincial Judge, at the close of the trial, pronounced reasons very briefly as
follows:

Stand up Mr. Bagshaw. I’m finding that
there is a prima facie case made out against you and I can draw an inference
from all the evidence that I have heard that you in fact did steal these three
cans of peanut oil.

The only information as to the disposition of
the second charge upon which the accused was arraigned may be found in the
return on the reverse side of the information where it is indicated over the
signature of the Provincial Judge that Count No. 2, i.e., that for possession
of stolen goods, was dismissed.

The appeal by the Crown to this Court purports
to be based upon s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code , i.e., an
appeal from the judgment of a court of appeal setting aside a conviction, such
appeal being permitted “on any question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal dissents”.

The Notice of Appeal served and filed by the
Crown specified that question in these words:

…upon the following question of law upon
which the Honourable Schroeder, J.A. dissented from the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario:

Did the majority of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario err in law in holding
that the removal

[Page 11]

of the goods from the Canada Packers
Limited truck in no way aids in establishing the title of Canada Packers
Limited in the goods?

As the argument developed in this Court, it
seemed to cover a much broader field than the question as was stated and dealt
with an analysis of all the evidence adduced at trial not merely that as to the
removal of certain goods from a truck owned by Canada Packers Limited.

I have had the opportunity of perusing the
reasons given by my brother Ritchie and I shall adopt the very complete
statement of facts set out in those reasons making only additional reference to
the evidence required for the purpose of my consideration.

Both the majority of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario, for whom Aylesworth J.A. gave reasons for judgment, and Schroeder
J.A., dissenting, agreed that on the information as charged the Crown has the
burden of proving that the three cans of peanut cooking oil were the property
of Canada Packers Limited and all three judges agreed that that proof could be
made by the Crown either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence
applying to the latter the well known rule in Hodge’s case[8], i.e., that to be probative such
circumstances must not only be consistent with the accused having committed the
act but the trier must also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be
inconsistent with any other conclusion than that the accused was the guilty
person. One must note that in applying that test to the present case, the trier
must be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that these cans were the property of Canada Packers
Limited and not consistent with any other rational conclusion.

Both the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and Schroeder J.A., dissenting,
rec-

[Page 12]

ognized that in order to find other rational
conclusions such conclusions must not be merely speculative. Aylesworth J.A.
said:

(3) While bearing in mind the application
of the rule in Hodges case, it must also be borne in mind that
conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be rational
conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts and that no conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence, being in the
absence of evidence a speculative imaginative conclusion not a rational one. McIver’s
case, [1965] 1 O.R. 306; [1965] 2 O.R. 475; [1966] S.C.R. 254, and Regina
v. Torrie, [1967] 3 C.C.C. 303.

Therefore, I am of the opinion that the only
difference between the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario composed of
Aylesworth J.A. and Laskin J.A., as he then was, and the dissenting opinion of
Schroeder J.A., was whether or not the other possible conclusion, i.e., that
the cans of peanut cooking oil were not the property of Canada Packers Limited,
was a rational conclusion or merely a speculative one. Surely, that difference
is a difference upon a question of fact and a difference arrived at by
considering and weighing the evidence and not in any way a question of law. I
express this view despite the decisions of this court in Regina v. Lemire[9] and Wild v. The Queen[10].

As my brother Martland points out in his reasons
in Wild v. The Queen, it was held in Regina v. Lemire that if an
appellate court allows an appeal on grounds that certain specific evidence
creates a reasonable doubt as to guilt when on a proper view of the law that
evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt then the decision
of the appellate court is in error on law and an appeal lies to this Court
under the provisions of s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

In the Wild case, the majority of this
Court, of which I was not one, held that the Crown had

[Page 13]

a right, under the provisions of s. 584(1)  of
the Criminal Code , to appeal to the appellate court from the acquittal
at trial, such appeal being limited to one which involves a question of law
alone because the trial judge, in considering the facts to which he referred in
finding any rational conclusion, did not distinguish between a conjectural
possibility arising from those facts and a rational conclusion arising from the
whole of the evidence. In the present case, Aylesworth J.A., giving the reasons
for the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, did consider all of the evidence and, in my view, did not base his
decision on any conjecture having, as I pointed out above, expressly ruled out
any conclusion based on such conjecture. It would seem, from reading the
reasons of Schroeder J.A. that he was of the opinion that the other conclusion
which the majority of the court found to be a rational one and which,
therefore, would cause the rule in Hodge’s case to operate so as to
prevent a conviction, was that the cans of peanut cooking oil had been
purchased by the accused from some other source such as at a distress sale and
the learned justice in appeal pointed out that the inference could only arise
from a question put by Crown counsel to the employee of Canada Packers Limited
and that there was no evidence at all of any such sale. Schroeder J.A.
characterizes such a conclusion as being only “by a resort to the most highly
imaginative and unrealistic speculation which has no basis in the evidence,
whether derived therefrom directly or indirectly”. I am of the opinion that this
was not the other conclusion which the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario found was a rational one.
Aylesworth J.A., giving judgment for the majority, said:

As an equally rational conclusion from the
evidence in the case, these cans of peanut oil, with or without the connivance
of appellant, might have been stolen by Graham from any one of innumerable
concerns which had bought the oil from Canada Packers Limited; certainly
Graham, an individual identified by the police, played a prominent, indeed a
leading, part in the disposal of the cans of peanut oil to the Golden City
Restaurant; his presence and his conduct according to the only evidence ad-

[Page 14]

duced, are as consistent with theft from a
person or persons unknown or even theft by Graham alone, appellant being guilty
of illegal possession only, as they are with theft by appellant from Canada
Packers.

It should be noted that the Provincial Court
Judge dismissed the charge of illegal possession against this accused and there
was no appeal therefrom.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that
there was no dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario upon a question of law alone and that, therefore, no appeal lay to
this Court under the provisions of s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code .

However, lest I be in error in that view, it is
my intention to examine the other conclusion suggested in the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to express my view as to
whether that conclusion was a rational one or was based on mere conjecture and,
therefore, excluded by the authorities in Ontario cited by Aylesworth J.A.,
i.e., the McIver case[11],
confirmed in this Court[12], and Regina
v. Torrie[13] and by
the Lemire and Wild decisions in this Court.

As I have pointed out, that other conclusion
which Aylesworth J.A. termed “equally rational” was that the peanut oil might
have been stolen by Graham, the other rider in the Canada Packers truck and not
an employee of the company, from any one of the innumerable concerns which had
purchased the said peanut oil from time to time from the said Canada Packers
Limited and that such theft from another might have been either with or without
the connivance of the present appellant.

Employees of Canada Packers Limited gave
evidence for the Crown. Their evidence proved that the system utilized by that
company was that during the night prior to the day the driver, the appellant,
made the deliveries, the night staff loaded the truck which was to be operated
by

[Page 15]

this appellant and then locked the truck and
sealed it. In the morning, when the appellant came on duty he was given the
key, a complete set of invoices covering each shipment of goods which had been
loaded on the truck and another document called a Driver’s Loading Sheet. The
latter document listed all of the invoices covering all the goods on the truck
and indicated which of the shipments were to be delivered only on payment by
the customer. The evidence showed that there was only one shipment of peanut
cooking oil placed, on the previous night, in the truck to be driven by the
appellant and that shipment was two 45-pound cans which were to be delivered to
the Happy Palace Company at 108 Dundas Street West. The driver’s load sheet showed that the shipment which included
those two cans of peanut oil was delivered to the said Happy Palace Company and
was paid for by a cheque and such cheque was handed over by the appellant to
Canada Packers Limited. In my view, this evidence proves conclusively that when
the appellant took possession of his truck so loaded with the goods in the
locked compartment and the invoices covering the goods locked therein on the
morning of the offence, the three cans of peanut oil in the truck were not
there.

Now let us consider the possibility that on that
morning the appellant made a detour or side trip to some store room and there
obtained the three extra cans of peanut oil. These are no little containers
which could be stuffed into a jacket pocket or hidden in a coat, they are three
45-pound containers of peanut oil. Had the appellant stolen three such cans of
peanut oil from the storage that day such an action would have been most
visible and we can be sure that evidence would have been given on that topic at
the trial. Moreover, it is impossible to conceive of the three 45-pound drums
being already in the truck when the night staff started to load it. Such a
circumstance would defeat the whole procedure set up by Canada Packers to
control the deliveries and could not have failed to have been the subject of a
report to the officials supervising the loading of the trucks. No evidence
whatsoever was offered in reference to any unexplained shortage of stock and
yet Canada Packers Limited is one of the

[Page 16]

very largest packing houses in Canada and must have had an accurate
inventory control.

What I have been going on above is not evidence
but the lack of evidence. Under the circumstances, however, it is not
conjecture. As Aylesworth J.A. said, the evidence shows that Graham was the
person who actually drove the bargain with the alleged receiver in the premises
of the Golden City Restaurant and he was already known to the police. No
evidence was given and no evidence could be given as to the actions of the
appellant after he left the premises of the Canada Packers Limited and prior to
arriving at the premises of the Golden City Restaurant at 175 Dundas Street
West, Toronto, and therefore there is no evidence whatsoever as to when these
three cans of cooking oil were loaded onto the truck driven by the appellant.
It would appear that the back door of that truck had been opened at some time
after it left the premises of Canada Packers Limited because the detective who
observed Graham delivering these three cans of peanut oil to the Golden City
Restaurant described the appellant opening the back doors but made no reference
to his breaking any seal. Upon leaving the restaurant after having carried out
the deal described by my brother Ritchie in his reasons, the appellant drove
only a short distance along Dundas Street and then south on Chestnut Street, and there Graham left the truck while the appellant proceeded on
his way.

The evidence also showed that Canada Packers
Limited sold a considerable number of these large cans of peanut cooking oil to
restaurants and other large volume users.

Now those are the circumstances upon which
Aylesworth J.A. determined that another rational conclusion was that the three
cans of peanut oil were not, on the day they had been delivered to the premises
of the Golden City Restaurant, the property of Canada Packers Limited, although
it was quite conclusive that they had been produced by Canada Packers Limited
but might well have been sold by it to one of those whom Aylesworth J.A.
rightly describes as “innumerable concerns” which bought oil from Canada
Packers Limited

[Page 17]

and from one of such concerns stolen by Graham.
I must point out that even if the theft from such other unidentified firm had
been perpetrated by this appellant he could not have been convicted on the
offence as charged as the cans would not have been the property of Canada
Packers Limited: Reg. v. Scott[14].
(Alta. App. Div.).

With respect, I am in agreement with Aylesworth
J.A. that such a conclusion is not a conjectural one but is based on a careful
consideration of all of the evidence and is, therefore, a rational conclusion
but not consistent with the guilt of the accused charged with stealing the
property of Canada Packers Limited.

I should point out that Schroeder J.A., in his
dissenting reasons, relied on the doctrine of possession giving a prima
facie status of proprietorship to hold that it had been proved that the
three cans of peanut cooking oil were the property of Canada Packers. I am, of
course, in agreement that if it had been proved that these cans were in the
possession of Canada Packers Limited then it could be taken as established that
they were the property of that company for the purpose of founding a charge of
the theft of the property of that company. I am, however, of the opinion that
it has not been proved that the cans of peanut oil were in the possession of
Canada Packers Limited. It is true that they were being carried in the truck
owned by Canada Packers Limited and operated by the appellant in the course of
his duty as an employee of that company but on the evidence recited by my
brother Ritchie, to which I have referred, it has also been shown conclusively
that they were not delivered to that employee by Canada Packers Limited for the
purpose of his acting in reference thereto as an employee and that when he was
in possession of the cans of cooking oil he was not in possession as the agent
of Canada Packers Limited but against the interest of Canada Packers Limited.
In my opinion, the doctrine of possession cannot be applied here to prove
property in Canada

[Page 18]

Packers Limited any more than if the appellant
had borrowed or stolen a raincoat and his use for it having been temporary he
had thrown the raincoat into the locked compartment of the truck.

For both of the reasons which I have outlined I
would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Fire set to a
building—Admissibility and protective force of admissions of judicial
nature—Criminal Code , ss. 374 , 375  and 376 .

The appeal by the Crown of a judgment of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace acquitting the respondents on charges of
having wilfully set fire to a building and of having conspired together for
this purpose was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Hence the appeal to this Court.
The appellant contends (1) that the trial judge repudiated in his judgment of
acquittal the judgment given by him on the admissibility of the admissions made
by the respondents before the Fire Commissioner and (2) that the presumption
established by s. 376  of the Criminal Code  should have applied in
this instance.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The question of the admissibility of
evidence, and the question whether, once admitted in the record, such evidence
has probative force, are two different matters, the first being a question of
law left for the judge to decide and the second being a question of fact for
the jury or the trier of facts, as the case may be. The statement complained of
relates to the probative force of those admissions, i.e. to a question
of fact which does not give this Court jurisdiction.

With regard to the presumption enacted by
s. 376  of the Criminal Code , it does not apply here since the
respondents held a fire insurance policy not relating to the building in
respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed but relating to
certain personal property located in this building.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of

[Page 748]

Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of
Quebec[1],
affirming a judgment of acquittal of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace.
Appeal dismissed.

F. Tremblay, for the plaintiff,
appellant.

René Letarte and Louise Simard, for the
defendants, respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—At the conclusion of their
separate trials in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace the two Drouin
brothers were acquitted on charges of having wilfully set fire to a building,
the property of Laurent Veilleux, and of having conspired together for this
purpose.

The Crown appealed in each case. In both cases,
the appeal was dismissed by a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal[2].

Hence the appeal to this Court.

It is appellant’s contention that the Court of
Appeal erred in law (i) when it failed to hold that the trial judge had
erroneously discarded the statements made by the Drouin brothers under oath at
the hearing held before the Fire Commissioner, and (ii) in holding that the
presumption established by s. 376  of the Criminal Code  did not
apply in this instance.

Regarding the first ground of appeal, the trial
judge in the course of the hearing, without proceeding to hold a voir dire, and
over the defence’s objections, admitted in evidence the stenographic report of
the admissions made by the Drouin brothers under oath before the Fire Commissioner.
On the other hand, in the judgment of acquittal the judge stated:

[TRANSLATION] I must therefore disregard
all admissions made by the accused before the Fire Commissioner, because
they do not meet the requirements of a free, conscious and voluntary statement.

[Page 749]

According to the interpretation placed on it by
the Crown, this statement means that the judge repudiated the judgment given by
him on the admissibility of the admissions made before the Fire Commissioner,
and that in so disregarding these admissions, which are judicial in
nature, he applied criteria appropriate to the admissibility of confessions.
Accordingly, it is said, the trial judge apparently failed to observe the
principle invariably applied since the decision of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council in The Queen v. Coote[3],
to the effect that statements made by a person under compulsion of law are
not, merely by virtue of such compulsion, inadmissible in a criminal proceeding
implicating that person. Cf. Walker v. The King[4]; Tass v. The King[5]; The King v. Mazerall[6]. The Court of Appeal correctly
refused to accept this interpretation. The question of the admissibility of
evidence, and the question whether, once admitted in the record, such evidence
has probative force, are two different matters; the first is a question of law
left for the judge to decide, and the second is a question of fact for the jury
or the trier of facts, as the case may be. In my view it cannot be contended
that the principle laid down in The Queen v. Coote (supra)—in
which, precisely, the validity of the admission of the statements made before
the Fire Commissioner was challenged—was misunderstood by the judge. The fact
that he admitted the statements over the defence’s objections, without
conducting a voir dire, is sufficient proof of this. Further, it is
clear that, placed in the context of the judgment, the statement complained of
relates not to the admissibility, but to the probative force of those
admissions, and this is not a question of law giving us jurisdiction, but a
pure question of fact. I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as
unfounded.

With regard to the second ground of appeal,
s. 376  of the Criminal Code , which is in substantially the same
form at the present time as it was when the offence was committed, provides:

[Page 750]

376. Where a person is charged with an
offence under section 374  or 375 , evidence that he is the holder of or is
named as the beneficiary under a policy of fire insurance relating to the
property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed is,
in the absence of any evidence to the contrary and where intent to defraud is
material, proof of intent to defraud.

In the case at bar the respondents were charged
with an offence covered by s. 374(1)(a), namely, of having wilfully set
fire to a building, and not to personal property as described in
subsection (2) of that section. In dismissing the second ground of appeal,
therefore, it is sufficient to note that, although they held a fire insurance
policy relating to certain personal property located in the building, the
accused were neither holders nor beneficiaries under such a policy relating to
the building in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed.
The Court of Appeal therefore correctly found that the legal presumption
enacted by s. 376  of the Criminal Code  does not apply here.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Conspiracy to
burglarize—Murder—Weapon jointly owned by the parties to this crime—Guilty
knowledge of the accused that his accomplice was armed—Dissent in the Court of
Appeal on a question of law or of fact—Absence or insufficiency of the evidence
supporting a conviction—Power of the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal from
conviction—Jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada on a question of
Law—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 21, 202, 592 and 598.

Respondent was charged and convicted of
murder in having unlawfully caused the death of B after having conspired with D
and L to burglarize the residence of G who operated a grocery store and brought
with her to her residence the money she had taken in during the day. The murder
was committed when D broke into B’s residence which he thought was G’s house,
armed with a weapon which he jointly owned with the respondent, while the
latter was waiting with L in a stolen car. The three accomplices were arrested.

The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction
and acquitted the respondent. The Crown entered an appeal de plano to
this Court based on the dissent in the Court of Appeal and subsequently
obtained leave to appeal on any question of law. It was the respondent’s
contention that this Court was without jurisdiction to review the judgment a
quo since there was no question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal dissented.

Held (Martland,
Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the
conviction at trial restored.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Judson and Pigeon JJ.: The respondent’s case is governed by
the provisions of ss. 21  and 202  of the Criminal Code . It can be

[Page 860]

reasonably deduced from the proven facts,
which moreover were not disputed or explained by him or anyone else, that the
respondent knew or ought to have known, not only that D would have with him and
would use if needed the weapon owned jointly by them, while or at the time he
would be committing or attempting to commit the theft, or during or at the time
of his flight after committing or attempting to commit such theft, but also
that the respondent knew or ought to have known that if the need arose D would
cause bodily harm by whatever means he could in order to facilitate the
commission of the theft or his flight.

The views expressed by the judges of the
Court of Appeal on the question of the absence of the evidence, on which they
were devided, are in clear language. There is no necessity to interpret these
words, which must be given the ordinary meaning and purport conveyed by them.
The absence of evidence is a question of law. There is, therefore, a dissent
giving this Court jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code  as well as s. 598(1) (b) since leave to
appeal on any question of law was granted by the Supreme Court of Canada to the
appellant. Furthermore there was a failure to consider whether the evidence
permitted the jurors to find that the respondent knew or ought to have known
that his accomplice would resort to violence and cause bodily harm in order to
facilitate the execution of their common purpose, and this failure impairs in
law the legal basis of the operative part of the judgment a quo.

Per Ritchie
J.: It appears that there is some evidence to implicate the respondent so as to
make him a party to the crime of murder within the meaning of ss. 21  and 202  of
the Criminal Code .

Per Hall and Spence
JJ., dissenting: The Court of Appeal did not consider that the appeal
fell to be determined upon the question of whether there was any evidence
to support the conviction but rather whether there was sufficient evidence
to support the conviction. The right of the Crown to appeal to this Court under
s. 598(1) (a) or under s. 598(1) (b) is upon a question
of law, and the sufficiency of the evidence upon which it is sought to
support the verdict is a question of fact or at the least a question of mixed
law and fact on which this Court is without jurisdiction.

Per Martland
J., dissenting: This Court cannot, by giving leave to appeal, acquire
jurisdiction to deal with the sufficiency of the evidence in a case in which
the Court of Appeal has itself reached the

[Page 861]

conclusion that the evidence was not
sufficient to support the conviction.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: The dissent on a question of law need not be a dissent on
which there was a difference of opinion between the dissenting judge or judges
and those in the majority. It is enough if the dissent is on a question of law
that goes to the merits of the case and consequently to the decision therein.
There is nothing in either set of dissenting reasons that raises a question of
law alone that would go to the correctness of the acquittal.

Counsel for the Crown alleges that the judges
of the Court of Appeal erred in law in the application of the cases in their
judgment. Only one issue, that of guilty knowledge, was the focus of all the
opinions in the Court of Appeal. What Montgomery J. said about knowledge or
attributed knowledge of murder does not raise any error of law which goes to
the validity of the acquittal. The adverse conclusion on this issue by the
judges in the majority made any consequential issue touched upon in their
reasons immaterial.

As to the error of law alleged about the
question relating to the change of intention on the part of the respondent and
his accomplice to break and enter a house that they found was then occupied
instead of one that was not, there is no basis for saying that the Court of
Appeal made any determination on this question adverse to the contention of the
Crown.

Finally the Crown contends that the judges of
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that there was no evidence to go to
the jury. The Criminal Code  empowered that Court to allow an appeal from
conviction when it was of opinion that “the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”. The
relevant inquiry here is whether the reasons of the Appellate Court disclose a
question of law upon which this Court may entertain the appeal thereto. The
fact that an appellate judge decides that there was no evidence from the mouth
of a particular witness on an issue in the case does not alone raise a question
of law. It is nowhere said that the Crown had failed to make out a case to go
to the jury. The members of the majority in the Court of Appeal dealt with the
same determining issue and with the evidence thereon as representing a
continuum. Where one of the grounds of decision of the Provincial

[Page 862]

Appellate Court is founded on the
insufficiency of the evidence, thus excluding any appellate jurisdiction in the
Court, the giving of another reason upon which jurisdiction could otherwise be
founded will not support its exercise.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of
Queen’s Bench[1], Appeal
Side, Province of Quebec, quashing a conviction of the respondent on a charge
of non-capital murder. Appeal allowed and conviction upon the verdict of the
jury restored, Martland, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

François Tremblay, for the plaintiff,
appellant.

Jacques Bouchard, for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Judson
and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Respondent was charged and
convicted in a jury trial presided over by Mr. Justice Antoine Lacoursière
of having, on or about Nóvember 9, 1968, in the City and District of Quebec,
unlawfully caused the death of Albert Burran, thereby committing murder.

He appealed from this conviction. By a majority
judgment, the Court of Appeal, then composed of Tremblay C.J., and Casey,
Taschereau, Montgomery and Rivard JJ.A., allowed the appeal, quashed the
conviction and acquitted the accused.

From that decision appellant entered an appeal de
plano to this Court based on the dissenting opinion of Casey and Taschereau
JJ.A., and subsequently obtained leave to appeal on any question of law.

The underlying facts established by the evidence
introduced by the prosecution are as follows. On November 8, 1968, respondent
Jean Caouette, Denis Daigle and Diane Lessard all met in a room of a motel
situated in a suburb of Quebec City. The room had been taken by

[Page 863]

Caouette, who registered under a false name and
gave a fictitious registration number for the automobile used. Caouette had
known Daigle for several years and was also acquainted with Diane Lessard. At
the time in question the three were engaged in conspiring to burglarize the residence
of one Thérèse Grondin, who was known to Caouette and Diane Lessard. Caouette
and Diane Lessard both knew that when Thérèse Grondin left the grocery she
operated on rue d’Aiguillon at between 10:30 and 11:30 P.M., she brought with
her to the rue de Repentigny the money she had taken in during the day. On
Friday, November 8, Caouette and Daigle, intending to commit the proposed crime
that evening and using a stolen car for the purpose, followed Miss Grondin from
her place of business to her residence. However, the plan was not carried out
that evening because Daigle did not have sufficient information to penetrate
into the house. The next day, Saturday, November 9, at about 7:30 P.M., the
three accomplices, using a different car this time, headed for Miss Grondin’s
house to put their plan into execution. It had been agreed that Daigle would be
the one to break into the house. When they arrived at the house which they
thought was that of Miss Grondin, but in reality was the adjoining house
occupied by Albert Burran, Daigle got out of the car and rang at the front
door. According to his testimony, this is what happened:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Then, when you got there,
what did you do when you got there?

A. To make sure, we… I got out of the car,
then I rang to make sure there was no one in the house, inside.

Q. And then?

A. Then, a man spoke to me, answered
me, in the house.

Q. And?

A. So we couldn’t know if it was her
parents…

According to the evidence the man in question
was Burran. The testimony goes on:

[Page 864]

[TRANSLATION]…

Q. And while you were ringing at the door,
where was Jean Caouette?

A. In the front, at the door, in the
front, near the sidewalk.

(The italics are mine.)

To explain his visit to the house Daigle then
asked Burran for someone whose name he made up. When the latter told him there
was no person there by that name, he left and rejoined his companions. Caouette
and Daigle were thus able to see that the house was not empty. After driving
round the neighborhood in the car for about three-quarters of an hour, the
three conspirators came back to the same house. Daigle got out of the car and
entered by forcing a window on the upper floor. While this was going on the two
others acted as lookouts, driving around the block and preparing to pick up
their confederate at the proper moment. Having searched the upper floor of the
house and found no money, Daigle decided to go downstairs. At this point he
took out of his belt a sawed-off 22-calibre rifle, which was loaded, and went
down the stairs carrying the weapon. As he reached the lower landing a tile
creaked under his foot; he stopped for a moment, moved along a little adjoining
passage, and suddenly found himself face to face with the occupant,
Mr. Burran, who tried to defend himself. Daigle wounded him several times,
hit him several times on the head with his rifle butt, and Burran, who received
a 22-calibre bullet in his abdomen, died a few days later. Having managed to
get away, Daigle fled to rejoin Caouette. Daigle described the conversation he
had with the latter once he was in the car as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Q. And then, did you speak to
Caouette, was anything said between Caouette and yourself?

A. I think that, a bit later, I told him the
man had been wounded.

(The italics are mine.)

[Page 865]

The man referred to by Daigle was obviously
Burran, whom he and Caouette had just seen when he rang at the door.

Caouette, Daigle and Diane Lessard returned to
the motel. The following Monday, November 11, officers of the Quebec Provincial
Police went to the motel, where they arrested the three accomplices and found
among Caouette’s effects a box of 22-calibre bullets—the same calibre as the
weapon used in the crime, which Daigle had abandoned at the victim’s residence.
This weapon was jointly owned by Caouette and Daigle.

These are the underlying facts established by
the evidence. Caouette did not testify and called no witnesses in his defence.

In law:—

The following provisions of s. 202  apply
here:

202.
Culpable homocide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being
while committing or attempting to commit… robbery, burglary… whether or not the
person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that
death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

(a) he means to cause bodily harm
for the purpose of

(i) facilitating the commission of the
offence, or

(ii) facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

…

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon
his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

It is not disputed that Daigle committed the
offence of murder. This is proved by his own testimony. He had a loaded,
sawed-off weapon on his person. He took it out and had it in his hand as he
went down the stairs. He inflicted bodily harm on Burran and used this weapon
to rid himself of the obstacle which the latter pre-

[Page 866]

sented to committing theft or to his flight. So,
according to his own testimony, he committed murder as defined in paragraph (a)
of s. 202 , and also as defined in paragraph (d) of the said
section.

Caouette’s case is governed by the provisions of
s. 202  and of the second subsection of s. 21 , which enacts that:

21. (1) …

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the
commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying
out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

(The italics are mine.)

In The Queen v. Trinneer[2] this Court ruled on the meaning of
s. 21(2) in the case of a murder charge based on s. 202 . Speaking for
all members of this Court, Cartwright C.J. said, at pp. 644 and 645:

If the respondent ought to have known that
it was probable that bodily harm would be inflicted on the deceased to
facilitate the carrying out of the robbery, then it was unnecessary for the
Crown to establish that he ought to have foreseen that her death was likely to
result. The offence contemplated by s. 21(2) (that is murder as defined in
s. 202 (a) and/or (d)) was committed when Frank inflicted the
bodily harm on the deceased for the purpose of facilitating the robbery or
flight. Its character was determined when her death ensued.

In the case at bar the jury, therefore, had to
decide whether they could reasonably deduce from the proven facts, which
moreover were not disputed or explained by him or anyone else, that Caouette
knew or ought to have known, not only that Daigle would have with him and would
use if needed the weapon owned jointly by them, while or at the time he would
be committing or attempting to commit the theft, or during or at the time of
his flight after committing or attempting to commit such theft,

[Page 867]

but also that Caouette knew or ought to have
known that if the need arose Daigle would cause bodily harm by whatever means
he could in order to facilitate the commission of this theft or his flight.

It surely is realistic for a jury to invest the
association of Daigle and Caouette with the incriminating quality which is
implied by their joint ownership of this sawed-off weapon in the circumstances,
and to conclude that it was not without the knowledge of his accomplice but
with the latter’s consent that Daigle had carried on his person for the execution
of their common purpose the said weapon, loaded with bullets of the same
calibre as those found among Caouette’s personal effects, and that the latter
in any case knew or ought to have known that if the need arose Daigle would
resort to violence to facilitate his flight.

So I would say, with all respect for the
contrary opinion, that an affirmative reply to the above questions is not only
reasonable but necessary, and that the verdict reached by the jury is fully
justified.

Further, in my opinion the contention by
respondent that there is no question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal dissents, and that this Court is accordingly without jurisdiction to
review the judgment a quo, cannot be entertained.

I would observe, first, that the question on
which the judges of the Court of Appeal were divided was the absence, not the
sufficiency, of the evidence concerning whether Caouette knew that Daigle was
armed. The judges of the majority clearly stated that there was no evidence to
indicate such knowledge, while the minority judges expressed the contrary view,
and would have dismissed the appeal and affirmed the jury verdict. This can be
seen from the following passages in the reasons of Mr. Justice
Rivard—concurred in by Chief Justice Tremblay—and from the reasons of
Mr. Justice Montgomery, who stated his own views. Referring to Daigle’s
testimony, Mr. Justice Rivard said:

[Page 868]

[TRANSLATION] I have read his testimony
several times, and the learned defence counsel is correct in stating that
nothing in his replies can lead to the conclusion that Caouette knew Daigle was
armed.

…

But nothing in the evidence indicates that
Caouette knew that Daigle had loaded the weapon in question, or had brought
bullets with him.

Mr. Justice Montgomery, after saying at the
beginning of his reasons that “I agree with my colleague Mr. Justice
Rivard that we should maintain this appeal”—referring by this to the
conclusion, and not the reasons, put forward by his colleague—concludes by
saying:

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
knowledge to go before the jury. I therefore agree that we should maintain
the appeal and acquit Appellant.

(The italics are mine.)

These views expressed by Mr. Justice
Rivard, and certainly those expressed by Mr. Justice Montgomery, are in
clear language. There is no necessity to interpret these words, which must be
given the ordinary meaning and purport conveyed by them. It is not necessary to
cite authorities in order to reiterate that the absence of evidence is a
question of law. There is, therefore, a dissent giving this Court jurisdiction
under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code :

598. (1)
Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an
appeal taken under section 583 or 583A or dismisses an appeal taken
pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (1) or subsection (3)
of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

To the foregoing it must be added that this
Court also has jurisdiction by virtue of the following provisions of
s. 598(1) (b) of the Criminal Code :

(b) on any question of law, if leave
to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada…

[Page 869]

As already indicated, appellant was granted
leave to appeal on any question of law. The evidence in the record required
that the Court of Appeal consider the application of the provisions of
para. (a) of s. 202 , which describe another mode whereby the
offence in question may be committed, as well as the application of the
provisions of para. (d) of the same section. Accordingly, even if
the opinion of the Court was that there was an absence or insufficiency of
evidence as to whether Caouette knew that Daigle was armed, it could not set
aside the jury verdict and acquit the respondent before considering whether the
evidence permitted the jurors to find—as their verdict implied—that Caouette
knew or ought to have known that his accomplice would resort to violence if the
need arose and cause bodily harm, by whatever means he could, in order to
facilitate the execution of their common purpose, or at least to facilitate his
flight after committing or attempting to commit this robbery. There was a
failure to consider such a question, and this failure impairs in law the legal
basis of the operative part of the judgment a quo.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and, concluding that the grounds
raised by respondent in the Court of Appeal, which were virtually not pleaded
by him in this Court, are unfounded, in accord with Casey and Taschereau JJ.A.,
I would restore the verdict of the jury, just as our authority to do so was
especially recognized in Her Majesty the Queen v. McKay[3]; Her Majesty the Queen v. Borg[4].

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—I am in
agreement with the reasons of my brother Spence, and wish only to add the
following additional comments.

In order that the respondent should be convicted
of non-capital murder by virtue of the provisions of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  it was necessary for the Crown to establish,

[Page 870]

beyond reasonable doubt, that the respondent
knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence of murder would
be a probable consequence of Daigle’s carrying out the common purpose of
burglary. The offence of murder was committed by Daigle by reason of the
application, to the facts of this case, of s. 202  (now s. 213) (a)
and (d) of the Criminal Code , which provides:

213.
Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being
while committing or attempting to commit treason or an offence mentioned in
section 52, piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody,
resisting lawful arrest, rape, indecent assault, forcible abduction, robbery,
burglary or arson, whether or not the person means to cause death to any human
being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any
human being, if

(a) he means to cause bodily harm
for the purpose of

(i) facilitating the commission of the
offence, or

(ii) facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

…

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon
his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

On the facts of this case the bodily harm, which
caused death, resulted from the use, by Daigle, of the weapon which he had upon
his person. In determining the criminal responsibility of the respondent under
s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code , the learned trial judge was of the
view that the vital issue was as to whether he knew, or should have known, that
Daigle was armed with the weapon when he entered the house so as to commit the
offence of burglary. In his address to the jury he said:

[TRANSLATION] And to that end, of course,
there is one question to ask yourselves, the very important question, which is,
from my point of view, the most

[Page 871]

important question in order to be able to
render your verdict: did Caouette know, or ought he to have known, that Daigle
had a weapon when he entered the house? Because it is evident that if he had
not known that Daigle had a weapon, we cannot say that he ought to have found
it probable that the death of a person could ensue.

Again, after dealing with the matter of direct
and circumstantial evidence, he said:

[TRANSLATION] Is it reasonable to believe
that he did not know that Daigle was armed when he entered the Burran house?
That is the question, and you must be able to answer it, in order to find the
accused guilty, be able to answer it, beyond any reasonable doubt. This leads
me to speak to you about reasonable doubt.

In the light of this charge it is clear that, in
finding the respondent guilty of non-capital murder, the jury felt satisfied,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the respondent knew, or should have known, that
Daigle was armed when he broke into the house.

The Court of Appeal had the power, under
s. 592 (now s. 613), on the respondent’s appeal from his conviction,
to allow the appeal if it was of the opinion that the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence. The Court
addressed itself to the issue which had been put to the jury and considered
whether a finding that the respondent knew, or should have known, that Daigle
was armed when he entered the house could be supported by the evidence. The
majority held that it could not be supported.

Rivard J.A. considered the direct evidence of
Daigle and of the police, and said:

[TRANSLATION] I have read and reread his
testimony, and the learned defence counsel is correct in stating that nothing
in the answers which he has given can permit the conclusion that Caouette knew
Daigle was armed.

…

It is true to say that the police officers’
testimony stated that they found one or two boxes of bullets in motel No. 15,
among Caouette’s effects (J.R. p. 129). But nothing in the evidence
indicates that Caouette

[Page 872]

knew that Daigle had loaded the weapon in
question, or had brought the bullets with him.

He then went on to deal with the circumstantial
evidence, and said this:

[TRANSLATION] In order to establish the essential
element in Caouette’s guilt we have, in all, only circumstantial evidence
which, in accordance with the well-known rules, can only result in a verdict of
guilty if no other conclusion than that of appellant’s guilt is possible.

I do not think that the Crown’s evidence
meets these requirements. In order to find a person guilty of a crime committed
by another, it is essential that all conditions prescribed by law be met.

His conclusion is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The association of Daigle,
Diane Lessard and Caouette establishes beyond any doubt their intent to commit
the crime of breaking and entering with intent to commit theft. Their behavior
before the crime and in the days that followed can be explained without the
necessity of finding that Caouette knew, or ought to have known, that in
breaking into Miss Grondin’s residence in her absence it was probable that
violence would be used and someone killed or wounded.

For this reason I would allow the appeal
and acquit the appellant.

Montgomery J.A. reached a like conclusion and
said this:

To find Appellant guilty of murder, the
Crown had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offense of murder would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose of breaking and entering
(subsec. (2) of sec. 21 . Crim. Code). I see no reason to
suppose that he ought to have known this to be a probable consequence unless he
knew that Daigle was armed. Of this, there is no direct evidence. The Crown had
in Daigle a witness who appears to have been frank and cooperative, yet no
questions were put to him to establish knowledge on Appellant’s part that
Daigle was carrying a firearm. All that we have is Daigle’s testimony that the
weapon was their joint property and evidence that the bullets, which Daigle had
procured, were found two days later among Appellant’s effects in the motel room
occupied by both of them. These circumstances

[Page 873]

may give rise to suspicion, but I do not
find that they amount to proof.

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
knowledge to go before the jury. I therefore agree that we should maintain the
appeal and acquit Appellant.

Chief Justice Tremblay agreed with Rivard J.A.
Casey J.A. and Taschereau J.A. dealt with exactly the same issue and reached
the opposite conclusion; i.e., that there was sufficient evidence to find that
the respondent knew, or should have known, that Daigle was armed when he
entered the house.

In these circumstances it is my opinion that the
Court of Appeal has reached a decision which is not subject to appeal to this
Court. Admittedly, Montgomery J.A. made the statement that “there was no
evidence of knowledge to go before the jury”, but, in my opinion, a decision by
a judge of the Court of Appeal, on an appeal by the accused from a conviction,
that there is no evidence to go to the jury must, of necessity, mean also that
he has concluded that the verdict of the jury cannot be supported by the
evidence. It is true that a finding of no evidence is a finding on a question
of law, which might be a basis for an appeal, but a finding as to sufficiency
of evidence is a finding of fact, or of mixed law and fact, which cannot be
appealed to this Court.

The case of The Queen v. Warner[5], decided that a finding as to insufficiency
of evidence by a Court of Appeal, on an appeal from conviction, is a finding of
fact, or of mixed law and fact, and is not subject to appeal to this Court. It
was also decided that, where such a finding had been made, it was of no consequence
that other

[Page 874]

grounds on which the Court of Appeal has
proceeded did raise questions of law.

If it is to be held that, because one of the
judges forming the majority stated that there was no evidence to go before the
jury, a question of law is raised which may be brought before this Court, the
situation which results is anomalous. The question of law is: “Was there
evidence to go to the jury?” The answer to this issue is that either there was
evidence, or there was not. If the former conclusion is reached, it is then
necessary, before restoring the conviction, to find that there was sufficient
evidence to support it. But the question of sufficiency of evidence is, by
virtue of s. 613 of the Code, a matter for the determination of the
Court of Appeal.

That was the very issue which was considered by
the Court of Appeal in this case. The two dissenting judges disagreed with the
majority on that specific issue. For that reason, this case differs from The
Queen v. McKay[6]. In
that case the Crown had an appeal as of right, because the dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal had dissented on a question of law from the majority, which
had held that there was no evidence implicating the accused to go to the jury.
It was held, in this Court, that the dissenting judge was right, and that this
Court, being seized of the appeal, could direct the remedy which the Court of
Appeal should have granted; namely, to restore the conviction.

In the present case, in my opinion, there was no
appeal as of right, because there was no dissent on a question of law. Leave to
appeal was given, but, in my view, this Court cannot, by giving leave to
appeal, acquire jurisdiction to deal with the sufficiency of the evidence in a
case in which the Court of Appeal has itself reached the conclusion that the
evidence was not sufficient to support the conviction. That

[Page 875]

was the situation in the Warner case.
Leave to appeal had been given, but this Court later held, on hearing the
appeal, that the finding of the Appellate Division that the evidence was not
sufficient to support the conviction was not subject to any appeal to this
Court, and the appeal was dismissed.

In my opinion, following the Warner case,
the Court of Appeal having reached a conclusion on a question of fact, or of mixed
law and fact, there is no appeal to this Court, unless it could be shown that,
in reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeal had done so because of an error
as to the law. In the present case, in my opinion, Montgomery J.A. correctly
defined what, in law, had to be established to find the respondent guilty of
non‑capital murder in the light of the decision of this Court in The
Queen v. Trinneer[7]. Rivard
J.A. expressly referred to that case and, in my opinion, correctly stated its
application.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RITCHIE J.—Accepting as I do the interpretation
which the Chief Justice of this Court has placed upon the language used by
Mr. Justice Rivard in the Court of Appeal with which Chief Justice
Tremblay concurred, and having regard to the opinion expressed by Montgomery
J.A., I feel bound to conclude that the majority of the Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal of the respondent on the ground that there was no evidence to so
implicate Caouette as to make him a party to the crime of murder within the
meaning of ss. 21  and 202  of the Criminal Code  as those
sections have been interpreted in this Court in The Queen v. Trinneer[8].

As it appears to me that there is at least some
such evidence, I would dispose of the matter in the manner proposed by the
Chief Justice.

[Page 876]

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec pronounced on
January 14, 1971, in which that Court by a majority judgment allowed an appeal
by the respondent from his conviction in the Court of Queen’s Bench on May 26,
1969, upon a charge of non-capital murder. The respondent had filed an appeal
to that Court as of right and had in the same document applied for leave to
appeal upon questions of fact. Paragraph 8 of that document which, as I have
said, was both a notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal, read as
follows:

[TRANSLATION]—The proof of prosecution is
insufficient to justify the verdict of guilty and the gaps which are present
therein are such that the said judgment is unreasonable in fact as in law.

The Crown alleged that the respondent had
conspired with one Denis Daigle and Diane Lessard to break into the home of a
Miss Thérèse Grondin and steal therefrom the receipts from a grocery store
business which they believed she had brought to her home the previous evening.
The respondent drove Daigle to the residence in which the conspirators resided
and Daigle broke into that residence through a second storey window, searched
for the money and, not finding it, started to descend a stairway. There Daigle
met Colonel Burran, into whose home he had broken in error, a tussle ensued and
Daigle withdrew a sawed-off 22 rifle from his belt and shot Colonel Burran
inflicting wounds from which the latter died. Therefore it became vital in
applying s. 202  and s. 21(2)  to determine whether the respondent knew
or ought to have known that the commission of the offence of non-capital murder
would be a probable consequence of the carrying out of the burglary. This the
Court of Appeal for Quebec found hinged on whether the respondent knew that
Daigle was armed when the latter broke into this home. Mr. Justice Casey
and Mr. Justice Taschereau gave reasons to dismiss the appeal of the now

[Page 877]

respondent Caouette. Mr. Justice Rivard,
with whom the Chief Justice concurred, gave reasons for allowing the appeal.
Mr. Justice Montgomery concurred in this latter view and added further
reasons to allow the appeal.

Although the dissent upon a question of law,
upon which the Crown’s right to appeal to this Court without leave rests, under
the provisions of s. 598(1)(a), now R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 621(1)(a), of the Criminal Code , must be found in the
dissenting reasons of either Casey or Taschereau JJ. A. I turn first to
consider the reasons given on behalf of the majority as the Crown obtained
leave to appeal to this Court “de bene esse”.

Rivard J.A. in his reasons said:

[TRANSLATION] The first ground of appeal
relied on by appellant against this verdict is that the evidence submitted by
the Crown cannot reasonably justify or support the verdict of guilty pronounced
against appellant.

And thereafter in his reasons he said:

[TRANSLATION] Appellant submits that there
is no evidence on record from which it could reasonably be deduced that, in
carrying out the unlawful purpose of their mutual assistance for breaking into
and stealing, Caouette knew or ought to have known that the result of carrying
out the common intent, i.e. breaking and entering with theft, in Miss Grondin’s
uninhabited house, would be the use of violence against some person.

The evidence as to the commission of the
offence is based almost exclusively on the testimony of Denis Daigle,
Caouette’s accomplice for committing the offence of breaking and entering with
theft. He claims that the weapon used was owned by Caouette and himself; but
nowhere does he say that Caouette knew that he was carrying this weapon when
the crime was committed, or when it was being planned.

I have read his testimony several times,
and the learned defence counsel is correct in stating that nothing in his
replies can lead to the conclusion that Caouette knew Daigle was armed.

The weapon, which was discovered broken in
the Burran residence, is not very large. In fact, Daigle carried it in his belt
to shoot Burran.

[Page 878]

It is true to say that the police officers’
testimony stated that they found one or two boxes of bullets in motel No. 15,
among Caouette’s effects (J.R. p. 129). But nothing in the evidence
indicates that Caouette knew that Daigle had loaded the weapon in question, or
had brought bullets with him.

In order to establish the essential element
in Caouette’s guilt we have, in short, only circumstantial evidence which, in
accordance with well-known rules, can only result in a verdict of guilty if no
other conclusion than that of appellant’s guilt is possible.

I do not think the Crown’s evidence meets
these requirements. In finding a person guilty of a crime committed by another,
it is essential that all conditions prescribed by law be met.

He concluded:

[TRANSLATION] The association of Daigle,
Diane Lessard and Caouette establishes beyond any doubt their intent to commit
the crime of breaking and entering with theft. Their behaviour before the crime
and in the days that followed can be explained without the necessity of finding
that Caouette knew, or ought to have known, that by breaking into Miss
Grondin’s residence in her absence it was probable that violence would be used
and someone killed or wounded.

For this reason I would allow the appeal
and acquit the appellant.

In none of these excerpts does Rivard J. advance
the proposition that there was no evidence to support the conviction. On the
other hand, in all of them the learned justice of appeal is discussing the
sufficiency of the evidence.

Montgomery J.A. in his brief concurring reasons
refers to evidence which had been advanced as indicating that the respondent
knew Daigle was armed and concludes:

These circumstances may give rise to
suspicion, but I do not find that they amount to proof.

Despite Montgomery J.A.’s concluding words,

In my opinion, there was no evidence
of knowledge to go before the jury.

[Page 879]

(The emphasis is my own.)

I am of the opinion that in those reasons he, as
did Rivard J., engaged in the task of determining whether the evidence was
sufficient to support the verdict.

Casey J.A., again in brief reasons, also
referred to the facts advanced by the Crown to support the submission that the
respondent knew Daigle was armed and accepted them as having such probative
force. In my view, this is plainly a weighing of the sufficiency of the
evidence. Taschereau J.A. followed a course almost exactly the same as that
followed by Casey J.

I, therefore, have come to the conclusion that
all five of the learned justices of appeal did not consider that the appeal
fell to be determined upon the question of whether there was any evidence
to support the conviction but rather whether was sufficient evidence to
support the conviction, a course which lay open to them under the provisions of
s. 592(1)(a)(i), (now R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(a)(i))
of the Criminal Code .

As I have pointed out, the right of the Crown to
appeal to this Court under s. 598(1)(a) without leave upon a
dissent or under s.598(1)(b) with leave is upon a question of law. The
presence or absence of any evidence upon which a verdict may be supported is
such a question of law. The sufficiency of the evidence upon which it is sought
to support a verdict is not a question of law but one of fact or at the best a
question of mixed law and fact. In The Queen v. Warner[9], this Court considered a case where the
Chief Justice of the Court appealed from had said:

I am strongly of the opinion that the
verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go
further and set out other reasons for setting aside the verdict.

Kerwin C.J. said at p. 147:

[Page 880]

I read the first sentence as meaning that
the Chief Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a
conviction,—which is a question of fact…

While it was announced that we had
jurisdiction, further consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court
that such is not the case.

Cartwright J., as he then was, sait at pp.
149-150:

So far as the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to
interfere with it. The question whether the Appellate Division was right in
proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a
question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a
mixed question of fact and law.

…

On reading the reasons as a whole, I am
satisfied that the Appellate Division was exercising its jurisdiction under
s. 592(1)(a)(i) and was setting the verdict aside on the ground
that, in its opinion, it could not be supported by the evidence.

Taschereau and Abbott JJ. agreed with both
Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. Ritchie J., in giving concurring reasons, said at
p. 162-3:

If the Appellate Division erred in finding
that such a doubt existed, then this was an error of fact from which other
errors necessarily flowed, including the finding that s. 202  was the only
one under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder. The
latter conclusion follows directly from the former, and, accordingly, in my
view the error, if error it was, raises a mixed question of fact and law, and
as such is not a competent ground of appeal to this Court (see The King v.
Décary, [1942] S.C.R. 80 at 83, 2 D.L.R. 401.)

Therefore, I am of the opinion that in this
appeal, as in The King v. Warner, the Crown seeks to appeal on a ground
of fact or mixed law and fact.

I, therefore, would dismiss the appeal on
the ground that this Court is without jurisdiction to consider it.

[Page 881]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—The threshold
question in this appeal by the Crown against the acquittal of the accused by
the Quebec Court of Appeal of non-capital murder is the jurisdiction of this
Court to entertain the appeal. The Quebec Court of Appeal, by a bare majority,
set aside the conviction entered upon the verdict of a jury.

The Crown has asserted an appeal as of right
under s.621(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , taking the position that
the dissenting opinions of Casey and Taschereau JJ.A. raise questions of law
within the meaning of that provision. Leave to appeal was also obtained under
s.621(1) (b) “de bene esse on any question of law”. This leave,
given so far as it may be required, must, in my understanding, be taken to
relate to any question of law that goes to the validity of the verdict of
acquittal; it cannot be construed to refer to a question of law whose correct
resolution would not affect the result reached by the majority of the Quebec
Court of Appeal. The unlimited character of the leave makes it necessary to
determine what were the grounds upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside
the conviction herein and to consider the grounds urged in this Court against
the acquittal; in this latter respect there is no restriction to the grounds
upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal proceeded.

I deal first with the Crown’s assertion of an
appeal as of right. I am prepared on this point to take the view of s.621(1) (a),
expressed by Cartwright J., as he then was, in Rozon v. The King[10], that the dissent on a question of law
need not be a dissent on which there was a difference of opinion between the
dissenting judge or judges and those in the majority: see

[Page 882]

also Brown v. The Queen[11]. Taking this view, here in favour of the
Crown, it is enough if the dissent is on a question of law that goes to the
merits of the case and consequently to the decision therein. I am well aware of
the line of cases in this Court, of which Pearson v. The Queen[12], illustrative, that support the position
that the appeal as of right depends upon the dissent being upon a question of
law which has been differently determined by the majority in the provincial
appellate Court. They do not call for re-examination here because, on the more
generous construction of s. 621(1) (a) which I would take, the
dissents of Casey and Taschereau JJ.A. do not raise any determining question of
law.

The appeal by the accused to the Quebec Court of
Appeal was taken both as of right on questions of law and by leave on questions
of mixed law and fact and on questions of fact alone. The issue that chiefly
concerned all five members of that Court was whether there was evidence to
support the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew that his
confederate Daigle was armed when the latter broke into the deceased’s home
while the accused remained outside. Casey J.A. concluded (in his words) that
“the known facts were compatible only with the conclusion that the appellant
had guilty knowledge, that is, that he knew that Daigle was armed and that what
happened would be a probable consequence of what they proposed to do”. This, to
me, is simply a conclusion on the sufficiency of the evidence to meet the
burden of proof resting upon the Crown, and suggesting in this connection
reliance upon the circumstantial evidence formula of Hodge’s case. (I
may say, parenthetically, that this intimation of reliance on Hodge’s case
does not engage the propositions of this

[Page 883]

Court in Wild v. The Queen[13], which were addressed to oral reasons of a
trial judge sitting without a jury.) It is a determination on the effect of the
facts adduced in evidence or, at the most, one of mixed law and fact, which it
was open to the Quebec Court of Appeal to make. A determination on these
grounds is not, however, open to this Court.

Taschereau J.A. in his longer dissent, dwelling
at greater length on the evidence, expressed his concurrence with Casey J.A. on
the question whether the accused knew that Daigle was armed when he broke and entered
the victim’s house. As clearly, if not more so than his colleague in dissent,
Taschereau J.A. proceeded upon the sufficiency of the evidence. Since all the
evidence which the two dissenting judges considered was before the jury, their
dissents merely affirmed the jury’s appreciation thereof on the issue of guilty
knowledge. Even on the hypothesis that the majority were wrong in setting aside
the conviction, there is nothing in either set of dissenting reasons that
raises a question of law alone that would go to the correctness of the
acquittal.

This evaluation is amply supported by a
consideration of the reasons of Rivard J.A. in whose opinion, as a member of
the majority, Tremblay C.J.Q. concurred. What Rivard J.A. said, after a lengthy
review of the evidence, was that on the key issue of guilty knowledge it did
not go far enough to establish that the only reasonable conclusion therefrom
was that the accused knew that Daigle was armed. Like his dissenting
colleagues, Rivard J.A. did not find it necessary to consider any other grounds
of appeal.

[Page 884]

In view of my conclusion that there was no
dissent on a question of law alone, it remains to consider whether any relevant
questions of law arise in the case under the grant of leave to appeal. It is in
this connection that the reasons of Montgomery J.A., as a member of the
majority favouring acquittal, become material. He also limited his reasons to
the crucial issue of guilty knowledge that Daigle was armed, and ended his
brief reference to the evidence with the following two sentences:

These circumstances may give rise to
suspicion, but I do not find that they amount to proof.

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
knowledge to go before the jury.

These sentences are capable of being understood
to say that Montgomery J.A. was satisfied not only that the evidence of
knowledge was deficient to establish it, but that there was none upon which it
could be established. Accepting that a conclusion of no evidence raises a
question of law, an error in that conclusion becomes immaterial if the judgment
of Montgomery J.A. also supports the position of his colleagues of the majority
that the evidence was insufficient to establish the fact to which it was
addressed.

A clearer illustration of this result would be
afforded if the “no evidence” position was taken in a case where there was a
clear majority that proceeded upon the basis that there was evidence of the
fact in issue but that it fell short of satisfying the burden of proof upon the
Crown. To find, in such circumstances, that a judge was wrong in deciding that
there was no evidence would be of no consequence when there was a majority
finding on insufficiency of the evidence.

If the proper view of Montgomery J.A.’s reasons
be that they admit of no other construction than that there was no evidence of
guilty knowledge to go to the jury, that would raise a question of law alone;
and if he is wrong in his

[Page 885]

assessment this becomes critical to the whole
case in view of the equal division of the other four members of the Quebec
Court of Appeal on whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction.

Counsel for the Crown in his submissions to this
Court founded himself in part on such a reading of the reasons of Montgomery
J.A. He alleged three errors of law as follows:

[TRANSLATION] 1. Did Tremblay, Montgomery
and Rivard JJ.A. err in law in the interpretation and application of the
provisions of sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (a) of section 592  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada, in deciding as they did to assume the functions of
the jury by considering facts which constituted the circumstantial evidence for
the Crown? They held in consequence that the jury had returned a verdict which
was “unreasonable and not supported by the evidence”.

2. Did Tremblay, Montgomery and Rivard
JJ.A., in assuming the functions of the jury and interpreting the evidence as
they did, err in law in the legal interpretation of sections 202  and 21(2) 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada?

(a) By erroneously interpreting
joint possession under section 3, subsection 4(b);

(b) By failing to interpret the
change of intent by the accused Caouette, as indicated by the evidence, at the
time when his accomplice Denis Daigle rang at the door to ascertain whether
there was anyone in the victim’s house.

3. Did Tremblay, Montgomery and Rivard
JJ.A. err in law in the application of the cases cited in their judgment?

I propose to deal with these matters in reverse
order.

The third alleged error of law needs little
comment. It is a contention of misapplying the authorities cited in the
majority opinions. The only citations were in the reasons of Rivard J.A.; and
the two cases he cited, namely, Regina v. Simmons and Lotharp[14], from which a passage on p. 130 was
quoted, and The Queen v. 

[Page 886]

Trinneer[15], were used to
support his conclusion, previously reached, that before a person may be found
guilty of a crime actually committed by another, all the elements of culpable
complicity must be established by evidence reaching the required standard of
proof. The cases were not cited in connection with any consideration of the
elements of constructive murder. As already noted, only one issue, that of
guilty knowledge, was the focus of all the opinions in the Quebec Court of
Appeal. I cannot find in this third contention any error of law within
s.621(1) (b).

Crown counsel expanded his attack on the alleged
misapplication of cited cases by drawing attention to an alleged error of law
in the following passage of the reasons of Montgomery J.A., as being a
departure from the rule of law laid down by this Court in The Queen v.
Trinneer, supra (which Montgomery J.A. did not cite):

To find appellant guilty of murder, the
Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offence of murder would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose of breaking and entering… I see
no reason to suppose that he ought to have known this to be a probable
consequence unless he knew that Daigle was armed.

What Montgomery J.A. said about knowledge or
attributed knowledge of murder as a probable consequence of the breaking and
entering does not raise any error of law which goes to the validity of the
acquittal. The point at issue in the reasons of the Quebec Court of Appeal was
whether the accused knew that Daigle was armed. It is only after this issue was
properly determined that the further question mentioned

[Page 887]

by Montgomery J.A. would become material. Since,
in the view of all judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal the central question
was guilty knowledge that Daigle was armed, the adverse conclusion on this
issue by the majority made any consequential issue touched upon in their
reasons immaterial.

The second alleged error of law is in part a
return to the question of evidence or no evidence that the accused knew that
Daigle was armed and in part a submission of a change of intention on the part
of the accused and Daigle to break and enter a house that they found was then
occupied instead of one that was not. In this latter respect, the contention
appeared to be that the infliction of bodily harm would probably result and
hence the accused, as a confederate of Daigle, would be guilty of murder under
the principle laid down in The Queen v. Trinneer. For reasons already
given, this latter point does not go to the validity of the acquittal. There
is, indeed, no basis for saying that the Quebec Court of Appeal made any
determination on the question of change of intention adverse to the contention
of the Crown.

The question of evidence or no evidence is
raised again in the first error of law alleged by the Crown and I shall
consider it in what follows in these reasons.

The first question of law raised by the Crown is
based on the contention that the majority judges erred in law in their
interpretation and application of what is now s.613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code  in substituting their opinion for that of the jury in the appreciation
of the facts founded upon the circumstantial evidence adduced by the Crown. The
specified enactment empowered the Quebec Court of Appeal to allow an appeal
from conviction where it was of opinion that “the verdict should be set aside
on

[Page 888]

the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence”. What emerged from the submissions on this question,
in reiteration of what was said thereon in the Crown’s factum, was that the
majority judges erred in law in holding that there was no evidence to go to the
jury.

I do not regard an attack upon a provincial
appellate Court’s resort to s.613(1) (a)(i) as necessarily raising a
question of law for the purposes of an appeal to this Court. Section 613(1) ,
specifying when an appellate Court may allow an appeal from conviction, must be
read against the provisions of s. 603(1) which set out the conditions
governing an accused’s right of appeal. Where, as here, the appeal to the
provincial appellate Court has been at large (by reason of the grant of leave),
it must be a rare case where the jurisdiction of this Court, limited to a question
of law, can be invoked on the basis of the misconstruction of the powers of the
appellate Court under s. 613(1) . The relevant inquiry, in my view, is
whether the reasons of the appellate Court disclose a question of law upon
which this Court may entertain the appeal thereto. Hence, it is enough to say,
without reference to s. 613(1) (a)(i), that in so far as the Crown’s
contention here is that the majority in the Quebec Court of Appeal proceeded
erroneously on the basis that there was no evidence to go to the jury on the
issue of guilty knowledge, a question of law is raised which is cognizable here
if the contention is made out.

In seeking to support this contention, by
reference to the reasons of Rivard J.A., two extracts from his reasons were
relied upon. I find it unnecessary to reproduce them because as set out in the
Crown’s factum they were torn from their context where they related to certain
testimony of Daigle himself and of some police officers touching the guilty
knowledge of the accused. In finding that the evidence as a whole did not
support a determination of guilty knowledge, Rivard J.A., as I have already
pointed out,

[Page 889]

was concerned with the sufficiency of the
evidence. The fact, as was the case here, that an appellate judge decides that
there was no evidence from the mouth of a particular witness on an issue in the
case does not alone raise a question of law. Rivard J.A. nowhere said that the
Crown had failed to make out a case to go to the jury.

There is, however, the statement to that effect,
already quoted, by Montgomery J.A. relating to the issue of guilty knowledge
(and not simply to the testimony of a witness thereon), and Crown counsel
relied on it as well in putting forward his first-mentioned error of law. If
the statement of Montgomery J.A. concerned a critical issue on which his
brethren of the majority and, indeed, those of the minority, did not pronounce
and he was wrong in asserting that there was no evidence on that issue, I would
have to conclude that the acquittal could not stand; but, even so, it would not
necessarily follow that the conviction would have to be restored. The
restoration by this Court of the conviction in The Queen v. Taylor[16], over the lone dissent of Cartwright J.,
as he then was, resulted from the fact that all the opinions delivered in the
provincial appellate Court were construed as based upon an erroneous
determination that there was no evidence to go to the jury. The provincial
appellate Court was not divided in its views in that case; and since the jury
there had passed on the evidence the conviction was necessarily reinstated.

What distinguishes the present case from the
postulated situation that I introduced above is that here the members of the
majority in the provincial appellate Court dealt with the same determining
issue and with the evidence thereon as representing a continuum. The fact that
Montgomery J.A. went the farthest in favour of

[Page 890]

the accused along the line cannot erase the fact
of his journey to the point at which his colleagues of the majority stopped.
His reasons support this appraisal. Conversely, if it be said that he stopped
short of the point that his brethren of the majority reached, his reasons may
be read as none the less finding the evidence deficient to discharge the burden
of proof upon the Crown. In my view, this is a case for the analogical
application of what was said by this Court in its majority opinion in The
Queen v. Warner[17]. As
pointed out by Cartwright J., as he then was (at p. 151), where one of the
grounds of decision of the provincial appellate Court is founded on the
insufficiency of the evidence (thus excluding any appellate jurisdiction in
this Court) the giving of another reason upon which jurisdiction could
otherwise be founded will not support its exercise.

In the result, I would quash the Crown’s appeal
on the ground that there is no question of law arising in the opinions of the
Quebec Court of Appeal upon which it can proceed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Indecent assault—Conviction by
magistrate—Jurisdiction of judge of Supreme Court to declare accused a
dangerous sexual offender—Jurisdiction of Court of Appeal to order new
hearing—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 2(10), 468, 659, 661, 662,
667.

The appellant was convicted of indecent
assault by a magistrate without a jury and was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of ten years. An application to have him declared to be a
dangerous sexual offender was filed in the Supreme Court and was

[Page 166]

heard by a judge of the Supreme Court. The
declaration was made and a sentence of preventive detention was imposed. The
Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new hearing. The appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court and contended that the finding at trial
and the judgment of the Court of Appeal were both nullities because the judge
who entertained the application, not being “any other judge or magistrate who
might have held or sat in the same Court”, was without jurisdiction to do so,
and, alternatively, that the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction to order
a new hearing.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The trial judge was without jurisdiction to
hear the application. The phrase “the same Court” in s. 662(4) of the Code
must refer to “the judge or magistrate who sentenced the accused”, and as the
accused elected in this case to be tried by a magistrate, the application to
have him declared to be a dangerous sexual offender must be heard by another
magistrate to accord with the meaning of Part XVI of the Code.

The Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction
to order a new hearing. The 1969 amendment to s. 667 (2a) of the Code,
which empowers the Court of Appeal to order a new hearing, could not act
retrospectively to affect the appellant’s rights which were fixed by his notice
of motion for leave to appeal as of a date prior to the amendment. Accordingly,
the Court of Appeal could only have quashed the sentence of preventive detention
and restored the sentence for a definite term.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia1, allowing an appeal from a finding that the appellant was a dangerous
sexual offender and ordering a new hearing. Appeal allowed.

C.R. Kennedy, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
which allowed an appeal by the accused from a finding that he was a dangerous
sexual offender,

[Page 167]

and ordered a new hearing. On this appeal, the
accused contends that the finding at trial and the judgment of the Court of
Appeal are both nullities because the judge who entertained the application was
without jurisdiction to do so, and, alternatively, that the Court of Appeal was
without jurisdiction to order a new hearing, being only empowered to quash the
finding and sentence at trial.

The appellant was charged with indecent assault
under s. 148  of the Criminal Code . Pursuant to his right under
s. 468  in Part XVI, he elected to be tried by a magistrate without a jury.
He was convicted on December 23, 1968, before Magistrate Denroche, and on
January 9, 1969, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years. A Notice
of Application to have Loos declared to be a dangerous sexual offender was then
filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on February 27, 1969, and on
being heard on June 4, Mr. Justice Dohm of the Supreme Court made the declaration
and imposed a sentence of preventive detention upon him in lieu of the sentence
imposed on January 9, 1969.

A Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal dated
July 3, 1969, was filed in the Court of Appeal on July 7, 1969. After several
adjournments sine die for the purpose of amending the notice, the matter
came on for hearing on April 23, 1970, and the Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal and ordered a new hearing in judgment rendered May 8, 1970. The accused
now appeals from that judgment.

The first ground of appeal involves the
interpretation of s. 662(4) of the Code:

s. 662(4) Where an application under
subsection (1) of section 660 or subsection (1) of
section 661 has not been heard before the accused is sentenced for the
offence for which he has been convicted, the application shall not be heard by
the Judge or Magistrate who sentenced the accused but may be heard by any other
Judge or Magistrate who might have held or sat in the same Court.

The appellant contends that Dohm J. was without
jurisdiction to hear the application because he was not “any other Judge or
Magistrate who might have held or sat in the same Court.”

[Page 168]

Section 659 defined “court” for the purposes of
s. 662, and it states:

659. In this Part,

(a) “court” means

(i) a superior court of criminal
jurisdiction, or

(ii) a court of criminal jurisdiction.

Section 2(10) defines the latter term:

2.(10) “court of criminal jurisdiction”
means (a) a court of general or quarter sessions of the peace, when presided
over by a superior court judge …

(b) a magistrate or judge acting under Part
XVI, and …

The relevant provision, 10(b), refers to Part
XVI within which s. 468 gives to an accused the right to elect trial on an
indictable offence before a magistrate without a jury, a judge without a jury, or
a court composed of a judge with jury.

The appellant elected to be tried by a
magistrate and was convicted and sentenced. Section 661 allows for an
application to be made to have the accused declared a dangerous sexual
offender, and as to sentence, subsection (3) provides:

661. (3) Where the Court finds that the
accused is a dangerous sexual offender it shall … impose upon the accused a
sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired.

In my opinion this section reinforces the
view that an application thereunder is essentially a continuation of proceedings
which led to the conviction. The majority of this Court have expressed this
opinion in Sanders v. Regina.[2] That
case involved an application made before the accused was sentenced, but it is
no less applicable for that reason.

[Page 169]

Section 662(4) provides that if the accused has
already been sentenced, the application is to be heard “by any other judge or
magistrate who might have held or sat in the same court.” The phrase “the same
Court” must refer to “the judge or magistrate who sentenced the accused”, and
as the accused elected to be tried by a magistrate, the application must be
heard by another magistrate to accord with the meaning of this Part. The
accused has no further right to elect once the application is made, and there
is no reason to grant such a right to the Crown.

On this point, I am in agreement with the
dissenting opinion of Taggart J.A. in the Court below, and accordingly both the
judgments of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal are null and void, as the
trial judge was without jurisdiction to hear the application.

The majority of the Court of Appeal were of the
opinion that the trial judge had jurisdiction, but allowed the appeal on the
ground that two psychiatrists who gave evidence at the hearing took into
account prior convictions of the accused. As a result, the Court of Appeal
ordered a new hearing. The appellant contends that they were without
jurisdiction to so order, being only entitled to quash the sentence of
preventive detention and to impose one in respect of the offence committed. The
Court of Appeal were acting pursuant to s. 667 (2a) of the Code as
enacted by 1969 (Can.), c. 38, s. 80, which reads:

667. (2a) On appeal against a sentence of
preventive detention the court of appeal may

(a) quash such sentence and impose
any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the offence for which
the appellant was convicted, or order a new hearing; or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

The part I have emphasized was added to the
section by this amendment, which was proclaimed on July 30, 1969, to be
effective on August 26, 1969. The appellant had filed his Notice of Motion for
Leave to Appeal on July 7, 1969, and thereby fixed his substantive rights on
appeal as of that date, at which time the Court of Appeal had no

[Page 170]

jurisdiction to order a new hearing. The
amendment could not act retrospectively to affect the appellant as his rights
are preserved by s. 19 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
158. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal could only have quashed the sentence of
preventive detention and restored the sentence for a definite term.

The appellant succeeds on both grounds of
appeal, either of which results in the restoration of the sentence of ten years
imprisonment imposed upon him by the magistrate.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Indictment for
robbery—Conviction for common assault—Offence of common assault included in
that of robbery as described in the enactment creating it—Criminal Code , 1970,
ss. 302 , 589(1) .

The appellant, charged with robbery, was
convicted of common assault pursuant to the provisions of s. 589  of the Criminal
Code . On appeal, the conviction was upheld by a majority judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal, whereupon the appellant, with leave, appealed
to this Court. The question in issue was whether the offence of common assault
is included in that of robbery as described in the enactment creating it in the
Criminal Code  (s. 302 ).

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Robbery is one offence which can be committed
in different ways and a reference to the relevant section is a reference
to it in its entirety. The lesser offence must be included in the offence
charged as described in the enactment, albeit not in all the subsections and
“it is sufficient if the other offence is included in the enactment creating
it” as was held in this case by the Court of Appeal, following its own decision
in R. v. Brown (1959), 124 C.C.C. 127. This is consistent with the
decision of this Court in The Queen v. McKenzie, [1972] S.C.R. 409,
where it was held that an accused charged with theft without reference to a
specific section, in that case s. 276(1), now s. 290(1), could be
found guilty of theft committed in the way described in that section.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1],
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for common assault on an
indictment for robbery. Appeal dismissed.

David Pendleton, for the appellant.

A.M. Stewart and William Smart, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—Charged with robbery the appellant
was found guilty of common assault. His conviction was upheld by a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.

The question in issue is whether the offence of
common assault is included in that of robbery as described in the enactment
creating it in the Criminal Code .

“Included offences” are governed by s. 589
of the Code, para. (1) of which reads as follows:

589. (1) A count in an indictment is
divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as described in the
enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of
another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the
accused may be convicted

(a) of an offence so included
that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not
proved, or

(b) of an attempt to commit
an offence so included.

As it appears, there are two circumstances under
which an offence is included in another: it can be included in the offence “as
described in the enactment creating it” or “as charged in the count”.

We are concerned here only with the first of
these circumstances. It is not in dispute that common assault is not included
in the offence as charged in the count which reads: Indictment: William Eric
Luckett stands charged:

[Page 1142]

That, at the City of Vancouver, County of
Vancouver, Province of British Columbia, on the 23rd day of July, 1977, he
unlawfully did commit robbery of Walter Leibel, of a quantity of cigarettes and
approximately $4.00 in cash contrary to the form of the statute in such case
made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen her Crown and
dignity.

Robbery is defined by s. 302  of the Criminal
Code  as follows:

302. Every one commits robbery who

(a) steals, and for the
purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to
the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or property;

(b) steals from any person
and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter,
wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person;

(c) assaults any person with intent
to steal from him; or

(d) steals from any person
while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.

It is the appellant’s submission that to be
considered as an included offence under s. 589(1)  Cr.C ., the
offence must be a necessary ingredient in the description of the offence charged.
It is not a necessary ingredient in subs, (d) of s. 302  Cr.C .,
nor is it in subs. (a) when the violence or threats of
violence used are to property as opposed to a person. The appellant therefore
concludes that common assault is not included when the charge is one of robbery
without any specific reference to one or the other of the subsections of
s. 302  Cr.C .

This was the view held by the dissenting members
of the Court of Appeal, expressed as follows in the formal judgment:

That having regard for the form of the
indictment it was not open to the trial judge to convict of common assault and
in the circumstances if the Crown wishes the Court to be able to convict of an
included offence, it must so frame its indictment as to show upon which of the
subsections of s. 302  it intends to rely so as to give notice to the
accused not only of the principal offence with which he is charged but as well
of the possible included offences of which he may be convicted if proof of the
principal offence fails.

[Page 1143]

In support of his submission the appellant
relied on R. v. Manuel[2]; R.
v. Harmer and Miller[3]; R.
v. Maika[4]; and
Fergusson v. The Queen[5].

In R. v. Manuel the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia held that a charge that the accused “did attempt to murder Joe
Manuel” did not include the offences of assault causing bodily harm and common
assault.

Delivering the judgment of the Court, Sheppard
J.A. said at p. 407:

It follows that in order to be an included
offence within sec. 569 the essential constituent of the included offence
must necessarily be “included or involved” in the offence as described in the
enactment creating it or as charged in the count.

And at p. 408 he added:

Further, to be an included offence the
inclusion must form such an apparent and essential constituent of the offence
charged that the accused in reading the offence charged will be fairly informed
in every instance that he will have to meet not only the offence charged but
also the specific offences to be included. Such apparent inclusion must appear
from “the enactment creating” the offence or “from the offence as charged in
the count;” either of those two may be considered under sec. 569 but not
the opening by counsel or the evidence.

The crown contended that these assaults
were included offences under sec. 210; “the enactment creating the
offence.” The difficulty arises in the case at bar in that the offence charged,
attempt to murder, may be carried out “by any means” (sec. 210) and
therefore may be by assault or by other means. Hence, in a particular case the
attempt to murder as opened by crown counsel or as sought to be proven may be
an attempt not carried out by assault.

That is the difficulty in the crown’s
contention here. Under sec. 569, to determine whether assault is an
included offence, regard may be had to sec. 210, the enactment creating
the offence charged. But sec. 210 does not necessarily include the offence
of assault by

[Page 1144]

reason that under that section the
attempt assigned in a particular case may be “by any means,” and hence may be
by means which do not come within “assault” as defined in sec. 230. It
follows that sec. 210 does not make assault such apparent and essential
constituent of the offence of attempt to murder that the accused in reading the
section would be fairly informed in every instance that he would have to
meet the offence of assault.

In R. v. Harmer and Miller, supra, the
issue was whether assault causing bodily harm was included in robbery as
charged in the count and it was found to be included in that particular
indictment. It nevertheless appears from the judgment delivered by Evans J.A.
that the Court was of the opinion that it is not an included offence in a
charge of robbery. He wrote at p. 20: “If the trial Judge was of the view
that assault causing bodily harm was an included offence in a charge of robbery
then on the authorities he was in error”. From a previous statement on
p. 19 it follows that would be included in an indictment charging an
offence:

…all offences which as a matter of law are
necessarily committed in the commission of the principal offence as described
in the enactment creating it, as well as those offences of which the accused
may be convicted by virtue of express statutory provisions.

In R. v. Maika, supra, the Court of Appeal
for Ontario held that common assault was not an included offence within the
description of robbery in s. 302  Cr.C . This decision was based on
the English case of R. v. Springfield[6]
in which the Court of Appeal interpreted s. 6(3) of the Criminal
Law Act 1967:

Where, on a person’s trial, on indictment
for any offence except treason or murder, the jury find him not guilty of the
offence specifically charged in the indictment, but the allegations in the
indictment amount to or include (expressly or by implication) an allegation of
another offence falling within the jurisdiction of the court of trial, the jury
may find him guilty of that other offence

[Page 1145]

or of an offence of which he could be found
guilty on an indictment specifically charging that other offence.

This section is different from
s. 589(1)  Cr.C . and deals only with offences included in the
offence “as charged in the count”. It does not deal with offences included in
the offence “as described in the enactment creating it”, which is what we are
concerned with here. For this reason, R. v. Springfield, supra, is, in
my view, of no assistance in this case.

The appellant has quoted the following extract
from the judgment of Taschereau J. (as he then was), speaking for the Court in Fergusson
v. The Queen (supra), at p. 233:

In the present case, there was only one
count in the indictment and the charge was for robbery in violation of
s. 288 (b) of the Criminal Code . A count in an indictment is
divisible and where the commission of the offence charged includes the
commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary
conviction, the accused may be convicted of an offence so included that is
proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved,
or of an attempt to commit an offence so included (Criminal Code  569).
Thus, a man charged with robbery may be found guilty of theft, but a person
charged with robbery may not be found guilty of receiving stolen goods, as was
held by the Court of Queen’s Bench in the present instance. Receiving stolen
goods is a less serious offence, but is not included in a charge of robbery.

The count must therefore include but not
necessarily mention the commission of another offence, but the latter must be a
lesser offence than the offence charged. The expression “lesser offence” is a
“part of an offence” which is charged, and it must necessarily include some
elements of the “major offence”, but be lacking in some of the essentials,
without which the major offence would be incomplete. Rex v. Louie Yee (1929),
1 W.W.R. 882, 24 Alta. L.R. 16, 51 C.C.C. 405, 2 D.L.R. 452.

Relying on the last sentence of the above
extract, the appellant concludes that to be an included offence “an offence
must necessarily be

[Page 1146]

included in the description of the offence in
the Code”. And he goes on to say that where no reference is made to one
specific subsection, this means it must be included in all four
subsections of s. 302 .

With respect, I do not think that the latter
proposition is supported by Fergusson v. The Queen, supra, which
did not consider this question.

On the other hand, Fergusson v. The
Queen, supra, does not support the opposite view either because in that
case the accused was specifically charged under s. 288 (b), now 302(b).

Nor is The Queen v. George[7], directly in point. There it was
held that common assault was included in robbery but in that case the charge
read that the accused did “unlawfully and by violence steal” which made it fall
under s. 288 (b).

To hold however that the lesser offence must be
included in every subsection of the section referred to would seem to
me to impose a requirement beyond those of s. 589 .

Robbery is one offence which can be committed in
different ways and a reference to the relevant section is a reference to
it in its entirety.

Section 302  was s. 288  of the Criminal
Code , 1953-54, 2-3 Elizabeth II, c. 51, which replaced ss. 445 to 448 of
the Criminal Code , 1927.

As put in Crankshaw’s Criminal Code  of
Canada, 7th ed., A.E. Popple, 1959, at p. 431:

ROBBERY. The law of robbery was revised in
the new Criminal Code  by combining together ss. 445 , 446  and 448  into one
comprehensive section 288  (above). It will be noted that
s. 288  (above) contains four clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d).
The offence of robbery is punishable under s. 289  which provides that
“every one who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for life and to be whipped.” There is, therefore, one offence
only “robbery” which

[Page 1147]

may be committed in different ways. These
ways of committing robbery are set out in s. 288  (above).

I would therefore conclude that the lesser
offence must be included in the offence charged as described in the enactment,
albeit not in all the subsections and that “it is sufficient if the other
offence is included in the enactment creating it” as was held in this case by
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, following its own decision in R.
v. Brown[8].

This is consistent, in my view, with the
decision of this Court in The Queen v. McKenzie[9], where it was held that an accused
charged with theft without reference to a specific section, in that case
s. 276(1), now s. 290(1), could be found guilty of theft committed in
the way described in that section.

The appellant further submitted:

…that the effect of the decision of the
majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case will be to require an
accused charged with robbery simpliciter to seek particulars from the
Crown as to the particular method in which the offence is alleged to have been
committed. It is submitted that the onus of describing the offence in
particulars should rest with the Crown and not the accused.

This seems to me of little relevance if assault
is included in a charge of robbery and as submitted by counsel for the
respondent an accused charged with robbery will at the outset know that he is
faced with a charge of robbery and a charge of assault as well as of theft.

To hold otherwise would in the respondent’s
submission cause the inclusion in the indictment of multiple counts of robbery
and of the specific actions under one or more of the subsections of
s. 302  Cr.C . as the case may be.

Furthermore, it was the respondent’s submission
that an accused acquitted of robbery would not be able to plead autrefois
acquit within the meaning of s. 537  Cr.C . and would be subject
to further prosecution on one or more other charges. In this

[Page 1148]

respect however it can be queried whether in the
case of an offence punishable on summary conviction all this could be done
within the limitation period of six months.

For these reasons I am of the opinion that the
appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Murder—Defence of
insanity—Meanings of the words “appreciating” and “knowing” in s. 16(2)  of
Criminal Code  distinct and separate—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
ss. 16(2), 613(1)(d).

Witnesses—Self-misdirection as to the
law—Propriety of reference by witnesses to the law as it is said to be
enunciated in specific judgments of the courts.

During a trial on a charge of murder in which
the accused raised the defence of insanity, the trial judge instructed the jury
that the words “appreciating” and “knowing” as they appear in s. 16(2)  of
the Criminal Code , have the same meaning. The issue as to the difference
in meaning, if any, between “appreciating” and “knowing” arose in fact much
earlier in the trial when, in the course of giving evidence, two psychiatrists
called by the Crown revealed that they had found the accused to be insane
within the meaning of that section, but after they had examined the judgment of
this Court in Schwartz v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 673, they reversed
themselves and found the accused not to be insane. The jury found the accused
guilty. The Court of Appeal, acting under s. 613(1) (d) of
the Criminal Code  set aside the conviction (one member of the Court
dissenting) and ordered that the accused “be kept in safe custody to await the
pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor, this Court being of the opinion that
although the appellant committed the act of murder charged against him he was
insane at the time the act was committed so that he was not criminally
responsible for his conduct.” From this decision the Crown appealed to this
Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

One must commence the analysis of a statutory
provision by seeking to attribute meaning to all the words used therein. In the
definition of insanity in s. 16(2) of the Code, Parliament has
employed two different words in the critical portion of the definition, which
words in effect established two tests or standards in determining

[Page 1125]

the presence of insanity. The
subsection in form and substance provides that: a person is insane when he
has a disease of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable (a) of
appreciating the nature and quality of an act… or, (b) of knowing that an act
is wrong. Under the primary canon of construction already referred to,
‘appreciating’ and ‘knowing’ must be different, otherwise the Legislature would
have employed one or the other only. The meanings of the two verbs from which
the participle form is derived are separate and distinct in the ordinary usage
of language.

In the ordinary usage of these words it would
appear that to appreciate embraces the act of knowing but the converse is not
necessarily true. The verb “know” has a positive connotation requiring a bare
awareness, the act of receiving information without more. The act of
appreciating, on the other hand, is a second stage in a mental process
requiring the analysis of knowledge or experience in one manner or another. It
is therefore clear on the plain meaning of the section that Parliament
intended that for a person to be insane within the statutory definition, he
must be incapable firstly of appreciating in the analytical sense the nature
and quality of the act or of knowing in the positive sense that his act was
wrong. With these processes, the Schwartz case was in no way concerned.

The second issue involved the propriety of
the reference by witnesses to the law as it is said to be enunciated in
specific judgments of the courts. It was clear beyond dispute that the expert
witnesses here had been misdirected as to the meaning of the Schwartz case
and hence the definition of insanity prescribed by Parliament in the Criminal
Code . This misdirection was taken up and restated to the jury in the charge
by the presiding justice. In the result the jury heard expert opinion evidence
which was founded on an erroneous understanding of the law of insanity, and
hence their decision cannot stand.

The Court of Appeal correctly applied
s. 613(1) (d) in finding the accused not guilty on account of
insanity.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
allowing an appeal by the accused from his conviction on a charge of
non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 1126]

David Gibbons, for the appellant.

John P. MacKrow, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

ESTEY J.—During a trial on a charge of murder in
which the respondent raised the defence of insanity, the trial judge instructed
the jury that the words “appreciating” and “knowing” as they appear in
s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , have the same meaning. The issue as
to the difference in meaning, if any, between “appreciating” and “knowing”
arose in fact much earlier in the trial when, in the course of giving evidence,
two psychiatrists called by the Crown revealed that they had found the
respondent-accused to be insane within the meaning of that section, but after
they had examined the judgment of this Court in Schwartz v. The Queen[2], they reversed themselves and found
the respondent-accused not to be insane. The jury found the appellant guilty.
The Court of Appeal, acting under s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code  set aside the conviction (Maclean J.A. dissenting) and ordered that
the respondent-accused “be kept in safe custody to await the pleasure of the
Lieutenant Governor, this Court being of the opinion that although the
appellant committed the act of murder charged against him he was insane at the
time the act was committed so that he was not criminally responsible for his
conduct.”

Before considering the impact of the Schwartz
decision on this proceeding, it is helpful to turn to the evidence. The
trial proceeded on the basis of an admission of facts pursuant to s. 582
in which the killing of the deceased by the respondent was admitted. The
evidence revealed that the only apparent contact between the deceased and the
accused was that the former was employed as Office Manager in the business
where the respondent was employed and she (the deceased), in the course of her
job, signed the letter terminating the respondent’s employment.

One of the psychiatrists called by the Crown,
Dr. Whitman, gave a written opinion prior to trial

[Page 1127]

to the effect that the accused “was unable to
appreciate the nature and the quality of an act or [to know] that an act was
wrong.” Another psychiatrist called by the Crown, Dr. Stephenson,
testified that prior to trial he shared the opinion of Dr. Whitman. At
trial both doctors testified that they had had the opportunity of examining the
judgments of this Court In Schwartz v. The Queen, supra, with reference
to the defence of insanity as contained in s. 16  of the Criminal Code  and
thereupon changed their minds and decided that the accused was sane within that
definition.

In his examination-in-chief, Dr. Whitman
stated with reference to his report of April 23 and thereafter with reference
to his subsequent opinion:

Q. And what was your opinion as stated in
that report?

A. The conclusion—I am of the opinion—this
is a record of mine dated April the 23rd, 1976, and following my examination of
the previous day, I am of the opinion that Banner’s presently as fit for trial
as he is ever likely to be. I am of the opinion that at the time of the alleged
offence he was suffering from a disease of the mind to such an extent that he
was unable to appreciate the nature and quality of an act or knowing that an
act was wrong.

Q. Now, following your rendering of that
opinion, were you given a copy of a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, Regina v. Schwartz, May 5th, 1976?

A. Yes.

Q. And did that decision deal with the
definition of insanity set out in Section 16 ?

A. That is my understanding.

Q. And based upon the reasons of the
majority of the members of the Supreme Court in that case, did you alter your
opinion as to the legal sanity of the accused at the time of the offence?

A. I did.

Q. And what were the basis [sic] of
your having done so?

A. My understanding, my Lord, of the
meaning of the words “appreciate the nature and quality of an act as defined by
the Supreme Court of Canada”, I had previously used that word in much more

[Page 1128]

liberal and wider sense where I was of the
opinion that the accused person was suffering from a disease of the mind.

Q. Now, assuming that the words “nature and
quality of the act” refer to the physical character of the act, and assuming
that the law is that if a person who has committed a crime did not, by reason
of disease of the mind, know what he was doing, that he was not to be
convicted, what is your opinion now as to whether the accused was at the time
of the offence insane or sane within the definition?

A. It’s my opinion that at the time of the
alleged offence while he suffered from a disease of the mind he was still able
to appreciate the nature and quality of an act in that sense.

Q. Is it your opinion that he knew what he
was doing?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it your opinion that when he pulled
the trigger of the rifle, he knew what he was doing?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it your opinion that when he loaded
the rifle with bullets including placing bullets in the firing chamber he knew
what he was doing?

A. Yes.

…

Q. During the time described by the
witnesses that the gun was shot in the offices, what is your opinion as to
whether the accused realized the consequences of what he was doing?

A. Well, he would be aware in a physical
sense the effect of discharging a rifle, high‑powered rifle pointing at
someone, that that would cause serious injury or death.

Q. Now, with respect to the second aspect
of the test, that is whether he knew that the act was wrong?

A. I believe that he knew that this was
something which is prohibited by law from doing.

Under cross-examination Dr. Whitman
testified as follows:

MR. MACKROW:

Q. All that I am getting at, then, doctor,
is that were it not for these cases, you then would still be of the opinion
that you were when you made that report on April 23rd?

A. Yes.

Q. As to both aspects, as to whether he was
able to appreciate the nature and quality of his acts?

[Page 1129]

A. That is the one that would decide the
issue in my mind.

Dr. Stephenson, a psychiatrist called by
the Crown, testified when examined in chief as follows:

Q. Alright, now, aside from the—in addition
to your opinion that he was suffering from a mental disease, what other opinion
did you form initially?

A. Initially I formed the opinion that he
was suffering from a disease of the mind of such intensity and quality that he
was unable to fully appreciate the nature and quality of his acts, and I was of
the opinion that he had been in this state of mind for some considerable time
before the commission of the alleged offence and that he was still in that
state when I examined him on the 29th of April.

Q. Now, before I get into any question of
any change of that opinion, did you also form an opinion on the 29th of April
with respect to whether he knew what he was doing was wrong?

A. Yes, I did. And it was my opinion that
he did know that what he was doing was wrong in the moral sense although he
felt in his own mind justified in what he was doing.

Q. Was your opinion that he knew what he
was doing was against the law?

A. Yes, it is my opinion that he did know
that what he was doing was against the law.

Q. Now, with respect to your opinion, your
opinion originally was that he was incapable of fully appreciating the nature
and quality of his acts?

A. Yes, that’s true.

Q. Now, was the case of Regina v. Schwartz
I already referred to given to you to read?

A. I had not—I was not aware of the Regina
v. Schwartz case at the time 1 did my first examination and gave my first
opinion and my opinion at that time was based on the more traditional
interpretation of the understanding of the nature and quality of an act,
appreciating the nature and quality of an act in that in my opinion at that
time, to appreciate the nature and quality of an act one must be able to form
an appropriate opinion, I should say, an opinion about the appropriateness of
the act that one is to perform. For instance, whether one is justified in one’s
own mind either, for instance, by reason of one’s own safety or the safety of
others, in doing an act

[Page 1130]

which in a cognitive sense one might know
to be wrong and in my opinion Mr. Barnier at that time did feel by reason
of his dillusional system and the narrowing down of his sort of responses to
dillusions that what he was doing was justified, and that was my reason for
saying at that time that he was unable to appreciate the nature and quality of
his acts.

Q. Now, assuming for the time being that
the law is that nature and quality deal with the physical act and that the test
is whether a person suffering from a disease of the mind knows what he’s doing,
what is your opinion now as to whether the accused at the time of the offence
appreciated the nature and quality of his acts?

A. Assuming that the law is that, to
appreciate the nature and quality of an act means to know that one is doing it,
and to know the probable consequences of it, then I would have to say that by
that definition Mr. Barnier does appreciate the nature and quality of his
acts.

Q. Now, I understand you haven’t been here
throughout the whole of the evidence, doctor?

A. That’s true.

Q. You have had an opportunity to read
Exhibit 1, the Statement of Facts?

A. I read the Statement of Facts, yes.

Q. And you’ve heard the evidence given by
the other medical witnesses here today?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And based on the evidence which you are
aware of as well as the observations you made of the accused in your
interviews, is it your opinion that he knew that he had a rifle at the time of
the alleged offence?

A. Yes, it’s my opinion that he did know he
had a rifle.

Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether he
knew whether it was loaded?

A. I don’t know whether it was loaded but I
assume it was and if it was loaded I am sure he knew it was loaded.

Q. And do you have an opinion of whether he
knew if he pointed a loaded rifle and pressed the trigger it would go off and
strike the person he had pointed it to?

A. In my opinion, he was well aware of
that.

On cross-examination Dr. Stephenson stated:

[Page 1131]

Q. Doctor, I understand that before you
were given a copy of the Schwartz decision to read your idea was that
“appreciate” meant a little more than “know”, is that true?

A. That’s true.

Q. You felt that it must be able to form an
opinion as to the appropriateness of what he was doing, as you said?

A. Yes, customarily once interpretation of
the term “appreciate” as used in the Criminal Code  was that an individual, in
order to properly evaluate his behaviour, must be able to evaluate it from the
point of view of reality function, must be able to evaluate what was going on
in real terms and if he was able to do that, if his evaluation or reality was a
denial of reality and a projection of his own imaginations or dillusions onto
the situation, then certainly he wasn’t appreciating the nature and quality of
his acts properly.

Q. In your idea then the word “appreciate”
involves a proper appraisal and interpretation of the nature and quality of the
act, is that true?

A. That’s true.

Q. Now, had you never seen or considered
the Schwartz decision, your opinion would still be, I take it, that at the time
of the act he was unable to appreciate the nature and quality of his act by
reason of his mental illness?

A. Yes, using the old standard, old
definition, that would be my opinion.

Q. And in between—I take it that a copy of
the Schwartz decision, you were presented with this by Crown Counsel and it was
discussed with you at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was suggested to you, I take it,
by Crown Counsel that the Schwartz decision in some way changed the law or
modified it, is that true?

A. That was my understanding.

Dr. J.P. Duffy, called as a witness for the
accused, testified on cross-examination concerning the state of mind of the
accused as follows:

Q. Now, there is, of course, no question
that the accused here suffered from a disease of the mind and I think you are
aware that all of the psychiatric evidence tends to that direction?

A. Yes, I am.

[Page 1132]

Q. Now, the definition, for our purposes
here, has two aspects: one of involving an inability to appreciate the nature
and quality of this act and one of—to deal with knowing that the act or
omission is wrong. Let me deal with the latter part of that definition first. I
am not sure if I follow your evidence insofar as that aspect is concerned. Was
it your view that at the material time the accused did not know that his
actions were wrong?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, I understand that you are familiar
with a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Schwartz?

A. I have read it.

Q. Are you implying the language, when you
come to your conclusion, as to that, with respect to that part of the
definition that the Supreme Court was using, knowing that the act was legally
wrong?

A. I am not implying either of the definitions
used in the case you are referring to. I am talking about the words “to know”
and I am bringing in—I hope I did bring in that there is no such thing as a
static condition of mind, and that my opinion with regards to
Mr. Barnier’s knowledge is specifically directed to the instant of
commission. I would say that it’s perfectly consistent to find a person whose
mental illness deprives him of knowledge at the time of the commission of the
offence who can later give evidence that he could know—I think that’s the
dilemma.

Q. But your view is that at the time of the
commission of the offence that the accused did not know that his actions were
wrong?

A. My position is that at the time of the
commission of the offence the accused suffered from mental illness of such a
degree as to render him incapable of appreciating the quality and nature of his
actions, and that of such a degree as to prevent him from knowing?

Q. Knowing that his act was wrong?

A. Yes.

Q. That he was suffering from a disease of
the mind to the extent that he did not know that it was wrong to shoot somebody
with a gun?

A. Yes.

Q. And that he did not know that was
against the law?

A. He may have had this knowledge before
and he may have been able to talk about it afterwards but

[Page 1133]

we are talking about one instant in time
and we are attempting to make an artificial dicotomy [sic] and I can’t
underline this too strongly. We are dealing with an instant of time.

All the psychiatrists in one way or another deal
with the interpretation of the words “know and appreciate” as they appear in
the definition of insanity contained in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , which
I will set out later, and the alleged purport of Schwartz v. The Queen,
supra. These witnesses of course are qualified as experts in a branch of
medicine and not in the law. The position of a juror listening to such a
discussion by a witness is very difficult. Such testimony does not assist the
trier of fact, and the introduction of such evidence should be avoided. The
instruction of the jury on questions of law is, of course, for the Court, and
to have a discussion of the law reach the jury through a witness is at best
confusing and at worst destructive of a fair and proper trial.

The charge to the jury given by the judge on the
issue of insanity is as follows:

The next question to ask yourselves is
whether the accused had a disease of the mind to an extent that rendered him at
the time he fired that gun incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of
the act of firing the rifle at Doreen Garbutt. I must tell you that as a matter
of law the words ‘nature and quality’ refer to the physical character of the
act. The questions to be asked are these: Did the accused know that he was
pointing a loaded rifle at Doreen Garbutt? Did he know what the bullet would do
to her if and when it hit her? If you find that he was incapable of
understanding what he was doing, that is, that he was incapable of appreciating
the nature and quality of the act, that he did not know what he was doing, the
defence of insanity would succeed.

I will review the evidence of the
psychiatrists later but at this point I must say to you that the law, as I have
just given it to you, is the basis, as I understood the evidence, on which
Dr. Whitman and Dr. Stephenson founded the opinions they expressed
yesterday. Initially each of them had reached the opposite conclusion, namely,
that the accused did not appreciate the nature and quality of his act. You may
find it unsettling and disturbing that two highly qualified psychiatrists have
been proceeding for some years on the interpretation of the law which is the
wrong interpretation. You must take from me what I have said the law to be. The
initial opinions of Dr. Whitman and Dr. Stephenson were

[Page 1134]

based on what the Supreme Court of Canada
in the case which you heard about, the Schwartz case has held to be wrong. You
were entitled to be told that they had changed their opinions and to be told
the reason for that change, a reason not related to any matter of fact but a
reason related to the legal interpretation to be given to the word
‘appreciate’.

I repeat then, if you find on the balance
of probabilities that the disease of the mind rendered the accused incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his act the defence of insanity would
succeed. Your verdict would be not guilty by reason of insanity. If, however,
you find that he was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of what he
was doing you must then ask yourselves whether the disease of the mind was such
as to render him incapable of knowing that his conduct was wrong. When I use
the word ‘wrong’ that means according to law, wrong in the sense that the act
was forbidden by law. If you find on the balance of probabilities that he was
incapable of knowing what he was doing was wrong in the sense that I have used
that word, that is contrary to the law, then the defence of insanity would
succeed. Your verdict would be not guilty by reason of insanity…

…Dr. Duffy said that the accused would
know but would not appreciate. I have told you that as a matter of law those
words have the same meaning for the purpose of section 16 .

Against this background of evidence received in
the course of the trial and the judge’s charge to the jury, I turn to the
judgment of the majority in Schwartz v. The Queen, supra. It is
imperative to recall that the question before this Court on that appeal was
simply the meaning of the word ‘wrong’ as it is used in the definition of
insanity in s. 16(2) . The Court was not dealing with the balance of the
subsection and no issue was raised with reference to that part of the
definition of insanity relating to the capacity to appreciate and to know. One
excerpt from the judgment of this Court as delivered by my brother Martland is
sufficient to demonstrate that the Schwartz appeal has no bearing on the
outcome of the issue now before us:

There is no evidence in the case which
relates to the issue as to whether, at the time the offences were committed,
the appellant, owing to disease of the mind, though appreciating the nature and
quality of his acts, did not know that what he was doing was morally, or

[Page 1135]

legally, wrong. That issue never arose on
the facts of this case. There was no evidence to meet the onus imposed on the
appellant by s. 16(4) to establish his insanity within the latter part of
the definition in s. 16(2)  no matter how the word “wrong” be interpreted.
([1977] 1 S.C.R. 673, at p. 694)

The question raised here cannot be answered by
the application of any principle advanced in the disposition of the single and
different issue which arose in Schwartz, supra.

I turn then to the crux of this appeal, namely
the interpretation of the definition of insanity as found in subs. (2) of
s. 16 , and particularly the proper meaning in law of the words
‘appreciating’ and ‘knowing’ found in that definition. The
subsection reads as follows:


 
  
  (2) For the purposes of this
  section a person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility
  or has disease of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of
  appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that
  an act or omission is wrong.
  
  
  (2) Aux fins du présent article, une
  personne est aliénée lorsqu’elle est dans un état d’imbécillité naturelle ou
  atteinte de maladie mentale à un point qui la rend incapable de juger la
  nature et la qualité d’un acte ou d’une omission, ou de savoir qu’un acte ou
  une omission est mauvais.
  
 


One must, of course, commence the analysis of a
statutory provision by seeking to attribute meaning to all the words used
therein. Here Parliament has employed two different words in the critical
portion of the definition, which words in effect established two tests or
standards in determining the presence of insanity. The subsection in form
and substance provides that:

a person is insane when he has a disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable

(a) of appreciating the nature and quality
of an act… or

(b) of knowing that an act is wrong.

(I have eliminated those words with which we are
not here concerned.) Under the primary canon of construction to which I have
referred, ‘appreciating’ and ‘knowing’ must be different, otherwise the

[Page 1136]

Legislature would have employed one or the other
only. The meanings of the two verbs from which the participle form is derived
are separate and distinct in the ordinary usage of language.

“Appreciate” is defined in the Shorter Oxford
Dictionary, 1959, as:

1. trans. To form an estimate of
worth, quality, or amount…

2. …to be sensitive to, or sensible of, any
delicate impression or distinction…

The definition assigned to “appreciate” in the Random
House Dictionary of the English Language, 1973, is as follows:

2. to be fully conscious of; be aware of;
detect: to appreciate the dangers of a situation…

The participle “appreciating” is rendered in
French as “juger” which connotes a mental process approximating that of the
verb “to appreciate.” In Harrap’s Standard French and English Dictionary, 1962,
the verb is defined in part:

to think, believe; to be of opinion.

The definition of the verb “juger” as found in Larousse,
1952 is, in part:

Apercevoir, entre deux idées un rapport de
convenance ou de disconvenance.

and in the 1975 Larousse:

porter une appréciation sur les êtres ou
les choses.

On the other hand, the verb “to know” is defined
in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, 1959, as:

I …To recognize; to identify; to
distinguish…

II. To be acquainted with (a thing, place,
person); to be familiar with;… to have personal experience of (something) as
affecting oneself.

…

III. 1. To be aware or apprised of… to
become cognizant of, ascertain…

3. To apprehend or comprehend as fact or
truth…

and in Random House, the verb “to know”
is given these definitions:

1. to perceive or understand as fact or
truth; to apprehend clearly and with certainty:…

[Page 1137]

2. to have established or fixed in the mind
or memory;

…

3. to be cognizant or aware of; be
acquainted with (a thing, place, person, etc.), as by sight, experience, or
report:

5. to be able to distinguish, as one from
another:

The French version of s. 16(2)  employs
“savoir” where “knowing” is found in the English version. Harrap’s gives
the meanings:

to know; to be aware of.

Larousse gives, inter
alia, the following meaning:

avoir conscience de quelque chose.

In the ordinary usage of these words in the
language, therefore, it would appear that to appreciate embraces the act of
knowing but the converse is not necessarily true. This lies behind the comment
in Black’s Legal Dictionary, 4th ed., 1951, at p. 130:

Appreciate may be synonymous with “know” or
“understand.”

The verb “know” has a positive connotation
requiring a bare awareness, the act of receiving information without more. The
act of appreciating, on the other hand, is a second stage in a mental process
requiring the analysis of knowledge or experience in one manner or another. It
is therefore clear on the plain meaning of the section that Parliament
intended that for a person to be insane within the statutory definition, he
must be incapable firstly of appreciating in the analytical sense the nature
and quality of the act or of knowing in the positive sense that his act was
wrong. With these processes, of course, the Schwartz case was in no way
concerned. The psychiatrists, in preparing for trial, either misconstrued the
judgment and thereby the definition contained in s. 16 , or the judgment
was misconstrued for them in their preparation for testimony before the
tribunal, and it matters not which is the case.

These words were the subject of comment in the Report
of the Royal Commission on The Law of Insanity as a Defence in Criminal Cases (Canada

[Page 1138]

Queen’s Printer, 1956) (Chairman, Chief Justice
J.C. McRuer):

An examination of the civil law of England
and Canada shows that there is an important difference between “know” or
“knowledge” on the one hand and “appreciate” or “appreciation” on the other
when used and applied to a given set of circumstances. This is best illustrated
by the principles of law underlying those cases in which the maxim volenti
non fit injuria is involved. There is a clear distinction between mere
knowledge of the risk and appreciation of both the risk and the danger.

(at p. 12)

The same process of interpretation of the words
“knowing” and “appreciating” as they are employed in s. 16(2)  may also be
found in the judgment of this Court in Gary Albert Cooper v. The Queen[3] (reasons issued March 3, 1980,
unreported), in a case also involving a charge of murder.

I turn now to the question of the propriety of
the reference by witnesses to the law as it is said to be enunciated in
specific judgments of the courts. In Stavroff v. The Queen[4] (judgment rendered October 2, 1979)
this Court was concerned with the propriety of the presiding judge instructing
the jury on the applicable law by making explicit reference to judgments of
other courts, including those of this Court. Of that practice, McIntyre J.
speaking on behalf of the Court stated:

While the adoption of this course by a
trial judge will not always amount to error in law, it is generally to be
avoided. The trial judge faces a task of great difficulty in charging a jury.
He must explain the law and he must as well relate the law to the facts. While
he is entitled to comment on and express opinions on the evidence, he must
always keep in mind the separate functions of the judge and jury and avoid any
interference with the jury’s prerogative to find facts. The trial judge is
fully entitled to all the assistance he can find in the decided cases and other
authorities and he is entitled to utilize the language of learned judges and
authors in making his explanations and in answering questions.

I refer to that decision (although it deals not
with instruction of witnesses by counsel or by their own

[Page 1139]

research but rather with instruction of juries
in the law by judges) because it illustrates the sensitivity of the courts to
the practice of leaving to laymen the problem of the analysis of and the
conclusions to be drawn from individual judgments of courts of law dealing with
the same or similar issues. Whether the law be placed before the jury
indirectly through a witness or directly by a judge, by reference to earlier
decisions, the same risks and dangers exist. However, here the dangers are more
pronounced because a witness, by misdirecting himfelf as to the law, can
fatally mislead the trier of fact, be it judge or jury. Fortunately, the act of
self-misdirection was detected here, as it generally will be, by one of the
fundamental components of our adversarial trial system, namely the cross-examination
of witnesses by the opposing interest. It is clear beyond dispute that the
expert witnesses here had been misdirected as to the meaning of the Schwartz
case and hence the definition of insanity prescribed by Parliament in the Criminal
Code . This misdirection was taken up and restated to the jury in the charge
by the presiding justice. In the result the jury heard expert opinion evidence
which was founded on an erroneous understanding of the law of insanity. To
compound the problem, the jury was not thereafter properly instructed by the
presiding judge as to the law on this subject which was to be applied to the
facts when found by the jury, in the process of determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused. Hence the jury have not in law reached a determination
on the charge under which the accused was delivered to their custody.

The circumstances of this appeal fall squarely
within the specific provision made by Parliament in s. 613(1) (d),
which provision has been applied by the Court of Appeal in finding the accused
not guilty on account of insanity. Accordingly the appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Murder — Confession obtained by interrogation
specialist — Admissibility — Emotional disintegration of accused — Accused
under light hyp­notic state immediately prior to but not at time of giving
confession — Whether statement voluntary.

During the morning of June 16, 1975, the mother of
the appellant, Horvath, was murdered in her own bed by having her skull struck
repeatedly with a blunt instru­ment. About midnight of the same day, the
appellant, who was 17 years of age at the time, was arrested for suspicion of
murder, given the usual police warning, and was taken to detention cells. He
was there interrogated for just under three hours by two R.C.M.P. officers. The
appellant made certain oral declarations concerning his whereabouts on June 16,
the taking of the car of his mother's common law husband and his involvement in
two car accidents; but through the end of the interview he denied having killed
his mother.

The next day at about noon, the appellant
voluntarily underwent an interview which lasted some four hours with an
R.C.M.P. polygraph operator, Staff Sergeant Proke, although no actual polygraph
test was conducted. There was a complete taped transcript of what was said
during the four hours. During the interview, the officer left the appellant
alone in the interview room three separate times. During these three periods,
the appellant reflected aloud in what the trial judge called monologues or
soliloquies.

During the first monologue, the appellant vowed to
avenge his mother. During the second monologue, the appellant asked his mother
why she had asked him to kill her and he confessed having killed her by hitting
her over and over again. When the officer returned after the second monologue,
the appellant repeated the confession to him, and told him he had used a
baseball bat and had disposed of it in a certain location. During the third and
last monologue, the appellant asked his mother's for­giveness for having
disclosed the incident.

[Page 377]

Following the interview, the appellant provided the
R.C.M.P. investigating officers with a written signed confession. He also
accompanied them in a police car to the location where he had disposed of the
baseball bat, a towel, gloves and socks, all of which were recovered.

After a voir dire, the trial judge
ruled that the accused's first statement was inadmissible because it had been
""obtained in an atmosphere of oppression which may have spilled over, in
the accused's mind, to an atmosphere of threat"". The Crown did not appeal
from that ruling.

In the course of argument, the trial judge expressed
the view that the second statement was not tainted by the first. He said that
if it was ""tainted from within"", not by the first interview with the
investigating officers.

The trial judge finally ruled the second statement
inadmissible apart from any relationship with the first statement, because of
the factor of hypnosis. A psychia­trist, who had been called by the Crown, was
requested by the trial judge to listen to the entire tape of the interview. He
did so and prepared a written report which was received in evidence by consent.
The trial judge noted that the psychiatrist had said that following the first
soliloquy and continuing throughout until the end of the second soliloquy the
accused was in a light hypnotic state. The trial judge stated: ""Had [the
psy­chiatrist] not given the evidence of an hypnotic state, I would have, with
some misgivings, have admitted this statement. It is the accumulation of all
the factors .. . plus the factor of the subject having been, for a sizeable
part of the interview, in an hypnotic state immediately before the confession
came out, that have caused me to reject the statement.""

As for the third statement (the signed confession),
it was ruled out because it flew directly from the second statement and was
vitiated by the same factor.

On appeal by the Crown from the appellant's acquit­tal
upon the verdict of the jury, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that
the second and third state­ments were admissible. That Court relied upon Ibrahim
v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599, among other authorities, and upon the words
of Viscount Sumner: ""It has long been established as a positive rule of
English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence
against him unless it is shewn by the prosecu­tion to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority.""

[Page 378]

The appeal was allowed, the acquittal set aside and a
new trial ordered. From that judgment the accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of acquit­tal
restored.

Per Spence and Estey JJ.: Rather than placing
emphasis on the existence of any hypnosis, reliance was placed on all of the
circumstances and particularly the finding of the trial judge that under the
circumstances of the four-hour interview the complete emotional disin­tegration
of the appellant had been brought about. It was really for this reason that the
trial judge ruled that the statement as well as the other supporting material
such as the tapes of the questioning and soliloquies were inadmissible.

The requirement to establish the admissibility at
trial of a statement made by an accused person to persons in authority has been
oft cited as simply that it is free and voluntary. There has been repeatedly
throughout the cases emphasis on the fact that the statement must be voluntary
and often such words as ""of free will"" are added. Here, the appellant
was 17 years of age. He was of a most unstable character, diagnosed by the
Crown psychiatrist as being a sociopathic personality who had boasted that he
owned three fine automobiles, that he had been the manager of one department of
a large company, who had said to a youth who was his friend that he was so
anxious to obtain a fine car that he would take the money from his mother and
even kill her, and then this boy was hammered in cross-examination by two most
impressive police officers and then taken by a skilled and proved interrogation
specialist and, with what the psychiatrist described as the most suggestive of
questions, taken through a three-phase examination so that the trial judge
characterized his condition at that time as one of ""complete emotional
disintegration"". No statement made by that accused under those circum­stances
could be imagined to be voluntary, and nothing in the authorities indicated
that the law was otherwise.

Per Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The trial judge was
right in ruling the appellant's second and third statements inad­missible.
Horvath's state of hypnosis began at some point in time after his first monologue
while he was being interrogated by Sergeant Proke; he remained in that state
until the officer re-entered the interrogation room at the end of the second
monologue. Following the first monologue, the interrogator sensed that Horvath
was more vulnerable and his manner and voice took on an hypnotic quality to
which Horvath did in fact respond by slipping into a state of light hypnosis.
This

[Page 379]

was induced hypnosis in the sense that Sergeant Proke
was instrumental in bringing it about, albeit unwittingly.

Nothing that Horvath said under hypnosis was volun­tary
in the legal sense. In typical legal fashion, the test of voluntariness is
expressed negatively in the Ibrahim rule by reference to instances of
involuntariness: a statement obtained by hope of advantage, (a promise), or
fear of prejudice, (a threat), exercised, held out or inspired by a person in
authority, is involuntary in the eyes of the law.

The enumeration in the rule of instances of involun­tariness
cannot be limitative since the rule is a judge-made rule and anything said by a
judge beyond what is necessary to decide the issue is obiter. Furthermore,
the principle which inspires the rule remains a positive one; it is the
principle of voluntariness. The principle always governs and may justify an
extension of the rule to situations where involuntariness has been caused
otherwise than by promises, threats, hope or fear, if it is felt that other
causes are as coercive as promises or threats, hope or fear and serious enough
to bring the principle into play. The principle behind the rule justified that
the rule be extended to cover the circumstances of the present case.

As to the question whether the second and third
statements were tainted by the circumstances which preceded them and more particularly
by the involuntari­ness of the statement made under hypnosis in the course of
the second monologue, that monologue and the second and third statements were
part of a continuous and very short process. Each stage of the process aroused
the other in quick succession. The third statement found its polluted source in
the second statement and the second statement in the equally polluted source of
the second monologue uttered under hypnosis. Both statements were as vitiated
as their source and equally involuntary and inadmissible.

Per Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ., dissenting:
The Court of Appeal correctly stated the law to be applied in Canada in
determining the admissibility of a statement to a police officer by an accused
person. The question as to whether a broader rule of exclusion than that stated
by Viscount Sumner in the Ibrahim case ought to be applied was raised
and met in R. v. Fitton, [1956) S.C.R. 958.

This was not an appropriate case in which to consider
""oppression"" as defined in the English Judges' Rules. The appellant's
statement was not prompted by oppressive [sic]

[Page 380]

conduct. It was not forced from him. He had ""a
very strong basic wish to unburden himself"". As stated in R. v. Isequilla,
[1975] 1 W.L.R. 716, to exclude the statement there must have been
""some conduct on the part of authority which is improper or
unjustified"".

As to the question whether the second and third
statements were tainted, the condition of the accused, in a light hypnotic
state, which would have excluded the statement then made, no longer continued
at the time the statements in issue were made. The case was compa­rable to that
in which a statement is made while in a state of shock. The fact that that
statement might be inadmissible would not preclude the admission of a later
statement made after the state of shock had ceased to exist. The only test to
be applied as to the admissibility of the later statement would be whether the
condition which rendered the first statement inadmissible had ceased. In the present
case the evidence of the psychia­trist established that the light hypnotic
state had ended before the later statements were made.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia allowing an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal of the appellant on
a charge of murder following a trial by judge and jury. Appeal allowed,
Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

Dennis D. G. Milne, for the appellant. 

R. D. Shantz, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which allowed an appeal by the
Crown from the acquittal of the appellant follow­ing a trial by a judge and
jury. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred in law in
refusing to admit in evidence two statements made by the appellant to a police
officer. A new trial was ordered.

[Page 381]

During the morning of June 16, 1975, the appel­lant's mother,
Anna Horvath, was murdered in her own bed by having her skull struck repeatedly
with a blunt instrument. About midnight of the same day, the appellant, who was
seventeen years of age at the time, was arrested for suspicion of murder, given
the usual policy warning, and was taken to detention cells. He was there
interrogated for about two hours and one half by two R.C.M.P. officers. No
confession of any kind was made at that time.

The next day at about noon, the appellant volun­tarily underwent
an interview which lasted some four hours with an R.C.M.P. polygraph operator,
Staff Sergeant Proke, although no actual polygraph test was conducted. There is
a complete taped transcript of what was said during the four hours. During the
interview, the officer left the appellant alone in the interview room three
sepa­rate times. During these three periods, the appel­lant reflected aloud in
what the trial judge called monologues or soliloquies.

During the first monologue, the appellant vowed to avenge his
mother. During the second mono­logue, the appellant asked his mother why she
had asked him to kill her and he confessed having killed her by hitting her
over and over again. When the officer returned after the second mono­logue, the
appellant repeated the confession to him, and told him he had used a baseball
bat and had disposed of it in a certain location. During the third and last
monologue, the appellant asked his mother's forgiveness for having disclosed
the incident.

Following the interview, the appellant provided the R.C.M.P.
investigating officers with a written signed confession. He also accompanied
them in a police car to the location where he had disposed of the baseball bat,
a towel, gloves and socks, all of which were recovered.

The Crown sought to introduce as evidence in the case the
statement made by the appellant to Sergeant Proke, following the second
monologue, and also the written statement made at the end of the interview. A
voir dire was held. The trial judge requested Dr. Stephenson, a
psychiatrist who had

[Page 382]

been called by the Crown, to listen to the entire tape of the
interview. He did so and prepared a written report which was received in
evidence by consent.

The trial judge refused to receive the two state­ments in
evidence. In making that decision he appears to rely upon a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of New Zealand in Naniseni v. The Queen[1],
and, in particular upon the following passage from the judgment of Turner
J., who deliv­ered the judgment of the Court, at p. 274:

But in our opinion the word ""voluntary"", where
used to describe the essential characteristic of an admissible confession, must
be taken to signify that the will of the person making the confession has not
been overborne by that of any other person. If the factor which is set up as
rendering the confession not voluntary is something in the nature of threats,
violence, force, or other form of compulsion, to use the words of our own
Evidence Act, or, to adopt the enumeration of Dixon J. in R. v. McDermott, (1948)
76 C.L.R. 501, ""duress, intimida­tion, persistent importunity, or
sustained or undue insist­ence or pressure"", whatever is alleged as an
inducement must have been brought to bear on the prisoner by some other
person, and to have influenced him to make the confession.

A summary of the reasoning which led to the refusal to admit the
statements is contained in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, as follows:

I turn now to some of the things said by the trial judge in
making his ruling to reject those two state­ments. He tells us that the tape
was what he called auditioned by the psychiatrist, Dr. Stephenson, whom he
described as a respected and well-known practitioner. He goes further and says,
""As to Dr. Stephenson's evidence, the credibility of it is
impeccable"". I quote now in part from what the trial judge said when
giving his ruling:

""What Dr. Stephenson said, and it was unequivocal and
not questioned by the Crown, was that following the first soliloquy and
continuing throughout until the end of the second soliloquy ... the interrogatee,
namely, the accused Horvath, was in a light hypnotic state. Throughout the
second soliloquy, I assume that the accused thought he was alone. When Proke
came back into the room, after the second soliloquy, he had heard in it things
which assured him what he had already firmly surmised. Dr. Stephenson notes
that at

[Page 383]

that point Proke started re-examining, and it was then that
the young man came out of his hypnotic state"".

The trial judge then read two extracts from the written
report of Dr. Stephenson which were admitted in evidence at the trial by
consent, and those two paragraphs read as follows:

""It is axiomatic that a person under hypnosis (whatever
its depth) cannot be forced to do or say anything to which he has not already
given tacit consent. In my opinion, this subject had a very strong basic wish
to unburden himself and his ambivalence over it is expressed in monologues 2 &
3.

In my opinion his initial denial was based on involun­tary
repression of the painful material and not mere concealment. Therefore, when
the painful material becomes conscious, his telling of it is essentially a
voluntary act, even though there is a strong possibility he was in a light
hypnotic state up to the end of the second monologue. In my opinion, by the
time he begins to relate his mother's death wish he is in full and voluntary
control of his faculties and remained so until the end of the tape.""

That is the end of the extract from the psychiatrist's
report. The trial judge continues:

""I accept that last paragraph, of course. After the end
of the second interview, and after Sergeant Proke started again to question him
he came out of the hypnotic state, but he had been in a state of total
emotional disintegration.""

[The trial judge was careful to point out that the phrase
""emotional disintegration"" was his phrase and not that of Dr.
Stephenson.]

Then after some references to authorities on this subject, the
trial judge continued:

""Had Dr. Stephenson not given the evidence of an
hypnotic state, I would have, with some misgivings, have admitted this
statement. It is the accumulation of all the factors, and I have dealt with
those, plus the factor of the subject having been, for a sizeable part of the
interview, in an hypnotic state immediately before the confession came out,
that have caused me to reject the statement. This ruling is given with very
real regret that police work as skilful as this should end in frustration of
its purpose.""

Again the trial judge said:

""It is the factor of hypnotism which has tipped the
balance against admission in this case.""

[Page 384]

The trial judge did not criticize the questioning technique used
by Sergeant Proke in his interview with the appellant. He says of it that it
was ""the most skilful example of police interrogation that has ever come
to my attention in 36 years as a lawyer and a judge"".

Sergeant Proke testified that he did not attempt to hypnotize the
appellant. The appellant did not give evidence either at the voir dire
or at the trial.

The Court of Appeal, unanimously, held that the trial judge had
erred in refusing to admit the statements. McFarlane J.A., who delivered the
judgment of the Court, said:

Turning then to what I consider the principal ground of
appeal, it is important, in my opinion, to remember that in cases of this sort
the tribunal of fact is the jury. Our law has determined that there is one
aspect of fact with relation to statements by accused persons which falls
within the province of the judge in the first instance. The scope of the
judge's duty and responsibili­ty in that connection is, however, a limited one.
If statements by an accused are admitted in evidence, it ultimately is the
responsibility of the jury to decide what weight, if any, shall be given to
them. The extent of the field in which the judge must make findings of fact is,
in my opinion, firmly established in our law.

He referred to the judgment of the Privy Coun­cil in Ibrahim
v. The King[2], and
the judgments of this Court in Boudreau v. The King[3],
and in The Queen v. Fitton[4]. He
went on to say:

It is therefore clear, and I must say it again, that the
function of the judge so far as the facts are concerned is to determine whether
the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the statement by the accused
person was a voluntary statement in the sense that it has not been obtained
from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out (or I
insert inspired) by a person in authority.

After reviewing the reasons given by the trial judge for refusing
to admit the statements he concluded:

Now tying the law as I tried to state it very briefly before
I referred to the facts of this case, it is, in my opinion, clear that the
trial judge applied a wrong test in determining whether these two statements
should be

[Page 385]

allowed to go before the jury. Assuming that he was right in
finding that there was an emotional disintegra­tion, the evidence is clear that
the statements were not obtained by hope of advantage or fear [or] prejudice
exercised, held out, or inspired, by a person in authority.

The question whether any weight should be attached to
confessions made in the circumstances which I have described is a question for
the jury, and not a question for the judge, in my opinion. The judge exceeded
the scope of the functions which the law gives to him and I am afraid invaded
the field of the jury.

In my opinion McFarlane J.A., correctly stated the law to be
applied in Canada in determining the admissibility of a statement to a police
officer by an accused person. The question as to whether a broader rule of
exclusion than that stated by Viscount Sumner in the Ibrahim case ought
to be applied was raised and met in the Fitton case. The facts in that
case were as follows:

The accused, having been taken to the police station early
in the morning, and there given an account of his movements on the previous
evening, was left there all day, not formally under arrest. About 5 p.m. the
police officers returned and told the accused that they had been working all
day on the case (one of murder) and that they had discovered further facts
indicating that what he had told them in the morning was untrue. The accused
thereupon ""blurted out"" a damaging statement, whereupon he was
stopped and given a formal warning in respect of a charge of murder, after
which he made a statement, obtained in the form of question and answer, that
was reduced to writing and signed by him.

The trial judge admitted the oral statement and the written
statement in evidence. On appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the
statement was inadmissible. Aylesworth J.A. and Roach J.A. dissented. The Crown
then appealed to this Court on the basis that the dissent was on a question of
law. Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. were of the opinion that the dissent was on
a question of fact, and, thus, the Court was without jurisdiction. The other
seven members of the Court took the opposite view, The issue of law is delineat­ed
in the judgment of Fauteux J. (as he then was) at p. 984, as follows:

With reference to the rule of law governing the admissi­bility
of the extrajudicial admissions made by the

[Page 386]

respondent in the present instance, Roach J.A., for the
minority, said [[1956] O.R. at pp. 725-6]:

There can be no doubt as to the rule. It was stated by
Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 at 609, as
follows: ""It has long been estab­lished as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in
the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority.""

There is no positive rule of evidence that if improp­er
questions are asked of a prisoner in custody the answers to them are, merely on
that account, inad­missible. The cases are reviewed by Kellock J. in Boudreau
v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262 at 270 et seq., 94 C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R.
427, [1949] 3 D.L.R. 81. I do not review them here. In determining whether the
answers made are admissible or not, the Court inevi­tably must come back to the
primary question: Were they made voluntarily in the sense described in
the rule as laid down by Viscount Sumner, supra.

(The italics are mine.)

On the other hand, Pickup C.J.O, for the majority, stated
[[1956] O.R. at p. 714]:

In my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting
upon it by merely adducing oral testimo­ny showing that an incriminating
statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage, That statement of the rule of law is too
narrow. The admissions must not have been ""improperly instigated or
induced or coerced"": per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra, at
p. 269. The admissions must be self-impelled and the statement must be the
statement of a man ""free in volition from compulsion or inducements of
authority"".

Thus it appears that Roach J.A., with the concurrence of Aylesworth
J.A., held the view that the decision of this Court in Boudreau v. The King did
not change the law as stated by Viscount Sumner and that a declaration made by
an accused is a voluntary statement if it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. In the view of Pickup C.J.O. and Laidlaw and Schroeder JJ.A., this
statement of the rule is too narrow and in addition to proving that the
statement has not been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, the
prosecution must further show that the statement

[Page 387]

was not otherwise influenced by the course of conduct
adopted by the police, that it must be self-impelled, failing which it is not a
voluntary one in the sense required by law.

Having concluded that an issue of law was raised by the dissent
of Roach and Aylesworth JJ.A., Fauteux J. went on to say that he agreed
with the views expressed by those judges. On this point, Kerwin C.J. was in
agreement, as were all the other members of the Court except Cartwright
J., who did not express any view on this point.

Rand J., in the Fitton case had this to say, at p. 962:

The Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the majori­ty of
the Court of Appeal, has treated the expression ""freely and
voluntarily"", used in Boudreau v. The King, as if it connoted only
a spontaneous statement, one unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the
conduct of the police officers; but with the greatest respect that is an
erroneous interpretation of what was there said. The language quoted must be
read primarily in the light of the matters that were being considered. As the
opening words show, there was no intention of departing from the rule as laid
down in the authorities mentioned; the phrase ""free in volition from the
compulsions or inducements of authority"" [Boudreau v. The King, supra, at
p. 269] means free from the compulsion of apprehension of prejudice and the
inducement of hope for advantage, if an admission is or is not made. That fear
or hope could be instigated, induced or coerced, all these terms referring to
the element in the mind of the confessor which actuated or drew out the
admission. It might be called the induced motive of the statement, i.e., to
avoid prejudice or reap benefit. As Professor Wigmore intimates, the terms
promise or threat may be reduced to the word ""inducement"", but that
again may raise a question of meaning; and the justification of the
illustrative use of other words is that together they indicate the general
conception of influence of a certain kind producing the admission. Even the
word ""volun­tary"" is open to question; in what case can it be said
that the statement is not voluntary in the sense that it is the expression of a
choice, that it is willed to be made? But it is the character of the influence
of idea or feeling behind that act of willing and its source which the rule
seizes upon. Nothing said in Boudreau v. The King was intended to
introduce a new quality of that influence.

In other words, to render a statement of the accused to a
police officer inadmissible there must

[Page 388]

be the compulsion of apprehension of prejudice or the inducement
of hope of advantage whether that apprehension or hope be instigated, induced
or coerced.

The rule as to admissibility of a confession, in England, is
stated in Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed.), vol. 11, p. 231, para.
410, as being:

It is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in
evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to
a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person,
that it shall have been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained
from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised or held out by a
person in author­ity, or by oppression.

The footnote points out that this statement is contained in the
introduction to the Judges' Rules and that it was approved by Lord Reid in Com­missioners
of Customs and Excise v. Harz[5], at
pp. 818 and 821.

The word ""oppression"" appeared for the first time in
the Judges' Rules in 1964. ""Oppressive questioning"" was defined in The
Queen v. Prager[6], as
""questioning which by its nature, duration or other attendant
circumstances (including the fact of custody) excites hopes (such as the hope
of release) or fears, or so affects the mind of the suspect that his will
crumbles and he speaks when otherwise he would have remained silent"".

Nonetheless, in that case leave to appeal from conviction was
refused. One of the grounds for the application was based upon the alleged
inadmissi­bility of a statement made by the accused to police officers. The
police officers had questioned the accused on three occasions in one day, from
9:15 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., from 5:45 p.m. to about 7:40 p.m. and from 7:40 p.m.
to 11:30 p.m.

In The Queen v. Isequilla[7], the
facts and con­clusions are set out in the headnote as follows:

[Page 389]

The defendant was the passenger in a car which stopped
outside a bank. Three police officers, two of whom were armed, came towards the
car. One police officer chased the driver, the second jumped into the car and
placed handcuffs on the defendant and the third, holding a gun, went to the
near side of the car. The defendant reached down to a briefcase at his feet. A
police officer took the case and, on opening it, found an imitation gun and a
note written by the defendant, which stated, ""Keep calm. Hand over £3,000
or I'll blow your head off."" The defendant was asked what the articles
were for; he began to cry, saying that he had been stupid. He was taken to the
police car and, still crying, he repeated that he had been stupid that he was
short of money and was trying to get some from the bank. He was cautioned. He
was obviously frightened and, on the journey to the police station and at the
police station, he became more and more hysterical. He made a confession
statement. At his trial, the defence contended that the statement was not
admissible in evidence. The judge ruled that the police had acted properly and
the statement was admissible. The defendant was convicted and appealed.

On the question whether the confession statement was
inadmissible because (1) the police officers' conduct was such as to amount to
an inducement although that was not their intention and they had acted
properly: and (2) the defendant's mental state was such as to deprive him of
the capacity to choose freely whether to confess or not:

Held, dismissing the appeal, (1) that a confession
statement was inadmissible where there had been an improper or unjustifiable
inducement by someone in authority making threats or promises; that fright
caused by a justified violent arrest made by police officers carrying guns
could not be an improper inducement and, accordingly, the defendant's fear
caused by the police officers' acts and words during the arrest was not a
ground for ruling that the confession statement was not voluntary.

(2) That the fact that the defendant was frightened and
crying and later became hysterical was not a mental state that rendered the
confession statement unreliable or untrustworthy so that it should be excluded.

In the judgment, following references to authorities, including Naniseni
v. The Queen, referred to by the trial judge in the present case, the Court
of Appeal, at p. 720, said this:

[Page 390]

Those cases, and there are many others, all as it seems to
us proceed on this basis, that to rule a confession out as being inadmissible
at law it must be shown it was not voluntary in the sense that it was procured
by inducement of some form, either threats or promises offered by a person in
authority at the particular situation in which the confession was made. The
rule has not, as we see it, substantially changed over the years except in the
following respects. In the first place this century has probably shown a more
generous attitude to the suspect in the application of the rule; by that I mean
that although the principle has remained the same, the courts have perhaps been
over-generous in accepting as an inducement for present purposes something
which would be unlikely to induce the average man.

Furthermore, the conception of the confession being made or
the inducement offered in the presence of a person in authority has been
extended to the point where the authority in question is perhaps minimal, but
the principle is not affected.

The only possible addition to the principle which one finds
in the English books at the present time is that exemplified in the recent case
of Reg. v. Prager [1972] 1 W.L.R. 260, where it is established
that interrogation by police officers if carried on to the point of oppression
may be held to have destroyed the will of the suspect who was being
interrogated, and thus prevented a subse­quent confession from being treated as
a voluntary confession. That is I think another example of the confession
ceasing to be voluntary because of some failure on the part of authority to
observe the rules which naturally must govern situations of this kind.

The Court later went on to say:

In the first place we accept what Mr. Denny, for the Crown,
has said, which to some extent has been made out by the reference to authority
included in this judg­ment, that under the existing law the exclusion of a
confession as a matter of law because it is not voluntary is always related to
some conduct on the part of author­ity which is improper or unjustified.
Included in the phrase ""improper or unjustified"" of course must be
the offering of an inducement, because it is improper in this context for those
in authority to try to induce a suspect to make a confession. Counsel for the
Crown says, and we agree, that if one looks to the authorities there is no case
in the books which indicates that a confession can be regarded as not voluntary
by reason of the present grounds, unless there is some element of impropriety
on the part of those in authority. That seems to be the case, and we can see no
justification for extending the princi­ple today.

[Page 391]

I have already said that the law as to the admissibility of a
statement by an accused person to a police officer was settled in the Fitton
case. Counsel for the appellant has invited the Court to expand the grounds
for ruling a statement to be inadmissible. This is not an appropriate case in
which to consider ""oppression"" as defined in the English rule because
the trial judge made no find­ing of oppression by Sergeant Proke. As is pointed
out by the Court of Appeal, he would have admit­ted the statement had it not
been for the evidence of Dr. Stephenson of an hypnotic state. In this
connection the doctor's report is significant. I repeat these passages:

It is axiomatic that a person under hypnosis (whatever its
depth) cannot be forced to do or say anything to which he has not already given
tacit consent. In my opinion, this subject had a very strong basic wish to
unburden himself and his ambivalence over it is expressed in monologues 2 &
3.

In my opinion his initial denial was based on involuntary
repression of the painful material and not mere concealment. Therefore, when
the painful material becomes conscious, his telling of it is essentially a
voluntary act, even though there is a strong possibility he was in a light
hypnotic state up to the end of the second monologue. In my opinion, by the
time he begins to relate his mother's death wish he is in full and voluntary
control of his faculties and remained so until the end of the tape.

The appellant's statement was not prompted by oppressive conduct.
It was not forced from him. He had ""a very strong basic wish to unburden
himself"".

I agree with the statement in the Isequilla case, already
cited, that to exclude the statement there must have been ""some conduct on
the part of authority which is improper or unjustified"".

Since preparing the above reasons I have had the opportunity to
consider the reasons of my brother Beetz and I would like to make a few
additional comments.

The Crown did not seek to introduce in evidence the statements
made by the appellant while he was in, what Dr. Stephenson describes as ""a
light hypnotic state"". The two statements which the

[Page 392]

Crown sought to introduce in evidence were made after he was
""in full and voluntary control of his faculties"". Had the Crown
sought to introduce the statements made while the appellant was in a light
hypnotic state, it is clear that they would not have been admitted by the trial
judge, but the refusal to admit them would not have been because of threats or
inducements by a person in authority, but because the appellant, at the time
those state­ments were made, was not in a condition which would make it safe to
admit them.

Reference has been made to the judgment of Lord Parker C.J. in R.
v. Smith[8], at p.
41, where he says:

The court thinks that the principle to be deduced from the
cases is really this: that if the threat or promise under which the first
statement was made still persists when the second statement is made, then it is
inadmiss­ible. Only if the time-limit between the two statements, the
circumstances existing at the time and the caution are such that it can be said
that the original threat or inducement has been dissipated can the second
statements be admitted as a voluntary statement.

All of the cases, to which. reference has been made, which
consider the proposition stated above, are cases which had to consider whether
a threat or promise which rendered an initial statement inadmissible continued
to have effect when a later statement was made. The question was whether the
later statement was tainted because of what had occurred prior to the making of
an earlier statement.

In my opinion that question does not arise in the present case.
There is no evidence of threats or inducement which led to the making of a
statement. The objection to the possible admission of the statement made while
in a light hypnotic state is not against the conduct of persons in authority
when that statement was made. The objection would arise because of the
condition of the appel­lant at that time which would make the statement
involuntary. That condition did not continue because, as Dr. Stephenson
testified, when the appellant began to relate his mother's death wish he was in
full and voluntary control of his faculties.

[Page 393]

The condition of the accused, in a light hyp­notic state, which
would have excluded the statement then made, no longer continued at the time
the statements, in issue in this case, were made. In my opinion, the case is
comparable to that in which a statement is made while in a state of shock. The
fact that that statement might be inadmissible would not preclude the admission
of a later statement made after the state of shock had ceased to exist. The
only test to be applied as to the admissibility of the later statement would be
whether the condition which rendered the first statement inadmissible had
ceased. In the present case, Dr. Stephenson's evidence establishes that the
light hypnotic state had ended before the later statements were made.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Estey JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.—I have had the opportunity to read the reasons for
judgment being delivered by Mr. Justice Martland. I have, however, come to a
different conclusion and such conclusion entails a rather detailed examination
of the evidence adduced as to the investigation of the offence and, more
particularly, the whole contact between the appellant and the police officers.

The trial took place before Gould J., an experienced trial court
judge, and he conducted a very lengthy voir dire after which he gave
reasons for his ruling in detail and with precision.

I take the facts, while I shall outline hereafter, from Gould J.'s
reasons for such ruling, as they appear in the Appeal Case.

The appellant was a 17-year-old youth charged with murdering his
mother. The appellant's mother had been discovered by her common law husband,
in the late afternoon of June 16, 1975, lying on her bed ""with her head
bludgeoned into a pulp"". Her son, the appellant, was arrested at about
midnight on his return to the apartment where his mother had been found earlier.
It appeared from the evidence that the appellant had taken a set of keys for
his so-called step-father's, Molnar's, car, which set of keys the late Mrs.

[Page 394]

Horvath kept in a dresser in her bedroom. He then had gone to
Molnar's place of work and taken the automobile without Molnar's knowledge,
picked up three young ladies and, in driving about Vancouver with them, got
into two minor accidents in each case leaving the scene without giving his
name. The appellant later in his statements averred that he feared to go home
with the damaged automobile and so did not arrive until midnight.

Within about twenty minutes after his arrest, interrogation of
the appellant commenced at the police station. That interrogation proceeded
from 12:20 a.m. until 3:10 a.m. without a break. It was carried out by two
R.C.M.P. constables, Delwisch and Charlton, each of whom sat at an end of a
table with the appellant sitting between them in the centre of the table. Gould
J., in his ruling, described this interrogation in these words:

Delwisch, I thought, was particularly honest to the court in
describing the whole technique of the interroga­tion. It was hot and furious.
The technique followed was for one, at one end of the table, to put a question
and then the other officer put another one. To use a phrase used by defence
counsel, they hammered him with shots from both sides, and that, for just under
three hours. They emphatically accused him of lying, accused him again and
again of lying, and told him at one time with reference to his demeanour and
way of answering ques­tions, in effect (I think the words were used) ""to
pack up that nonsense"".

Delwisch is an imposing officer in size, with a firm
personality. He is six-foot three, and weighs some 225 pounds.

Charlton is an older man, experienced, positive per­sonality,
and I have no hesitation in speculating that both these officers were a great
deal more positive that night in that interview room than they were in Court,
and in Court they were both well possessed of the situation and well able to
look after themselves.

Now, fairness is not a test whether or not a statement is
voluntary, but this statement was obtained in a manner of questioning, which in
my view, was oppressive.

He then made his ruling thereon in these words:

The facts, in outline, were put to Dr. Gordon Stephenson,
psychiatrist called by the Crown, and he was asked what he thought would be the
mental state of the interrogatee towards the end of the interview. He said

[Page 395]

that the thought that there would have been an atmos­phere
of oppression so great as to give the interrogatee a sense of being threatened.
I agree. Cross examination in interrogation, of course, is not fatal. Accusing
an inter­rogatee of not telling the truth, trying to persuade him to change his
ways and tell the truth are not fatal. But I exclude the first examination on
the grounds of the method used, the age of the accused, the circumstances of
the day he had been through, the hours of the morning, the length of the
interrogation, the technique used. It is that combination of circumstances
which leads me to hold that the first statement was obtained in an atmosphere
of oppression which may have spilled over, in the accused's mind, to an
atmosphere of threat. Either, in my view, oppression or threat, is sufficient
to exclude the statement. I am also of the view that if I have doubts, I should
favour then the position of exclu­sion rather than admission. However, in this
instance I am not wavering. I am firm in my opinion that, for the reasons I
have given, the statement is inadmissible.

The appellant was then left for the remainder of the night, that
is, from 3:10 a.m. on, in his cell. There is no doubt that the appellant was
properly treated at this time. Between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on the 17th of
June, the police officers took the appellant to the flat where the fatality
occurred and permitted him to change his clothes, he having been wearing police
provided coveralls after his arrest and until that time. He was then taken to
the R.C.M.P. headquarters in Vancouver ostensibly for a polygraph test which he
had con­sented to undergo. He waited outside a Sgt. Proke's office while one of
the constables briefed Proke, an action which would seem to have taken about
one hour. He then entered Sgt. Proke's office shortly after noon and was there
until 4:16 p.m. During that time, there was no attempt made to administer a
polygraph test. Sgt. Proke was an officer of the R.C.M.P. and had been trained
with great skill in interrogation techniques and he pro­ceeded on what Gould J.
described as ""the most skilful example of police interrogation that has
ever come to my attention in thirty-six years as a lawyer and judge"".
Gould J. described that exami­nation in some detail:

Let me sweep away some underbrush first of all. There was no
match between the interrogator and the interrogatee in mental strength. It was
a case intellectu­ally of a cat manoeuvering a mouse. This is not a

[Page 

[Page 396]

criticism. In fact, to have a police officer as intellectual­ly
adroit as this one interrogating prisoners, is, I think, highly desirable—a
matter of congratulation rather than any criticism. In that sense it was unfair
because there was no doubt as to who in the scene was the cat and who was the
mouse; but police interrogation is not a sporting event such that one is
interested in a fair match between the contestants. Of course, in many cases,
there is a vast difference in intellect between the interrogator and the interrogatee.
I have seen cases where the difference has run very much the other way.

Part of the technique used, and I won't do it justice with
the short description I am going to give it, was this: Horvath said that he
could remember nothing about his mother's death; that he was troubled with
something locked away in his mind. He denied it, of course, at first, but that
didn't last too long. Staff Proke very adroitly ingratiated himself early in
the interview with this man. It was a quite different atmosphere from the usual
""you did""—""I didn't"" technique of interrogation. Then when
what was described by Dr. Gordon Stephenson as Hor­vath's hysterical amnesia
was unshakingly stubborn, the officer commenced asking the accused as to
whether he couldn't see something, couldn't he see an image of his mother in
bed with blood around her. Now, that was no trickery because that's the way his
mother had been found. It's a true statement, and Proke kept putting this up,
and from the tape, it is clear that he brought about in this young man, under
these circumstances, within the four hours and four minutes involved, a
complete emotional disintegration. I don't say that in criticism. Under
appropriate circumstances that might be the culminating success of an
interrogation, and, were it not for one factor, which I am going to come to,
might have successfully culminated this interrogation. That is a factor number
one. One only has to listen to the tape to come to that conclusion. The phrase
""emotional disinte­gration"", by the way, is my phrase, not that of
Dr. Gordon Stephenson. Something that I suspected, from the tape, was quite
outside of my field, thus I was anxious to get help on it from an expert. That
is the reason why I asked Dr. Gordon Stephenson to listen to the tape and give
me the benefit of his views. That was the matter of hypnosis.

It is a strange and rather puzzling story. The interview may be
divided into three phases. During the first phase, Sgt. Proke proceeded to
question the appellant, and I shall refer to his techniques hereafter, and then
left the appellant alone. Although the appellant was unaware of it, a sound

[Page 397]

taping device picked up not only Sgt. Proke's questions and the
appellant's answers but any words that the appellant might have uttered during
the time when he thought he was alone in the room after Sgt. Proke had left it.
Those words, and there were many, were referred to by both Dr. Stephenson, to
whom reference shall be made later, and the learned trial judge, as
soliloquies, and the appellant's soliloquy after the first ques­tioning by Sgt.
Proke was described as a disclaim­er of any guilt in the murder of his mother
plus an avowal of vengeance upon whoever had been guilty. Thereafter, Sgt. Proke
returned to the interrogation room, knowing, of course, of the words that had
been spoken in his absence and which he had overheard and proceeded further
with his type of questioning. This second set of questioning was followed again
by Sgt. Proke's departure and a second soliloquy and in that solilo­quy the
appellant recited a story that his mother had begged him to kill her and
finally he had acquiesced in her demands and also that he had promised his
mother that he would not reveal that his mother had made such a request.

Following the second soliloquy, Sgt. Proke returned to the room and
further carried on his questioning, then again departed and left the appellant
alone and the third soliloquy occurred. In that soliloquy, the appellant begged
his moth­er's forgiveness for having revealed the secret of her request that he
should kill her. Again, upon the return of Sgt. Proke, there was reference made
in the conversations between the appellant and Sgt. Proke to what had been said
in these mono­logues. Thereafter, the officers proceeded to put into a
statement the story they had obtained from the appellant in this fashion.

Later, the appellant accompanied the police officers to a point
in an area described as Burnaby Mountain and there, at the appellant's
direction, the police officers recovered a baseball bat, two socks and two
gloves. At the trial, it was proved that there was a small amount of hair on
one of the socks and some blood on the baseball bat which, however, could not
be typed. Nothing was shown on the gloves. The only way that any of these three
items could be associated with the

[Page 398]

appellant was (a) from the appellant's statement, and (b) from
the evidence which was given at the trial that he did so accompany the officers
and so indicate the position of where the articles were found. The statement
was, as I shall show, exclud­ed by the learned trial judge.

When the Crown requested a voir dire to determine
the admissibility of this statement, evidence in reference thereto was given
not only by police officers but by Dr. Gordon H. Stephenson, a physician
holding a specialist's certificate in psy­chiatry who was on the staff of
Vancouver General Hospital, a professor of psychiatry, and consultant to the
Provincial Attorney General's Department. As I have said, Dr. Stephenson was
called by the Crown. He had examined the appellant on the 23rd of July, that
is, some five weeks after the offence. Dr. Stephenson's evidence upon examina­tion
by the Crown was that he found nothing which would indicate a distortion or
disorder of the appellant's thought processes which would render the appellant
incapable of appreciating the nature and quality or the consequences of his
acts, nor was there anything in the appellant's thought stream that would
indicate that he had any dif­ficulty in knowing an act to be wrong. Dr. Ste­phenson
gauged the appellant's intelligence as being within the normal range. This
evidence given by Dr. Stephenson in conjunction with and in answer to a most
general question was most evi­dently addressed to the issue of sanity under the
provisions of s. 16  of the Criminal Code , yet there had been no defence
of insanity adduced and the evidence was given on a voir dire in
the absence of the jury purportedly for the purpose of determin­ing whether a
statement made by the appellant was admissible.

Dr. Stephenson did continue to give other evi­dence which
indicated that the appellant suffered from what he termed a personality
disorder describing it as a sociopathic personality and the appellant's past
history as described by the appel­lant to him ""indicated a tendency toward
impul­siveness, hedonism, that is to say, an impulsive indulgence in immediate
pleasures without regard for future consequences, immediate satisfaction
without regard to future consequences, a certain

[Page 399]

amount of emotional blunting which I felt verged on callousness,
a grandiose boastfulness and a recklessness of consequences"".

It was quite evident that upon hearing the evi­dence of Dr.
Stephenson the learned trial judge was perplexed and perhaps irritated and at
his suggestion, Dr. Stephenson, over a week's adjournment, took the complete
tapes of Sgt. Proke's examination of the appellant and the appellant's three
soliloquies and read them over and then prepared a report for submission to the
Court. Following this, Dr. Stephenson again testified, being examined by the
Crown, and gave much most significant evidence. Dr. Stephenson was of the
opinion that Sgt. Proke skilfully played upon his subject's (the appellant's)
feelings and latent pleasures to bring the material into consciousness. He was
of the opinion that the appellant's first soliloquy was not a denial of guilt
because of an intention to hide it but was rather the involuntary repression of
painful memories and that when Sgt. Proke, by skilful questioning, brought into
con­sciousness those memories, the appellant recounted them in his soliloquy as
a voluntary act. Dr. Ste­phenson said that, whether deliberately or not, Sgt. Proke's
manner and voice took on an hypnotic quality and that the appellant slipped
into a mild hypnotic state which lasted through the first two soliloquies. Sgt.
Proke, in his evidence, had denied that he had intended to hypnotize the
appellant. It was Dr. Stephenson's view that the appellant's answers were
voluntary but it must be remem­bered that they were voluntary only under the
circumstances which I have most briefly described. In referring to the effect
of hypnosis, Dr. Stephenson said:

It is axiomatic that a person under hypnosis (whatever its
depth) cannot be forced to do or say anything to which he has not already given
tacit consent. In my opinion, this subject had a very strong basic wish to
unburden himself, and his ambivalence over it is expressed in monologues two
and three—and ""ambiva­lence"", my lord, means a divided opinion.

Dr. Stephenson gave his opinion that what was said by the
appellant in each of the three solilo­quies or, as they were sometimes called,
mono­logues, was ""the truth as he saw it"". Dr. Stephenson

[Page 400]

agreed, upon cross-examination, that the appellant was, during
the interview, always under a very considerable degree of emotional stress and
that it was fair to say that the interrogator, there referring to Sgt. Proke,
was suggesting in very strong terms that the appellant ought to face or reveal
things that he was hiding or supposedly hiding from the interrogator, that the
interrogator was trying to get this individual to reveal incriminating material
about himself, and finally, that despite his earlier answer, which I have
quoted, he agreed with counsel for the appellant that the person in an hypnotic
state was more susceptible to the power of suggestion than he would be
normally. In his ruling, the learned trial judge depended much upon the
hypnosis, saying, in part:

Had Dr. Stephenson not given the evidence of an hypnotic
state, I would have, with some misgivings, have admitted this statement. It is
the accumulation of all the factors, and I have dealt with those, plus the
factor of the subject having been, for a sizeable part of the interview, in an
hypnotic state immediately before the confession came out, that have caused me
to reject the statement. This ruling is given with very real regret that police
work as skilful as this should end in frustration of its purpose.

I place no such emphasis on the existence of any hypnosis but
rather I rely on all of the circum­stances which I have outlined and I rely
particular­ly on the specific finding of the learned trial judge who had heard
all of the evidence including that given by Constables DeIwisch and Charlton,
Sgt. Proke and Dr. Stephenson, and who, in the ruling which I have cited, found
that under the circum­stances within the four hours and four minutes involved
the complete emotional disintegration of the appellant had been brought about.
It was really for this reason that the learned trial judge ruled that the
statement as well as the other supporting material such as the tapes of the
ques­tioning and soliloquies were inadmissible, and it is for this reason I am
of the opinion that the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia should be allowed and that the judgment of the learned trial
judge restored.

McFarlane J.A., in giving the reasons for the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia, quoted the

[Page 401]

oft-cited statement of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[9],
at p. 609:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.

It is my strong opinion that Ibrahim and the many cases
which followed have not and need not be considered to have reduced the words
""free and voluntary"" in the test as to the admissibility of a
statement made by the accused to only meaning that the statement has not been
induced by any hope of advantage or fear of prejudice, and it is my view that a
statement may well be held not to be voluntary, at any rate, if it has been
induced by some other motive or for some other reason than hope or fear. It is
for that reason that I shall examine a review of the cases which I think have
given rise to this view that the word ""voluntary"" has such a narrow
and confined meaning.

Let us turn first to Ibrahim. It should first be observed
that the major part of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Ibrahim is concerned
not with admissibility of a statement at all but with a complex, and for our
purposes irrelevant, consideration of the jurisdiction of the Court in Hong
Kong to try a charge that a murder was committed in China. Secondly, the advice
tendered to His Majesty was to be upon the very narrow ground that there had
not been shown any clear departure from the requirements of justice or vio­lation
of the principles of natural justice causing substantial and gross injustice.

The facts in the Ibrahim case are most reveal­ing. Members
of an Indian Regiment stationed in China were sitting around under the street
lights in a town on a hot summer night. A junior officer entered the group of
private soldiers, charged one Ibrahim with gambling, abused him with offensive
language, searched him, took away some small amount of money, and ordered him
confined to the lines. Shortly thereafter, the sentry saw a man go

[Page 402]

into the camp itself to the rifle rack and gave an alarm. A shot
was fired, the junior officer fell dead, a bullet having passed through his
body. A man was seen a few paces away standing behind a tree and pointing his
rifle in the direction where the junior officer had been shot. He was seized,
proved to be Ibrahim, with his own service rifle in his hand and it had been
recently fired. Ibrahim was arrested and within fifteen minutes of the
occurrence a major arrived to find Ibrahim in custody and in bonds sitting on
the step of the guard room. The major said to Ibrahim, ""Why have you done
such a senseless act?"" The major said nothing else. He did not threaten Ibrahim
in any way. He offered no inducement of any kind nor did anybody else to his
knowledge or in his presence. Lord Sumner, in his reasons, said:

In truth, except that Major Barrett's words were formal­ly a
question they appear to have been indistinguishable from an exclamation of
dismay on the part of a humane officer, alike concerned for the position of the
accused, the fate of the deceased, and the credit of the regiment and the
service.

It must be very plain that under those circum­stances there could
be no inducement of any kind, whether it was an inducement which raises a hope
of advantage or fear of prejudice, or any other kind of an inducement. Lord
Sumner, at the end of his opinion, shows how very important the question was,
when he said:

It appears to their Lordships that a clearer case there
could hardly be, and that it would be the merest specu­lation to suppose that
the jury was substantially influenced by the evidence of what Ibrahim said to
Major Barrett.

Although many courts seem to have done so, I do not regard such
an authority as Ibrahim as indicating that the natural meaning of the
word ""voluntary"" should be confined to cases of hope of advantage or
fear of prejudice.

The next reference to which I shall refer is Boudreau v. The
King[10], a
decision of this Court. There, the accused, while in custody in the Prov­ince
of Quebec under a coroner's warrant during the investigation of a murder case
made two written

[Page 403]

statements to the police during questions put to him. The first
statement was made prior to any caution having been given to him and was simply
an account of his movements during the few days surrounding the killing and was
totally exculpatory in character except that it did indicate an illicit
association between the accused and the wife of the deceased man. The second
statement was made after the accused had been given what was described as a
proper warning, although the pro­priety of it today might be the subject of
some doubt. In that statement, the accused reiterated the substance of his
earlier statement but suddenly said, ""I may as well tell you, I killed
him"". Thereupon the one constable called the second constable back into
the room and the accused told the whole story of how he killed the deceased
man. A statement was typewritten by the police and sworn to by the accused. The
reasons given by all the members of the Court are chiefly concerned with
whether or not a warning given after an earlier statement had been taken
without warning was sufficient unless it ruled out any compulsion resulting
from the giving of the first statement. Rand J. said at pp. 269-70:

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex, [1914] A.C. 599, Rex
v. Voisin [1918] 1 K.B. 531, and Rex v. Prosko, 63 S.C.R. 226, lay
down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is voluntary. No
doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a
warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is directed against the
danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions. It is the
doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the circum­stances in
which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the statement should be is
that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of author­ity
and what is sought is assurance that that is the case. The underlying and
controlling question then remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily
made? Here the trial judge found that it was. It would be a serious error to
place the ordinary modes of investigation of crime in a straight jacket of
artificial rules; and the true protec­tion against improper interrogation or
any kind of pres­sure or inducement is to leave the broad question to the
court. Rigid formulas can be both meaningless to the weakling and absurd to the
sophisticated or hardened criminal; and to introduce a new rite as an
inflexible preliminary condition would serve no genuine interest of

[Page 404]

the accused and but add an unreal formalism to that vital
branch of the administration of justice.

Those words have been held by some to be such a limitation to the
narrow meaning of the word ""voluntary"" and by others to permit an
interpreta­tion of the word in accordance with its ordinary English meaning. I
prefer the latter view.

Again, it is to be noted that in Boudreau there were none
of the extraordinary circumstances which surround the statement made by the
appel­lant in the present case. There was no long and skilful questioning.
There was not, firstly, the bombardment by officers over the course of some
hours of most accusatory statements followed by most skilful exhibition of
suggestive questioning by a person specially trained in a psychological
technique. There was simply the blurting out in the middle of an exculpatory
statement of a most inculpatory sentence. Kellock J., at pp. 275-6, quotes
Darling J., as he then was, in Lewis v. Harris[11],
at p. 71. I stress Darling J.'s words, ""and it is tolerably certain
that if there is any sign that the evidence was unfairly obtained he would
reject it"".

The next case in this Court which is relied on most strongly by
the Crown and which I admit causes me more difficulty than any other is R. v. Fitton[12].
There, a driver of a postal delivery truck was charged with the sexual
assault and murder of a thirteen-year-old girl. The body of the girl had been
found on the east side of Toronto near the harbour shortly after eleven o'clock
in the evening of the 18th of January. On the early morning of the 19th of
January, the police officers went to the garage where the mail collector's
truck was kept. There, in the presence of the accused man, they carefully
examined that truck and found a bobby pin and a lipstick, both of which were
subsequently identified as being the property of the dead girl. The accused
nearly fainted upon witnessing this

[Page 405]

discovery. He was assisted by the police officers and then taken
to headquarters. At headquarters, the police officers informed him of the crime
which they were investigating and of such evidence as might involve him. The
accused, during the course of about two hours, gave to the police officers a
verbal resumé of his whereabouts the previous evening and made no reference to
having seen the deceased girl at all. The police officers then left the accused
in custody at police head-quarters and throughout the whole day carried on
further investigation.

After their departure, the verbal resumé was reduced to a
typewritten statement which the accused read over and signed. The police
officers returned from their investigation, again took the accused to the
interview room, informed him they had been working on the case and said,
""We have been out going over the area in the west end of the city where
you worked and we have been working pretty hard this afternoon"" and that
they had some information to the effect that the accused had been seen with the
deceased girl on the previ­ous evening. They informed the accused that the
lipstick that had been found in the truck had been identified as that of the
deceased girl and that they had other information which indicated that he had
been seen with the girl the previous night, and concluded, ""We do not
believe what you told us this morning"". The accused then blurted out,
""I was just thinking of my wife and my kids. I didn't mean to do it. She
started kibitzing around and I grabbed her by the scarf and she didn't breathe
no more"".

The officer immediately stopped the accused, cautioned him and
asked the accused if he understood the caution, and the accused having agreed
that he did so understand, the officer asked the accused if he wished to make a
statement. The accused indicated that he did and thereafter the long statement
in question and answer form was written out in long hand by a detective, read
over by the accused and signed. That statement was a complete outline of all
the circumstances surrounding the crime. The accused later went with the
officers in an attempt to recover several of the

[Page 406]

items which had been in the possession of the deceased girl
including her shoes.

The police amassed a lot of other evidence and the accused was
charged.

At trial, when the statement of the accused was produced by the
Crown, no objection was made to its admissibility. As Rand J. pointed out at p.
964 of the Supreme Court Reports, the production of the statement, if not
facilitated, was not seriously challenged for the reason that the statement con­tained
the only evidence upon which the defence intended to rely, for, feeble as it
was, the accused, referring in that statement to the victim, said she was
""kibitzing around"" and his grabbing her by the scarf was the only
evidence upon which the defence could show anything but a clear case of murder.

However, in the Court of Appeal, the fifth ground of appeal taken
by counsel for the accused, then appellant, was set out in these words:

The statement made by the accused should not have been
admitted in evidence. The accused was subjected to a kind of cross-examination
and persistent questioning in an attempt to elicit the statement. He was in
custody from about 6:30 a.m., and not until about 5 p.m. was any caution given
to him, and that was done only after he had made an incriminating admission.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario found, by a majority judgment,
that that statement was inad­missible and directed a new trial. The majority
judgment was given by Pickup C.J.O. who said at p. 714:

In my opinion, the Crown does not discharge the onus resting
upon it by merely adducing oral testimony show­ing that an incriminating
statement made by an accused person was not induced by a promise or by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage. That statement of the rule of law is too
narrow. The admissions must not have been ""improperly instigated or
induced or coerced"": per Rand J. in Boudreau v. The King, supra. The
admis­sions must be self-impelled, and the statement must be the statement of a
man ""free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of
authority"". The statement must be ""freely and voluntarily made"".

[Page 407]

Roach J.A., however, gave a dissenting judg­ment which was
adopted upon appeal to this Court in which judgment the most careful analysis
was made of all the evidence, not only in reference to the statement made by
the accused man but as to the mass of other incriminating evidence. One cannot
help but feel that a jury was as little affected by the production of the
statement of the accused as Lord Sumner felt the jury in Ibrahim was
affected by the production of Ibrahim's statement. Roach J.A. was concerned
with the manner of the police interrogation of the accused man, and he said at
pp. 726-7:

I am not suggesting that it is in any circumstances
advisable or proper for a police officer to say to an accused ""I do not
believe what you have told me."" That is just a police way of saying
""You are a liar."" What I am saying is that in this case the use of
that language did not result in the statement, made after he was duly
cautioned, being inadmissible. There is nothing in what he said before he was
cautioned that is not included in his statement, except the excuse for having misled
the officers by what he said in the morning.

As I have said, the Crown appealed to this Court and this Court
by a majority judgment were of the view that the statement was admissible. Rand
J. made specific reference to Pickup C.J.O.'s citation from Boudreau v. The
King, which was a statement made by Rand J. in that Boudreau case,
and regarded Pickup C.J.O. as being of the opin­ion that that meant that only
spontaneous state­ments unrelated to anything as cause or occasion in the
conduct of the police officers could be admitted but regarded such an
interpretation of Boudreau as being in error. Looking at the words
""free in volition from the compulsions or induce­ments of authority""
as meaning free from the compulsion of apprehension of prejudice and the inducement
of hope for advantage, Rand J. said that it was a character of the influence of
idea or feeling behind that act of willing and its source which the rule seizes
upon, and further holding that questions without intimidating or suggestive
overtones are inescapable from police enquiry and by themselves could not be
taken to invalidate the response given.

So, in Rand J.'s view, the question was whether the statement had
been made through fear or hope

[Page 408]

induced by authority. I am ready to admit that such a reading of
the reasons of Rand J. would seem to support a narrow construction of the word
""voluntary"" but those words must be understood in the light of the
evidence in that particular case and I point out that Nolan J., in his reasons
in the same case, stressed ""In the present case, there was no evidence of
inducement or coercion, no evidence of threat or promise of reward"", and
also noted ""The questioning must not, of course, be for the purpose of
trapping the suspected person into making admissions and every case must be
decided according to the whole of the circumstances"". (The
underlining is my own.)

In my respectful opinion, the judgment of this Court in Fitton
must be limited so as not to rule admissible statements made by the accused
when not induced by hope of advantage or fear of preju­dice but which are
certainly not voluntary in the ordinary English sense of the word because they
were induced by other circumstances such as existed in the present case.

Courts of late in the United Kingdom, in New Zealand and in
Australia have been concerned with the question of oppression and the learned
trial judge in his ruling placed much reliance on the decision in New Zealand
of Naniseni v. The Queen[13]. There,
although the statement was held to be admissible, it was said that a confession
is voluntary if it has been made by the accused, his will in making it not
being overborne by the will of some other person by means of some inducement.
That Court was ready to accept the doctrine of oppression but held that the
oppression must be by some third party and could not be merely self-induced
involuntariness.

Although some of the statements are illuminat­ing, the case is of
little value in the present circum­stances where, of course, an inducement was
made by a third party, the skilled and persistent Sgt. Proke.

[Page 409]

In McDermott v. The King[14], in
the High Court of Australia, Dixon J., as he then was, said at p. 511:

At common law a confessional statement made out of court by
an accused person may not be admitted in evidence against him upon his trial
for the crime to which it relates unless it is shown to have been voluntari­ly
made. This means substantially that it has been made in the exercise of his
free choice. If he speaks because he is overborne, his confessional statement
cannot be received in evidence and it does not matter by what means he has been
overborne. If his statement is the result of duress, intimidation, persistent
importunity, or sustained or undue insistence or pressure, it cannot be
voluntary.

In the particular case, the statement was found not to have been
subject to pressure.

The Judges' Rules dealt with oppression and in Martin
Priestley, Sachs J., as he then was, made a ruling which he referred to
subsequently in R. v. Algernon Watson. The statement made in the Priestley
trial is outlined in a note reported in 51 Cr. App. R. 1. I
quote the following excerpt:

There I mentioned that I had not been referred to any
authority on the meaning of the word ""oppression"" as used in the preamble
to the Judges' Rules, nor would I venture on such a definition, and far less
try to compile a list of categories of oppression, but, to my mind, this word
in the context of the principles under consideration imports something which
tends to sap, and has sapped, that free will which must exist before a
confession is voluntary.... Whether or not there is oppression in an individual
case depends upon many elements. I am not going into all of them. They include
such things as the length of time of any individual period of questioning, the
length of time intervening between periods of ques­tioning, whether the accused
person has been given proper refreshment or not, and the characteristics of the
person who makes the statement. What may be oppres­sive as regards a child, an
invalid or an old man or somebody inexperienced in the ways of this world may
turn out not to be oppressive when one finds that the accused person is of a
tough character and an experienced man of the world.

It is exactly this issue with which I am con­cerned in the
present case. The requirement to establish the admissibility at trial of a
statement

[Page 410]

made by an accused person to persons in authority has been oft
cited as simply that it is free and voluntary. Those are both ordinary English
words and I think mean roughly the same thing. The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary defines ""voluntary"" as ""arising or developing in
the mind without external constraint . .; of actions: performed or done of
one's own free will, impulse, or choice; not constrained, prompted, or
suggested by another"". Other definitions might be cited but they are to
the same effect. As I have shown, there has been repeatedly throughout the
cases emphasis on the fact that the statement must be voluntary and often such
words as ""of free will"" are added. Here, the appellant was seventeen
years of age. He was of a most unstable character, diagnosed by the Crown
psychiatrist as being a sociopathic person­ality who had boasted that he owned
three fine automobiles, that he had been the manager of one department of a
large company, who had said to a youth who was his friend that he was so
anxious to obtain a fine car that he would take the money from his mother and
even kill her, and then this boy is hammered in cross-examination by two most
impressive police officers and then taken by a skilled and proved interrogation
specialist and, with what the psychiatrist described as the most suggestive of
questions, taken through a three-phase examination so that the learned trial judge
characterized his condition at that time as one of ""complete emotional
disintegration"". It is my strong view that no statement made by that
accused under those circumstances can be ima­gined to be voluntary, and I do
not find anything in the authorities which I have analyzed which would show me
that the law is otherwise.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the
acquittal upon the verdict of the jury.

The judgment of Beetz and Pratte JJ. was deliv­ered by

BEETZ J—I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my
brothers Martland and Spence. I reach the same conclusion as my brother Spence
but on narrower grounds confined to the matter of hypnosis.

[Page 411]

The issue is whether a confession is tainted because the accused
was under hypnosis immedi­ately prior to but not at the time of the confession
and, while under hypnosis, made a previous confes­sional statement which was
involuntary.

I—THE VOIR DIRE

On June 16, 1975, appellant's mother was mur­dered in her bed. In
the early hours of June 17th, following his arrest for suspicion of murder,
seventeen years old Horvath was interrogated for about two hours and one half
by R.C.M.P. members Delwisch and Charlton. Horvath made certain declarations
concerning his whereabouts on June 16th, the taking of the car of his mother's
com­mon-law husband and his involvement in two car accidents; but through the
end of the interview he denied having killed his mother. These oral decla­rations
are hereafter referred to as the first statement.

On the same day, Horvath was interviewed by Staff Sergeant Proke,
an R.C.M.P. polygraph operator. The interview began at noon and lasted
approximately four hours. It took place in a room equipped with a polygraph
(""lie detector""), a lis­tening device and a one-way glass permitting
observation from an adjoining room where what was said by Sergeant Proke and
Horvath in the interrogation room could be heard and was entire­ly tape
recorded. From this adjoining room, Cor­poral Delwisch witnessed most of the
interview.

During the first portion of the interview, which lasted about two
hours, Sergeant Proke advised Horvath that he was a police officer and might
have to give evidence in court if Horvath acknowl­edged involvement in the
murder; he also told Horvath that he neither had to answer any ques­tion nor
take the polygraph test. Horvath said he wished to defer the polygraph test. In
reply to Sergeant Proke's questions, Horvath gave some outline of his
background, relationship with his mother, father, brother, stepfather (his
mother's common-law husband) and gave an account of events from Sunday, June
15th, to Tuesday, June 17th, but without reference to the death of his mother.
Sergeant Proke said repeatedly to Horvath

[Page 412]

that he was trying to block things from his mind. Corporal Delwisch
described the method as a psychological approach in that Sergeant Proke was
talking to Horvath in a soothing manner, trying to win his confidence.

A few minutes after two o'clock, Sergeant Proke went into the
observation room leaving Horvath alone for a little less than ten minutes.
Horvath then went into what Corporal Delwisch described as a trance or semitrance
and began his first monologue or soliloquy. In this first monologue, Horvath
swore to avenge his mother's murder.

Sergeant Proke returned to the interrogation room and spoke with
Horvath for about one hour. He suggested to Horvath that sodium amytal or
sodium penthotal, so-called ""truth serums"" could be used to eliminate
suspicion. Horvath indicated some preference for hypnosis and said he wanted to
see a psychiatrist; he stated he would like to see a psychiatrist in any event
before consenting to the truth serum treatment. Sergeant Proke replied that a
meeting with a psychiatrist could easily be arranged; he ultimately talked
Horvath out of the idea of seeing a psychiatrist and using hypnosis but I do
not think it is an exaggeration to say, as defence counsel submitted to the
trial judge, that Sergeant Proke put himself in the position of the accused's
psychiatrist.

After further conversation with Horvath, Ser­geant Proke left the
examination room at about 3:15 p.m. and Horvath began his second mono­logue in
which he confessed his involvement in his mother's death saying he had hit her
several times. Corporal Delwisch described this second mono­logue as a trance
of a type resembling that of the first monologue.

Sergeant Proke re-entered the interrogation room at about 3:25
p.m. and Horvath repeated to him what he had said in the second monologue. This
oral declaration is hereafter referred to as the second statement.

Sergeant Proke asked Horvath whether he would be willing to
repeat to the police officers in

[Page 413]

charge of the investigation what he had just told him. Horvath
indicated that he would.

Sergeant Proke left the interrogation room and, in a third and
relatively brief monologue, Horvath begged his mother's forgiveness for having
told of the incident.

Sergeant Proke came back to the interrogation room with Corporals
Delwisch and Sisterson and asked Horvath whether he was still willing to repeat
to them what he had told him. Horvath agreed and left with the two corporals.
Between 4:25 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. he gave a written signed confession hereafter
referred to as the third statement

Dr. Stephenson, a psychiatrist who had exam­ined Horvath and had
been called by the Crown, listened to the entire tape of the interview at the
request of the trial judge, Gould J., and prepared a written report in the form
of notes a summation of which was received in evidence by consent and reads as
follows:

""Up to the point of the subject's first solitary mono­logue,
he was presenting a normal defence against his accusers.

The first monologue indicates he is up to this point,
unaware he had any part in the murder.

Sensing that there is hidden material behind the mono­logue,
and probably also sensing that, having given vent to an emotional reaction to
his mother's death, the subject is more vulnerable, the interrogator skillfully
plays upon the subject's feelings, and his—""and his"" means the
subject's—latent pressure to bring the hidden material into consciousness.

The subject recalls a screen memory of seeing his mother
dead, and the way is opened for further recall. Whether deliberately or not—I
am not able to say—the interrogator's manner and voice take on an hypnotic
quality, and the subject's manner of response strongly suggests he is slipping
into an hypnotic state. During the second monologue, subject's voice is low,
monotonous and, compared to the first monologue, emotionally low-key. He
recites the provocation by his mother, his resistance, and finally acquiescence
to her demands. It appears he had promised her not to reveal her request that
he kill her. But so great is the pressure to unburden himself—so great is the
pressure to unburden himself he violates her 'death—bed command'.

[Page 414]

Having ventilated his distress, he then admits to attack­ing
her—he then admits to attacking her and reveals her request.""

""In the third monologue, he begs his morther's [sic] forgive­ness
for—betraying her death-bed wish, and tells bow he resolved to 'keep his head
up' and take whatever conse­quences come so as not to cause his stepfather,
John (mother's common-law husband) further grief by reveal­ing that his mother
apparently preferred death to going on.""

That's my summation, my lord, and my opinion is as follows:
""The emotional pressures on the subject were immense—there were three main
sources—mother's death, her 'death-bed command', and the distress his
stepfather John (who appears to be the one person who had shown him consistent
affection) would experience, should he fail to honour her command. As a result
he blots out the memory of the episode by hysterical repres­sion—a common
psychological defence mechanism (involuntary) against intolerable stress. With
it went the emotional accompaniment of the stress, and thus he appears cool and
unconcerned. That is, until the inter­rogator makes an almost irresistible
appeal to him to unburden himself. Following his abreaction—an abreac­tion my lord,
means a strong emotional response to a situation— he is vulnerable to hypnotic
suggestion and the memory begins to break through his resistance, and he
confesses his actions"".

Dr. Stephenson was examined and cross-exam­ined. I find it
necessary to quote substantial parts of his testimony:

Q. Is this a voluntary confession?

A. It is axiomatic that a person under hypnosis (whatever
its depth) cannot be forced to do or say anything to which he has not already
given tacit consent. In my opinion, this subject had a very strong basic wish
to unburden himself, and his ambivalence over it is expressed in monologues two
and three"" ... and ""ambivalence"" my lord, means a divided
opinion.

In my opinion his initial denial was based on involuntary
repression of the painful material, and not mere concealment. Therefore, when
the pain­ful material becomes conscious, his telling of it is essentially a
voluntary act, even though there is a strong possibility he was in light
hypnotic state up to the end of the second monologue.

In my opinion, by the time he begins to relate his mother's
death-wish ... [that is in the course of the second statement] he is in
full and voluntary

[Page 415]

control of his faculties, and remained so until the end of
the tape.

Q. Now, would you explain as well, Doctor, what you mean by
a light hypnotic state?

A. Well, an hypnotic state is a state of—how can I best
describe this now—is a sort of dreamy state in which the patient, or the
individual is in a state of somewhat altered consciousness, but is not uncon­scious,
with his environment, but his general con­dition is, I suppose, the best way
one can describe it, is dreamy, and a light hypnotic state is one in which the
dreaminess or alteration in conscious­ness is very slight. This might not even
be appar­ent to the casual observer because the individual would be, to all
intents and purposes, normal. His eyes would be open. He would in all
probability be sitting quietly and not moving very much, but his eyes would be
open and he would be conversing in a fairly normal fashion. The usual
indication of an hypnotic state is an alteration in the individual's stream of
speech. His speech characteristically becomes lower in volume, monotonous in
tone, and the emotional accompaniment to the speech is pretty low-key or
neutral.

Dr. Stephenson was asked to comment on the veracity of the
content of the tape:

… following the first soliloguy, I have no way of knowing
for sure, or no way of expressing a valid opinion about the truthfulness of his
statements except to say that following the first soliloguy, he did, in my
opinion, begin to slip into this slight hypnotic state and in all probability,
the responses he gave to the interrogator at that point .. .

THE COURT: Yes?

A. .. . were in the main, the truth as he knew it,
especially those which deal with the emergence of the repressed memories.

Now, during the second monologue, the second solilo­quy, I
have no reason to think that the subject was not expressing the truth as he saw
it. You will recall that he was at that point pleading with his mother, and in
that situation, I see no reason to doubt that his statements, verbal
productions were genuine and unfeigned, and at the end of that monologue, and
as the questioning proceeded, again I have no way of knowing whether he was at
that point being truthful or not. I may say that following the—upon the
resumption of questioning after the second soliloquy, I am of the opinion that
he was very soon in full possession of his faculties.

[Page 416]

Staff Sergeant Proke had suggested the use of narcoanalysis to
Horvath and Dr. Stephenson was cross-examined at some length on the comparative
effects of a sodium amytal injection and hypnosis.

Dr. Stephenson said that sodium amytal is a barbiturate. In a
so-called amytal interview, it was administered intravenously, produced a mild
drow­siness and reduced inhibitory controls. The subject would then become able
to discuss certain subjects he could not otherwise voluntarily talk about
because of the intensity of emotion which they elicited. Dr. Stephenson agreed
with the trial judge that someone having something to hide would be ""a bit
of an idiot"" if he took that test. He said that the state of a person
under the influence of sodium amytal was not a hypnotic state. He was asked whether
there was any real difference between a ""four-hour shot of Sergeant Proke""
and a shot of sodium amytal:

A. All right, my opinion from listening to the tape is that
Sergeant Proke is an extremely skilful interviewer, and his attitude towards
the interview was one of gentleness and persuasion, rather than coer­cion. In
my opinion, this did tend to allay a great deal of the anxiety that the subject
would have experienced or would normally be experiencing, but I can't say that
the long interview by Sergeant Proke is exactly comparable to an amitol
interview.

Q. Well, sir, I'm not interested in the interview itself. I
am interested in the effect, and I repeat the question to you, once more,
Doctor, that really the effect, the overall effect of Sergeant Proke's
examination was exactly the same, as far as this individual was concerned, as
if he had had a shot of this amitol or whatever you want to call it,
psychologically in this kid's mind, he was able to produce, reproduce things
that he wasn't mentally or psychologically capable of doing voluntarily?

A. It is certainly true that he was—that as a result of the
interview, he was able to bring back into consciousness material which he had
forgotten by repressing it.

Q. And this is because the man had—so that really, I come
back to that same question again, and using it in layman's language, really a
shot of Sergeant Proke was basically the same thing as a shot of

[Page 417]

this truth serum, so far as the reaction in the individual
was concerned, i.e., the accused?

A. Essentially, yes. Essentially.

Dr. Stephenson disagreed with the proposition put to him that
Sergeant Proke had been able to break Horvath's will to resist, ""because
if you don't know something, you can't resist pressure to tell it"":

Dr. Stephenson then said:

A. After the first soliloquy. It was at this—it was at this
point, in my opinion, that the—that the sub­ject began to experience a light
hypnotic state. Now, I am unable to say whether Sergeant Proke did this
deliberately or whether it was simply his manner of questioning that produced
it, but in my opinion, at this point, after the first soliloquy, the subject
did experience a light hypnotic state and this is an ideal situation in terms
of ordinary therapeutic setups, this is an ideal situation for the recall of
suppressed—I'm sorry, repressed ma­terial, repressed material meaning material
that the individual cannot recall because he has pushed it out of his mind
involuntarily. Okay, under a under a—under a light hypnotic state, the
individual can recall incidents which he has forgotten in terms of a—a
hysterical amnesia and this is what began to happen at that point.

Q. ... You stated at a certain stage in the interview that
the interrogator makes an almost irresistible appeal to the accused.

THE COURT: Appeal to what?

MR. MILNE: To unburden himself .. .

Q. What was the status of that man's or the accused's mind
when this irresistible appeal was made, in your opinion? .. .

A. Yes. Well, the individual's state of mind at—at that
point, would be one of extreme emotional turmoil. He has just come through a
very intense emotional experience, and—

MR. MILNE: 

Q. Yes?

A. And therefore, he would be, of course, in a state of very
emotional turmoil.

Q. Could I use the term then he would be very vulnerable?

A. Yes.

[Page 418]

Q. To suggestion?

A. Vulnerable to suggestion, yes.

Q. To the extent of almost an irresistible position at that
time?

A. Under these particular circumstances, there would be a
very strong impulsion to unburden himself, yes.

Q. And this would be the result of the inducements made by
the questioner, is that correct?

A. I suppose you could call them inducements, pleadings. I
take it when you use the term ""induce­ments"", you are using it in the
sense of a promise of some sort?

THE COURT: Contractual sense.

MR. MILNE: Q. Contractual sense?

THE COURT: I will give you something if you do something for
me.

A. Not in that sense, my lord.

Counsel for the defence referred to the resump­tion of questioning
by Sergeant Proke following the second monologue, that is to the second
statement, and ventured the opinion that the material was revealed while
Horvath ""was still under a considerable degree of emotional stress"":

Q. An hypnotic state?

A. No, because I think I said earlier, in my opinion, at the
point where Staff Sergeant Proke re-entered the room and began to question him
again, that had the effect of, in a colloquial sense, bringing him out of it.
Now, one must remember this was a very light hypnotic state, but the effect of
a change of-change of the situation, the re-entry of another individual into
the room, the re-com­mencement of conversation between the two, in my opinion
had the effect of removing whatever degree of hypnotic state existed up to that
point, and so my opinion is that the material which he gave to the
interrogator, as recorded on page 59, [that is in the course of the second
statement] was given in a state of full consciousness and awareness.

The last question and answer of the cross-exami­nation by Counsel
for the defence were as follows:

Q. Doctor, one more question. Is a person in any hypnotic
state more susceptible to the power of suggestion than he would be normally?

[Page 419]

A. Yes.

The last part of Dr. Stephenson's interrogation was by the Court:

Q. Is there any similarity between being in a light state of
hypnosis and being drunk?

A. No, my lord.

THE COURT: There is no similarity?

A. No, no, there really isn't. Being drunk is simply a state
of reduced inhibition, and light state of hypnosis is much more complex than
that.

Staff Sergeant Proke testified that he had not attempted to
hypnotize Horvath; he had attended lectures by psychiatrists who used hypnosis
and he was aware of what could be done through hypnosis but he had never
himself studied it or attempted to practise it.

The defence called no evidence on the voir dire.

II—JUDGMENTS OF THE COURTS BELOW

The learned trial judge ruled that the first statement was
inadmissible because it had been ""obtained in an atmosphere of oppression
which may have spilled over, in the accused's mind, to an atmosphere of
threat"". The Crown did not appeal from that ruling.

In the course of argument, the learned trial judge expressed the
view that the second statement was not tainted by the first. He
said that if it was tainted, it was ""tainted from within"", not by the
first interview with R.C.M.P. members Delwisch and Charlton.

The trial judge finally ruled the second statement inadmissible
apart from any relationship with the first statement, because of the
factor of hypnosis:

Now, as to the interrogation by Staff Proke, there was no
overt inducement used in the interview, no overt threat used.

Had Dr. Stephenson not given the evidence of an hypnotic
state, I would have with some misgivings, have admitted this statement. It is
the accumulation of all the factors, and I have dealt with those, plus the
factor of

[Page 420]

the subject having been, for a sizeable part of the
interview, in an hypnotic state immediately before the confession came out,
that have caused me to reject the statement. This ruling is given with very
real regret that police work as skilful as this should end in frustration of
its purpose.

Neither counsel was able to give me any case dealing with
hypnotism occurring during a police interrogation. It is the factor of hypnotism
which has tipped the balance against admission in this case. It is not neces­sary
to deal with the relationship, if any, between the first and second statements,
because both statements are rejected on their internal content, regardless of
any relationship that the first may have had to the second.

As for the third statement, it was ruled out because it
flew directly from the second statement and was vitiated by the same
factor:

THE COURT: Well, I think you reached the conclu­sion—you
see, at the end of the Proke interview, Proke then says would you now say to
two other officers—by the way, the same two that have examined the lad in the
early hours of the morn­ing—would you now say to them what you have just said
to me. Of course, if the obtaining of the second statement is defective, the
third statement is only a projection of the second. He was—I use the vernacular—he
was dead by the time he fin­ished the second statement. He had made the
admission and confessed, so then, of course, he could hardly say, 'No, I just
confessed to you, but I won't say the same thing to somebody else, 'so the
third statement falls because of it is founded so much on the second'. Now, the
third is a written statement?

MR. SHANTZ: Indeed it is.

THE COURT: That must fall, too. It falls with the second,
from which it directly flows. If follows naturally on, is a culmination of the
second. If the second is defective, the third cannot stand.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the second and
third statements were admissible. McFarlane J.A., speaking for himself
and McLean and Bull JJ.A., relied upon Ibrahim v. The King[15],
among other authorities, and upon Viscount Sum­ner's often quoted
words (at p. 609):

[Page 421]

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.

McFarlane J.A. concluded his reasons for judg­ment as follows:

... the evidence is clear that the statements were not
obtained by hope of advantage or fear of prejudice exercised, held out or
inspired, by a person in authority.

The question whether any weight should be attached to
confessions made in the circumstances which I have described is a question for
the jury, and not a question for the judge, in my opinion. The judge exceeded
the scope of the functions which the law gives to him and I am afraid invaded
the field of the jury.

In those circumstances the error is one of very considerable
substance, and it is my opinion that this appeal must be allowed, the acquittal
set aside, and a new trial ordered.

In my respectful opinion, it was the trial judge, Gould J., who
was right in ruling Horvath's second and third statements inadmissible.

III—LACK OF CONSENT TO HYPNOSIS

Horvath's state of hypnosis began at some point in time after his
first monologue while he was being interrogated by Sergeant Proke; he remained
in that state until Sergeant Proke re-entered the interrogation room at the end
of the second mono­logue. Following the first monologue, the inter­rogator
sensed that Horvath was more vulnerable and his manner and voice took on an
hypnotic quality to which Horvath did in fact respond by slipping into a state
of light hypnosis.

The conclusion is clear in my opinion that this was induced
hypnosis in the sense that Sergeant Proke was instrumental in bringing it
about, albeit unwittingly.

There is no evidence that Horvath was aware he was about to
undergo hypnosis and that he had agreed to be put in that state. What evidence
there is indicates the contrary: although Horvath had

[Page 422]

himself mentioned hypnosis, it was hypnosis at the hands of a
psychiatrist, not hypnosis by Sergeant Proke; furthermore, Horvath had just
refused to participate in two other special forms of interroga­tion, a
polygraph test and a narcoanalysis treatment; these forms of interrogation,
together with induced hypnosis, present certain elements of artificiality,
technicality and external intervention which are somewhat out of the ordinary
and they should never be used without the subject's full and unequivocal
consent. Yet, Horvath found himself submitted without his consent to such a
special form of interrogation and, in the course of his second monologue and
while under hypnosis, made an inculpatory statement which unlatched the others.

In my view, the use of hypnosis by Sergeant Proke in those
circumstances would have been highly improper had it not been inadvertent. But
this inadvertence did not remove the objective element of moral violence
involved in the process nor did it alter the impact on Horvath's mind.

IV—INVOLUNTARINESS OF STATEMENT MADE UNDER HYPNOSIS

Dr. Stephenson's expert opinion was uncon­tradicted. He was
described by the learned trial judge as a respected and well-known practioner
whose evidence was impeccable as to credibility. We are bound by these
findings. On the other hand, it was not for the expert but for the trial judge
to decide whether Horvath's statements were free and voluntary and therefore
admissible. Also, and as is understandable in a subject as complex as hypnosis,
Dr. Stephenson's testimony is not so free from ambiguity and even contradiction
with respect to voluntariness that it does not call for interpretation.

I propose to summarize what I understand to be the essence of Dr.
Stephenson's testimony and draw my own conclusions; this summary should be read
in context however and I refer to those parts of the evidence quoted above.

While under hypnosis, Horvath was not uncon­scious or incapable
to communicate with his environment

[Page 423]

but he was in a sort of dreamy state of altered consciousness; he
could not be forced to do or say anything to which he had not already given
tacit consent; but he was not either in a state of full consciousness and
awareness; he was not pre­senting a normal defence against his accusers; nor
was he in full and voluntary control or possession of his faculties. Horvath's
hysterical amnesia or repression of the memory that he had killed his mother
had been involuntary but he also had a strong basic wish to unburden himself
and was ambivalent about it. Once he had become con­scious of the painful
material through hypnosis and because of the interrogator's almost irresist­ible
appeal to unburden himself, the telling of it was essentially a voluntary act
although he was in a light hypnotic state up to the end of the second
monologue. There was no reason to doubt that what Horvath said under hypnosis
was the truth as he then knew it although he was more susceptible to the power
of suggestion than he would normally be. There is no similarity between a state
of light hypnosis and drunkenness. Narcoanalysis pro­duced through the use of
sodium amytal is distinct from hypnosis but (as it seems) not to the point of a
total absence of similarity; under narcoanalysis, emotional controls are less
inhibited than they are in a fully conscious state and the subject is assisted
to say what he was not able to say voluntarily because of the emotional
intensity of it. The long interview by Sergeant Proke was not exactly com­parable
to an amytal interview but, having regard to the overall effect of the
interview and the reaction of the subject, ""a shot of Sergeant Proke""
was essentially the same as a shot of the truth serum.

Dr. Stephenson's use of the words ""voluntary"" and
""involuntary"" is rather confusing to me and it may be that he used them
in some psychiatric or medical sense rather than in their ordinary or legal
sense. According to Dr. Stephenson, Horvath's ""initial denial was based on
involuntary repression of the painful material"". Hypnosis had
enabled him to recall the painful memory. ""Therefore, when the
painful material becomes conscious, his telling of it is essentially a voluntary
act, even though there is a strong possibility that he was in a

[Page 424]

light hypnotic state up to the end of the second monologue"".

I hope I do not distort Dr. Stephenson's testimo­ny but what he
said apparently amounts to this: it was hypnosis which has rendered possible
the passage from involuntariness to voluntariness or which had caused the
emergence of voluntariness together with the recall of a repressed memory. I
find this paradoxical to say the least given the fact that, while under
hypnosis, Horvath was in a dreamy state of altered consciousness, not in full
and voluntary control or possession of his faculties, labouring under extreme
emotional turmoil, great­ly vulnerable to suggestion and to an appeal to
unburden himself which was almost irresistible and which in fact was not
resisted. Horvath had been ambivalent about the telling of the inculpato­ry
material. Yet he had resolved the ambivalence and begun to speak while he was
still under the spell.

In my opinion, nothing that Horvath said under hypnosis was
voluntary in the legal sense.

In typical legal fashion, the test of voluntariness is expressed
negatively in the Ibrahim rule by reference to instances of
involuntariness: a statement obtained by hope of advantage, (a promise), or
fear of prejudice, (a threat), exercised, held out or inspired by a person in
authority, is involuntary in the eyes of the law.

The question arises as to whether the enumera­tion in the rule of
instances of involuntariness is a limitative one.

It cannot be limitative since the rule is a judge-made rule and
anything said by a judge beyond what is necessary to decide the issue is obiter.
Furthermore, the principle which inspires the rule remains a positive one;
it is the principle of voluntariness. The principle always governs and may
justify an extension of the rule to situations where involuntariness has been
caused otherwise than by promises, threats, hope or fear, if it is felt that
other causes are as coercive as promises or. threats,

[Page 425]

hope or fear and serious enough to bring the principle into play.

In my view, the principle behind the rule justi­fies that the
rule be extended to cover the circum­stances of the case at bar.

It does not take much of a promise or a threat to render a
confession inadmissible and it is certainly not required that the hope of
advantage or fear of prejudice raised by the promise or the threat be almost
irresistible. It seems to me that if a mere threat or a mere promise are
considered to have such an impact on mind and will as to render involuntary the
confession of an accused who is not under induced hypnosis, whose state of
conscious­ness has not been altered, who is in full and voluntary control and
possession of his faculties and who is therefore quite capable to resist sugges­tion,
then Horvath's statement made under hypno­sis in the circumstances described
above was a fortiori involuntary even though the cause of involuntariness
was neither hope of advantage nor fear of prejudice.

The statement was involuntary because Ser­geant Proke, a person
in authority, had been instrumental in bringing about the state of hypno­sis
and had made an appeal to speak which, given this abnormal state, was almost
irresistible.

Furthermore, voluntariness implies an aware­ness of what is at
stake in making a statement to a person in authority. This is the reason for
the customary police warning. Horvath was in control of his faculties when Sergeant
Proke cautioned him at the beginning of the interview but, under hypnosis, he
ceased to be in a state of full con­sciousness and awareness. His awareness of
what was at stake in making any statement is very much a matter of doubt.

Finally, voluntariness is incompatible not only with promises and
threats, but with actual vio­lence. Had Horvath made a statement while under
the influence of an amytal injection administered without his consent, the
statement would have been inadmissible because of the assault and, pre­sumably,
because also of the effect of the injection on his mind. There was no physical
violence in the

[Page 426]

case at bar, There is not even any evidence of bodily contact
between Horvath and Sergeant Proke. But through the use of an interrogation
technique involving certain physical elements such as an hypnotic quality of
voice and manner, a police officer has gained unconsented access to what in a
human being is of the utmost privacy, the privacy of his own mind. As I have
already indicated, it is my view that this was a form of violence or intrusion
of a moral or mental nature, more subtle than visible violence, but not less
efficient in the result than an amytal injection administered by force.

I feel that I am not precluded from reaching my conclusions by
any of the leading authorities. The rule in Ibrahim was adopted and
followed by this Court in Prosko v. The King[16];
Boudreau v. The King[17] and
The Queen v. Fitton[18]. It
is true also that in Fitton this Court declined to broaden the rule of
exclusion stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim. But Fitton must
be read in the light of the facts of that case which had nothing to do with
hypnosis anymore that the facts in Ibrahim, Prosko and Boudreau. The
highly exceptional nature of a confession made under hypnosis was never
considered in any of those cases. Nor do I understand Fitton to mean
that the rule in Ibrahim ought to be construed as a statutory enactment:
no judge-made rule, however authoritative and deserving of respect could ever have
such an effect nor give such an effect to another judge-made rule. For the
reasons stated above, unconsented hypnosis induced by a person in authority
ought in my view to be added to the motives of exclusion mentioned in Ibrahim
for it is covered by the principle which inspired the rule; the wording of
the rule could not exhaust the fecundity of the principle.

As for judicial authorities dealing specifically with hypnosis,
they are very few. I know of only two reported Canadian cases. The more recent
one has no bearing on the case at bar: Regina v. Pitt[19].

[Page 427]

The earlier case of Rex v. Booher[20]
is more to the point although it involves post-hypnotic suggestion: a
confession made to a detective was excluded because the Crown had failed to
discharge the onus that the accused was not under the influence of mental
suggestion exercised by a ""criminolo­gist"" retained by the Crown, who
claimed to have hypnotic powers and who had paid several visits to the accused
for the purpose of obtaining a confession.

In the United States, cases having to do with narcoanalysis are
somewhat less rare than those related to hypnosis and the general tendency is
against admissibility. Robert S. Spector and Teree E. Foster,
""Admissibility of hypnotic statements"", (1977) 38 Ohio State Law
Journal 567; D. Keith Lowter, ""Should statements made during drug
interview be admissible into evidence in criminal cases?"", (1975) 7
U.W.L.A. Law Rev. 222. The case of Leyra v. Denno[21]
is of some interest although the Supreme Court of the United States did not
actually confront the issue of hypnosis.

Horvath's second monologue being involuntary, its impact on the second
and third statements must now be assessed.

V—TAINTING OF POST-HYPNOTIC STATEMENTS

In its factum, counsel for the Crown takes the position that the second
and third statements which he seeks to have declared admissible were
not made under hypnosis.

The question is whether the second and third statements
were tainted by the circumstances which preceded them and more particularly
by the involuntariness of the statement made under hyp­nosis in the course of
the second monologue.

The principle relating to the tainting of a second statement by a
first statement has thus been for­mulated by Lord Parker C.J. in Regina v.
Smith[22], at
p. 41:

[Page 428]

The court thinks that the principle to be deducted from the
cases is really this: that if the threat or promise under which the first
statement was made still persists when the second statement is made, then it is
inadmiss­ible. Only if the time-limit between the two statements, the
circumstances existing at the time and the caution are such that it can be said
that the original threat or inducement has been dissipated can the second
statement be admitted as a voluntary statement.

In that case, the second statement had been given some nine hours
after the first involuntary statement, to a different person and after the
customary caution. It was held that the original inducement had dissipated and
the second statement was admissible.

The Judicial Committee followed the same prin­ciple without
discussing it in Sparks v. The Queen[23], at
p. 989. There the accused had made a written confession after which he was
allowed to speak to his wife over the telephone his conversa­tion being heard
by the police. He thereafter requested to be detained so as not to face his
family and friends. The Judicial Committee found the written statement
inadmissible and also ruled against the admissibility of the telephone conversa­tion
and the request made to the police for the considerations which had led to the
exclusion of the written statement.

In R. v. Williams[24] the
accused had made two written statements, the first on June 7 and the second,
confirming the first, on July 18. The first statement had been obtained by the
promise of a person in authority. Judge Rogers found the second statement
inadmissible, holding that the effect of a promise is perhaps harder to
dissipate than that of a threat.

The principle has been applied in Canada by the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Regina v. Logue[25]. The
accused had signed a first involuntary statement on March 16 and a second
statement on March 17. Kelly J.A. who delivered the unanimous

[Page 429]

judgment excluding them both said at p. 351:

If the questioned statements were made subsequent to the
making of a statement which was admissible there is some weight to the
contention that, having made a voluntary statement, the accused would be
disposed to continue voluntarily giving information by way of state­ments. But
the converse does not hold. Subsequent statements made after a statement which
was made under duress or by reason of inducements would not be evidence of the
voluntary nature of the earlier statement. It might well be that the influence
of the circum­stances which made the earlier statement inadmissible might have
assisted to taint the subsequent statement which, taken by itself, would appear
to be voluntary.

The principle was taken for granted by three members of this
Court in Boudreau although they did not agree on its application.
Boudreau had signed two written statements, the first on a Tuesday and the
second on the following Thursday. The first was found by the majority to be
admis­sible although it had not been preceded by the usual warning. Rinfret
C.J. and Taschereau J. (as he then was), who concurred in the result, did not
agree with the majority that the first statement was inculpatory. They also
expressed the view, in an obiter dictum, that the first statement had
not influenced the second. Estey J. dissenting, held both statements
inadmissible, the second because it had been influenced by the first. While
Estey J. was in dissent, his views on tainting were not contradicted by the
majority and the disagreement of Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. on this point
was clearly not a disagreement in principle but on the application of the
principle to the facts of the case, a matter which they did not discuss in any
detail. Among the factors which Estey J. took into con­sideration with respect
to tainting were the connec­tion between the two statements, the fact that the accused's
mind had been directed to the first statement, and the fact that the same
police officers had been present on each occasion.

One or more of these factors are mentioned in the cases dealing
with tainting, but of all the factors, the interval of time between the two
state­ments is of prime importance.

[Page 430]

In the case at bar, the second statement made by Horvath
began just as he was coming out of hypnosis and within a very few minutes,
perhaps two or three, after Horvath had made, under hypnosis, the inculpatory
statement contained in the second monologue. In the course of the second
monologue, Horvath had been able to recall and express a memory so intolerable
that the immense emotional pressure generated by it had triggered a
psychological defence mechanism powerful enough to produce hysterical amnesia.
This psychological defence had just been broken down at the cost of the subject
going through a state of extreme emo­tional turmoil. The breaking down of this
defence, the exceedingly short time between the end of Horvath's hypnotic state
and the beginning of the second statement, the correlation between the
second monologue and the second statement, the fact that Sergeant Proke
was both the hypnotist and the recipient of the second statement lead me
to the inescapable conclusion that the second statement, although given
while Horvath was no longer under hypnosis, was contaminated by the factor of
hypnosis which remains determinative of the whole issue.

If Horvath's second statement was not tainted, I cannot
conceive of any that could be.

Horvath's third statement is not reproduced in the case.
With respect to its content, I rely on the trial judge who said that it was a
projection of the second; I understand this to mean that it was
essentially the putting into writing of the content of the second statement,
with more or less detail. This is what Corporal Delwisch said to Horvath in
the presence of Sergeant Proke and before the third statement: ""We
just want to get down in writing, John, what you already told Sergeant Proke
here"". Corporal Delwisch wrote the confes­sion and testified that it was
an eight-page statement and that the usual police warning was given and written
on the statement.

Now the third statement was not received by Sergeant Proke,
but by Corporal Delwisch, one of the recipients of the first statement. Sergeant
Proke was not present. On the other hand, Corporal

[Page 431]

Delwisch was re-introduced to Horvath by Ser­geant Proke and
Horvath's mind was clearly directed to the second statement when he made
the third: just before he started the third statement, Sergeant Proke,
the hypnotist, had asked Horvath in the presence of Corporal Delwisch:
""Are you still willing to repeat to them (Corporal Delwisch and
another R.C.M.P. officer) what you told me?"" Horvath began to make the third
statement approximately fifty minutes after the second.

Keeping in mind that the burden to prove volun­tariness rests
with the Crown, I have no difficulty in concluding that the Crown has not
discharged the burden and in agreeing with the trial judge that if the second
statement was defective, the third could not stand: it was a
culmination of the second.

In other words, the second monologue and the second and third
statements were part of a contin­uous and very short process. Each stage of
the process aroused the other in quick succession. The third statement found
its polluted source in the second statement and the second statement in
the equally polluted source of the second monologue uttered under hypnosis.
Both statements are as vitiated as their source and equally involuntary
and inadmissible.

VI—OPPRESSION

I agree with my brother Martland that this is not a case for
considering whether ""oppression"", within the meaning of the English
Judges' Rules, ought to be recognized as a ground for excluding a confession.
Not only did the learned trial judge not make any finding of oppression with
respect to the Proke interview but, in the course of argument, he expressed the
view that, by contrast with the first statement the Proke interview
involved no element of oppression:

THE COURT: There is obviously no element of oppres­sion
here; quite to the contrary. There was an element of confidence and tremendous
confidence on the subject to the interrogator. In fact, the subject felt very
highly of the interrogator and said I couldn't lie to that man, he said to
somebody else, so the oppression aspect you can forget about it.

[Page 432]

While it might be argued that the inducement of unconsented
hypnosis by a person in authority is a subtle and covert form of oppressive
treatment, I am not prepared to say whether or not the learned trial judge was
in error on this point, for it seems to me inappropriate to consider the still
undefined and possibly broad ground of oppression on the narrow basis of the
unusual circumstances of this case. Whether or not it amounts to oppression, unconsented
hypnosis induced by a person in au­thority is quite sufficient by itself to
render a statement involuntary, at par with threats, promises and violence.

VII—VERACITY AND OTHER MATTERS

Some psychiatrists apparently believe that a subject under
hypnosis remains capable of fab­ricating and deceiving and that the reliability
or veracity of his response is difficult to ascertain even for the skilled
hypnotist: Spector and Foster (op. cit.). However, we must accept
Dr. Stephenson's opinion that in this case there was no reason to doubt that
Horvath was telling the truth as he saw it during his second monologue. By way
of consequence, (and although Dr. Stephenson did not say so explicitely)
Horvath's second and third statements must have been true to the
extent at least that they coincided with the second monologue.

One of the policy reasons most frequently advanced for holding
inadmissible confessions obtained by threats or promises is the untrustwor­thiness
of such confessions. But the sole purpose of the voir dire remains to
determine voluntariness and admissibility. At that stage, the veracity of the
confession and the guilt of the accused are in principle irrelevant: R. v. Gauthier[26].
The principle is qualified only in two circumstances. The first is where
the accused has testified in the voir dire and his answer to the
question whether his statement was true might assist the trial judge in
weighing

[Page 433]

the evidence in order to determine whether or not the statement
was voluntary: De Clercq v. The Queen[27].
De Clercq has no application in the case at bar where the accused did not
testify in the voir dire. The second qualification is where the discov­ery
of certain facts revealed by the confession confirms the confession; then, that
part of the confession which led to the discovery of the facts, which was
confirmed by the discovery of the facts and without which the facts could not
be brought before the jury is admissible, but further than that, no part of an
otherwise involuntary confession is admissible: The Queen v. Wray[28].
The rule in Wray was complied with in the case at bar.

Apart from the untrustworthiness of confessions extorted by
threats or promises, other policy reasons have also been advanced to explain
the rejec­tion of confessions improperly obtained. But the basic reason is the accused's
absolute right to remain silent either completely or partially and not to
incriminate himself unless he wants to. This is why it is important that the
accused understand what is at stake in the procedure. In a voir dire,
voluntariness not veracity governs admissibility. Dr. Stephenson's expert
opinion as to the truthful­ness of Horvath's confessions is accordingly not
determinative of the issue of admissibility.

I wish to add that the accused's absolute right to remain silent
includes not only the right to censor any information which is on his conscious
mind but also the right to control the administration of artificial processes
whereby unconsciously held information might emerge into consciousness. In this
sense, the accused has the absolute right to censor his unconscious mind as
well as his con­scious one. The police must take the accused as they find him,
and if it so happens that he suffers from hysterical amnesia, he has the right
not to be cured against his will by the use of extraordinary means, however
desirable his cure might be from a police or medical point of view.

It would appear that hypnosis and narcoanalysis are used on a
consensual basis by certain police

[Page 434]

forces as well as by the defence and it has been argued that they
can serve useful purposes: Spector and Foster, (op. cit.); Lowter, (op.
cit.).

I refrain from commenting on such practices short of noting that
even the consensual use of hypnosis and narcoanalysis for evidentiary purposes
may present problems: under normal police interrogation, a suspect has the
opportunity to renew or deny his consent to answer each question, which is no
longer the case once he is, although by consent, in a state of hypnosis or
under the influ­ence of a ""truth serum"".

But the use of such interrogation techniques on unwilling
suspects is a dehumanising process and should in my view be proscribed.

I also refrain from expressing any view on confessions obtained
while the accused is under the effect of alcohol: there was no drunkenness in
the case at bar and, according to the uncontradicted evidence of Dr. Stephenson,
there is no similarity between a state of light hypnosis and drunkenness.

VIII—CONCLUSION

In the result, I agree with the learned trial judge that ""it
is the factor of hypnotism which has tipped the balance against admission in
this case"".

I would dispose of the appeal as is proposed by my brother
Spence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Convictions for driving
offences—Automatic suspension of licences under provincial statute—Accused
unaware of suspension—Charges of driving while disqualified—Whether ignorance
of suspension ignorance of fact or of law—Whether proof of mens rea essential
to found conviction—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 238(3)—Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, s. 86D, am.
1976 (B.C.), c. 35, s. 20; 1977 (B.C.), c. 41, s. 3.

The accused were convicted of offences under
s. 236  of the Criminal Code . They suffered an automatic suspension
of their driving licences under s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 253, as amended by 1976 (B.C.), c. 35, s. 20 and by
1977 (B.C.), c. 41, s. 3. They thereafter drove motor vehicles
notwithstanding such suspension, and were then charged not for a violation of
the provincial statute under which the suspension was made but rather under
s. 238(3) of the federal Criminal Code . There was a finding on the
trials of this charge that neither accused knew that his licence to drive had
been suspended. Despite this finding they were convicted at first instance, but
on appeal by way of stated case, their convictions were set aside by Gould J.
who held that proof of mens rea was essential to a conviction of an
offence under s. 238(3) . The British Columbia Court of Appeal affirmed.
The Crown then appealed to this Court.

[Page 548]

Held (Ritchie,
Pigeon and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Estey JJ.: In enacting s. 238(3)  of the Criminal
Code , Parliament created a criminal offence merely by reason of a violation
of a provincial sanction against driving while one’s licence is suspended, save
that it applied its own sanction throughout Canada. Parliament does not acquire
legislative jurisdiction simply by making its legislation operative throughout Canada. There must be a substantive non-geographical
basis for federal legislation, and where the criminal law is concerned, and
especially where an offence is included in the Criminal Code , it is
generally found in a requirement of proof of mens rea. (Beaver v. The
Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 531.)

The fact that the offence under
s. 238(3)  may be prosecuted by indictment and carries in that respect a
maximum two-year term of imprisonment supported the application of the general
principle laid down in Beaver v. The Queen. Indeed, the inclusion of an
offence in the Criminal Code  by that very fact must be taken to import mens
rea, and there would have to be a clear indication against it before a
Court would be justified in denying its essentiality. The Criminal Code  is
a code of outright prohibitions, distinguishable from regulatory offences
created by other kinds of federal legislation. (R. v. Pierce
Fisheries Ltd., [1971] S.C.R. 5.)

Much of the argument by the Crown proceeded
on the basis that ignorance of the suspension was ignorance of law and not of fact,
and hence there was no defence to the charge under s. 238(3) . The effect,
if this is a correct appraisal, is to make s. 238(3)  an offence of
absolute liability where the provincial suspension of a driving licence is
automatic under the provincial enactment (proof of such suspension being made),
but not if the provincial suspension does not take effect without a requirement
of notice. In either case, the consequence is to govern the operation of the
federal statute by what is prescribed by the provincial enactment, and hence to
create a variable type of federal offence which may have a different operation
in different provinces according to the character of the relevant provincial
legislation.

This cannot be. Criminality under the Criminal
Code  must depend on what Parliament independently proscribes; it risks the
vulnerability of its enactment if it simply applies a sanction to a violation
of a provincial statute. The issue of ignorance of fact or ignorance of law is
properly applicable to the enforcement of the provincial enactment under which
the suspension from

[Page 549]

driving is made and not to the enforcement of
s. 238(3) of the Code.

So far as the operation of s. 238(3)  is
concerned, the existence of a suspension from driving is a question of fact
underlying the invocation of that provision, and so too is proof that an
accused charged thereunder drove while his licence to do so was under
suspension. This position is not affected by whether the provincial legislation
operates to make a suspension automatic or whether it arises only upon some
notice or other action to be taken thereunder. For the purpose of the Criminal
Code , whether there has been an effective suspension is simply a question
of fact.

Per Ritchie
and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The mistake made by the accused in these
cases was nothing more than a mistake as to the legal consequences of a
conviction under s. 236  of the Criminal Code  involving as they do
the automatic suspension of the operator’s licence under s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle
Act. Once the mistake is recognized as being founded in ignorance of the
law the respondents are faced with s. 19  of the Criminal Code  which
provides: “Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an
excuse for committing that offence.”

Here there was a plain statement of the law
in British Columbia, as contained in s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle Act, requiring
the automatic suspension of an operator’s licence upon breach of certain
sections of the Criminal Code  dealing with the operation of motor
vehicles and a disregard of the provisions of this section which involved
the accused in a breach of s. 238  of the Criminal Code . There was
no evidence that either of the respondents made any effort to determine whether
their licences had been suspended or not and this was not a case involving
ignorance of some regulation or technicality which might have been
understandably unknown to the driving public and thus to the respondents.

Per Beetz J., dissenting:
It was not necessary to express any view as to whether the offence created by
s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  is a mens rea offence or one
of strict liability: even if it is a mens rea offence, it is one where mens
rea can be inferred from the nature of the act committed and cannot be
negated by the accused’s ignorance of the law.

Respondents had knowledge of the fact that
caused the suspension of their licences, namely their convictions for offences
as a result of which such suspension took

[Page 550]

place automatically, ipso facto. Their
ignorance of this result was an ignorance of the law which is no excuse and
cannot be considered as a defence.

APPEALS by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
affirming a judgment of Gould J. whereby the appeals by the accused by way of
stated case from their convictions on charges of driving while disqualified
contrary to s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  were allowed and the
convictions quashed. Appeals dismissed, Ritchie, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.
dissenting.

B.A. Crane, Q.C., and R.W. McDiarmid, for
the respondents.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The facts relevant to the
disposition of these two appeals are set out in the reasons prepared by my
brother Ritchie which I have had the advantage of reading. The basic fact,
common to both cases, is that the two accused suffered an automatic suspension
of their driving licences under s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 253, as amended by 1976 (B.C.), c. 35, s. 20, and by
1977 (B.C.), c. 41, s. 3. They thereafter drove motor vehicles
notwithstanding such suspension, and were then charged not for a violation of
the provincial statute under which the suspension was made but rather under
s. 238(3) of the federal Criminal Code . There was a finding on the
trials of this charge that neither accused knew that his licence to drive had
been suspended. Despite this finding they were convict-

[Page 551]

ed at first instance, but on appeal by way of
stated case, their convictions were set aside by Gould J. who held that proof
of mens rea was essential to a conviction of an offence under
s. 238(3) . The British Columbia Court of Appeal affirmed. I hold the same
view.

Section 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  is as
follows:

238. …

(3) Every one who drives a motor vehicle in
Canada while he is disqualified or prohibited from driving a motor vehicle by
reason of the legal suspension or cancellation, in any province, of his permit
or licence or of his right to secure a permit or licence to drive a motor
vehicle in that province is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years; or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

What Parliament has done is to create a criminal
offence merely by reason of a violation of a provincial sanction against
driving while one’s licence is suspended, save that it applies its own sanction
throughout Canada. It needs no extensive citation of authority to say that
Parliament does not acquire legislative jurisdiction simply by making its
legislation operative throughout Canada: see Toronto Electric Commissioners
v. Snider[2], at
p. 401. There must be a substantive non-geographical basis for federal
legislation, and where the criminal law is concerned, and especially where an
offence is included in the Criminal Code , it is generally found in a
requirement of proof of mens rea.

This Court expressed this general principle in Beaver
v. The Queen[3], and
it was expressed many years ago in England in Sherras v. De Rut zen[4], at

[Page 552]

p. 921. If mens rea is not a requirement
for proof of an offence under s. 238(3) , I would have serious doubt as to
its validity on the principle expressed in Johnson v. Attorney-General of
Alberta[5], namely,
that just as it is not open to a Province to supplement by additional sanctions
the provisions of the Criminal Code , it is not open to Parliament to add
a sanction, without more, to a violation of a provincial penal statute.

Much of the argument in this Court by the Crown
appellant proceeded on the basis that ignorance of the suspension was ignorance
of law and not of fact, and hence there was no defence to the charge under
s. 238(3) . The effect, if this is a correct appraisal, is to make
s. 238(3)  an offence of absolute liability where the provincial suspension
of a driving licence is automatic under the provincial enactment (proof of such
suspension being made), but not if the provincial suspension does not take
effect without a requirement of notice. In either case, the consequence is to
govern the operation of the federal statute by what is prescribed by the
provincial enactment, and hence to create a variable type of federal offence
which may have a different operation in different provinces according to the
character of the relevant provincial legislation.

This cannot be. Criminality under the Criminal
Code  must depend on what Parliament independently proscribes; it risks the
vulnerability of its enactment if it simply applies a sanction to a violation
of a provincial statute. In my opinion, the issue of ignorance of fact or
ignorance of law is properly applicable to the enforcement of the provincial
enactment under which the suspension from driving is made and not to the
enforcement of s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code . Thus, in the present
case reference should properly be made to the British Columbia Motor-vehicle
Act, s. 18, as amended and to ss. 98 and 99, as amended, if it is to be
invoked against persons who claim to be unaware of the suspension of their
driving licences.

[Page 553]

So far as the operation of s. 238(3)  is
concerned, the existence of a suspension from driving is a question of fact
underlying the invocation of that provision, and so too is proof that an
accused charged thereunder drove while his licence to do so was under
suspension. That was the view taken by Culliton C.J.S. in Regina v. Ooms[6], by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina
v. Finn[7], and
earlier in Nova Scotia in Regina ex rel. Ross v. Jollimore[8]. I do not see how this position is
affected by whether the provincial legislation operates to make a suspension
automatic or whether it arises only upon some notice or other action to be
taken thereunder. For the purpose of the Criminal Code , whether there
has been an effective suspension is simply a question of fact. In my opinion,
therefore, Regina v. Villeneuve[9], a
judgment of O’Hearn Co.Ct.J. in Nova Scotia, was wrongly decided.

This brings me back to the essentiality of mens
rea to found a conviction under s. 238(3) . I should have thought that
the fact that the offence may be prosecuted by indictment and carries in that
respect a maximum two-year term of imprisonment would support the application
of the general principle laid down in Beaver v. The Queen, supra. I need
not repeat the constitutional consideration which I have mentioned earlier and
which leads to the same conclusion. Indeed, the inclusion of an offence in the Criminal
Code  by that very fact must be taken to import mens rea, and there
would have to be clear indication against it before a Court would be justified
in denying its essentiality. The Criminal Code  is a code of outright
prohibitions, distinguishable from regulatory offences created by other kinds
of federal legislation. In this last-mentioned class, it is understandable that
there should be questions raised about the requirement of mens rea. The
judgment of this Court in Regina v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.[10] is illustrative.

[Page 554]

The encompassing judgment of my brother Dickson
in Regina v. City of Sault Ste. Marie[11],
does not lead to a different conclusion in the present case. It must be
remembered that in wrestling, as he so admirably did, with whether there were
two or (as he concluded) three categories of offences, he was dealing with the
operation of provincial legislation, namely, The Ontario Water Resources
Commission Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 332, and was not concerned with
evaluating offences under the Criminal Code . Several passages in his
reasons make clear that mens rea continued to be essential to prove
commission of a Criminal Code  offence. I refer particularly to the
following passage (at p. 1309):

The distinction between the true criminal
offence and the public welfare offence is one of prime importance. Where the
offence is criminal, the Crown must establish a mental element, namely, that
the accused who committed the prohibited act did so intentionally or
recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence, or with
wilful blindness toward them.

Justice Dickson’s classification would be an
appropriate reference point for assessing the thrust of the provincial Motor-vehicle
Act in its effect upon a person who drove in the Province while his licence
to do so was suspended, but I see no need here to go further than to say with
him that s. 238(3)  falls clearly within his first category of offences
requiring mens rea.

I would dismiss the two appeals.

The judgment of Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—These two appeals
were heard together from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia, dismissing an appeal brought from a judgment of Mr. Justice
Gould whereby he allowed the appeals of the present respondents and gave an
affirmative answer to the following questions raised in the two stated cases
which came on for hearing before him:

1. Did I err in holding that it is not
necessary for an accused person to have mens rea in order for an accused
to be convicted of an offence under Section

[Page 555]

238(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada where
a legal suspension of the accused person’s licence arose automatically by
operation of law pursuant to Section 86D, of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C.
1960, c. 253 (as amended by S.B.C. 1976, c. 35, s. 20).

2. Did I err in holding that the absence of
actual knowledge by the accused person of the automatic invocation of the
suspension the accused’s licence does not provide a defence to the charge
before me.

In the course of the reasons for judgment
delivered by Mr. Justice Seaton on behalf of the Court of Appeal he
described the circumstances giving rise to the two appeals in the following
terms:

These two appeals that were heard together
raised the same issue. Both Mr. Prue and Mr. Baril were convicted of
offences under section 236  of the Criminal Code . Impaired driving was one
and maybe the other was also impaired driving. Within a short period of time
thereafter each was found driving an automobile. They were then charged under
section 238 , subsection (3)  of the Criminal Code , which reads in part
as follows:

Every one who drives a motor vehicle in
Canada while he is disqualified or prohibited from driving a motor vehicle by
reason of the legal suspension or cancellation, in any province, of his permit
or licence or of his right to secure a permit or licence to drive a motor
vehicle in that province is guilty of an offence.

Each was convicted, appealed by way of
stated case, and those appeals came on for hearing before Mr. Justice
Gould, who allowed the appeals. In each case there was a finding of fact that
the accused did not know that his licence had been suspended, and I stress
that. These are not cases where there was no evidence of notice, or something
of that sort. The trial judges had found as a fact that the accused did not
know that their licences were suspended. A few years ago that would have been
surprising, but apparently the practice has changed and people are not
notified. This grows out of section 86D of the Motor Vehicle Act, as
amended in 1976, which states in part:

Where a person is convicted of an offence
under section … 236 of the Criminal Code  … by means of a motor vehicle,
that person’s driver’s or operator’s licence, whether issued in this or any other
jurisdiction, is, by that fact, suspended for a period of…

And then there are various periods.

[Page 556]

It is common ground that each of these
respondents did drive during the period mentioned in section 86D when
their licence was in part suspended.

It is contended on behalf of the defence that
conviction for the offence created by s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  can
only be justified where mens rea has been established by affirmative
evidence and it becomes necessary to consider the elements of this defence in
order to determine the issue raised by the stated case. Happily, the question
has been authoritatively analyzed by my brother Dickson in the recent case of Regina
v. City of Sault Ste. Marie[12], where
he said at p. 1325:

I conclude, for the reasons which I have
sought to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of
three categories of offences rather than the traditional two:

1. Offences in which mens rea, consisting
of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must
be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act
committed, or by additional evidence.

2. Offences in which there is no necessity
for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing of the
prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it open to the
accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care. This
involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in the
circumstances. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed
in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission
innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.
These offences may properly be called offences of strict liability.
Mr. Justice Estey so referred to them in Hickey’s case.

3. Offences of absolute liability where it
is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of
fault.

Offences which are criminal in the true
sense fall in the first category. Public welfare offences would prima facie be
in the second category. They are not subject to the presumption of full mens
rea. An offence of this type would fall in the first category only if such
words as ‘wilfully,’ ‘with intent,’ ‘knowingly,’ or ‘intentionally’ are

[Page 557]

contained in the statutory provision
creating the offence. On the other hand, the principle that punishment should
in general not be inflicted on those without fault applies. Offences of
absolute liability would be those in respect of which the legislature has made
it clear that guilt would follow proof merely of the proscribed act. The
overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature, the subject matter of
the legislation, the importance of the penalty, and the precision of the
language used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence
falls into the third category.

In my view, s. 238(3)  creates one of those
offences in relation to which it is unnecessary for the prosecution to prove
the existence of mens rea as “the doing of the prohibited act prima
facie imports the offence”. Conviction for the driving offences here
involved was admitted by both accused, but it is contended on their behalf that
the automatic suspension of licences attendant upon such a conviction by reason
of s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle Act (supra) was a fact of
which the respondents were unaware, and that there was accordingly a mistaken
belief held by both respondents in the existence of a set of facts which, if
true, would negative the existence of mens rea and afford a full defence
to the charge under s. 236 .

The offence created by s. 238  relates to
driving a motor vehicle while prohibited from doing so “by reason of the legal
suspension or cancellation, in any province”, of the driver’s
permit or licence to drive. (Italics are my own.) The terms of any such
provincial suspension are accordingly incorporated into the Criminal Code  with
the result that suspension is the automatic result of a conviction under
s. 236  in some provinces but not in others.

It will be readily apparent that a wide
difference exists between the case of a man who acts in ignorance of the
provision for automatic suspension and is therefore acting under a mistake of
law, and a man who resides in a province where the imposition of such a
suspension can only be effected as the result of the intervention of some
administrative act by the authorities. The latter

[Page 558]

situation is evidenced in jurisdictions where
provision is made for the clerk of the court, the presiding magistrate or some
other official giving notice to the accused of the suspension of his licence
before that suspension can be effective. In the latter type of case when the
requisite administrative step or steps have not been taken and the accused can
show that he was therefore ignorant of the fact of his suspension, his
ignorance is one of fact and not of law, and in this event it has been
consistently held that he has a valid defence to the charge. The cases in
support of this proposition are collected and form the subject of comment in
the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Martin of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario in R. v. Lock[13], and
they are referred to with approval in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Seaton in these cases. These cases turn on the finding that
the failure to give notice or to take such other administrative step as is
required is a question of fact and that the accused’s failure to know of the
suspension is not a mistake of law.

In the present cases the respondents’ lack of
knowledge of the suspension of their licences was not occasioned by any mistake
of fact but rather by ignorance of the law attendant upon failure to be aware
of the automatic suspension for which provision is made in s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle
Act (supra). In this latter regard I share the view expressed by His
Honour Judge Peter O’Hearn of the County Court in Nova Scotia, in R. v.
Villeneuve, supra, where conviction under s. 221  of the Criminal
Code  (now s. 236 ) resulted in automatic revocation of the licence and
the defence was advanced that the accused was ignorant of the fact that his
licence had been revoked. Judge O’Hearn, in referring to Regina ex rel. Ross
v. Jollimore[14], said
of the charge before him (at pp. 270-1):

Of what was he ignorant? In Jollimore it
could be said that the defendant did not know whether the Magistrate had
forwarded a record of the original conviction to the Registrar, or whether the
Registrar had acted thereupon by revoking the licence. These are administrative
acts; they are matters of fact. In the instant case, the accused was ignorant
of the fact that

[Page 559]

his licence was revoked but this was a
direct consequence of his ignorance of the legal effect of conviction under Cr.
Code s. 221. That is, his ignorance of the fact of revocation is not
independent of his ignorance of the law, but directly dependent upon it, and
his ignorance is essentially ignorance of the law. There is no independent
factual error to make it a mistake of mixed law and fact.

I am satisfied that the mistake made by the
accused in the present cases is nothing more than a mistake as to the legal
consequences of a conviction under s. 236  of the Criminal Code  involving
as they do the automatic suspension of the operator’s licence under s. 86D
of the Motor-vehicle Act.

Once the mistake is recognized as being founded
in ignorance of the law the respondents are faced with the provisions of
s. 19  of the Criminal Code  which read as follows:

19. Ignorance of the law by a person who
commits an offence is not an excuse for committing that offence.

What we have here is a plain statement of the
law in British Columbia, as contained in s. 86D of the Motor-vehicle
Act, requiring the automatic suspension of an operator’s licence upon
breach of certain sections of the Criminal Code  dealing with the
operation of motor vehicles and a disregard of the provisions of this
section which involved the accused in a breach of s. 238  of the Criminal
Code . There is no evidence that either of the respondents made any effort
to determine whether their licences had been suspended or not and this is not a
case involving ignorance of some regulation or technicality which might have
been understandably unknown to the driving public and thus to the respondents.

For all these reasons I would allow these
appeals, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and
direct the conviction of the two respondents for the offences with which they
were charged.

BEETZ J. (dissenting)—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice and of my brother
Ritchie.

[Page 560]

I do not find it necessary to express any view
as to whether the offence created by s. 238(3)  of the Criminal Code  is
a mens rea offence or one of strict liability: even if it is a mens
rea offence, it is one where mens rea can be inferred from the
nature of the act committed and cannot be negated by the accused’s ignorance of
the law.

Respondents had knowledge of the fact that
caused the suspension of their licences, namely their convictions for offences
as a result of which such suspension took place automatically, ipso facto. I
agree with my brother Ritchie that their ignorance of this result was an
ignorance of the law which is no excuse and cannot be considered as a defence.
I would dispose of the appeals as is proposed by my brother Ritchie.

                   In
1981, appellant pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and committing robbery,
and he was later charged with attempted murder. The second offence took place
during the breaking and entering incident. The victim was brutally beaten and
suffered severe injuries. She would likely have died without treatment. The
trial judge charged the jury that appellant could be convicted of attempted
murder if he had an intention to kill or an intention to cause bodily harm
knowing that death may result and being reckless whether death ensues or not.
This charge was in accordance with Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R.
399. Appellant was convicted. On appeal from his conviction, appellant invoked
the rule against multiple convictions enunciated in the Kienapple case,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, and alleged that having pleaded guilty to breaking and
entering and robbery, he should not have been tried again for attempted murder
arising out of the same set of circumstances. The Court of Appeal held that the
Kienapple principle did not apply and dismissed the appeal. The
appellant was then granted leave to appeal at large to this Court. At the
hearing, he indicated that he intended to rely also on the Ancio case,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 225. The Ancio decision, which was rendered after
appellant obtained leave to appeal to this Court, overruled Lajoie and
held that the mens rea for attempted murder was the specific intent to
kill. The Court adjourned the hearing to permit both parties to file factums on
the new issue. At the new hearing, both the Kienapple issue and the Ancio
issue were argued. The Crown conceded that the trial judge's charge was an
error of law if Ancio were to be applied, but it contended that (1) to
entertain the Ancio issue would be to hear an appeal on an issue in
respect of which no leave has been granted; (2) if leave should be granted, the
proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should in any
event be applied in so far as it may be grounded in an attack on the judge's
charge to the jury; and (3) should this Court not apply the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code to this appeal, it should substitute conviction for an
offence under s. 228 of the Code.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed but the conviction at trial for the offence of
attempted murder should be substituted by a conviction for the included offence
of causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life. 

 

                                                  (1)
The Kienapple Issue

 

                   The
Kienapple principle has no application in this case. For the Kienapple
rule to apply, there must be both a factual and legal nexus between the
charges. Multiple convictions are only precluded under the Kien­apple
principle if they arise from the same ""cause"", ""matter"", or
""delict"", and if there is sufficient proximity between the offences
charged. This requirement of sufficient proximity between offences will only be
satisfied if there is no additional and distinguishing element contained in the
offence for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple
principle. In the case at bar, the offence of attempted murder involved the
appellant's striking the victim with intent to kill or, at that time, with
intent to cause bodily harm, knowing it to be likely to cause death and being
reckless whether death ensued or not. The elements of the offence of breaking
and entering and committing robbery involved breaking and entering the
apartment, taking jewellery and money, and using violence. There is no
overlapping of the essential elements of the two offences, the only common
element is violence, and the required specific intents are clearly different.

 

                                                      (2)
The Ancio Issue

 

                   Provided
that he is still in the judicial system, an accused charged with an offence is
entitled to have his culpability determined on the basis of what is held to be
the proper and accurate interpretation of the Criminal Code . This test
affords a means of striking a balance between the impractical dream of
providing perfect justice to all those convicted under the overruled authority
and the practical necessity of having some finality in the criminal process.
Finality in criminal proceedings is of the utmost importance, but it is
adequately served by the normal operation of res judicata. Thus a person
convicted under Lajoie will not be able to reopen his or her case,
unless the conviction is not final.

 

                   The
fact that appellant's factum filed in support of his motion for leave and the
oral argument at the hearing of the motion related solely to the Kienapple
issue does not preclude him from invoking Ancio. Leave to appeal to this
Court was not limited to the Kienapple issue but was granted without any
restriction. The appellant became entitled to bring into question the validity
of his conviction on any question of law at a time when this Court had just reversed
its own interpretation of attempted murder. The appellant is thus entitled to
invoke the new question of law raised by reason of Ancio in accordance
with s. 618(1)(b) of the Code. He has established that he was
""in the system"" since he still had an appeal pending before this
Court when Ancio was released.

 

                   It
is common ground that the charge to the jury did not conform to Ancio.
The curative provision of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code cannot be
used to save the attempted murder conviction since it is not clear that the
jury would have convicted the appellant of this offence if instructed that the
necessary intent was the intent to kill. The appeal should be dismissed but a
conviction for the included offence of causing bodily harm with intent to endanger
life, contrary to s. 228(b) of the Code, should be substituted
pursuant to s. 613(1)(b)(i) and s. 613(3) of the Code. This
included offence was put to the jury but no verdict was rendered on it as the
jury found the appellant guilty of attempted murder. Since the jurors convicted
on the basis of one of the two mental elements put to them in the trial judge's
charge, it follows that they would also have convicted the appellant of the
offence under s. 228(b).

 

                   Finally,
the analysis of the Kienapple issue is equally applicable in respect of
the s. 228(b) offence. The intent required under s. 228(b) is an
aggravated intent distinct and additional to that which would suffice for a
conviction of breaking and entering and robbery.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d)
289, dismissing the accused's appeal from his conviction for attempted murder.
Appeal dismissed, but the conviction at trial for the offence of attempted
murder should be substituted by a conviction for the included offence of
causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life.

Goldberg, for the appellant.

Stewart, Q.C., for the respondent.

 

                   The
following is the judgment delivered by 

 

1.                The Court‑‑In
1974, in Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399, this Court, speaking
through Martland J., held that when s. 24(1)  of the Criminal Code 
referred to ""an intent to commit an offence"" in relation to murder,
it meant an intention to commit that offence in any of the ways provided for
under s. 212 or s. 213 of the Code. The effect of the decision was that
on an attempted murder charge the Crown could succeed, insofar as the mental
element of the crime was concerned, on proving beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused either (i) meant to cause death or (ii) meant to cause bodily harm that
the accused knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death
ensued or not.

 

2.                Some
ten years later in R. v. Ancio, [1984] l S.C.R. 225, the majority of the
Court, speaking through McIntyre J., held that Lajoie should no longer
be followed, that the mens rea for attempted murder was the specific
intent to kill. A mental element falling short of that level might well lead to
conviction for another offence, for example, one of the aggravated forms of
assault, but not conviction for an attempted murder.

 

3.                In
1981, during the period between the 1974 judgment in Lajoie and the 1984
judgment in Ancio, the appellant Gerald Michael Wigman was tried and
convicted before a judge and jury of attempting to murder one Margaret Hill by
beating her. The judge charged that the accused could be convicted if the jury
found he had either of the two intents mentioned. That was the law according to
Lajoie. It was an error of law however if Ancio is applied, as
the Crown concedes. The appellant, whose conviction is now under review in this
Court, says he is entitled to the benefit of Ancio. The Crown says he is
not. That is the first and primary issue in this appeal. A second point arises
as to the possible application of the so‑called Kien‑ apple
principle, found in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] l S.C.R. 729.

The
Facts and the Trial

 

4.                Mr.
Wigman was charged with three counts of breaking and entering and robbery in an
indictment dated October 26, 1981. Count #2 related to an apartment in the City
of Vancouver in which Mrs. Margaret Hill resided. Mr. Wigman pleaded guilty to
all three charges before Toy J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court.

 

5.                On
October 30, 1981, Mr. Wigman was charged with an attempted murder that took
place during the break and enter incident cited in Count #2. Mrs. Hill, a 69
year old woman, lived alone in a ground floor apartment. She went to bed at
8:30 p.m. on May 16, 1981. A neighbour found her lying on the floor of her
bedroom the next day at 4:00 p.m. and it was evident that she had suffered very
severe injuries. The apartment was ""an awful mess"". A number of items
had been taken. The telephone cord had been cut. Medical evidence indicated
that she had been struck on the head at least six times and had enormous
bruises on other parts of her body. She would likely have died without
treatment. The fingerprints of the accused were found in the apartment.

 

6.                The
charge was heard by Toy J. and a jury. At the opening of the trial the accused,
by his counsel, admitted that he, the accused, gained entry to Mrs. Hill's
apartment by removing a sliding door from the apartment balcony, and that he
stole various items of jewellery and a sum of money. There was no reference
during the trial to Mr. Wigman's prior guilty plea to the break and enter
charge. Nor was reference made to the Kienapple argument that the
accused could not be convicted of both the robbery charge and the attempted
murder charge, the violence being common to both.

 

7.                Mr.
Wigman's defence to the attempted murder charge was that he had been
accompanied by a person called ""Dave"" who had assaulted and severely
beaten Mrs. Hill.

 

8.                The
judge charged the jury as to the requisite intent for attempted murder as
follows:

 

. . . you can go either route, an intention to
kill or an intention to cause bodily harm knowing that death may result and
being reckless whether death ensues or not.

 

Words
giving the jury the choice of two intents were repeated many times in the
charge of the jury. This charge was in accordance with Lajoie, but it
now conflicts with Ancio.

 

9.                Toy
J. left with the jury two included offences to the attempted murder charge: (1)
causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life; and (2) assault causing
bodily harm. The jury retired to deliberate at 5:12 p.m. on November 6, 1981
and returned at 5:28 p.m. on November 7, 1981 with a verdict of guilty of
attempted murder. 

 

10.              The
judge noted upon sentencing that the testimony of the accused that a ""Dave
X"" had administered the beatings without the knowledge or agreement of the
accused was rejected by the jury in whole or in part, although it could not be
said whether the jury found Mr. Wigman guilty as a principal, or as a party to
a common purpose pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . We would add
that it cannot be said with certainty whether the jury found that Mr. Wigman
meant to cause death or that he had the lesser and now irrelevant intent,
namely, that of meaning to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause
death or was reckless whether death ensued or not.

 

11.              On
December 4, 1981, Toy J. sentenced the appellant to ten years in prison with
respect to the charge of breaking and entering and committing robbery, and to
life imprisonment with respect to the conviction on the charge of attempted
murder.

The
Court of Appeal of British Columbia

 

12.              Mr.
Wigman, having obtained new counsel, appealed to the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia against his conviction for attempted murder. His counsel took as his
main point that the accused, having pleaded guilty to breaking and entering,
and robbery, should not have been tried again for attempted murder arising out
of the same set of circumstances. This is the Kienapple issue. The Court
was of the opinion that the principle did not have any application to the facts
in this case. In a decision reported at (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 289, Hutcheon
J.A. reviewed a number of the authorities canvassed in Sheppe v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 22, and the statement of Laskin C.J., at p. 27:

 

                   In Kienapple v. The Queen, supra,
this Court was concerned with a single act which gave rise to two different
offences, and it held that multiple convictions could not be supported for the
same delict or for the same cause or matter or where the same or substantially
the same elements entered into two different offences.

 

Hutcheon
J.A. concluded at p. 292 that the correct view of the matter was set out in the
Crown's argument:

 

The breaking and entering and robbery involved the
accused entering the victims [sic] apartment, taking the woman's
jewellery and money and using violence. The offence of attempted murder
involved the accused striking the woman with one of the two intents set out in
s. 212 (a) of the Criminal Code , or at the very least, involved the accused in
that he was a party to such an offence, pursuant to section 21(2)  and section
212 (a).

 

Hutcheon
J.A. held that on the facts in the case there were two offences involving the
same violence, but he had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that different
factual and legal elements underlay the two offences.

 

                                                                   III

 

The
Supreme Court of Canada

 

13.              Mr.
Wigman applied to this Court for leave to appeal which was granted on December
15, 1983 by a panel consisting of Laskin C.J. and Dickson and Estey JJ., [1983]
2 S.C.R. xv. Leave was granted at large, that is to say the leave was not
confined to any specified point or points. The order granting leave to appeal
reads:

 

                   UPON APPLICATION by counsel on behalf
of the Applicant for an Order granting leave to appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia dated the 28th day of June, 1983, and upon
hearing what was alleged by counsel on behalf of the Applicant as well as the
Respondent on the 5th day of December, 1983;

 

                   IT IS ORDERED that leave to appeal be
granted.

 

14.              In
a factum filed on June 25, 1984, the appellant set out the issues proposed to
be argued:

 

THAT the Appellant having pleaded guilty to Breaking and
Entering and Robbery should not have been tried again for Attempted Murder,
arising out of the same set of circumstances;

 

THAT the Trial Judge erred in not determining and/or in
failing to permit the jury to determine whether the Attempted Murder went
beyond the facts disclosed by the Breaking and Entering and Robbery;

 

THAT the Appellant having been sentenced to imprisonment
for 10 years for Breaking and Entering and Robbery should not have been
sentenced again for Attempted Murder;

 

THAT the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the two
convictions arising from the same violence should stand and that Kienapple
v. The Queen (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2nd) 524 had no application to the facts of
this case.

 

15.              The
appeal was scheduled to be heard on the morning of November 6, 1985. Shortly
before the Court convened that morning, counsel for the appellant told counsel
for the Crown that he intended to raise the R. v. Ancio issue. When the
Court opened, counsel made this known to the Court. Crown counsel objected on
the ground that he had had no warning of opposing counsel's intention to argue Ancio
and that the Crown was not in a position to respond to any such argument. The
Court accordingly adjourned the hearing to permit counsel for the appellant to
prepare a written submission on the Ancio issue and to afford Crown
counsel an opportunity to respond. Supplementary factums were filed.

 

16.              On
the renewed hearing of the appeal, both the Kienapple issue and the Ancio
issue were argued. The Crown makes three submissions. It contends that to
entertain the Ancio issue would be to hear an appeal on an issue in
respect of which no leave has been granted. It contends further that if leave
should be granted, the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  should in any event be applied in so far as it may be grounded in an
attack on the judge's charge to the jury. Finally, it is contended that, should
this Court not apply the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
to this appeal, it should substitute conviction for an offence under s. 228 of
the Code as it stood on the date of the offence. 

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Kienapple
Issue

 

17.              We
agree with the conclusion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal that the Kienapple
principle has no application and that Mr. Wigman could be convicted of the two
offences in question. In view of the extensive review undertaken in R. v.
Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, it is sufficient to simply reiterate that a
two‑part test must be met for the Kienapple rule to apply: there
must be both a factual and legal nexus between the charges. Multiple convictions
are only precluded under the Kienapple principle if they arise from the
same ""cause"", ""matter"", or ""delict"", and if there
is sufficient proximity between the offences charged. This requirement of
sufficient proximity between offences will only be satisfied if there is no
additional and distinguishing element contained in the offence for which a
conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple principle.

 

18.              In
the case at bar, the offence of attempted murder involved the appellant
striking Mrs. Hill with intent to kill or, at that time, with intent to cause
bodily harm, knowing it to be likely to cause death and being reckless whether
death ensued or not. The elements of the offence of breaking and entering and
committing robbery involved breaking and entering the apartment, taking
jewellery and money, and using violence. There is no overlapping of the
essential elements of the two offences, the only common element is violence,
and the required specific intents are clearly different. The Kienapple
principle does not apply and the appellant must fail on this point.

 

                                                                    V

 

The Ancio
Issue

 

19.              As
already indicated, the Ancio decision had not yet been released at the
time the appellant sought and obtained leave to appeal.

 

20.              The
appellant, however, submits that the charge of the trial judge to the jury
conflicts with the new interpretation of the Criminal Code  given in Ancio.
The inadequacy of the charge in this respect is not in doubt, as is conceded by
the Crown. The main point in issue is whether the appellant can invoke what is
now considered to be the correct interpretation of the Code.

 

21.              The
appropriate test is whether or not the accused is still in the judicial system.
As expressed in the Crown's factum, this test affords a means of striking a
balance between the ""wholly impractical dream of providing perfect justice
to all those convicted under the overruled authority and the practical
necessity of having some finality in the criminal process"". Finality in
criminal proceedings is of the utmost importance but the need for finality is
adequately served by the normal operation of res judicata: a matter once
finally judicially decided cannot be relitigated. Thus a person convicted under
Lajoie will not be able to reopen his or her case, unless, of course,
the conviction is not final. In the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 757, the Court observed that res judicata
would even preclude the reopening of cases decided by the courts on the basis
of constitutionally invalid laws. The res judicata principle would apply
with at least as much force to cases decided on the basis of subsequently
overruled case law.

 

22.              The
Crown, however, argues that Mr. Wigman ought not to be able to benefit from Ancio.
Counsel for the Crown contends that the appellant was granted leave exclusively
on the Kienapple rule since the factum filed in support of his motion
for leave and the oral argument at the hearing of the motion were all related
solely to this argument.

 

23.              The
flaw in the Crown's proposition is that it does not make any distinction
between the leave to appeal being limited to certain issues and the same leave
being granted at large. It is clear that the Court is empowered to restrict an
appeal to certain specific issues: Lizotte v. The King, [1951] S.C.R.
115, at pp. 117‑18; R. v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R. 144, at pp. 147‑48;
Kienapple, supra, at p. 732; and Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v.
The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662, at p. 669; (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 576 (sub
nom. R. v. McNamara). In such cases, the Supreme Court is without
jurisdiction to hear arguments dealing with issues other than the ones
enumerated on the order granting leave to appeal: Lizotte, supra, at p.
133; Warner, supra, at p. 151; Kienapple, supra, at p.
732; and Canadian Dredge & Dock Co., supra, at p. 671.
However, the situation is different when the right of appeal has not been
restricted to a specific question of law. The appellant is then entitled to
raise additional questions of law, subject to the discretion of the Court for
instance, not to decide a case on the basis of an issue tardily raised.

 

24.              In
this regard, s. 618(1)(b) of the Code, which governs the right to
appeal in this case, should be quoted in the context of the whole section:

 

                   618. (1) A person
who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by
the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a
judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law, if leave
to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty‑one
days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended
time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons,
allow. [Emphasis added.]

 

25.              The
difference in the wording between s. 618(1)(a) and (b) is
significant. The respondent's argument would require this Court to construe s.
618(1)(b) as if it read:

 

                   618. (1) A person
who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by
the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a judge
of the court of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law on which
leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty‑one
days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended
time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special
reasons, allow. [Emphasis added.] 

 

26.              That
this cannot be the correct interpretation when leave to appeal has been granted
at large is well illustrated in R. v. Caouette, [1973] S.C.R. 859, which
involved the scope of s. 621(1)(b), the counterpart of s. 618(1)(b)
for the Crown:

 

                   621. (1) Where a
judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal
taken under section 603 or 604 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to
paragraph 605(1)(a) or subsection 605(3), the Attorney General may
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a judge
of the court of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law, if leave to
appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty‑one days
after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as
the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

 

(As it
then read.)

 

27.              In
that case, the Crown asserted an appeal as of right, based on the questions of
law on which there had been a dissent, against the acquittal of Caouette by the
Court of Appeal. The Crown however also obtained leave to appeal under s.
621(1)(b) ""on any question of law"". After having stated that
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was the threshold question in the appeal,
Laskin J., as he then was, dissenting on another point, expressed the following
comments at p. 881 on the Crown's right of appeal after leave has been granted
at large:

 

This leave ... must, in my understanding, be taken to
relate to any question of law that goes to the validity of the verdict of
acquittal; it cannot be construed to refer to a question of law whose
correct resolution would not affect the result reached by the majority of the
Quebec Court of Appeal. The unlimited character of the leave makes it necessary
to determine what were the grounds upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal set
aside the conviction herein and to consider the grounds urged in this Court
against the acquittal; in this latter respect there is no restriction to
the grounds upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal proceeded. [Emphasis added.]

 

(See
also the comments of the majority at pp. 868‑69.)

 

28.              For
reasons of fairness, the Court is reluctant to decide a case on a basis which
was not argued by the parties and upon which the provincial courts have not
spoken. This is a far cry, however, from suggesting that any issue not
contained in the leave application which may tend to support acquittal or
conviction is beyond the reach of the Court. For example, let us suppose that Ancio
had never been heard or decided by the Court and Wigman had proceeded to
be argued solely on the Kienapple issue. It would have been open to the
Court to ask for additional argument on the correctness of the Court's decision
in Lajoie. The Court can, and not infrequently does, raise issues which
did not attract the interest of the parties at the time of the leave
application. In short, this case arose while avenues of redress from the
judgment were still open to the accused ‑‑ it was still ""in
the system"" so to speak. The possibility for an appellant to raise a new
question of law should, however, be subject to counsel for the opposing party
being given notice that the point will be raised and sufficient opportunity to
respond, which was assured in the present case by granting the adjournment
requested.

 

29.              Provided
that he is still in the system, an accused charged with an offence is entitled
to have his or her culpability determined on the basis of what is held to be
the proper and accurate interpretation of the Code. The same reasoning
was inevitably though implicitly adopted in Ancio. Obviously, the
respondent Ancio was still in the system; once it is established in the case at
bar that the appellant is still in the system, then the rationale for applying
to him the ruling in Ancio is the same as the one which was taken for
granted in Ancio with respect to the respondent Ancio.

 

30.              This
rationale is grounded in the principle that an accused should not be convicted
on the basis of the interpretation of a statute which, at the appropriate time,
is known to be wrong. An apt expression of this principle can be found in the
following passage written by Lord Goddard C.J. on behalf of the full Court of
Criminal Appeal in R. v. Taylor, [1950] 2 K.B. 368, at p. 371:

 

                   This court ... has to deal with
questions involving the liberty of the subject, and if it finds, on
reconsideration, that, in the opinion of a full court assembled for that
purpose, the law has been either misapplied or misunderstood in a decision
which it has previously given, and that, on the strength of that decision, an
accused person has been sentenced and imprisoned it is the bounden duty of the
court to reconsider the earlier decision with a view to seeing whether that
person had been properly convicted. 

 

31.              Taylor
was a bigamy case where the Court of Criminal Appeal reconsidered its previous
interpretation of the statutory defence of seven years absence available to a
""Person Marrying a Second Time"", given in the R. v. Treanor
case (1939), 27 Cr. App. Rep. 35. The above‑quoted passage is directed at
the limits of the doctrine of stare decisis but it also explains why the
new and presumably correct interpretation of an offence‑creating statute
should be applied to the accused who is still before the court when the correct
interpretation is rendered.

 

32.              This
rationale was recently followed in R. v. Hotte (1984), 13 W.C.B. 224, in
a decision almost identical to the case at bar. On October 21, 1982, Hotte was
convicted at trial of attempted murder. The trial judge had charged himself
that the intent required to be proven by the Crown was that specified in either
s. 212(a)(i) or s. 212(a)(ii) of the Code. Prior to the
appeal against conviction being heard before the Court of Appeal of Alberta,
this Court released its judgment in Ancio. Laycraft J.A., speaking for
the Court of Appeal, came to the conclusion that, as a consequence of the
interpretation given in Ancio, the appellant had been wrongly convicted
of attempted murder, and he set aside the conviction on this charge. On the
evidence of the case and on the findings made by the trial judge, however,
Laycraft J.A., pursuant to s. 613 of the Code, substituted a conviction
for the included offence of causing bodily harm with intent to wound, maim or
disfigure, under s. 228 of the Code, as it then stood. Hotte is
only one of several decisions wherein different courts of appeal have
consistently applied Ancio to convictions entered prior to the ruling of
this Court: see R. v. Braun (1984), 12 W.C.B. 281 (Alta. C.A.); R. v.
Beaver (1984), 64 N.S.R. 158 (C.A.); R. v. Bains and Grewal (1985),
7 O.A.C. 67, leave to appeal refused, [1985] l S.C.R. v; R. v. Singh
(Inderjit) (1985), 8 O.A.C. 100, and Czubak c. La Reine, R.J.P.Q.,
86‑180 (C.A.)

 

33.              We
should finally add that the possibility for the appellant to raise the new
interpretation given in Ancio is consistent with the power of this
Court, in s. 48 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S‑19, to
resort to its general discretion to order a new trial when ""the ends of
justice seem to require it"".

 

                                                                   VI

 

Conclusion

 

34.              The
determinative factor in the case at bar is that the appellant became entitled
to bring into question the validity of his conviction on any question of law at
a time when this Court had just reversed its own interpretation of attempted
murder. The appellant is thus entitled to invoke the new question of law raised
by reason of Ancio in accordance with s. 618(1)(b) of the Code.
He has established that he was ""in the system"" since he still had an
appeal pending before this Court when Ancio was released.

 

35.              It
is common ground that the charge to the jury did not conform to Ancio.
The curative provision of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) cannot be used since it is
not clear that the jury would have convicted Mr. Wigman of attempted murder if
instructed that the necessary intent was the intent to kill. Firstly, it cannot
be determined with any degree of certainty that the jury completely rejected
Mr. Wigman's story that ""Dave"" was the person who administered the
beating. The jury may have found that Mr. Wigman was a party to the offence
committed by ""Dave"". Secondly, in spite of the savagery of the
attack, it cannot be concluded that the jury found or ought to have found that
the attacker had the intent to kill rather than the intent to inflict bodily
harm which he knew was likely to cause death.

 

36.              Nonetheless,
the Crown has indicated that it would be satisfied with the substitution of a
conviction for the included offence of causing bodily harm with intent to
endanger life, contrary to s. 228 of the Code as it read at the material
time:

 

                   228. Every one
who, with intent

 

(a) to wound, maim or disfigure any person,

 

(b) to endanger the life of any person, or

 

(c) to prevent the arrest or detention of
any          person,

 

discharges a firearm, air gun or air pistol at or causes
bodily harm in any way to any person, whether or not that person is the one
mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c), is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

 

37.              This
included offence was put to the jury, but of course no verdict was rendered on
it since the jury found Mr. Wigman guilty of attempted murder. The two mental elements
put to the jury in the trial judge's charge on attempted murder were (i) the
intent to kill, and (ii) the intent to cause bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. Since the
jurors convicted on the basis of one of these two mental elements, it follows
that they would also have convicted Mr. Wigman of the offence under s. 228. The
previous comments on the Kienapple rule are equally applicable in
respect of the s. 228(b) offence. The intent required under s. 228(b)
is an aggravated intent distinct and additional to that which would suffice for
a conviction of breaking and entering and robbery.

 

38.              Accordingly,
we would, pursuant to s. 613(1) (b)(i) and s. 613(3), dismiss the appeal
but substitute a conviction for the included offence of causing bodily harm
with intent to endanger life (s. 228  of the Criminal Code ); see R. v.
Nantais, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 108 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Fyfe, [1968] 1

C.A.); R. v. Hotte, supra, and R. v. Singh (Inderjit), supra.

 

39.              The
case should be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for
sentencing.

                   The
Municipal Court of Montréal convicted appellant of fortune telling, contrary to
s. 323 (b) of the Criminal Code  which provides that ""Every
one who fraudulently...undertakes, for a consideration, to tell fortunes... is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction"". She testified at
trial that she enjoyed special powers to predict the future, but the judge did
not believe her. On a trial de novo, the Superior Court judge quashed
the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Court of Appeal restored the
conviction.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per
McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest JJ.: Given the trial judge's finding that the
accused knew full well that she had no basis for her claim to be able to
predict people's futures, the defence of honest belief was not open on the

                   The
judgment of McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest
JJ.‑‑The appellant was charged with having fraudulently
undertaken, for a consideration, to tell fortunes, an offence punishable on
summary conviction under s. 323 (b) of the Criminal Code .

 

2.                Section
323 (b) states:

 

                   323. Every one who
fraudulently

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) undertakes, for a consideration, to tell
fortunes,

 

                                                                    ...

 

is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

 

3.                The
appellant was tried before Judge Tourangeau of the Montréal Municipal Court.
The evidence established that she had told the fortune of a police officer for
$15, and that she regularly told fortunes for a small fee, usually $15. She
testified to the fact that she had enjoyed, since her childhood, special powers
to predict the future. The trial judge found that what she believed was
irrelevant, and in any event he disbelieved her. He read down the meaning
usually given to the word ""fraudulently"" in a charging section and
said that it was there to ensure that people who do not purport to enjoy
special powers and who do it for amusement, as one often sees in tombolas or
amusement parks, not be convicted.

 

4.                In
appeal, de novo, the conviction was quashed and an acquittal entered.
The Superior Court judge merely stated that there was no evidence that she had
said anything fraudulent.

 

5.                The
Court of Appeal restored the conviction.

 

6.                The
issue involves the meaning to be given to the word ""fraudulently"" and
its effect in the section, and in particular whether an accused should be
convicted of fraudulently undertaking for a consideration to tell fortunes if
he honestly believed that he had the power to tell fortunes. However, given the
finding of fact by the trial judge that [TRANSLATION]  ""The accused knows
full well that she has no basis for her claim to be able to predict what will
happen in people's futures"", we are agreed that the defence of honest
belief is not open on the facts of this case.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Charges of conspiracy to
traffic in a narcotic and unlawfully trafficking in a narcotic—Conviction for
substantive offence of trafficking not precluded by conviction for
conspiracy—Convictions not for same cause or matter.

The appellant and one Beeman were jointly
charged that between July 14, 1973, and September 12, 1973, at or near the city of Nanaimo, they did unlawfully conspire
together, the one with the other, to traffic in heroin. The appellant was also
charged in a second count that between September 1, 1973, and September 12, 1973, at or near Nanaimo, he did unlawfully traffic in
heroin. The trafficking proved against him, a transaction with Beeman, occurred
on September 3, 1973, and was one of five heroin transactions between them.
Beeman was also charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic and was
acquitted under the principle in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R.
729, but the acquittal was set aside on appeal by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal and a new trial was ordered. Both the accused appealed their conviction
of conspiracy but their appeals were dismissed. The appellant’s appeal against
his conviction of trafficking was held up pending the disposition of the Crown’s
appeal against Beeman’s acquittal of the possession charge. The Court of Appeal
rejected the application of the Kienapple principle in setting aside
Beeman’s acquittal and, for the same reasons given in that case, it affirmed
the appellant’s conviction of trafficking. Beeman’s appeal to this Court on the
possession charge was dismissed as moot when the Crown announced that it did
not intend to proceed with the new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal. At the
same time, this Court gave the appellant leave to appeal the trafficking
conviction to enable him to raise the Kienapple principle in respect
thereof.

[Page 23]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

In Kienapple v. The Queen, this Court
was concerned with a single act which gave rise to two different offences, and
it held that multiple convictions could not be supported for the same delict or
for the same cause or matter or where the same or substantially the same
elements entered into two different offences. This Court held further in R.
v. Loyer and Blouin, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 631, that the Kienapple principle
against multiple convictions did not automatically apply where the accused,
charged with two offences, with common elements, pleads guilty to the less
serious charge. In such a case the plea should be held in abeyance, pending the
trial of the more serious offence. If the accused is found guilty, the plea of
guilty to the less serious charge should be struck out and an acquittal
entered. If there is a plea of guilty to the more serious charge, an acquittal
should be entered on the less serious one. None of these considerations applied
here.

The present case was not one where the two
convictions were for the same cause or matter or involved the same or
substantially the same elements to establish criminality. The trafficking
transaction had no element of culpability that was in any way common
with the charge of conspiracy which depended on proof of a prior illegal
agreement and transcended any dependence on the trafficking transactions.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia dismissing
the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of trafficking in a
narcotic. Appeal dismissed.

B.A. Crane, Q.C., for the appellant.

S.R. Fainstein and E.G. Ewaschuk, Q.C.,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this appeal is
whether the principle in Kienapple v. The

[Page 24]

Queen[1] applies to preclude a conviction of an accused for trafficking in a
narcotic when he has also been convicted of conspiracy so to traffic and where
the substantive offence, charged as a second count to the conspiracy, took
place within the conspiracy period and involved the accused’s co-conspirator
who was joined in the conspiracy count. It was the contention of the appellant
accused that the two counts were alternative only and that the accused could
not be legally convicted of trafficking in the particular circumstances of this
case once he was convicted (as was his co-conspirator) of conspiracy. The
contention is untenable and the appeal fails for the reasons which follow.

The appellant and one Beeman were jointly
charged that between July 14, 1973, and September 12, 1973, at or near the city
of Nanaimo, they did unlawfully conspire together, the one with the other, to
traffic in heroin. The appellant was also charged in a second count that
between September 1, 1973, and September 12, 1973, at or near Nanaimo, he did
unlawfully traffic in heroin. The trafficking proved against him, a transaction
with Beeman, occurred on September 3, 1973, and was one of five heroin
transactions between them. Beeman was also charged with unlawful possession of
a narcotic and was acquitted under the Kienapple principle, but the
acquittal was set aside on appeal by the British Columbia Court of Appeal and a
new trial was ordered. Both the accused appealed their conviction of conspiracy
but their appeals were dismissed. The appellant’s appeal against his conviction
of trafficking was held up pending the disposition of the Crown’s appeal
against Beeman’s acquittal of the possession charge. The British Columbia Court
of Appeal rejected the application of the Kienapple principle in setting
aside Beeman’s acquittal and, for the same reasons given in that case, it
affirmed the appellant’s conviction of trafficking. Beeman’s appeal to this
Court on the possession charge was dismissed as moot when the Crown annouced
that it did not intend to proceed with the new trial

[Page 25]

ordered by the British Columbia Court of Appeal.
At the same time, this Court gave the appellant leave to appeal the trafficking
conviction to enable him to raise the Kienapple principle in respect
thereof.

It is important to note that the conviction of
conspiracy of both the appellant and of Beeman was not founded only on the
trafficking transaction of which the appellant was also convicted, nor indeed,
on the other trafficking transactions between them (although all five
transactions provided proof of overt acts in pursuance of the conspiracy). What
the trial judge found, on the evidence, was that the two accused had agreed
upon a scheme for the distribution of heroin in the Nanaimo area, “a planned common design on agreed terms”, the use of the
trial judge’s words. The trial judge said this:

There is no doubt whatever in my mind that
these two men knowingly and deliberately embarked on a scheme of distribution
of heroin in the Nanaimo area,
and implemented it with a considerable degree of financial success during the
period alleged in the indictment. This scheme was far more than an occasional
purchase by Beeman, the retailer on a rotating credit from Sheppe, the
wholesaler, as contended by the defence. There were here financial, joint
planning, meetings, private conversations, telephone discussions, all the
indicia in short of a planned common design on agreed terms over a period of
time to profit from the unfortunate and large scale sale of heroin in the
Nanaimo area. There was on all the evidence a continuing and knowing agreement,
close association and intent which renders both accused guilty on Count 1, the
conspiracy charge.

It is trite law that the gist of conspiracy
under our law lies in an unlawful agreement, here to violate the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.

[Page 26]

N-1: see Mulcahy v. The Queen[2]; Paradis v. The King[3]; The Queen v. Kravenia[4]. Culpability does not depend on the
implementation of the design, although the law in the United
 States is different in also requiring proof of an
overt act: see United States v. Skillman[5].
In Canada, overt acts are
admissible evidence to support a charge of conspiracy: see Koufis v. The
King[6]; The
Queen v. Gagnon[7]. This
does not, however, mean that the acts merge into the conspiracy so as to lose
their independent character: see Brodie v. The King[8], at p. 199.

The present case does not raise the kind of
issue which concerned this Court in Sokoloski v. The Queen[9]. Although on one view of the facts
in that case it might appear that a conspiracy could arise from a mere exchange
of promises, a contract of sale and purchase of a drug, I read the majority
judgment as resting on a prior agreement, although in the implementation
thereof a transaction of sale and purchase was carried out. Here, there can be
no doubt of the prior agreement, the scheme which the appellant and Beeman
concocted and then proceeded to carry out.

Counsel for the appellant conceded that the
substantive trafficking offence was not an included offence in conspiracy to
traffic but he did urge that it was inconsistent to convict the appellant of
both. This is more a plea of unfairness than an argument of law; see The
King v. Goodfellow[10], at
p. 431; Rex v. Hayes[11], at
p. 88. However, even if there was legal merit in it if the one substantive
offence was the main piece of evidence from which an inference of a prior
illegal agreement was drawn, the present case is far removed from such a situation.
The charge of conspiracy was the first count against the appellant and Beeman,
followed

[Page 27]

by a count charging trafficking and, on the
facts, this was not a case such as that which incurred the criticism of Barclay
J. in Leroux v. The King[12] at
p. 300 where, in effect, the conspiracy charge was mounted on the back of
the charge of a substantive offence.

The law on the point in issue here is the same
in England, subject now to the question of the propriety of joinder of
conspiracy and the substantive offence, with the Court entitled to put the
Crown to an election if joinder is not justified: see Practice Direction, [1977]
2 All E.R. 540. In the United States too, it has been held that there is no double jeopardy involved in
a conviction of the substantive offence as well as a conviction of conspiracy
to commit it: see Pereira v. United States[13]. There are two exceptions to this
in the United States, neither
of which has application here. One is where the substantive offence necessarily
involves an agreement of two persons to act in concert, e.g. duelling,
so that the conspiracy is embraced in the substantive offence. The other is
where the prohibited conduct involves two or more persons, e.g. a sale,
but prescribes punishment for one only and the other participates only to the
extent of establishing the offence: see Corpus Juris Secundum, vol. 15A,
p. 765.

In Kienapple v. The Queen, supra, this
Court was concerned with a single act which gave rise to two different
offences, and it held that multiple convictions could not be supported for the
same delict or for the same cause or matter or where the same or substantially
the same elements entered into two different offences. This Court held further
in The Queen v. Loyer and Blouin[14]
that the Kienapple principle against multiple convictions did not
automatically apply where the accused, charged with two offences, with common
elements, pleads guilty to the less serious charge. In such a

[Page 28]

case the plea should be held in abeyance,
pending the trial of the more serious offence. If the accused is found guilty,
the plea of guilty to the less serious charge should be struck out and an
acquitttal entered. If there is a plea of guilty to the more serious charge, an
acquittal should be entered on the less serious one. None of these
considerations apply here.

The present case is not one where the two
convictions were for the same cause or matter or involved the same or
substantially the same elements to establish criminality. The trafficking
transaction had no element of culpability that was in any way common with the
charge of conspiracy which depended on proof of a prior illegal agreement and,
as I pointed out earlier, transcended any dependence on the trafficking
transactions. Accordingly, neither The King v. Quon[15] nor The Queen v. Siggins[16], urged by counsel for the appellant in
support of the appeal, bear any resemblance to the issues in the recent case.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeal from acquittal on
charges under Combines Investigation Act—Questions of law alone not
involved—Court of Appeal without jurisdiction—Trial judge, fully cognizant of
applicable legal principles, deciding on facts that Crown failed to prove commission
of offences charged—Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23,
s. 32(1)(c) [re-en. 1974-75-76, c. 76, s. 14].

The respondent companies were, during the
relevant time, motor vehicle dealers in Port Alberni, British Columbia. They were indicted on three counts under
s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act. These
counts charged that the respondents had unlawfully conspired, combined, agreed
or arranged to prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the sale,
transportation or supply of parts and accessories for motor vehicles by (1)
agreeing to add a common freight charge to the selling price of such parts and
accessories, (2) agreeing to add a common surcharge to sales of such parts and
accessories, and (3) agreeing to a common policy in relation to rebates given
for returned parts and accessories. At trial, the Crown did not seek to prove a
conspiracy relating to an undue lessening of competition in the total market
for parts but rather only in connection with “captive” parts (i.e., parts
which may only be obtained from an automobile manufacturer or his franchised
dealer).

In respect of count (1), the trial judge
found that the Crown had proved the existence of an agreement among all the
respondents to add a 3 per cent charge to their

list prices for certain parts of a “captive”
nature on which they themselves had to pay freight. He concluded, though, that
the offence itself had not been made out because the agreement had no effect on
competition in the market. He also acquitted the respondents on the charge
contained in count (2). He found that there was evidence of a meeting at which
it was agreed to impose a 10 per cent surcharge but said that the agreement was
not intended, nor shown, to have any effect on competition. As regards count
(3), the trial judge found an agreement between the respondents Katila and
Chatwin but held that the Crown had failed to show that the agreement would
have effected or did effect an undue lessening of competition.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts
(1) and (2) to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The respondents moved to
quash the appeal contending that the grounds of appeal did not involve
questions of law alone. The motion was granted, Craig J.A. dissenting. The
Crown appealed to this Court pursuant to subs. 1(a) of
s. 621  of the Criminal Code .

The respondents moved to quash the appeal to
this Court on the ground that the dissent of Craig J.A. was not on a question
of law. This motion was dismissed prior to the argument of this appeal on the
merits on the ground that the issue before the Court of Appeal was as to the
jurisdiction of that Court to hear the appeal and Craig J.A. had dissented from
the reasons of the majority on that issue.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Read as a whole, and considering the
substance of the trial judgment, the trial judge, after instructing himself as
to the legal principles applicable, came to the conclusion, on the evidence,
that the Crown had not established that the respondents had agreed to lessen competition
unduly. Some passages in the judgment, taken out of context, if considered as
stating propositions of law, might be subject to attack. A reference to the
judgment of Rothman J. in R. v. Aluminum Co. of Canada (1976), 29 C.P.R.
(2d) 183, at p. 211, was perhaps, unfortunate, but like the majority in
the Court of Appeal, this Court did not construe the trial judgment as stating
as a proposition of law that the Crown, to succeed in a prosecution under subs.
(1) of s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act, must prove that the
agreement was intended as a device for controlling prices, or that the Crown
must prove that the agreement contemplated the fixing of a common price; nor as
stating as a

[Page 66]

proposition of law that a common surcharge
can have no effect upon competition.

As stated in R. v. Odeon Morton Theatres
Ltd. and United Artists Corp., [1974] 3 W.W.R. 304, where the right of
the Crown to appeal from an acquittal was considered, “the problem whether the
appeal involves a question of law alone is not one to be determined in the
abstract but rather against the actualities of the record.” “Against the
actualities of the record” in the present case, the Court was of the opinion
that the trial judge, fully cognizant of the applicable legal principles,
decided on the facts that the Crown had failed to prove commission of the
offences charged in counts (1) and (2).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia[1],
dismissing the appeal by the appellant and sustaining the acquittal of the
respondents on charges alleging the commission of offences contrary to
s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-23. Appeal dismissed.

C.O.D. Branson and H. Wetston, for the
appellant.

R.W. Lusk and P.G. Foy, for the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The respondents were acquitted on
three counts alleging the commission of offences contrary to subs. (1)(c)
of s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑23.
The appellant filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. The respondents moved to
quash the appeal contending that the grounds of appeal did not involve
questions of law alone. The motion was granted, Craig J.A. dissenting. The
appellant appeals to this Court pursuant to subs. (1)(a) of s. 621 
of the Criminal Code .

The respondents moved to quash the appeal to
this Court on the ground that the dissent of Craig J.A. was not on a question
of law. This motion was dismissed prior to the argument of this appeal on the
merits on the ground that the issue before the

[Page 67]

Court of Appeal was as to the jurisdiction of
that Court to hear the appeal and Craig J.A. had dissented from the reasons of
the majority on that issue.

The respondent companies were, during the
relevant time, motor vehicle dealers in Port Alberni, British Columbia. They were indicted on
three counts under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation
Act. These counts charged that the respondents had unlawfully conspired,
combined, agreed or arranged to prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the
sale, transportation or supply of parts and accessories for motor vehicles by
(1) agreeing to add a common freight charge to the selling price of such parts
and accessories, (2) agreeing to add a common surcharge to sales of such parts
and accessories, and (3) agreeing to a common policy in relation to rebates
given for returned parts and accessories. These offences were alleged to have
taken place between 1967 and 1972 and to have affected the city of Port Alberni and the surrounding market
area.

The trial judge outlined the following relevant
facts:

Chatwin Motors Limited was in existence
during the whole period of the alleged conspiracies and sold the Pontiac-Buick
line of General Motors. Katila Chevrolet‑Oldsmobile Ltd. came into
existence originally under the name Grant Katila Motors Ltd., which was
incorporated on September 29th of 1961 and had its name changed some time
during 1969. This corporation also held a General Motors franchise and sold the
Chevrolet-Oldsmobile line. Meyers Holland Motors (Port
 Alberni) Ltd. until January of 1970 held a Ford
franchise dealing with the Lincoln‑Mercury line. Ohs Brothers Motors
Limited also held a Ford franchise which entitled it to sell the Ford products.
These last two named accused corporations ceased to do business as of January
of 1970, when the whole of the Ford line including the Lincoln-Mercury and Ford
products were handled by the defendant Western Motors Limited. Western Motors
Limited started business in January of 1970, taking over from the other two
Ford distributors and buying part of their assets.

[Page 68]

All of the defendants sold new and used
automobiles and also sold automobile parts, both wholesale and retail. They
wholesaled the automobile parts manufactured by the auto company from which
they were franchised. Their wholesale customers were mainly service stations,
auto body repair shops, and other dealerships. In addition they retailed auto
parts to the general public and the customers who had their automobiles
repaired in the dealership garage. Of the defendants, Katila and Ohs were
equipped with collision repair facilities.

Within the trade there are two
classifications or categories of automobile parts known generally as “captive”
or “competitive” parts.

“Captive” parts are parts which may only be
obtained from an automobile manufacturer or his franchised dealer. “Captive”
parts included generally body parts such as fenders, doors, bumpers, grilles,
interior mouldings, etc.

“Competitive” parts are parts which are not
only available from a franchised auto dealership but also from a number of
independent jobbers and wholesalers. Examples of “competitive” parts would
include spark plugs, shock absorbers, mufflers, brake linings. In this line
could be included also what are known as “accessories” and which may loosely be
defined as parts which are not necessary for the running of the automobile.
These too could be obtained from a number of independent wholesalers and
generally from all the franchised dealers.

Evidence was tendered to show that there
was very brisk competition in the area of the general parts business in Port Alberni and the competition continued
throughout the time covered by these indictments. By far the greatest
competition was in the “Competitive Parts” category. It was estimated that
about 80% to 85% of all the Parts business in the area was of a “Competitive
Parts” nature.

In the field of “Captive Parts” those
manufactured by General Motors were distributed in Port Alberni only through
the two General Motors dealers, the accused Chatwin and Katila; while those
from Ford were distributed first by the two defendants, Ohs and Meyers Holland,
and latterly solely by Western.

At trial, the Crown did not seek to prove a
conspiracy relating to an undue lessening of competition in the total market
for parts but rather only in connection with “captive” parts.

At the commencement of his judgment, the trial
judge said this:

[Page 69]

I am indebted to both counsel for the
exhaustive reviews contained in their written submissions of the law on this
statute and specifically relating to that section confined to conspiracy
to restrict competition unduly. I do not find any significant dispute in the
submission of counsel on the current interpretation of this section of the
Act, and I content myself with stating what I consider to be the governing
principles and with which counsel appear to be in full agreement.

In summary, the applicable law was stated as
follows:

1. The offence lies, not in any overt act, but
in the conclusion of an agreement to carry out certain acts.

2. The “intention” with which the parties made
their agreement is irrelevant. If the effect of the agreement is unduly to
lessen or prevent competition, the agreement is a criminal one, no matter what
may have been the intention of the parties.

3. The agreement or conspiracy is only unlawful
where, if the agreement were carried out, an undue restriction of competition
would result.

4. While it is not necessary for there to be any
evidence that the conspiracy has been carried out, the Court may look at any
overt acts that may result from the carrying out of the conspiracy.

He cited the following passage from the judgment
of my brother, Ritchie, in the case of Aetna Insurance Co. et al. v. The
Queen[2], at
p. 747:

The fact that an agreement existed to
prevent or lessen competition in the price of insurance does not of itself
constitute an offence under the section; the illegal character of the agreement
lies in the fact that the prevention or lessening is undue and it
appears to me that the best if not the only way in which to determine this is
by considering whether competition would be unduly prevented or lessened if
the design evidenced by the agreement were carried into effect. In my view it
is only by assessing what the result would be if the agreement were implemented
that the elusive quality of undueness can be measured, and it was for this
reason that the learned trial judge in the present case heard evidence as to
the effect of the plan on free competition in the insurance business.

[Page 70]

The trial judge then proceeded to consider the
evidence.

In respect of count (1), the trial judge found
that the Crown had proved the existence of an agreement among all the
respondents to add a 3 per cent charge to their list prices for certain parts
of a “captive” nature on which they themselves had to pay freight. He
concluded, though, that the offence itself had not been made out because the
agreement had no effect on competition in the market.

He also acquitted the respondents on the charge
contained in count (2). He found that there was evidence of a meeting at which
it was agreed to impose a 10 per cent surcharge but said that the agreement was
not intended, nor shown, to have any effect on competition.

As regards count (3), the trial judge found an
agreement between Katila and Chatwin but held that the Crown had failed to show
that the agreement would have effected or did effect an undue lessening of
competition.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts (1)
and (2) to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The Notice of Appeal alleged
that eleven errors of law had been committed by the trial judge. These errors
are as follows:

1. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in his interpretation of what constitutes preventing or lessening
competition within the meaning of section 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act.

2. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in deciding that with respect to Count 1, the Crown was required not only to
prove an agreement to pass on a 3% charge reflecting an increase in freight
rates in relation to captive automobile parts, but was also required to prove
that this agreement was intended as a device for controlling prices and thereby
limiting competition.

3. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in deciding that with respect to Count 2, the Crown was required not only
to prove an agreement to pass on

[Page 71]

a further 10% charge reflecting labour
costs in relation to captive automobile parts, but was also required to prove
that this agreement was intended as a device for controlling prices and thereby
limiting competition.

4. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in that he misdirected himself as to the intention necessary to constitute
an offence under Section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.

5. That the learned trial judge erred in
law by considering the motives of the parties to the agreements as a factor in
the determination of whether such agreements were unlawful.

6. That the learned trial judge erred in
holding that he could not as a matter of law find a common agreement between
the Ford dealers and the General Motors dealers as to the addition of a common
3% freight charge.

7. That the learned trial judge erred in
holding that he could not, as a matter of law, find a common agreement between
the Ford dealers and the General Motors dealers as to the addition of a common
10% surcharge.

8. That the learned trial judge erred by
holding that it is at law necessary for the unlawful agreement contemplated in
section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act to fix a
common price or follow a common pricing formula or listing.

9. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in holding that a common surcharge, not in any way related to a common
pricing policy, can have no effect upon competition.

10. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in finding there was no evidence of any minimum or base prices to which the
common 3% freight charge was agreed to be added.

11. That the learned trial judge erred in
law in finding there was no evidence of any minimum or base price to which the
common 10% surcharge was agreed to be added.

The appellant’s factum, in stating the order
which it is desired this Court should make, seeks an order allowing the appeal
and directing the

[Page 72]

Court of Appeal to hear the appeal upon grounds
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. However, in the statement of the points in
issue, the error alleged on the part of the Court of Appeal is only as to
grounds 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11, and those were the points in issue before
this Court.

In the Court of Appeal, the respondents
contended that the only questions raised in the appeals to that Court were ones
of fact or of mixed fact and law and that, consequently, the Court was without
jurisdiction. Seaton J.A., Bull J.A. concurring, allowed the motion and quashed
the appeals.

Seaton J.A. dealt with the grounds in groups, as
that had been the approach taken by counsel. Grounds 1, 2, 3, 8 and 9 were all
seen to involve an alleged error as to the interpretation of the term
“competition” in subs. 32(1)(c) of the Act. The Crown conceded that the
trial judge had accurately stated the applicable principles of law at the
beginning of his judgment, but argued that he had subsequently committed
errors. The Crown placed particular emphasis on a passage the trial judge had
extracted from The Queen v. The Aluminum Company of Canada et al.[3] at p. 211, and the reliance that it
was alleged he had placed on it. The trial judge had extracted these words:

…here there is no evidence whatever of
price fixing or common prices and no indication that this was the intended
effect. …I am not aware, and counsel were not aware, of any Canadian decision
in which an agreement to pass on a bare increase in cost, in the absence of
price-fixing or common prices, was found to be illegal under
section 32(1)(c) or the equivalent provision previously contained
in the Criminal Code . In virtually every case that comes to mind, where
price competition was held to be lessened, there were common prices fixed.

He had then said:

So in the present case if price does play
an important role, it can only do so because of some agreement to fix a common
price or follow a common pricing formula or listing. There was no evidence here
of any relationship between the 3% or the 10% surcharges and real prices,

[Page 73]

since the respective dealers did not agree
to fix common prices or price lists.

I am aware there were manufacturers’ master
sheets with suggested retail prices. But there is no suggestion in the evidence
that these master sheets were followed carefully by the distributors, even
between the two dealers of General Motors products in the same town of Port
Alberni. So whatever the agreement was between the parties, there was no apparent
effect on real prices, since there was no base price on which agreements took
effect.

Seaton J.A. noted that the trial judge had
correctly stated the relevant principles of law at the outset of his judgment.
He then went on to say:

What Mr. Justice Rothman said in the Aluminum
case may be very good common sense or very bad common sense; but it was not
law. If that reasoning is not applicable to this case, then the trial judge
might have been wrong in adopting it, but it was not error of law. The fact that
logic is found in a decision does not make it law. Mr. Justice Rothman was
not stating and did not purport to be stating that it would be wrong in law to
find that an agreement to pass on a bare increase in cost can constitute a
breach of section 32(1)(c). Indeed, he specifically rejected that
suggestion later in his judgment. The part that I have read is now reported at
page 211 of the Canadian Patent Reporter. At page 213 of that report, this is
said:

“I do not wish to suggest that an agreement
to increase prices is, in itself, always insufficient to constitute a
‘lessening of competition’,…”

and he went on in a similar vein. I think
it quite clear that Mr. Justice Rothman did not purport to be stating law
and I think it equally clear that the trial judge here did not understand the
judgment in the Aluminum case, that part of it at any rate, to be a
statement of law. The learned trial judge adopted the reasoning, not in the
sense of adopting law but as adopting reasoning that appealed to him, and it has
apparently appealed to others. But it is reasoning in answering the second
question, that is, whether or not there was or would be an undue lessening of
competition.

There were other specific errors alleged in
this group or groups of appeal with which I am now dealing, but I think it
unnecessary to go through them separately. They raise, in my view, question of
fact—they are stated as issues of law but, as such, they lack reality. By
taking phrases out of context and putting before them the words “The trial
judge erred in law in finding” one can

[Page 74]

create the appearance of an issue of law.
But in my view, in this case, when the grounds are tested against the judgment,
the appearance is found not to be sound—the issues are really of fact.

Turning to grounds 4 and 5, Seaton J.A. found
that in so far as these grounds purported to state issues of law, they did not
state questions that arose in this case. The trial judge had not misdirected
himself as to the necessary intention. He had mentioned the intention and
purpose of the agreements when discussing the surrounding circumstances but
that was not an error.

Grounds 6 and 7 were disposed of on the basis
that they concerned alternative reasons for finding that the Crown’s case had
not been made out. It was conceded that unless the main grounds had merit that
grounds 6 and 7 were only academic.

Seaton J.A. also found that grounds 10 and 11
disclosed no error in law on the part of the trial judge. The Crown’s argument
was based on the following passages from the trial judgment:

So in the present case if price does play
an important role, it can only do so because of some agreement to fix a common
price or follow a common pricing formula or listing. There was no evidence here
of any relationship between the 3% or the 10% surcharges and real prices, since
the respective dealers did not agree to fix common prices or price lists.

…

They charged 3% of the total list price of
the invoice as a freight charge on special order items. But of course they were
charging on their own list prices and there is no suggestion that the prices
were identical or even similar as between two distributors for the same
manufacturer, i.e., Chatwin Motors and Katila Chevrolet. Certainly the list
prices were different even for similar parts where the dealer represented a
separate manufacturer, as was the case with Meyers Holland and Ohs, who
represented Ford Motors.

The Crown relied upon the words “no suggestion”
and “no evidence”. Seaton J.A. said that those statements were not to be likened
to a find-

[Page 75]

ing of no evidence at the end of a Crown case.
The trial judge had simply found that on the evidence it was not shown that
there was a base price.

Craig J.A. was of the view that motions of this
kind should only be granted in the clearest cases and he dissented from the
opinion of the majority. He said:

The appellant has, as my brother presiding
mentioned, raised 11 grounds. The respondents concede that two of them, namely,
grounds 6 and 7, do raise questions of law alone. Both counsel agree, however,
that these are, in effect, alternative reasons for a finding of guilt or
acquittal, and a decision with respect to them would be academic if a judge
found that there was competition but that it had not been unduly lessened by
that agreement.

The grounds of appeal, on their face, in my
view, do raise questions of law. With deference, I think there are some parts
of the judgment which could be related to these particular grounds. Grounds 1,
2, 3, 8 and 9 have been lumped together by counsel for the appellant. Ground 1,
of course, makes the broad statement that the judge erred in law in his
interpretation of what constitutes preventing or lessening competition within
the meaning of Section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.
Grounds 2 and 3 refer specifically to the fact that the judge erred by imposing
a burden on the Crown which should not have been imposed, namely, that the
Crown also had to prove that the agreement was intended as a device for
controlling prices and therefore limiting competition.

As I say, looking at the judgment and
taking some statements out of context, I think there is some support for these
propositions.

Grounds 4 and 5, in my view, perhaps do not
really raise an issue of law alone.

Grounds 10 and 11, with deference to my
brother presiding, do, in my opinion, raise questions of law alone. In my
opinion, when a judge asserts that there is no evidence upon which to make a
certain finding, and the appellant alleges that that particular issue is an
essential issue in the case, then the judge has erred in law.

Craig J.A. went on to say:

I feel constrained to say, however, that
had we heard the appeal completely on the merits (and I am not

[Page 76]

entirely sure that we have not), I would
have been disposed to dismiss the appeal, because I think the judgment, taken
in its entirety, indicates that the judge did in fact direct himself as to the
proper principles and that he did in fact, although he did not say so
expressly, with regards to grounds 1 and 2, make a finding that the agreement
did not unduly lessen competition. However, in the circumstances, I would
dismiss the motion.

I am in agreement with the conclusions reached
by Seaton J.A. Read as a whole, and considering the substance of the trial
judgment, the trial judge, after instructing himself as to the legal principles
applicable, came to the conclusion, on the evidence, that the Crown had not
established that the respondents had agreed to lessen competition unduly. Some
passages in the judgment, taken out of context, if considered as stating
propositions of law, might be subject to attack. The reference to the judgment
of Rothman J. in The Queen v. The Aluminum Company of Canada et al, supra, was,
perhaps, unfortunate, but like Seaton J.A. I do not construe the trial judgment
as stating as a proposition of law that the Crown, to succeed in a prosecution
under subs. (1) of s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act, must
prove that the agreement was intended as a device for controlling prices, or
that the Crown must prove that the agreement contemplated the fixing of a
common price; nor as stating as a proposition of law that a common surcharge
can have no effect upon competition.

In Regina v. Odeon Morton Theatres Ltd. and
United Artists Corporation[4], Chief
Justice Freedman, considering the right of the Crown to appeal from an
acquittal, said at p. 304:

Manifestly the problem whether the appeal
involves a question of law alone is not one to be determined in the abstract
but rather against the actualities of the record. It is not usually difficult
for an experienced Crown counsel to frame the appeal in language suggesting
that a question of law is there involved. In that way a prima facie basis for
the court’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal is made to appear. But a ground of
appeal thus framed may on analysis prove to be without validity, for one of two
reasons. It may, in the first place, be wholly without support in the record—a
theoretically good ground

[Page 77]

poised, as it were, in the air but not
rooted in the factual situation facing the court. Or, secondly, it may on
examination prove to involve questions of fact rather than of law. Its form may
give jurisdiction but its substance deny it. It is in the light of these
considerations that the present grounds of appeal must be tested.

“Against the actualities of the record” in the
present case, it is my opinion that the trial judge, fully cognizant of the
applicable legal principles, decided on the facts that the Crown had failed to
prove commission of the offences charged in counts (1) and (2).

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Elements of
offence—Common object—Extortion—Conspiracy to possess money obtained by
extortion—Criminal Code , s. 305 .

Evidence—Admissibility—Best evidence
rule—Tape recordings—Re-recordings—Admissibility of re-recordings—Requirement
of proof of authenticity and accuracy.

Criminal law—Indictable
offences—Duplicity—Criminal Code , s. 519(1) (b).

Papalia and Cotroni were convicted with
others, Swartz and Violi, on an indictment alleging that they unlawfully did
conspire together to have possession of some $300,000 more or less, knowing
that the said $300,000 was obtained by the commission in Canada of the indictable offence of
extortion. The Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of Violi and Cotroni and
entered acquittals, but dismissed the appeals of Swartz and Papalia. These two
further appeals, by Papalia from conviction and by the Crown from the acquittal
of Cotroni, were from the unanimous judgments of the Court of Appeal.

Swartz had been involved with a Toronto stock promoter (Bader) who in turn
was associated in some business venture with a man named Rosen. Swartz and
Bader borrowed funds from Rosen for the purpose of lending money at high rates
of interest. The funds passed from Rosen to Bader to Swartz. Bader had only the
word of Swartz that the funds were actually being loaned. Subsequently after
Rosen had advised Bader that he would make no further advances Swartz told

[Page 257]

Bader that the loans which he (Swartz) was
supposed to have arranged did not exist. Swartz also advised Bader of threats,
which had been relayed to him through someone, whom Bader believed to be John
Papalia. Bader, and subsequently Rosen, believed Swartz and Rosen became
convinced that Bader’s life was in peril. Rosen advanced $175,000 to Swartz and
Bader to save Bader from harm (Swartz having told Bader that he, Swartz, had
already paid $120,000 from moneys obtained from Rosen for lending purposes
towards the $300,000 which Swartz alleged “the people in Montreal” had lost in a stock collapse
which they blamed on Rosen). Swartz’s improved life-style gave rise to
suspicion and Bader made some inquiries. At this time however Cotroni and Violi
came to believe that their names had been used to acquire funds from Bader.
There were conversations involving Cotroni, Violi and Papalia and the evidence
of what was going on at that time consisted entirely of recordings of three
private conversations, largely in the Calabrese language intercepted by the
Montreal Police Department. The first conversation was between Violi and
Cotroni; for the second, later the same day, they were joined by Papalia; and
the third conversation, some two weeks later, was again between Violi and
Cotroni. The Court of Appeal found that the only evidence of agreement between
Violi and Cotroni and Papalia that emerged from the recorded conversations was
for Papalia to arrange a meeting in Toronto between them or one of them and Swartz; and that presumably at such
meeting Swartz would have been made the subject of extortion. The judgment in
the Court of Appeal could be read in two ways either that the verdict of the
jury was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence or that there was not one
but two conspiracies, the object of the second (involving Violi and Cotroni)
being different from that alleged in the indictment.

Held: Both
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Spence,
Dickson, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: Where, as here, several conspiracies are shown
to have been committed the problem is to determine which was the one envisaged
by the charge. Whether all or any of those that have been proven are covered by
the indictment depends on the construction of the charge.

Proper consideration must be given to the
jurisdictional limits of the court before which the indictment is laid; it must
be assumed that the indictment was intended to relate to a crime over which the
court had jurisdiction rather than to a crime over which it had no
jurisdiction. In the present case there existed two conspiracies; that of
Papalia and Swartz to have possession of extorted funds and that of Cotroni and
Violi (and possibly

[Page 258]

Papalia) to acquire and have possession of
part of the same extorted funds. The indictment might be broad enough to
include both conspiracies, but as the second took place only within the Province of Quebec and Ontario had therefore no jurisdiction with
respect to it, it must be inferred that this was not the conspiracy described
in the indictment. There was evidence to go to the jury on the basis that
Papalia and Swartz conspired as charged and Papalia was properly convicted. The
only evidence against Cotroni was however in respect of a conspiracy not
covered by the indictment.

Per Martland
J.: While agreeing that the appeal by Papalia should be dismissed on the basis
proposed, the appeal by the Crown against Cotroni should be dismissed for want
of jurisdiction. In the absence of any dissent in the Court of Appeal on a question
of law, the right of the Crown to appeal further, with leave is restricted by
subs. 621(1) of the Criminal Code  to an appeal on a question of law. The
Court of Appeal here exercised its power to allow further appeal under para.
(i) of s. 613(1)  rather than under paras. (ii) or (iii). It was suggested that
the reasons of the Court of Appeal constituted a finding of “no evidence” and
that this raised a question of law on which to base a further appeal. That
Court did not however find that there was “no evidence” but rather that the
evidence pointed to “a different object”.

Per Ritchie
and Pigeon JJ.: The recordings of the three conversations were the only
evidence incriminating Violi and Cotroni and these were also essential evidence
against Papalia. Transcripts, translated where necessary from Calabrese to
English, are part of the record of the case. While the recordings proffered in
evidence were re-recordings and it was argued that these should not be
admissible in the circumstances the re-recordings were properly admitted. No
question was raised as to their authenticity and the onus of showing that the
destruction of the originals was done in good faith and explaining the
circumstances of the destruction was in this case met by the Crown.

The issue of duplicity was raised by Papalia.
There was however no finding of prejudice caused by the alleged duplicity and
in view of s. 519(1)(b) of the Code such duplicity or
multiplicity do not invalidate an indictment.

Further, the only evidence against
Violi and Cotroni was not evidence of the conspiracy alleged and was of
conversations in Montreal.
There was no evidence that any part of Cotroni’s conspiracy took place or was
carried out in Ontario.

APPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal by Papalia and allowing an appeal by Cotroni from conviction for
conspiracy to possess money obtained by extortion. Both appeals dismissed.

David Doherty, for
the Crown.

Clive Bynoe, Q.C., and Douglas Simpson, for
the appellant, Papalia.

Robert Carter, Q.C., for the respondent,
Cotroni.

MARTLAND J.—With respect to the case of John
Papalia v. Her Majesty The Queen, I agree with the conclusion reached by my
brothers Pigeon and Dickson that the appeal should be dismissed.

With respect to the case of Her Majesty the
Queen v. Vincent Cotroni, in my opinion the appeal by the Crown should be
dismissed because this Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with it. In the
absence of any dissent in the Court of Appeal on a question of law, the right
of the Crown to appeal to this Court, with leave, is restricted by subs. 621(1)
of the Criminal Code  to an appeal on a question of law.

[Page 260]

In the Court of Appeal, Jessup, J.A., when
dealing with the appeal of Cotroni, said this:

The main ground of appeal of the appellants
Violi and Cotroni is that, as against them, the verdict of the jury is
unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. In their case I think
that argument has to be given effect to. The only evidence of an agreement
between them and Papalia that emerges from the recorded conversations is for
Papalia to arrange a meeting in Toronto between them or one of them and Swartz. Presumably at such meeting
Swartz would have been made a subject of extortion. The theory of the Crown was
that Cotroni and Violi joined the existing conspiracy between Swartz and
Papalia, but any conspiracy between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni had a different
object than that alleged in the indictment. While the roles of the several
persons in a conspiracy may be entirely different, they must have a common
object. Here the evidence led against Violi and Cotroni points to a different
object.

Section 613(1)  of the Criminal Code  defines
the powers of a court of appeal on an appeal from conviction. It provides that
the court of appeal:

(a) may allow the appeal where it is
of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage
of justice;

In my opinion the Court of Appeal in this case
exercised its power to allow the appeal under para. (i) and not under para.
(ii) or para. (iii). The passage cited from the judgment of the Court states
that the appellant’s main ground of appeal was that “the verdict of the jury is
unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence”, using the words of para.
(i). He then goes on to say that “that argument has to be given effect to”.

Paragraph (i) refers to the verdict of a jury.
Paragraph (ii) empowers a court of appeal to set aside a judgment of the trial
court on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The Court of
Appeal did not allow the appeal on that ground. Paragraph (iii) is irrelevant
in this case.

[Page 261]

It is suggested that the reasons of the Court of
Appeal constitute a finding of no evidence and that this raises a question of
law which may come to this Court. The Court of Appeal did not find that there
was no evidence to support the conviction. It found that the evidence “points
to a different object”. In my view the finding of the Court of Appeal was as to
an insufficiency of evidence and not a finding of no evidence at all.

In The Queen v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R.
144, it was held that this Court was powerless to interfere with a judgment of
a court of appeal based on the ground that a verdict of a jury should be set
aside because it could not be supported by the evidence. Such a finding is one
of fact and does not raise a question of law.

For these reasons, it is my opinion that the
appeal of the Crown as against Cotroni should be dismissed.

The judgment of Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

PIGEON J.—These two appeals are from unanimous
judgments of the Court of Appeal of Ontario affirming John Papalia’s conviction and quashing Vincent Cotroni’s.

Convictions were entered after a jury trial, on October 28, 1976, against all four accused on an
indictment charging that:

SHELDON SWARTZ, JOHN PAPALIA, VINCENT
COTRONI AND PAOLO VIOLI, between the 1st day of April, 1973, and the 30th day
of May, 1974, in the Judicial District of York and elsewhere in the Province of
Ontario and in the Province of Quebec, unlawfully did conspire together each
with the other and with persons unknown to have possession of $300,000, more or
less, knowing that the said $300,000 was obtained by the commission in Canada
of the indictable offence of extortion punishable by indictment contrary to
Section 423(1) (d) and Section 312(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

There was an appeal by each accused. The appeals
of Swartz and Papalia were dismissed, those of Cotroni and Violi were allowed.
Leave to appeal was granted by this Court to Papalia and to the Crown, but due
to Violi’s death the Crown’s

[Page 262]

appeal is now against Cotroni only. The Court of
Appeal issued one set of reasons on all four appeals and it will be convenient
to do likewise on the two appeals to this Court.

On the appeals to the Court of Appeal an
elaborate agreed statement of facts was filed. In this one reads:

The offence alleged by the Crown involved
three distinct stages,. . .

The first stage in the spring of
1973 to August 30th, 1973 involved events leading up to the alleged extortion
of $300,000.00 perpetrated on Stanley Bader in Toronto.

The second stage involved
observations made by Bader and his girlfriend and certain conversations they
had with certain persons in Montreal.

The third stage involved
conversations between John Papalia of Hamilton, Vincent Cotroni and Paolo
Violi, both of Montreal, which
occurred in the City of Montreal. These conversations concerned the sum of $300,000.00 and the
events of the first and second stage.

The first conversation mentioned in the last
paragraph took place on April 30, 1974 between Violi and Cotroni. For the second, which took place on the
same day, they were joined by Papalia. Violi and Cotroni were alone for the
third conversation on May 13, 1974.

It is common ground that the recordings of those
conversations are the only evidence incriminating Violi and Cotroni and that
they are also essential evidence against Papalia. Transcripts, translated where
necessary from Calabrese to English, are part of the record of the case. The
agreed summary of the first conversation is as follows:

Cotroni and Violi discussed certain
information which they received from Kott and/or Lanza relating to an alleged
extortion of $300,000 that had taken place in Toronto some eight to twelve months previous through the use of their
names. They were advised Johnny (Papalia) had approached someone and said: “If
you don’t pay the people from Montreal. they are Kott’s partners…they will put you away”. He (Papalia)
said it could be settled for $300,000 which Swartz was to deliver to Papalia
who, in turn, was to give the money to Vittorio (Cotroni). Swartz was said to
have received

[Page 263]

$150,000 which was to be lent out on
“Shylock” but he gave the money to Papalia. Then Swartz was alleged to have
told Bader he needed to give another $150,000.00 to Papalia to give to Cotroni.
Cotroni did not receive any monies from Papalia and he believed Papalia kept it
all himself. Violi and Cotroni concluded the conversation by agreeing to meet
later that day at Gelateria Violi to discuss the matter with Johnny (Papalia).

No satisfactory summary could be agreed upon for
the other two conversations but it may be said that there is no doubt Papalia
stated he had been promised $50,000 by Swartz and had received $40,000. Violi
and Cotroni were taking the stand that $300,000 had been obtained by the use of
their names and they should get one half of that sum.

The first ground of appeal which Jessup J.A.
dealt with in the reasons of the Court below concerned the admissibility of the
recordings as evidence. On that point he said:

…The recordings proffered in evidence were
re-recordings. The explanation for this was that, after re-recording, the
original recordings had been erased and the tapes of them re-used. The reason
was that at that time it was not the practice of the Montreal police to use tape recordings as evidence in Court. The further
reason was that electronic surveillance of the premises in Montreal had extended over a protracted
period and the storage of the many resultant tapes presented a problem. As a
result, a record only of significant conversations was kept by re-recording
such significant parts on fresh tapes which were preserved.

It was argued that the re-recordings
proffered were inadmissible as not being the best evidence of the conversations
they reproduced. However, counsel made the significant admission that no
question was raised as to the authenticity of the re-recordings.

Of the “best evidence” rule Halsbury states
in the 4th ed., Vol. 17, p. 8:

“That evidence should be the best that the
nature of the case will allow is, besides being a matter of obvious prudence, a
principle with a considerable pedigree. However, any strict interpretation of
this principle has long been obsolete, and the rule is now only of importance
in regard to the primary evidence of private documents. The logic of requiring
the production of an original document where it is available rather than
relying on possibly unsatisfactory copies, or the recollections of witnesses,
is clear, although

[Page 264]

modern techniques make objections to the
first alternative less strong.”

The rule itself, in its relatively modern
form did not absolutely exclude secondary evidence. It is stated by Lord Esher,
M.R. in Lucas v. Williams & Sons, (1892) 2 Q.B. at 116:—

“‘Primary’ and ‘secondary’ evidence mean
this: primary evidence is evidence which the law requires to be given first;
secondary evidence is evidence which may be given in the absence of the better
evidence which the law requires to be given first, when a proper explanation is
given of the absence of that better evidence.”

Lord Denning would remove the question of
secondary evidence entirely from the area of admissibility to that of weight.
In Garton v. Hunter, (1969) 2 Q.B. 37 at 44 he said:

“It is plain that Scott, L.J. had in mind
the old rule that a party must produce the best evidence that the nature of the
case will allow, and that any less good evidence is to be excluded. That old
rule has gone by the board long ago. The only remaining instance of it that I
know is that if an original document is available in your hands, you must
produce it. You cannot give secondary evidence by producing a copy. Nowadays we
do not confine ourselves to the best evidence. We admit all relevant evidence.
The goodness or badness of it goes only to weight, and not to admissibility.”

However, the counsel of prudence mentioned
by Halsbury accords with the principle stated by McCormick on Evidence, 2nd
ed. at p. 571:

“If the original document has been
destroyed by the person who offers evidence of its contents, the evidence is
not admissible unless, by showing that the destruction was accidental or was
done in good faith, without intention to prevent its use as evidence, he rebuts
to the satisfaction of the trial judge, any inference of fraud.”

The same principle should apply to tape
recordings.

In the present case, in my opinion, the
onus mentioned by McCormick was met by the Crown. Here the destruction of the
original tapes was done in good faith and the re‑recordings are
acknowledged to be authentic. For the proposition that only original tape
recordings are admissible the appellants rely on the rulings of single judges
in R. v. Stevenson, 55 Cr. App. R. 171 and R. v. Robson, 56 Cr.
App. R. 450. However, in both those cases the authenticity of the recordings
proffered in

[Page 265]

evidence was in serious issue and the
rulings on admissibility in neither case provide a guide for the facts in this
case. Similarly the appellants have referred to several judgments of American State
courts where the best evidence rule has been applied rigidly to exclude copies
of tape recordings. However, I prefer the Federal Court view expressed in United
States v. Knohl, 379 F. 2d. 427 (1967) at p. 440:

“Where a re-recording of a tape recorded
conversation is offered in evidence and the trier finds that a proper
foundation has been laid for it, and that the re-recording is authentic and accurate,
a technical and rigorous application of the best evidence rule makes no sense
and is not required. Johns v. United States, 323 F. 2d. 421 (5 Cir. 1963). The discussion of the rule by
Mr. Justice Sutherland, sitting as a Circuit Justice in the Second
Circuit, in United States v. Manton, 107 F. 2d. 834, 845 (2 Cir. 1939) is
pertinent:

‘The rule is not based upon the view that
the so-called secondary evidence is not competent, since, if the best evidence
is shown to be unobtainable, secondary evidence at once becomes admissible. And
if it appear, as it does here, that what is called the secondary evidence is
clearly equal in probative value to what is called the primary proof, and that
fraud or imposition, reasonably, is not to be feared, the reason upon which the
best evidence rule rests ceases, with the consequence that in that situation
the rule itself must cease to be applicable, in consonance with the
well-established maxim—cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex.

An over-technical and strained application
of the best evidence rule serves only to hamper the inquiry without at all
advancing the cause of truth.’

We are not unmindful, however, that tape
recordings are susceptible to alteration and that they often have a persuasive,
sometimes a dramatic, impact on a jury. It is therefore incumbent on the
Government to produce clear and convincing evidence of authenticity and
accuracy as a foundation for the admission of such recordings; and where the
Court accepts them as authentic and accurate but the evidence is conflicting on
these points, it must caution the jury to scrutinize the evidence with care.”

In my opinion the learned trial Judge
properly received in evidence in the present case the re-recordings proffered.

[Page 266]

In spite of the elaborate argument submitted by
counsel for Papalia and for Cotroni, I can see no reason to doubt the
correctness of the opinion thus expressed and I find it unnecessary to add
anything on the point. Most of the other points taken by Papalia before the
Court of Appeal were also raised again before us but I am satisfied they were
properly rejected and do not consider it necessary to deal explicitly with any
of them. There is however an important point which arises out of the reasons
given for disposing the appeals of Violi and Cotroni as follows:

The main ground of appeal of the appellants
Violi and Cotroni is that, as against them, the verdict of the jury is
unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. In their case I think
that argument has to be given effect to. The only evidence of an agreement
between them and Papalia that emerges from the recorded conversations is for
Papalia to arrange a meeting in Toronto between them or one of them and Swartz. Presumably at such meeting
Swartz would have been made a subject of extortion. The theory of the Crown was
that Cotroni and Violi joined the existing conspiracy between Swartz and
Papalia but any conspiracy between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni had a different
object than that alleged in the indictment. While the roles of the several
persons in a conspiracy may be entirely different, they must have a common
object. Here the evidence led against Violi and Cotroni points to a different
object.

Papalia’s first ground of appeal arising out of
the above statement is that on this view of the conspiracy, the indictment was
void for duplicity. I do not think this is a correct reading of the Court of
Appeal decision. What is said is not that two conspiracies were charged in the
indictment but that “any conspiracy between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni had a
different object than that alleged in the indictment”. This means that in the
view of the Court of Appeal, if there was a conspiracy between Papalia, Violi
and Cotroni it was not the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. The basis of
this finding is, I think, in the preceding sentence: “Swartz would have been
made a subject of extortion”, in other words, this was not a conspiracy to have
possession of the $300,000 but a conspiracy to extort $150,000 from Swartz.

I have to agree with Jessup J.A. that the
alleged conspiracy between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni did not have the same
object as the initial conspiracy

[Page 267]

between Swartz and Papalia. The object of this
first conspiracy was to obtain possession of the $300,000 extorted from Bader
at the end of August 1973 and of which Papalia got $40,000 out of a promised
$50,000. There is no evidence that Cotroni and Violi were actually involved in
this matter prior to the end of April 1974 at which time, having been told that
their names had been used in the extortion by Swartz, they allegedly conspired
with Papalia to obtain part of the $300,000. The theory of the Crown is that
they thereby joined the initial conspiracy between Swartz and Papalia, but I
think this contention was righly rejected by the Court of Appeal. There was no
evidence of any agreement by them with Swartz, only with Papalia, and, in the
circumstances, the latter certainly could not be considered as acting for him
so as to effect a conspiracy between all four accused in respect of what Violi
and Cotroni sought to accomplish. I, therefore, agree with Jessup J.A. that
“the evidence led against Violi and Cotroni points to a different object”.

Out of this there arise two groups of appeal
raised by Papalia which require consideration, namely, that on the basis of
such conclusion the verdict should be quashed for duplicity and also for
improper admission of evidence.

As to the duplicity, it is pretty clear that the
Court of Appeal did not think it existed, because it held the “conspiracy
between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni had a different object than that alleged in
the indictment”, that is it was a conspiracy to extort money from Swartz rather
than a conspiracy to have possession of the sum extorted by Swartz from Bader. However,
I do not think this is the correct view of Violi and Cotroni’s conspiracy with
Papalia. The money extorted by Swartz from Bader did not thereby become his in
law. Therefore it appears to me that Violi and Cotroni’s conspiracy is properly
described as a conspiracy to have possession of that money rather than as a
conspiracy to extort some of it from Swartz, so that, although it is a separate
conspiracy it is covered by the indictment and makes it duplicitous. But I do
not think this invalidates the conviction. Section 519 of the Code reads:

[Page 268]

519. (1) A
count is not objectionable by reason only that

(a) it charges in the alternative
several different matters, acts or omissions that are stated in the alternative
in an enactment that describes as an indictable offence the matters, acts or
omissions charged in the count, or

(b) it is double or multifarious.

(2) An accused may at any stage of his
trial apply to the court to amend or to divide a count that

(a) charges in the alternative
different matters, acts or omissions that are stated in the alternative in the
enactment that describes the offence or declares that the matters, acts of
omissions charged are an indictable offence, or

(b) is double or multifarious,

on the ground that, as framed, it embarrasses
him in his defence.

(3) The court may, where it is satisfied
that the ends of justice require it, order that a count be amended or divided
into two or more counts, and thereupon a formal commencement may be inserted
before each of the counts into which it is divided.

In my view, full effect must be given to ss.
(1)(b). Duplicity no longer makes an indictment void. In R. v. Cipolla[2] Porter C.J.O. said in giving the majority
opinion (at p. 90):

In the present case the charge is “that the
accused unlawfully did conspire together, the one with the other and others of
them and persons unknown,” so that in the present case all that was required to
be proved by the Crown in so far as Cipolla was concerned, was that he
conspired to traffic with any of the other persons charged in the indictment.
In my view, once the Crown has proved that Cipolla conspired with any of his co‑accused
to traffic in narcotic drugs they proved their case and even if there were more
than one conspiracy proved, which in my view there was not, it would not be
open to Cipolla as a defence to say “you have proved more than one conspiracy
against me.”

This decision was affirmed on appeal to this
Court ([1965] S.C.R. v, 46 C.R. 197).

I do not overlook subs. 510(1) which is the
introductory provision under the heading “General

[Page 269]

Provisions as to Counts” and is in the following
terms:

510. (1) Each count in an indictment shall
in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if
it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable
offence therein specified.

One should note in this enactment the words “in
general” which indicate that this is not a rigid but a flexible rule, also the
word “transaction” which has no technical meaning in criminal law and cannot be
equated with “offence”. The reason for this indefiniteness in the rule is
obvious: it is to be read with s. 519 which governs its application, giving to
the trial judge fairly complete discretion in this respect. He may at the
request of the accused or of his own motion, at any stage of the trial, divide
a double or multiple count. On the other hand, it is provided that this will
not be a cause of invalidity.

It has long been recognized that the general
rule against duplicity or multifarious counts is subject to exception in some
cases. For instance in Minchin v. The King[3] one reads in the head note:

A conviction for theft of an entire sum,
although it may have been taken in numberous small amounts at different times
during the deficiency period, may be supported without proving the taking of
each of any of such several amounts and the case treated as one continuous act
of theft although there were a number of distinct takings,…

In R. v. Laroche[4], at p. 10, McLennan J.A. said for the
Ontario Court of Appeal:

The argument was addressed to us that the
indictment and conviction were bad in law. Section 492(1) (of the Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51) states: “Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single
transaction…” Counsel for the appellant argued that each of the nine
transactions should have been made the subject of a separate count and since
they were not the conviction is void for uncertainty because a general verdict
on the indictment as it stands now does not reveal what amount the jury found
that the appellant had stolen. This charge is, however, that the appellant
between certain dates stole varying sums, in amounts

[Page 270]

and at times unknown, to a total sum of
$10,790.52. In such a case it is proper to charge a general deficiency: Minchin
v. The King (1914), 23 C.C.C. 414, 18 D.L.R. 340. The proof of the nine
transactions was necessary to show the general deficiency and apart from the
first Millcraft cheque the Noel cheque, if that was a substitution for cash
previously taken, there was no relation in time between the takings and the
substitutions of the cheques. If the charge had been that of falsifying records
under s. 340 it would of course have been necessary to set out in a separate
count each of the transactions referred to, but that is not this case. The
appellant did not apply for particulars before or during the trial under s. 497
or to amend or divide the count under s. 500. I would not be disposed to quash
the conviction on these grounds because in substance the charge is of one
continuous act of theft. In any event it is not a rule of law but one of
practice that in cases like this the charge should be divided into as many
counts as possible: R. v. Tomlin (1954), 38 Cr. App. R. 82…

Although rejecting the argument based on
multiplicity, the Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on another
ground. On appeal to this Court[5] the
conviction was restored by the majority judgment, however, Spence J.
Dissenting, agreed with the majority as to the correctness of the above quoted
statement.

In R. v. Canavan and Busby[6] at pp. 18, 19, Schroeder J.A. said for the
Ontario Court of Appeal after quoting ss. 510(1) (then subs. 492(1)):

“Transaction” is a word of quite
comprehensive import, which, so far as I am aware, has never been the subject
of any exact legal definition. The word has been interpreted as the justice of
each case demanded rather than by any abstract definition. In its ordinary
sense it is understood to mean the doing or performing of some matter of
business between two or more persons. “Transaction” in its broadest sense
expresses the concept of driving, doing, or acting as is denoted by the Latin
word trans-agere from which it is derived. In Bendir et al. v. Anson,
[1936] 3 All E.R. 326 at p. 330, it was suggested

[Page 271]

that “transaction” would seem to mean an
act the effect of which extends beyond the agent to other persons.

A “transaction” may and frequently does
include a series of occurrences extending over a length of time.

. . .

The words “in general” appearing in s.
492(1) would appear to indicate a permissible relaxation of its terms extending
to exceptional cases in which a number of acts each in itself constituting an
offence is capable of being treated as one transaction. This is implicit in the
provisions of s. 500(3) of the Code which empowers the Court, where it
is satisfied that the ends of justice require it, to order that a count be
amended or divided into two or more counts. This indicates that a number of
acts, each in themselves capable of constituting an offence, may be before the
Court in one count and a trial on that one count can proceed unless the Court
is satisfied that a division is required.

Leave to appeal to this Court was denied ([1970]
S.C.R. viii).

Counsel for Papalia relied on what is said by
Goode, Criminal Conspiracy in Canada at p. 228, and notes there
cited. The notes refer mainly to Cox and Paton v. R.[7] and Archer v. R.[8] I cannot find what Goode says very helpful
to Papalia and Cotroni. At p. 222, I read: “Cartwright J. in Cox and Paton
v. The Queen recognized that one conspiracy may encompass more than one
object,…”. I should however point out that Cox and Paton did not deal
with duplicity in the same sense as in the instant case. The problem there was
the exact opposite: instead of two conspiracies charged in one count, the same
conspiracy was in substance charged differently in several counts. It was a
situation similar to that which occurred in Kienapple v. R.[9] where it was likewise held that there
should not be more than one conviction entered for what is in substance the
same delict, although it may technically constitute two or more offences.

As to Archer v. R. it must be pointed out
that this was a summary conviction offence governed by the provisions of the
old Criminal Code , which

[Page 272]

are quoted in the judgment of the majority and
where one reads:

710. (3)
Every complaint shall be for one matter of complaint only, and not for two or
more matters of complaint, and every information shall be for one offence only,
and not for two or more offences.

This was a rigid rule against duplicity or
multiplicity totally unlike ss. 510(1) and moreover not subject to s. 519.

Even under the present Code, the
situation is not the same for summary conviction offences as for indictable
offences for the obvious reason that in summary conviction offences, the
accused does not have the benefit of a preliminary enquiry.
Subsection 724(1) reads:

724. (1) In
proceedings to which this Part applies, the information

(a) shall be in writing and under
oath, and

(b) may charge more than one offence
or relate to more than one matter of complaint, but where more than one offence
is charged or the information relates to more than one matter of complaint,
each offence or matter of complaint, as the case may be, shall be set out in a
separate count.

By virtue of subs. 729(1), ss. 510 and 512 apply
but not s. 519. However, here is what Dickson J., speaking for the full Court,
said of duplicity in the summary conviction case of Caswell v. Sault Ste.
Marie,[10] at pp.
38, 39 and 1307, 1308:

…one must recall, I think, the policy basis
of the rule against multiplicity and duplicity. The rule developed during a
period of extreme formality and technicality in the preferring of indictments
and laying of informations. It grew from the humane desire of judges to
alleviate the severity of the law in an age when many crimes were still
classified as felonies, for which the punishment was death by the gallows. The
slightest defect made an indictment a nullity. That age has passed. Parliament
has made it abundantly clear in those sections of the Criminal Code  having
to do with the form of indictments and informations that the punctilio of an
earlier age is not longer to bind us. We must look for substance and not petty
formalities.

[Page 273]

. .
.

In my opinion, the primary test should be a
practical one, based on the only valid justification for the rule against
duplicity: does the accused know the case he has to meet, or is he prejudiced in
the preparation of his defence by ambiguity in the charge?

In the present case there is no finding of
prejudice caused by the duplicity of the charge and none appears. In my view,
the effect of s. 519 is not doubtful: in indictable offences, duplicity and
multiplicity do not invalidate an indictment, it is for the judge trying the
case to decide whether a division is necessary. In the present case, it is
unnecessary to go on to consider under what circumstances the failure of the
trial judge to properly exercise his discretion in this respect might be
reviewed on appeal, there is no basis for such review. I, therefore, have to
reject the objection based on duplicity.

The last ground of appeal submitted by Papalia
which has to be dealt with is that, because the second conspiracy did not come
within the terms of the indictment, the evidence in support thereof was not
properly admitted. There is no substance in this objection. The incriminating
part of the three conversations towards Papalia is all in the second in which
he took part and which would be admissible in any event.

For those reasons, I conclude that Papalia’s
appeal should be dismissed.

On the Crown’s appeal against Cotroni, a
threshold question arises: Does the appeal raise a pure question of law? The
problem is that in dealing with Violi and Cotroni’s appeal, Jessup J.A. said at
the outset:

The main ground of appeal of the appellants
Violi and Cotroni is that, as against them, the verdict of the jury is
unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. In their case I think
that argument has to be given effect to.

If those words were to be considered apart from
what follows, it would have to be decided that there can be no appeal to this
Court because it is settled that when the Court of Appeal finds the evidence
insufficient this does not raise a pure

[Page 274]

question of law: R. v. Warner[11], Demenoff v. R.[12] However, the fact that the words of
subpara. 613(1)(a)(i) are used does not necessarily mean that the judgment of
the Court of Appeal is not based on one or more pure questions of law. In R.
v. Taylor[13] those
very words had been used by Casey J.A. as quoted by Cartwright J. dissenting
(at p. 495):

Before a jury can be called upon to pass
judgment, before it can be asked to decide whether there was ‘wanton or
reckless disregard’ there must be some evidence from which the existence of
this element can be reasonably deduced. If no such evidence exists then the
verdict that finds the accused guilty is one that in the words of CC 592 is
‘unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence’. In this case the only
person who testifies as to the conduct of the appellant was Mrs. Lemieux.
Assuming that the appellant was driving the automobile that struck the victim
the evidence of Mrs. Lemieux does not establish facts from which the
existence of ‘wanton or reckless disregard’ can be reasonably deduced.

For the foregoing reasons I would maintain
this appeal and quash the conviction.

However, the majority agreed with Judson J.
that, in fact, the decision was that there was no evidence and this was a
question of law (at p. 493):

When the case came to appeal the Court
concentrated its attention upon the evidence of Madame Lemieux. I take the
finding of Casey J. to be that there was no evidence to go to the jury and
that, in consequence, he held that the verdict was unreasonable and could not
be supported by the evidence. Rinfret J. held that the learned trial judge
ought to have directed a verdict of acquittal. Badeaux J. agreed with both his
colleagues and, in my opinion, without any inconsistency for it is a common
basis to both reasons for judgment that there was no evidence to go to the
jury. This is a question of law and I am of the opinion that the ruling upon it
was erronenous.

In the present case, after the two sentences I
have first quoted, Jessup J.A. goes on to say:

The only evidence of an agreement between
them and Papalia that emerges from the recorded conversations is for Papalia to
arrange a meeting in Toronto
between

[Page 275]

them or one of them and Swartz. Presumably
at such meeting Swartz would have been made a subject of extortion. The theory
of the Crown was that Cotroni and Violi joined the existing conspiracy between
Swartz and Papalia but any conspiracy between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni had a
different object than that alleged in the indictment. While the roles of the
several persons in a conspiracy may be entirely different, they must have a
common object. Here the evidence led against Violi and Cotroni points to a
different object.

This clearly means that the only evidence against
Violi and Cotroni is not evidence of the conspiracy alleged in the
indictment because it points to a different object. A finding that there is no
evidence raises a question of law as stated by Judson J., see: R. v.
Morabito[14], R.
v. Kyling[15]. Whether
evidence of a conspiracy between Cotroni, Violi and Papalia to obtain from
Swartz some of the money extorted by him from Bader is evidence of the
conspiracy alleged in the indictment, is also a question of law as is apparent
from what has already been said. In my opinion, for the reasons already stated,
the Crown’s appeal against Cotroni raises questions of law.

There is however a further difficulty. The only
evidence against Cotroni is of conversations in Montreal. In order to support a verdict against him in Ontario, there has to be some evidence that
some part of his conspiracy with Violi and Papalia took place or was carried
out in Ontario. This is what I
cannot find.

I therefore come to the conclusion that both appeals
should be dismissed.

The judgment of Spence, Dickson, Beetz and
Pratte JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This is an appeal by John Papalia
from conviction on a charge of conspiring to have possession of extorted funds,
and an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal of Vincent Cotroni on the same
charge.

[Page 276]

Conspiracy is an inchoate or preliminary crime,
dating from the time of Edward I, but much refined in the Court of Star Chamber
in the seventeenth century. Notwithstanding its antiquity, the law of
conspiracy is still uncertain. It can, however, be said that the indictment for
conspiracy is a formidable weapon in the armoury of the prosecutor. According
to the cases, it permits a vague definition of the offence; broader standards
of admissibility of evidence apply; it may provide the solution to
prosecutorial problems as to situs and jurisdiction. See Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Doot[16]. But
the very looseness generally allowed for specifying the offence, for receiving
proof, and generally in the conduct of the trial, imposes upon a trial judge an
added duty to ensure against the possibility of improper transference of guilt
from one accused to another. There is, I have no doubt, a subconscious tendency
upon the part of jurors in a conspiracy case to regard all co-conspirators
alike and ignore the fact that guilt is something individual and personal.

The word “conspire” derives from two Latin
words, “con” and “spirare”, meaning “to breathe together.” To conspire is to
agree. The essence of criminal conspiracy is proof of agreement. On a charge of
conspiracy the agreement itself is the gist of the offence: Paradis v. R.[17], at p. 168. The actus reus is
the fact of agreement: D.D.P. v. Nock[18],
at p. 66. The agreement reached by the co-conspirators may contemplate a number
of acts or offences. Any number of persons may be privy to it. Additional
persons may join the ongoing scheme while others may drop out. So long as there
is a continuing overall, dominant plan there may be changes in methods of operation,
personnel, or victims, without bringing the conspiracy to an end. The important
inquiry is not as to the acts done in pursuance of the agreement, but whether
there was, in fact, a common agreement to which the acts are referable and to
which all of the

[Page 277]

alleged offenders were privy. In R. v. Meyrick
and Ribuffi[19], at p.
102 the question asked was whether “the acts of the accused were done in
pursuance of a criminal purpose held in common between them”, and in 11
Halsbury (4th ed.), at p. 44 it is said:

It is not enough that two or more persons
pursued the same unlawful object at the same time or in the same place; it is
necessary to show a meeting of minds, a consensus to effect an unlawful
purpose.

There must be evidence beyond reasonable doubt
that the alleged conspirators acted in concert in pursuit of a common goal.

The difficulty in this case stems from the
essential vagueness of the charge. There is no indication that any motion to
quash was made at the outset of the trial. I observe in passing, however, that
it is open to question whether the indictment can be said to contain
“sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the
accused reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be proved
against him”, or “to identify the transaction referred to”, as required by s.
510(3)  of the Criminal Code . Indictments not unlike that in the case at
bar were quashed in the following conspiracy cases: Brodie v. The King[20], (where the offence was baldly stated as
“seditious conspiracy”); Schumiatcher v. Attorney‑General for
Saskatchewan[21] (conspiracy
“unlawfully by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud the
public of property, money or valuable securities”); R. v. Harrison and
Burdeyney[22] (conspiracy
“to commit the indictable offence of arson”); and Re Regina and Marcoux and
Desfosses[23] (conspiracy
to commit “armed robbery”).

The Facts

          Toronto

The facts of the case are bizarre. A detailed
statement of those agreed upon was prepared by the parties for submission to
the Court of Appeal

[Page 278]

of Ontario. The following is a resumé of the agreed facts: In 1973, one
Stanley Bader was working in Toronto as a stock promoter. He was associated in some business ventures
with a man named Sydney Rosen. During the first part of 1973 Bader was also
involved in a venture with one Sheldon Swartz. They lent money to various
individuals at high rates of interest. They borrowed funds from Rosen for that
purpose. The lending practice was referred to as “shylocking.” About $140,000
was advanced by Rosen during a period of six weeks. Swartz arranged most of the
loans. The funds passed from Rosen to Bader to Swartz. Bader had only the word
of Swartz that the funds were actually being loaned. Bader considered Swartz
his best friend and trusted him implicitly. In early August, 1973, Rosen
advised Bader that he would make no further advances. Shortly thereafter Swartz
told Bader that the loans which Swartz was supposed to have arranged did not
exist.

Swartz also advised Bader that he had been told
there was going to be trouble involving Bader and Rosen. Certain people in Montreal had apparently lost money because
the stocks promoted by one Irving Kott had collapsed. Rosen was blamed for this
collapse. Bader was the target of these people because he was close to Rosen,
and Rosen was considered too important to attack directly. Swartz advised Bader
that the “trouble” could be avoided by paying $300,000 to these people who had
suffered the loss. If the money was not forthcoming, Swartz was advised that
Bader would be maimed so he could never work again. Swartz told Bader that, as
a favour to Bader, he, Swartz, had paid about $120,000 from moneys obtained
from Rosen under the pretence that the money was being lent by Bader and Swartz.
Swartz told Bader that he was now compelled to tell Bader the truth because the
remaining $180,000 had to be paid within a week or Swartz himself would be in
trouble. Swartz indicated that these threats from Montreal had been relayed to him through someone in Hamilton whom Bader
assumed to be John Papalia, also known as “Johnny Pops.”

Bader believed the story told by Swartz, as did
Rosen. Rosen became convinced a “contract” was

[Page 279]

out on Bader and that Bader’s life was in peril.
Rosen advanced $175,000 in cash to Swartz and Bader in order to save Bader from
harm. Swartz reported to Bader that he had given the cash to a heavy-set man.
Bader inquired whether the man was Angelo Lanza (now dead), a resident of Montreal and an associate of Kott. Swartz
did not reply.

The friendship between Swartz and Bader cooled
in the latter part of 1973. Swartz’ life-style also showed a marked improvement
during this period. His purchase of expensive jewellery, furniture and swimming
pool gave rise to suspicion, however, on the part of Bader, leading the latter
in late April, 1974 to meet Kott in Montreal. Kott denied any knowledge of the $300,000. Lanza also disclaimed
knowledge of the events which had occurred in Toronto the previous August.

          Montreal

The scene now shifts to Montreal and to events between April 30, 1974 and May 13, 1974. Two residents of Montreal, Vincent Cotroni and Paolo Violi
(now dead) are added to the central cast of characters. Cotroni and Violi came
to believe that their names had been used to acquire funds from Bader. The
evidence of events in Montreal
consists entirely of recordings of three private conversations, largely in the
Calabrese language, intercepted by means of electromagnetic devices installed
by the Montreal Police Department.

In the first conversation, Cotroni and Violi
discuss information they received from Kott, or Lanza, or both, relating to an
alleged extortion of $300,000 in Toronto some months previously through the use of their names. They had
been advised that Johnny Papalia had approached someone and said: “If you don’t
pay the people from Montreal…they
are Kott’s partners…they will put you away…” Papalia had said it could be
settled for $300,000. Swartz was to deliver $300,000 to Papalia who, in turn,
was to give it to Cotroni. Cotroni, however, did not receive any moneys from
Papalia and he believed Papalia had

[Page 280]

kept it all himself. Violi and Cotroni concluded
their conversation by agreeing to meet later that day at Violi’s ice cream
parlour, Gelateria Violi, to discuss the matter with Papalia.

The second conversation involved Cotroni, Violi
and Papalia. Papalia is the object of intense and menacing inquiry. Cotroni and
Violi are seeking to discover whether to believe Papalia’s story to the effect
that Swartz had taken $150,000 improperly from Rosen and, in panic, sought
Papalia’s help. Through threats, Swartz obtained another $150,000 from Rosen.
Papalia said that he was supposed to be paid $50,000 by Swartz, but received
only $40,000. The following is an extract from the conversation:

PAPALIA IN ENGLISH

He’s got two sixty believe me, if he took
three hundred, he’s got two sixty.

COTRONI

Yeah?

PAPALIA IN ENGLISH

I got forty. Take the two sixty off of him.

COTRONI IN ENGLISH

Yeah! But you see the guy, he gonna say, “I
gave this money to Johnny.”

PAPALIA IN ENGLISH

He can say he gave it to Jesus Christ! I
don’t care what he says. He didn’t give it to me Vic.

COTRONI IN ENGLISH

Let’s hope because eh, we’ll kill you.

PAPALIA IN ENGLISH

I know you’ll kill me Vic, I believe you’ll
kill me.

COTRONI IN ENGLISH

…because the guy said, he give, he give it
to Johnny. He say. The guy say that.

PAPALIA IN ENGLISH

What, what do you want me to do. Just tell
him he’s a (…) liar.

Near the end of the conversation Cotroni said,
referring to Swartz: “O.K. we gonna deal with him, we gonna fix…” Violi,
speaking to Papalia, said: “So in the meantime, you got forty, he gotta two
sixty, he got the money because he used us

[Page 281]

names, the people he gonna see me, he got the
(…) money, when we got nothing.” Papalia suggested that they beat up Swartz and
take the $260,000 from him, but Cotroni and Violi demurred. After further
discussion Papalia said: “I tell him my own way, in my own back yard”, to which
Violi responded: “Hum, eh, eh, eh, this way we never, we never, we never reach
that guy.” Papalia replied: “Then you come, you come to Toronto then.” And so it was agreed that
Violi would go to Toronto the
following week. He was prepared to go “. . . any place, so long as we gonna
straight up this thing.” It is only too clear that “straight up this thing”
meant relieving Swartz of the money he had extorted or what was left of it.
Violi assured Papalia: “That’s gonna save your life.” It was agreed that,
pending the proposed meeting in Toronto, Papalia would say nothing to Swartz.

A third conversation, containing little of
interest, involved Cotroni and Violi in a discussion of the events which had
transpired since their conversation with Papalia on April 30, 1974. The Toronto meeting had not taken place.
Papalia, however, in breach of his undertaking, had spoken, it would appear, to
Swartz.

That is the evidence in the case, taken from the
agreed statement of facts and transcript of conversations. In most conspiracy
prosecutions the fact of an agreement between the conspirators, and its nature,
must be inferred from overt acts and disputed facts. In the present case, the
Court suffers under no such disability. The Toronto facts, if I may use that phrase, are agreed, and the Montreal facts are a matter of direct
evidence. The facts are, of course, of crucial importance in considering the
nature and scope of the agreement which is alleged to constitute the
conspiracy.

The Legal Proceedings

The Crown laid a single charge of conspiracy
against Swartz, Papalia, Cotroni and Violi. The indictment reads:

Sheldon Swartz, John Papalia, Vincent
Cotroni and Paolo Violi, between the 1st day of
April, 1973, and the

[Page 282]

30th day of May, 1974, in the Judicial
District of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario and in the Province
of Quebec, unlawfully did conspire together each with the other and with
persons unknown to have possession of $300,000, more or less, knowing that the
said $300,000 was obtained by the commission in Canada of the indictable offence
of extortion punishable by indictment contrary to Section 423(1) (d) and
Section 312(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada. (Emphasis
added.)

The four accused were tried by a jury presided
over by Mr. Justice Wright. All were found guilty. On appeal, the
convictions of Papalia and Swartz were confirmed. As to Violi and Cotroni, the
Court of Appeal, speaking through Mr. Justice Jessup, said:

The main ground of appeal of the appellants
Violi and Cotroni is that, as against them, the verdict of the jury is
unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. In their case I think
that argument has to be given effect to. The only evidence of an agreement
between them and Papalia that emerges from the recorded conversations is for
Papalia to arrange a meeting in Toronto between them or one of them and Swartz. Presumably at such meeting
Swartz would have been made a subject of extortion. The theory of the Crown was
that Cotroni and Violi joined the existing conspiracy between Swartz and
Papalia, but any conspiracy between Papalia, Violi and Cotroni had a different
object than that alleged in the indictment. While the roles of the several
persons in a conspiracy may be entirely different, they must have a common
object. Here the evidence led against Violi and Cotroni points to a different
object.

There are two possible readings of the judgment
of the Court of Appeal:

(a) the court concluded that the verdict of
the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence, although
there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury. If this be so, no question of
law arises for this Court;

(b) there was not one, but two,
conspiracies, the object of the second being different from that alleged in the
indictment.

Let me say at the outset that I have had an
opportunity of reading the reasons prepared by my brother Pigeon for delivery
in this appeal. I agree with him that the first of the above readings of the
Court of Appeal decision must be rejected. The Court of Appeal, as I read the
reasons, found a

[Page 283]

second conspiracy involving Cotroni and Violi
with a different object than the conspiracy to which Swartz and Papalia were
parties, Hence, so far as Cotroni and Violi were concerned, there was no
evidence, as distinguished from insufficiency of evidence, of the conspiracy
alleged.

I agree with my brother Pigeon that the Court of
Appeal was right in rejecting the theory of the Crown that there was one
continuous conspiracy initially composed of Swartz and Papalia, thereafter
joined by Violi and Cotroni, the object (the possession of funds knowing they
were obtained by extortion) remaining constant throughout. I also agree that
the count, as drafted, is not duplicitous and does not become so by reason of
the evidence called in support of the count: R. v. Greenfield[24].

The principal issue, as I see it, is not one of
duplicity or of objects, but whether the Crown has succeeded in proving
agreement among all the alleged conspirators. The Crown undertook to prove that
Swartz, Papalia, Cotroni and Violi, the four of them, conspired together and
agreed to possess extorted funds. The question is whether there was evidence
upon which the jury could find unity of intent on the part of the four accused.
In addition to proof of a common design, it was incumbent on the Crown to
establish that each accused had the intent to become a party to that common
design with knowledge of its implications.

Agreement

Some improbable groupings of individuals have
been held to be single conspiracies by the simple technique of positing a very
general “object”, and in the case at bar that technique was attempted. The
Crown contends that the “object” was the indictable offence of having
possession of funds knowing they were obtained by extortion, that there existed
only one conspiracy to achieve one object and hence that all four accused may
be convicted of conspiracy. This view overlooks the essential point that, in
order to have a conspiracy, one must have ageeement between the
co-conspirators. There was simply no evidence of agreement

[Page 284]

between the four alleged conspirators. There was
not the common purpose of a single enterprise, but rather the several purposes
of two separate adventures. It is true that, in the most general of terms, it
might be said that each of these adventures had a common object, money, with
Swartz and Papalia in possession of extorted funds, and Cotroni and Violi
desirous of relieving them of those funds, but there was no general agreement.
A common desire to have money cannot create a conspiracy in the absence of a
meeting of minds. The facts here show two competing and mutually exclusive
objects. Counsel suggested the analogy of four hungry dogs fighting over a
bone. If there was agreement between Violi, Cotroni, and a reluctant Papalia on
April 30, 1974, it was for an
object inconsistent with and, indeed, diametrically opposed to the stated
object of the agreement between Swartz and Papalia. Legal fiction and
conceptual theory must be kept within some reasonable limits.

However one characterizes the modus operandi intended
to be employed by Cotroni and Violi in respect of Swartz, it is Swartz who is
clearly the victim, and also unaware that he has been cast in that role. All of
this must serve to negate the existence of one agreement. The case of R. v. Dawson[25], started with a charge of conspiracy to
cheat and defraud over a period of three years rolled up with fourteen other
counts of substantive offences. Finnemore J. found that: “Although conspiracy
there was, it was a number of conspiracies.” Twelve men were said to have been
involved, of whom six were charged and three convicted. At p. 564, Finnemore J.
notes:

It is an odd circumstance that one person
named Eland was included in a count as one of the conspirators, and in a later
count included as one of the victims.

We find the statement: “…it is no more correct
to charge several conspiracies, though they are called one conspiracy, if it is
to include other different charges, in one count.” The convictions on this
count were quashed.

[Page 285]

Accepting that there was agreement between
Papalia and Swartz for the possession of the proceeds of extortion, and that it
continued until the events in Montreal, there is no evidence that Cotroni and Violi joined or, to use the
word of early days, “adhered”, to that agreement.

The indictable offence in the abstract, as it
was set out in this case, cannot be set up as, or confused with, the “object”
of the conspiracy. One must look to the facts to find the object. When this is
done it is obvious that while Swartz and Papalia, on the one hand, and Cotroni
and Violi, on the other, may be said, in a very loose sense, to have been
pursuing the same end or object, they were doing so independently and not in
pursuance of a criminal purpose held in common between them. If one asks the
simple question, “What did the four conspirators agree to do?”, the answer,
upon the evidence, must be: “Nothing.” One cannot pass off the antagonistic
designs of the four protagonists as merely differences in the “terms” of the
agreement, the “object” remaining constant, which is the Crown’s theory. There
was no common agreement and no common object.

A distinction must be drawn between a conspiracy
count which charges the accused with two or more conspiracies, and a count
which charges one conspiracy only but is supported by proof during trial of
more than one conspiracy. The former gives rise to questions of duplicity. The
latter raises the question of whether the Crown has proven the conspiracy
charged against two or more of the accused notwithstanding evidence of a second
conspiracy. It is the latter situation with which we are concerned in this
case.

A recent English case, R. v. Greenfield, supra, attempts to shed some light on the question. There Lawton L.J.
distinguished between “form” and “proof” at pp. 1155-6:

A conspiracy count is bad in law if it charges
the defendants with having been members of two or more conspiracies. This
is elementary law.

When considering whether a conspiracy count is
bad for duplicity, a trial judge should look at the count itself, the
particulars if provided, and the

[Page 286]

opening address of the prosecution. Lawton L.J.
continued, p. 1156:

Duplicity in a count is a matter of form;
it is not a matter relating to the evidence called in support of the count…

A charge which is not bad for duplicity
when the trial starts does not become bad in law because evidence is led which
is consistent with one or more of the defendants being a member of a conspiracy
other than the one charged. Such evidence may make it impossible for the
prosecution to establish the existence of the conspiracy charged…

Lawton L.J. proceeded then to discuss the proper
procedure to be followed in such a case, at pp. 1156-7:

At the end of the prosecution’s case the
evidence may be as consistent with the defendants, or some of them, having been
members of a conspiracy which was not the one charged as with the one charged.
In such a situation the trial judge should rule that there is no case to
answer. But if at the end of the prosecution’s case there is evidence on which,
if uncontradicted, a reasonably minded jury could convict the defendants, or
two or more of them, of the conspiracy charged despite evidence of the
existence of another conspiracy, then the trial judge should let the case go to
the jury.

In Greenfield the four accused were charged with
conspiring to cause explosions in the United Kingdom over a three-year period. The evidence showed about twenty-five
explosions in a number of cities. The argument of the accused on appeal was
that the count was bad for multiplicity because the evidence was inconsistent
with one single continuous conspiracy. The convictions were upheld. The
conspiracy consisted of the overall agreement to plant bombs though overt acts
offered to prove it showed subsequent subsidiary conspiracies.

Conclusion

Where several conspiracies are shown to have
been committed, the problem arises of determining which one of these
conspiracies is that envisaged by the charge.

[Page 287]

Whether any or all of the conspiracies that have
been proven to have been committed are covered by the indictment depends on the
construction of the charge.

In interpreting the indictment, proper
consideration must be given to the jurisdictional limits of the court before
which the indictment is laid; it must be assumed that the indictment was
intended to relate to a crime over which the court had jurisdiction, rather
than to a crime over which it had no jurisdiction.

In the present case, the evidence shows that
there existed two conspiracies; the first one involved Papalia and Swartz and
its purpose was to have possession of extorted funds; the second one involved
Cotroni and Violi, and possibly Papalia, and its purpose was to acquire and
consequently to have possession of part of the same extorted funds. The
language of the indictment may well be broad enough to include both
conspiracies; however, the second conspiracy clearly took place only within the
Province of Quebec. The
evidence does not disclose that anything was done in furtherance of its object
within the territorial limits of Ontario. It follows that Ontario had no jurisdiction in respect thereto, and it must be inferred
that this is not the conspiracy described in the indictment.

It is against this background that the merits of
these two appeals must be considered.

In the case of Papalia, there was evidence to go
to the jury that he and Swartz conspired as charged and, in my view, Papalia
was properly convicted. I agree with my brother Pigeon that the grounds of
appeal respecting the admissibility of certain evidence, and other matters
raised on his behalf, are without merit.

As to the appeal by the Crown against Cotroni, I
agree with the Court of Appeal, though for different reasons, that the only
evidence against Cotroni is in respect of a conspiracy not covered by the
indictment.

[Page 288]

I would, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario,
dismiss the appeal of John Papalia, and dismiss the Crown appeal in the case of
Vincent Cotroni.

Appeals dismissed.

Solicitor for Papalia: B. Clive Bynoe, Toronto.

Solicitor for the Crown: The Ministry of
the Attorney General for Ontario, Toronto.

Powell, Toronto.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Corrupt
practices—Corruption—Bribery—Giving or offering corruptly money—Person bribed,
a member of a legislature—Person bribed, also Minister of Tourism—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

Appellant was a lawyer practising in Campbellton, New Brunswick where he had
been in partnership with Charles Van Horne until the latter was elected to the
provincial legislature. Van Horne later became Provincial Minister of Tourism
and appellant was retained by that department to negotiate for the purchase of
some land for the establishment of a provincial park. While so retained
appellant indicated to a friend interested in building a motel that he could
obtain favours for him from Van Home but that it would cost $10,000, including
legal fees, to obtain Van Horne’s approval of having the motel located in the
provincial park. This proposal was accepted and over a period of months large
sums of money were transferred through the appellant to Van Home. Appellant was
convicted before a judge and jury upon a count that he “…did give or offer
corruptly to a person then a member of the legislature of the Province of New
Brunswick, to wit: J. Charles Van Home in his official capacity as member of
the legislature and Minister of Tourism… in relation to the proposed
construction of or leasing or purchasing of land for or operation of a motel in
or near Sugar Loaf Park in which the Government of New Brunswick had some
interest… contrary to Section 108(1) (b) of the Criminal Code of Canada
and amendments thereto”. The Appeal Division unanimously dismissed the
subsequent appeal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Pratte JJ.: There could be little
doubt that the appellant offered money to Van Home, then a member of the
legislature of New Brunswick,
in respect of acts to

[Page 137]

be done by him in furtherance of plans to
construct a motel in the provincial park. The charge as amended alleged that
the money was corruptly paid to a member of the legislature who had also become
a minister of the Crown and who therefore acted in both capacities. While it
was contended that Van Horne was acting only in his “official capacity” as
Minister of Tourism and that it was not an offence under s. 108 to pay
money to a member of the legislature for something done by him in his official
capacity as a minister, such contention would involve the proposition that a
member of the legislature, who is also a minister, is to be taken not to
be acting in his capacity as a member in respect of his acts and decisions in
his department. It was however as a member of the legislature that Van Horne
was appointed Minister of Tourism and in light of this and the accountability
of ministers to, and involvement in, the legislature, the ministerial and
legislative functions should not be severed so as to make it an offence under
s. 108 to corruptly pay money to him as a member and no offence to pay
money to him as a minister.

Appellant also contended that if the charge
laid disclosed any offence it was an offence under s. 110(1)(d)(i)
of which he had already been acquitted. The distinction between the offences
was however that the conviction under s. 108(1) (b) related to
bribery and the count under s. 110(1)(d)(i) to “influence
peddling”. In the circumstances there was no overlapping between the
sections or counts so as to make an acquittal under s. 110
inconsistent with the conviction under s. 108. Parliament regarded the
s. 108 offence as the more serious and it would be unlikely that
Parliament intended that that section was to have no application to
bribery of a member of the legislature qua minister of the Crown.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting: It is not an offence under
s. 108(1) (b) to pay a minister of the Crown for use of his
influence. The subsection is aimed only at transactions with holders of
judicial office, members of Parliament and members of provincial legislatures.
Section 110 is concerned with bribery of a minister. The whole intent of the
prosecution was that Van Home, a minister, had been bribed. This was not a case
where the member Van Home was given money to influence the minister Van Home.
The defect was fatal in that the accused was charged with a non-existent
offence and the indictment should be quashed. In the

[Page 138]

circumstances it was not necessary to
consider faults in the trial itself.

[Regina v. Bruneau (1963), 42 C.R. 93;
Martineau v. The Queen, [1966) S.C.R. 103, 48 C.R. 209 referred to.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of a
judge and a jury convicting appellant of an undictable offence under
s. 108(1)(b) of the Code. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and
Spence J. dissenting.

Patrick A. A. Ryan, Q.C., and Jean-Claude
Angers, Q.C., for the appellant.

Eugene Westhaver, J.-Paul Thériault,
Q.C., and Gabriel Lapointe, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)-This is an
appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick pronounced on February 18, 1977. By that judgment, the said Appeal
Division dismissed an appeal by the present appellant from his conviction after
a trial by a judge and jury on March 28, 1975, upon a single count.

The accused, the present appellant, had been
charged originally under an indictment dated November 13, 1974, laid by the
then Attorney General of New Brunswick John B.M. Baxter under the provisions of
s. 507(1)  of the Criminal Code . Mr. Baxter, the then Attorney
General of the Province, had not appeared in court to present the indictment
and the present appellant had succeeded in an application to have the
indictment quashed. Another indictment, dated December 14, 1974, was laid by
the Attorney General of the Province who had succeeded Mr. Baxter, a
Mr. Paul Creaghan. Mr. Creaghan appeared in court personally and
presented the indictment.

The indictment first laid by Mr. Baxter and
the second indictment preferred personally by Mr. Creaghan were in exactly
the same form. I quote the Creaghan indictment in full:

…

When the trial finally proceeded, the jury found
the accused, the present appellant, not guilty on counts Nos. 1 and 3 aforesaid
but guilty on count No. 2, and these reasons are concerned alone with count No.
2.

Amongst the multitude of proceedings taken in
reference to the matters involved in this appeal was a demand for particulars
delivered to the Crown on behalf of the appellant. That demand required the
giving of literally dozens of particulars. One of the demands was known as
Question 14 in reference to count No. 2. A search of the papers has failed to
reveal the actual words of the question but the answer is set out plainly. In
volume 1 at p. 83 of the Appeal Case, the statement made by Crown counsel
at the trial is recited as follows:

C) Question number 14 is answered as
follows: “as Member of the Legislature and Minister of Tourism for the Province
of New Brunswick”. These particulars should be inserted in the middle of line

[Page 141]

9 of Count Number Two, after the words
“official capacity”.

At another point in the proceedings at the
commencement of the trial, the learned trial judge stated:

Having so concluded, I am satisfied that
both parties are in the same position and that the Indictment contains in its
three counts sufficient ingredients to constitute the three offences for which
the accused is charged, namely, the offence of conspiracy, the offence of
bribery and the offence of influence peddling. I do not see at this time where
it would be fitting for me to order further particulars to be included in any
of these three counts of the Indictment.

Again, the learned trial judge stated:

I ought to direct a plea at this time. I
would ask the Clerk to ask the accused on each one of the counts for a plea. I
believe that it would be sufficient to specify count No. 1 as amended,
Mr. Ryan would you agree to that?

to which Mr. Ryan assented and the court
continued:

I think that the counts have been read on
numerous occasions here and the accused is well aware of what they are as
amended. The copies of the amendment have been filed and there is no
confusion there, is there Mr. Ryan?

Mr. Ryan agreed.

(The underlining is my own.)

The clerk said:

With regard to count No. 2, how do you
plead guilty or not guilty?

Mr. Ryan, on behalf of the appellant,
replied:

The accused enters no plea, Your Honour.

THE COURT: I again direct the clerk to
enter on Count No. 2 a plea of not guilty.

It is to be noted that on this count the count
was not read to the accused. On a previous occasion, much earlier in the trial,
the three counts had been read and count No. 2 at that time was in the exact
form I have quoted at the commencement of these reasons. It is, however, quite
apparent from what I have quoted that counsel for the accused was considering a
count with the words added from the

[Page 142]

answer to Question 14 in the demand for
particulars, i.e., with the words “as member of the Legislature and Minister of
Tourism for the Province of New Brunswick” added after the words “J. Charles
Van Horne, in his official capacity”. This is in accord with the provisions of
s. 516 (3) (c) of the Criminal Code .

Eventually, the trial proper commenced. The jury
was chosen and the clerk of the court, in the usual course, required the
members of the jury to look at the accused and listen to the counts of the
indictment which were presented against him, then read those counts and he read
count No. 2 in French in the following words:

2) entre le 15 juin A.D., 1971,
inclusivement et le 31 juillet A.D., 1972, inclusivement, à Campbellton, comté
de Restigouche, province du Nouveau-Brunswick; et ailleurs dans ladite
Province; donné ou offert par corruption à une personne, alors membre de la
Législature de la province du Nouveau-Brunswick, à savoir: J. Charles Van
Horne, de l’argent ou une contrepartie valable à l’égard d’une chose que ledit
J. Charles Van Horne, en sa qualité officielle, comme membre de la
Législature et ministre du Tourisme de la province du Nouveau-Brunswick, a
accomplie ou omise ou à être accomplie ou à être omise pour ledit J. Yvon Arseneau
ou Camille Deschenes ou Jean-Claude Leblanc ou Sugarloaf Park Motels Limited,
au sujet de la construction ou de la location ou de l’achat de terrains ou de
l’exploitation projetés d’un motel par Camille Deschenes ou Sugarloaf Park
Motel Limited dans ou près de Sugarloaf Park dans lequel le gouvernement de la
province du Nouveau-Brunswick avait un intérêt contrairement à l’article
108(1)(b) du code criminel et ses amendements.

(The underlining is my own.)

Amongst the jury chosen to try the case was one
Yvon Jean. It would appear that Mr. Jean was elected foreman of the jury
and he announced the verdict of the jury in the court. A copy of the indictment
in French had been furnished to the jurors and that copy may be perused in the
papers filed upon this appeal. Count No. 2 in that French form of the
indictment is in exactly the same words as count No. 2 read to the jury by the
clerk of the court and which I have recited above. On the French form of the
indictment at the end of count No. 2 appears in handwriting the words

[Page 143]

“Yvon Jean No. 2 Coupable”. It is, therefore, manifestly apparent that the indictment presented
to the jurors as count No. 2 and as to which the accused was found guilty was a
count which recited that the accused did give or offer corruptly to a person a
“Member of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick, to wit, J. Charles
Van Horne, money or a valuable consideration, in respect of anything done or
omitted or to be done or omitted by the said J. Charles Van Horne in his
official capacity as Member of the Legislature and Minister of Tourism for the
Province of New Brunswick”. The charge, by its very terms, purported to be a
charge under s. 108(1)6) of the Criminal Code . That
section provides:

108. (1) Everyone who

…

(b) gives or offers corruptly
to a person who holds a judicial office, or is a member of the Parliament of
Canada or of a legislature, any money, valuable consideration, office, place or
employment in respect of anything done or omitted or to be done or omitted by
him in his official capacity for himself or another person,

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

That charge, for the present circumstances, may
be stated shortly as giving money to a member of a provincial legislature in
respect of anything done or omitted in his official capacity, that is, the
official capacity as a member of the legislature. The charge which this jury
was asked to consider was a charge of giving Van Home money in respect of
something done or omitted in his official capacity as member of the legislature
and Minister of Tourism for the Province of New Brunswick.

I have not read the whole of this evidence but
all the reasons and all the factums deal only and consistently with the
question of whether Van Home, the Minister of the Crown, was bribed and are
quite unconcerned with whether or not Van Home were a member of the
legislature. It was Van Home’s character and capacity as a Minister which
provided the only reason why there should be any attempt to bribe him. Indeed,
in the reasons

[Page 144]

for judgment given by the Appeal Division of the
Province of New Brunswick, there appears this sentence:

In our view, the money transactions between
the Minister, the Appellant and Deschenes, the influence sought by Deschenes
and the alleged bribe disclosed in the letter from the Minister all related to
his official capacity as Minister of Tourism in interference with the
administrative function of the Government. The last ground of appeal does not commend
itself to us.

It would not be an offence under s. 108(1)(b)
to pay a minister of the Crown for use of his influence. The
subsection is aimed only at transactions with holders of judicial office,
members of Parliament, and members of provincial legislatures. Section 110  of
the Criminal Code  is concerned with bribery of a minister. Another
subsection of s. 110  was the subject of count No. 3 upon which the
accused was acquitted. But s. 110 (1)e) is not cited in
count No. 2 and is not related to count No. 2.

In this Court, very considerable argument was
made in reference to Regina v. Bruneau[1],
a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In that case, the accused
was convicted of corruptly agreeing to accept money for the use of his
influence in his official capacity as a member of Parliament in respect of the
sale of certain property to the federal government. The charge was laid under
s. 100(1)(a)(ii) as it then appeared, the counterpart of the
present s. 108(1)(a), and the question was whether a private member
could be convicted of accepting money when it was the function of the executive
and not of a private member to authorize the purchase which the briber sought
to influence. McLennan J.A. said at p. 97:

In this case the corrupt agreement was with
a constituent of the riding for which the appellant was the member of
Parliament; it related to a prospective transaction in land within the
constituency between the Government and the constituent; it was the established
practice of the Government to consult the local member about such transactions
and he was brought into that transaction by the Government by virtue of that
practice. In these circumstances he agreed to accept money for the use of his
influence to bring about the purchase

[Page 145]

by the Government of land belonging to the
person who offered him the money. Although the corrupt agreement was to
interfere with the administrative function of Government, in the final analysis
that function is subject to the will of Parliament of which the appellant was a
member and therefore I am of the opinion that he was acting “in his official
capacity” when he made that agreement.

A similar result was reached by the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council under like circumstances in Attorney General
of Ceylon v. De Livra[2].

There is no such inference in the present case.
The appellant Arseneau was not accused of giving the member of the legislature
Van Horne money so that he might influence the Minister Van Horne to grant the
desired privilege. The whole intent of the prosecution was that the Minister
Van Home had been bribed. I am of the opinion that this is a fatal defect, that
the accused was simply charged with an offence which did not exist and that,
therefore, the appeal must be allowed. It would be purposeless to permit a new
trial upon the same faulty indictment and so I am of the opinion that the
indictment simply should be quashed.

Under these circumstances, it is not necessary
to deal with the several other grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant.
The indictment charging an offence which does not exist makes the trial on the
second count a nullity and, therefore, I need not be concerned with faults in
the trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick dismissing the appeal
of the appellant from his conviction at trial before Judge G. A. Richard of the
County Court sitting with a jury, on the second of three counts in an
indictment preferred against him at the instance of the Attorney General which
count, as will hereafter appear, was amended during the course of the
proceedings.

[Page 146]

The original indictment has been helpfully reproduced
in full in the reasons for judgment of my brother Spence which I have had the
benefit of reading, but, as I have indicated, we are only concerned on this
appeal with count two as the appellant was acquitted by the jury on the other
two counts.

It is desirable in my view, for the sake of
clarity, to set out what I regard as the essential averment in the second count
of the original indictment which alleges that the appellant

…did give or offer corruptly to a person
then a member of the legislature of the Province of New Brunswick, to wit: J.
CHARLES VAN HORNE, money or a valuable consideration, in repect of anything
done or omitted or to be done or omitted by the said J. CHARLES VAN HORNE in
his official capacity, for the said J. YVON ARSENEAU or CAMILLE DES-CHENES or
JEAN CLAUDE LE BLANC or SUGALOAF PARK MOTELS LIMITED, contrary to
section 108(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  of Canada and
amendments thereto.

At all times relevant hereto the appellant was a
lawyer practising in the City of Campbellton in the Province of New Brunswick
where he had been engaged in partnership with Charles Van Horne until the
latter was elected to represent the constituency where they both lived in the
provincial legislature. In due course the local member became Minister of Tourism
in the provincial government and the appellant was retained by that department
to negotiate for the purchase of some land for the establishment of a
provincial park to be known as Sugarloaf Park. While so retained the appellant
had occasion to advise his friend, Camille Deschenes, who was a hotel operator
and real estate dealer in the area, that if he was considering the building of
a motel he might find the park area a desirable site for the purpose, in which
event advantages could probably be obtained for him through the government,
such as a long-term renewable lease and other benefits, including the shifting
of some government construction equipment and material to the proposed site of
the motel. In this connection the appellant indicated to his friend that he
could obtain favours for him from his former partner, but that it would cost
$10,000, including legal fees, to obtain Van

[Page 147]

Horne’s approval of having the motel located in
the park complex.

This proposal was readily accepted by Deschenes
with the result that over a period of months large sums of money were
transferred by Deschenes through the appellant to Vane Horne who was then, as I
have said, a sitting member of legislature for the constituency where both
Arseneau and Deschenes resided, and who was by that time also the Minister of
Tourism. Van Home’s co-operation in this scheme was made manifest by a letter
which he wrote to Deschenes on the notepaper of the Office of the Minister of
Tourism on December 24, 1971, in the following terms:

Further to our plans for a lodge at the
Sugar Loaf Park, this will confirm you will be given first refusal in
connection with the erection and operation of an 80 unit lodge on the park
land, to be arranged on long term lease. This is to permit you to complete your
plans and arrange financing.

It will have been noted that the appellant was
charged with breach of s. 108(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  which
reads as follows:

108. (1)
Every one who…

(b) gives or offers corruptly
to a person who holds a judicial office, or is a member of the Parliament of
Canada or of a legislature, any money, valuable consideration, office, place or
employment in respect of anything done or omitted or to be done or omitted by
him in his official capacity for himself or another person,

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

There can, in my opinion, be little doubt,
having regard to the facts which I have recited, that the appellant offered
money to Van Home, then a member of the legislature of New Brunswick, in
respect of acts to be done by him for the benefit of Camille Deschenes in
furtherance of the latter’s plans to construct a motel in the provincial park.

The proceedings at trial were, however,
characterized by a series of technical and procedural motions made on behalf of
the appellant which included a lengthy demand for particulars of each

[Page 148]

count in the indictment. In the case of the
second count the record discloses that only 13 particulars were sought, but the
answer to the 13th particular read as if it were answering particular No. 14 of
the first count in the indictment. The answer so given was, however, treated by
all concerned as if the indictment had been amended to conform with it in
accordance with s. 516(3) (c) of the Criminal Code  which
reads:

(3) Where a particular is delivered
pursuant to this section,…

(c) the trial shall proceed
in all respects as if the indictment had been amended to conform with the
particular.

The particular in question, which was treated as
if it had effected an amendment to count No. 2, read as follows:

Q. What specifically was the official
capacity of J. Charles Van Horne?

A. Question number 14 is answered as
follows: ‘as Member of the Legislature and Minister of Tourism for the Province
of New Brunswick’. These particulars should be inserted in the middle of line 9
of Count No. Two, after the words ‘official capacity’.

I should have thought that the words “in his
official capacity” as they occur in the original count No. 2 referred to Van
Horne in his “official capacity” as “a Member of the Legislature of the
Province of New Brunswick”, particularly having regard to the fact that the
appellant is charged with having given or corruptly offered money “to a person
then a Member of the Legislature of New Brunswick.”

Accordingly, in my view, the amendment to the
second count does nothing more than add the words “and Minister of Tourism” to
the charge as originally laid so that the count now alleges that the money was
corruptly paid to a member of the Legislature who had also become a minister of
the Crown and who therefore acted in both capacities.

It was, however, contended on behalf of the
appellant that Van Horne was acting throughout the transaction in question in
his “official capacity” as Minister of Tourism and that it would be no offence
under s. 108 to pay money to a member of

[Page 149]

the Legislature in respect of anything done by
him in his official capacity as a minister. This contention appears to me to
involve the proposition that a member of the Legislature who is also a minister
of the Crown is to be taken not to be acting in his official capacity as
a member in respect of the acts and decisions which he makes in the
administration of the department over which he is temporarily presiding.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I am
prepared to proceed on the basis that it was as a member of the Legislature
that Van Horne was appointed to be Minister, of Tourism. This would be in
accord with the generally accepted practice in this country whereby ministers
are accountable to the elected representatives of the people in Parliament or
the Legislature as the case may be, and it is in his capacity as a member of
the Legislature that a cabinet minister participates in the process of securing
legislative authority for the implementation of the policies which he proposed.
In the final analysis, it is as a member and not as a minister that he approves
the expenditures which he may have recommended as a minister. In view of the
above, I am unable to accept the contention of the appellant that Van Horne’s
capacity as a member of the Legislature can be so severed from the functions
which he performs as Minister of Tourism as to make it an offence under
s. 108 to corruptly pay money to him as a member of the Legislature and no
offence to corruptly pay money to the same man in his capacity as minister.

There can be little doubt that many of the
actions with respect to which money was paid to Van Home were administrative in
character and related to his authority as Minister of Tourism, but I do not
think that it can be concluded that he was not also acting as a member of the
Legislature of New Brunswick in relation to the favours which were sought and
given for the construction of a motel by one of his constituents.

The distinction between legislative and
administrative acts by a Member of Parliament is illustrated in the case of Regina
v. Bruneau[3],
where the

[Page 150]

accused was charged with unlawfully and
corruptly agreeing to accept money for the use of his influence with the
government in his official capacity as a Member of Parliament in relation to a
real estate transaction in his constituency, contrary to s. 100(1) (a)(ii)
of the Criminal Code , as it then read.

The defence advanced by the accused was that he
was not acting in his official capacity as a Member of Parliament when he
agreed to accept money for the purpose of influencing the administrative branch
of the government with which, as a Member of Parliament, he had no direct concern.
In the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, Mr. Justice McLennan had occasion to say, at
p. 97:

Although the corrupt agreement was to
interfere with the administrative function of Government, in the final analysis
that function is subject to the will of Parliament of which the appellant was a
member and therefore I am of opinion that he was acting ‘in his official
capacity’ when he made that agreement.

In the same sense I am satisfied that the money
was offered and accepted by Van Horne in the present case in his official
capacity as a member of the Legislature notwithstanding that “the corrupt
agreement was to interfere with the administrative function of Government”.

The appellant also contended that if the charge
laid in count No. 2 disclosed any offence it was an offence against
s. 110(1)(d)(i) which is the offence charged in count No. 3 of
which the appellant had been acquitted. It is thus contended that the record
discloses inconsistent verdicts and the defence of autrefois acquit should
be applied.

The essential averment of the third count is
that the appellant

…having or pretending to have influence
with a minister of the government of the said province, to wit: J CHARLES VAN
HORNE, or an official of the Department of Tourism of the Province of New
Brunswick, did demand, accept or offer or agree to accept for himself or
another person a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for
co-operation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act of omission in
connection

[Page 151]

with the transaction of business with or
any matter of business relating to the government of the Province of New
Brunswick…

It will be seen that the charge in the second
count relates to giving or offering money corruptly to Van Horne, whereas the
third count alleges that the appellant did demand, accept or offer or agree to
accept a reward or advantage of any kind for himself or another person, and I
am satisfied that the words “another person” as used in the context of that
section cannot refer to Charles Van Horne or an official of his
department.

Count No. 2 under s.108(1) (b) relates to
the offence of bribery, whereas count No. 3 under s. 110(1)(d)(i)
is concerned with what is colloquially known as “influence peddling”.

The difference between the two sections is
further accentuated by the fact that a person convicted of the offence of
bribery (s. 108) is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years, whereas one
convicted of influence peddling (s. 110 ) is liable to no more than five years’
imprisonment. It is abundantly clear that Parliament regarded s.108 as creating
the more serious offence and, bearing this in mind, it is indeed unlikely that
Parliament should have at the same time intended that s.108 was to have no
application to bribery of a member of the legislature acting in his official
capacity as a minister of the Crown.

The distinction between the two offences is also
made the subject of the judgment of Fauteux, J., as he then was, speaking for this
Court in Martineau v. The Queen[4], at
p. 218.

With the greatest respect, I can see no
overlapping between the two sections or the two counts so as to make an
acquittal under count No. 3 inconsistent with a conviction under count No. 2.

For all these reasons, as well as for those
expressed in the reasons for judgment of the

[Page 152]

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Public welfare offence—Hunting
for migratory birds in baited area—Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. M-12—The Game and Fish Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 186, s. 88(2)—Migratory
Birds Regulations, SOR/71-376, s. 14.

Mrs. Chapin went duck-hunting on the
Balmoral marsh, on property belonging to the Balmoral Hunt Club of which her
husband was part-owner. She was accompanied by a friend and they were talking a
lot as they walked through the marsh. They walked along a dyke road and then
along some “duck-boards”, five or six inches in width, placed over the water
and leading to the blind from which the respondent intended to shoot. Some
time, and two ducks, later, Mrs. Chapin was arrested by a conservation
officer. The officer had been in the area, had heard shots and had
investigated. On his way through the marsh, he came upon “a small pile of soy
beans, weed seeds and wheat”, in the middle of the dyke road and at the edge of
the pond, some fifty yards from the respondent’s blind. It was generally
accepted that Mrs. Chapin did not know the grain was there until it had
been pointed out to her. Section 14(1) of the Migratory Birds
Regulations makes it unlawful to hunt for migratory birds within
one-quarter mile of a place where bait has been laid.

The charge was dismissed by the justice of
the peace, who concluded that the offence was one which permitted a defence of
reasonable mistake of fact. He found that Mrs. Chapin believed, on
reasonable grounds, in a state of facts (that no bait was there), which if true
made her act (hunting), an innocent one. The county court judge allowed the
crown appeal on the basis that the offence was one of absolute liability. The Court
of Appeal for Ontario reversed,
on the ground that mens rea is an ingredient of the offence charged.

[Page 122]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The offence created by s. 14(1) of the
Regulations cannot be characterized as a “crime in the true sense”. The Migratory
Birds Convention Act is a regulatory statute enacted for the general
welfare of the Canadian public and its wildlife. Section 14(1) creates a
“public welfare offence” and it is not subject to the presumption of full mens
rea.

Following the Sault Ste. Marie case,
[1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, public welfare offences would prima facie fall in
the category of strict liability. Hunting of migratory birds is not prohibited,
but controlled. While the offence is summary conviction in nature, serious consequences
follow from conviction, including loss of hunting privileges, forfeiture of
guns and equipment and fines and potential imprisonment. The public interest,
as expressed in the Convention, does not require that s. 14 of the Regulations
be interpreted so that an innocent person should be convicted without fault.
Hunting being a permitted sport, it would be a practical impossibility for a
hunter to search a circular area having a diameter of half a mile for the
presence of illegally deposited bait, before hunting. This view of subs. (1) of
s. 14 is reinforced by a consideration of subs. (4), which provides for legal
baiting and posting of notices of legal baiting. Parliament could not have
intended to afford a person hunting within a quarter mile of an illegally
baited area any less protection than that afforded in relation to a legally
baited area. The offence is therefore not one of absolute liability.

The offence created by s. 14(1) is one of
strict liability, a classic example of the second category delineated in the Sault
Ste. Marie case. An accused may absolve himself on proof that he took all
the care which a reasonable man might have been expected to take in all the
circumstances or, in other words, that he was in no way negligent.

On all of the evidence, it would have been
unreasonable to convict the respondent and therefore a new trial ought not be
directed.

The
Facts

DICKSON J.—Mrs. Loise Chapin went duck
hunting in the Balmoral marsh, near Chatham, one windy afternoon in mid-October, 1976. She was accompanied by a
friend whom she had not seen for some time. As they walked through the marsh
they were, she testified, talking a lot, and not paying attention to anything
but the beautiful day. They reached a dyke road, walked along it a short
distance, then along some “duck boards”, five or six inches in width, placed
over water and leading to a duck blind from which Mrs. Chapin intended to
shoot.

Some time, and two ducks, later,
Mrs. Chapin was arrested by a conservation officer of the Ontario Ministry
of Natural Resources. He had been in the area and heard shots. Leaving his car
he proceeded on foot through two gates, down through a small canal gully, over
scrub land, across a corn field, and finally arrived at a road leading to a
small pond. The road, over which Mrs. Chapin and her friend has passed earlier,
was approximately 12 feet in width, and composed of a mixture of mud and
gravel. As the conservation officer approached the pond he observed, in the
centre of the road, and about ten feet from the water’s edge, a small pile of
soy beans, weed seeds and wheat, like the gleanings from a harvesting operation
on a farm. The officer said that he was practically on top of the pile before
he noticed it. It was a small pile, about a foot to a foot and a half in
length, three inches wide and approximately two inches in depth. The blind from
which Mrs. Chapin had been shooting was located some distance out from the
edge of the pond and about 50

[Page 124]

yards from the pile. The officer also noted
grain in the water on either side of the board walk.

Mrs. Chapin testified that she was unaware
of the presence of the grain. It was a very windy day and many things were
flying around the marsh. When she walked along the duck boards, in hip waders
and carrying a gun, her sole concern was to avoid falling into the water. It
seems to be generally accepted that Mrs. Chapin did not know that the
grain was there until it was pointed out to her by the conservation officer.
Even then she did not know what it was. She was shooting on private property
belonging to the Balmoral Hunt Club, of which her husband was part owner.
During the trial there was vague reference by defence counsel to “spite
baiting” but no evidence adduced to indicate by whom or in what circumstances
the grain had been deposited.

The
Migratory Birds Regulations

Now, it is unlawful to hunt for migratory birds
within one-quarter mile of a place where bait has been deposited.
Section 14 of the Migratory Birds Regulations, SOR/71-376, as
amended, reads:

14. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no
person shall hunt for migratory game birds within one-quarter mile of any place
where bait has been deposited.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a
place where bait has been deposited, if

(a) a game officer inspects that
place and declares that it is clear of bait, and

(b) seven days have elapsed since
the inspection referred to in paragraph (a).

(3) Where bait is deposited in a place
after an inspection referred to in subsection (2), that
subsection ceases to apply to that place for the remainder of the open
season.

(4) No person shall deposit bait in any
place during the period commencing seven days before the open season applicable
in that place and ending on the day immediately following the last day of the
open season in that place unless that person, at least thirty days prior to
placing the bait,

(a) obtains the consent in writing
of

[Page 125]

(i) every landowner and every lessee or
tenant whose land is located within one-quarter mile of that place, and

(ii) the Director and the Chief Game
officer of a province, and

(b) posts in that place signs of a
type and wording satisfactory to, and in a location designated by, the
Director.

(5) A consent obtained pursuant to
paragraph (4)(a) is valid in respect of the open season in respect of which it
was obtained.

(6) Subsection (4) does not apply to
the holder of a permit referred to in section 19 or 20 who places bait

(a) in a confined area specified in
his permit, or

(b) at a distance of not less than
one-quarter mile from an area where the hunting of migratory birds is permitted

for the sole purpose of feeding migratory
birds lawfully in his possession.

(7) For the purpose of subsection (I),
any area

(a) of standing crops, whether
flooded or not,

(b) of harvested crop land that is
flooded,

(c) where crops are properly shocked
in the field where they grow, or

(d) where grain is scattered solely
as a result of normal agricultural or harvesting operations

shall not be regarded as a place where bait
has been deposited.

Section 12(1) of the Migratory Birds
Convention Act R.S.C. 1970, c. M-12 provides:

12. (1) Every person who violates this Act
or any regulation is, for each offence, liable upon summary conviction to a
fine of not more than three hundred dollars and not less than ten dollars, or
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both fine and
imprisonment.

The
Judicial History of the Case

Mrs. Chapin was charged with contravening
s. 14(1) of the Regulations and appeared before Justice of the Peace Robert
Walker, who dismissed the charge. After considering the penalty, possible
damage to the public, and type of offence, he held that s. 14(1) of the Migratory
Birds Regulations was not a mens rea offence. On the authority of
the Ontario Divisional Court
judgment in R. v.

[Page 126]

Hickey[1] the justice
concluded that a s. 14(1) offence is an offence leaving open the defence of
reasonable mistake of fact. After reviewing all the evidence, he found that
Mrs. Chapin believed, on reasonable grounds, in a state of facts (that no
bait was there), which if true made her act (hunting), an innocent one.

The Crown appealed. Judge Beardall of the
Country Court of the County of
Kent allowed the appeal. He held that s. 14(1) of the Migratory Birds
Regulations created an offence of absolute liability and hence no mens
rea need be proven. He also concluded that R. v. Hickey, supra, was
not applicable. He was of the view that the defence of honest mistake was not
available to Mrs. Chapin. After referring to Hickey, and the
evidence in that case of a faulty speedometer on a charge of speeding, he said:

In this case there is no such evidence,
and, no corroborative evidence of any kind, to establish that Mrs. Chapin
was led astray by anything, said or observed, into believing that the pond was
not baited. She might have been careless in not asking to find out, but nobody
told her—or there is no evidence that anyone told her—that the pond was not
baited; that she had a right to rely on some other express evidence merely from
the fact that she didn’t observe and didn’t know.

With respect this passage contains two errors in
law (i) in the assumption that corroborative evidence is necessary and (ii) in
placing upon Mrs. Chapin the onus of establishing that she had been misled
into believing that the pond was not baited. The judge imposed a standard based
upon the premise that other people would act illegally.

Mrs. Chapin appealed, and the Court of
Appeal for Ontario allowed her
appeal, Houlden J.A. dissenting. Mr. Justice Weatherston, with whom
Mr. Justice Brooke concurred, dealt first with the argument that the
accused was entitled to be acquitted if she honestly and reasonably believed in
a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render her act an innocent one.
He said:

[Page 127]

Whether or not it is the law of this
country, it requires an affirmative finding of fact by the trial judge that the
accused was honestly mistaken on reasonable grounds.

He then quoted the passage from the judgment of
Judge Beardall which I have set out above, and said:

Since he made no affirmative finding of
fact in favour of the accused, we are unable to dispose of this appeal on the
basis of this defence, assuming it was available to her.

Mr. Justice Weatherston disposed of the
case in favour of Mrs. Chapin. He held that mens rea was an
ingredient of the offence charged. As the trial judge had not rejected
Mrs. Chapin’s evidence that she did not know of the presence of the bait,
the majority concluded that she was entitled to be acquitted. Mr. Justice
Houlden did not think that the offence was one requiring mens rea, nor
did he consider the mistake of Mrs. Chapin to have been a reasonable one.

The case has now, by leave, reached this Court.
There are two preliminary observations. First, the judicial history of the
case, all before the judgment of this Court in R. v. Sault Ste. Marie[2], provides an interesting example of the
courts attempting to come to grips with the classic sort of regulatory offence.
The three courts which have dealt with the matter to date have characterized
the offence in three different ways. Justice of the Peace Walker treated it as an offence of strict
liability to which the accused could plead that she committed the offence under
an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Judge Beardall considered it to be
one of absolute liability. The Court of Appeal majority regarded it as a mens
rea offence, while Mr. Justice Houlden regarded it as one of absolute
liability.

In Sault Ste. Marie at pp. 1325-1326 this
Court recognized three categories of offences, according to the mental element
requisite for conviction, rather than the traditional two:

[Page 128]

1. Mens rea offences in which some
positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness must be
proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act
committed or by additional evidence.

2. Strict liability offences in which there
is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of mens rea; the
doing of the prohibited act prima facie imports the offence, leaving it
open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable
care. This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done in
the circumstances. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably
believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or
omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular
event.

3. Absolute liability offences where it is
not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of
fault.

In further explanation the following passage
appears in the judgment at p. 1326.

Offences which are criminal in the true
sense fall in the first category. Public welfare offences would prima facie be
in the second category. They are not subject to the presumption of full mens
rea. An offence of this type would fall in the first category only if such
words as “wilfully”, “with intent”, “knowingly” or “intentionally” are
contained in the statutory provision creating the offence. On the other hand,
the principle that punishment should in general not be inflicted on those
without fault applies. Offences of absolute liability would be those in respect
of which the Legislature had made it clear that guilt would follow proof merely
of the proscribed act. The overall regulatory pattern adopted by the Legislature,
the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty and the
precision of the language used will be primary considerations in determining
whether the offence falls into the third category.

The Crown argues that the offence is one of
absolute liability or in the alternative, strict liability. The respondent
contends that it is one requiring full mens rea or, if not, a strict
liability offence.

[Page 129]

Not a “mens
rea” Offence

One would be hard pressed to characterize the
offence created by s. 14(1) of the Migratory Birds Regulations as a
“crime in the true sense”. Violation is punishable upon summary conviction and
not indictment. One must note the absence of the usual signals connoting mens
rea such as “wilfully” or “with intent”. In contrast, to take an example,
s. 10 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act commences “Any person who
wilfully refuses to furnish information or wilfully furnishes false information
to a game officer…”.

The Migratory Birds Convention Act is a
regulatory statute enacted by the Parliament of Canada for the general welfare
of the Canadian public, not to mention the welfare of the ducks. The purpose of
the legislation is expressed in the preamble to the Migratory Birds
Convention, which has been sanctioned, ratified and confirmed by s. 2 of
the Act, and which reads in part as follows:

Whereas many species of birds in the course
of their annual migrations traverse certain parts of the Dominion of Canada and
the United States; and

Whereas many of these species are of great
value as a source of food or in destroying insects which are injurious to
forests and forage plants on the public domain, as well as to agricultural
crops, in both Canada and the United States, but are nevertheless in danger of
extermination through lack of adequate protection during the nesting season or
while on their way to and from their breeding grounds;

His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the seas,
Emperor of India, and the United States of America, being desirous of saving
from indiscriminate slaughter and of insuring the preservation of such
migratory birds as are either useful to man or are harmless, have resolved to
adopt some uniform system of protection which shall effectively accomplish such
objects.

[Page 130]

Article I of the Convention, attached as a
Schedule to the Act, describes the migratory game birds included in the terms
of the Convention. Article II provides for close seasons “during which no
hunting shall be done except for scientific or propagating purposes under
permits issued by proper authorities”. Article III provides for a continuous
close season on certain migratory game birds. Article IV provides for special
protection to be given the wood duck and the eider duck. Article V provides for
the prohibition of the taking of nests or eggs, and Article VI for the
prohibition of the shipment or export of migratory birds or their eggs during
the continuance of the close season. Finally, Article VII provides for the
issuance of permits to kill migratory birds which, under extraordinary
conditions, may become seriously injurious to the agricultural or other
interests in any particular community.

The Migratory Birds Convention Act authorizes
the making of Migratory Birds Regulations for the purpose of effecting
the public welfare goals of the Migratory Birds Convention. Section 4
of the Act provides in part:

4. (1) The Governor in Council may make
such regulations as are deemed expedient to protect the migratory game,
migratory insectivorous and migratory nongame birds that inhabit Canada during
the whole or any part of the year.

(2) Subject to the provisions of the
Convention, the regulations may provide,

(b) for limiting the number of
migratory game birds that may be taken by a person in any specified time during
the season when the taking of such birds is legal, and providing the manner in
which such birds may then be taken and the appliances that may be used
therefor;

It seems clear that the offence of hunting for
migratory game birds within one quarter mile of any place where bait has been
deposited contrary to s. 14(1) of the Migratory Birds Regulations and s.
12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, is legislation designed to
protect migratory birds from indiscriminate slaughter for the general welfare
of the public. It seems equally clear that s.

[Page 131]

14(1) of the Migratory Birds Regulations creates
a public welfare offence which is not criminal in the true sense and it is
therefore not subject to the presumption of full mens rea. Section 14(1)
is thus not creating a new crime, but in the public interest is prohibiting an
act under a penalty: Sherras v. De Rutzen.[3]

Not an
Absolute Liability Offence

The language of the offence is straightforward,
“No person shall…”. Yet there is not a strict prohibition on hunting, rather a
hunt controlled within certain limits as to season, methods, and types and
numbers of species taken. Nor can one ignore the controls on shipment and
export of game, nor the stricter controls in certain prescribed geographic
areas “for the control and management of such area”.

Accepting that this is a public welfare or
regulatory offence, neither party mentions the approach taken by this Court in Sault
Ste. Marie that “public welfare offences would prima facie be in the
second category” of strict liability. The Crown merely lists the factors
suggested as relevant in Sault Ste. Marie, viz. the overall regulatory
pattern, the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty,
the precision of the language, in order to move the offence out of the second
category and into the third.

The Crown suggests that “the summary conviction
nature of the penalty” should carry some weight. Summary conviction it may be,
but one could hardly term the penalties minimal. Rather than a “small monetary
fine” alone, we find a number of serious consequences upon conviction.
Section 12(1) of the Act lays down a minimum fine of $10 and a maximum
fine of $300, or up to

[Page 132]

six months’ imprisonment, or both. (The County
Court Judge imposed a fine of $100 in this case.) Other serious consequences
ensue. Section 22(1) provides for a mandatory prohibition upon conviction
of either holding or applying for a migratory game bird hunting permit for a
period of one year from date of conviction. Further, as the respondent points
out, the Court may under s. 88(2) of The Game and Fish Act, R.S.O. 1970,
c. 186, cancel “any licence to hunt”—not just a game bird licence—and may
further order no obtaining of, or application for, a hunting licence “during
the period stated in the order”. Nor is that all. The most serious potential
consequence comes in s. 7 of the Migratory Birds Act itself, permitting
the Justice of the Peace to make an order of forfeiture of the gun and any
other equipment used in violation of the Act or Regulations. While the
respondent employs these penalties in support of her full mens rea position,
they certainly support the prima facie classification of strict
liability.

The best the Crown can do to shift this offence
into the category of absolute liability is to suggest that the availability of
a defence of reasonable care would considerably weaken the enforcement of the
legislation. This may be true, but as Weatherston J.A. observed, the problems
that may be encountered in the administration of a statute or regulation are a
very unsure guide to its proper interpretation. Difficulty of enforcement is
hardly enough to dislodge the offence from the category of strict liability,
particularly when regard is had to the penalties that may ensue from
conviction. I do not think that the public interest, as expressed in the
Convention, requires that s. 14 of the Regulations be interpreted so that an
innocent person should be convicted and fined and also suffer the mandatory
loss of his hunting permit and the possible forfeiture of his hunting
equipment, merely in order to facilitate prosecution.

[Page 133]

The Crown contends that a person found hunting
within one-quarter mile of a place where bait is deposited is guilty of an
offence, to which no defence is available. On the Crown’s submission, proof of
making all reasonable efforts to ascertain the presence of the bait
would be unavailing, as would proof of all possible efforts. This, in my
view, is an untenable position. Hunting being a permitted sport, it would be a
practical impossibility for a hunter to search a circular area having a
diameter of half a mile for the presence of illegally deposited bait, before
hunting. One must bear in mind the nature of the terrain over which hunting is
done, as the evidence in this case discloses, and the fact that many hunters
hope to get into position before first light. Is one first expected to search
through swamp, bog, creeks, corn fields, over land and in water in search of
illegal bait?

The case of R. v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.[4], was cited, but I do not believe that it
assists the Crown. In that case care had not been taken to acquire knowledge of
the facts constituting the offence. Ritchie J. said that it would not have been
a difficult matter for some officer or responsible person of the accused
company to acquire knowledge of the undersize lobsters and failure to acquire
that knowledge did not afford a defence. Nor does the decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Hickey[5] assist,
having regard to the many differences between the Ontario Highway Traffic
Act and the legislation here under consideration.

In my view, sub. (1) and (4) of s. 14 of the
Regulations must be read together. Together they speak of legal baiting, the
obtaining of written consents and the posting of signs to give notice of the
presence of bait. Anyone who hunts within such a posted area may be more
readily taken to be knowingly or recklessly in breach of the Regulations. The Regulations
do not seek to impose an absolute obligation upon a hunter who innocently hunts
in an unposted area within one quarter mile

[Page 134]

of bait which has been placed illegally by a
person unknown. Parliament could not have intended to afford a person hunting
within a quarter mile of an illegally baited area any less protection than that
afforded a person hunting within a quarter mile of a legally baited area.
Otherwise, as counsel for Mrs. Chapin argued, an activity which is legal
is rendered illegal by the illegal act of someone over whom the accused has no
control. We should not assume that punishment is to be imposed without fault.

These considerations incline me to the view that
the offence here under study is not one of absolute liability.

Strict
Liability Offence

In my view the offence created by s. 14(1) is
one of strict liability. It is a classic example of an offence in the second
category delineated in the Sault Ste. Marie case. An accused may absolve
himself on proof that he took all the care which a reasonable man might have
been expected to take in all the circumstances or, in other words, that he was
in no way negligent.

Conclusion

It remains to consider whether to dispose of the
case in this Court or send it back for a new trial. The respondent has to date
been subjected to two trials and two appeals. She lost her hunting privileges
from April to November, 1977. Her gun was seized and held under seizure for
some time.

The following evidence is undisputed. The
hunting was done at a private club, of which the husband of the respondent was
part owner and to which she had been going for some eight years. The club had a
permit from the Canadian Wildlife Service to bait at the proper season, but the
club had never baited ponds. The respondent played no part in the management of
the marsh. The day was windy with matter of all kinds flying about. The pile of
grain was not large. It looked like a gleaning after harvesting. It lay on a
mud and gravel road. Mrs. Chapin had no reason to be looking

[Page 135]

down. The conservation officer did not notice
the grain until he was practically on top of it. The other grain was in the
water on either side of a narrow duck walk which Mrs. Chapin had to
navigate to get to the blind. There were no signs indicating that this was a
baited area.

After careful reading of all the evidence, I
have arrived at the conclusion reached by this Court in Thibodeau v. R.[6], namely, that on the evidence in the record
it would have been unreasonable to convict the respondent and that we ought not
to direct a new trial.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal. Pursuant
to the terms under which leave to appeal was granted, the respondent is
entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis.

Appeal dismissed, costs on a solicitor and client basis
pursuant to the terms of leave.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appellant found guilty of theft
by trial judge—Absolute discharge set aside on appeal to Court of Appeal—Right
of Attorney General to appeal against direction for absolute discharge—Criminal
Code , ss. 601 , 605(1) , 662.1(1) , (3) .

The appellant was found guilty of the theft
of money exceeding $200 by a judge of the County Court of Vancouver. The trial
judge granted to the appellant an absolute discharge pursuant to the provisions
of subs. 662.1(1) of the Criminal Code .

The respondent applied to the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia for leave
to appeal against the sentence of absolute discharge. Leave was granted, the
appeal was allowed, the direction for an absolute discharge was set aside and a
sentence of imprisonment for one year was imposed. From that judgment, with
leave, the present appeal was brought.

Subsection (3) of s. 662.1 contains
provisions for an appeal by the accused or by the Attorney General from a
direction made under subs. 662.1(1). Paragraph 605(1) (a), referred
to in para, (a.1) of subs. 662.1(3), gives to the Attorney
General a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against a judgment or verdict
of acquittal on any ground of appeal involving a question of law alone.

The appellant submitted that para. (a.1)
of subs. 662.1 (3) provides the only right of appeal given to the Attorney
General from a direction for an absolute discharge. That right of appeal is
limited, by the reference to para. 605(1) (a), to an appeal
on a question of law alone. As the appeal by the Attorney General to the Court
of Appeal in the present case was an appeal only as against sentence, and did
not involve any question of law, the Court of Appeal did not have the power to
entertain it.

The respondent contended that the right of
appeal given to the Attorney General by para (a.1) is not
exclusive and that, in addition to that right of appeal, the Attorney General
can, with leave, appeal against a direction for absolute discharge, as a matter
of sentence.

[Page 74]

Paragraph (b) of subs. 605(1)
states that the Attorney General, or counsel instructed by him for the purpose,
may appeal to the Court of Appeal “with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge
thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in proceedings by
indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law”. The word “sentence” as
defined in s. 601  includes a disposition made under subs. 662.1(1). The
definition of “sentence” in s. 601  applies to Part XVIII of the Criminal
Code , in which part para. (b) of subs. 605(1) is found.
Consequently, when that paragraph gives to the Attorney General the right, with
leave, to appeal against sentence, it confers a right to appeal, with leave,
against a disposition made under subs. 662.1(1).

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Court agreed with the submission of the
respondent.

The right of the Attorney General, under
para. 605(1) (b), to appeal against sentence arises in
respect of an accused who has been sentenced in proceedings by indictment. In
the absence of special legislative provision, the right of appeal against
sentence in relation to a direction made under subs. 662.1(1) would not exist
since a discharge could hardly be regarded as a sentence. However, this
difficulty was met by amending the meaning of “sentence” in s. 601  so as
to include within that definition a disposition made under subs. 662.1(1). That
amendment enabled the Attorney General, with leave, to appeal against a
direction under subs. 662.1(1), by resorting to para. 605(1) (b)
because it would be appealing against “the sentence passed by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment”, and so would be squarely within the paragraph.

Unless the amendment of the definition of the
word “sentence” had that effect, it would be redundant and meaningless.
Parliament introduced that amendment in the same statute which created the
right to direct an absolute or conditional discharge. It was repeated in the
same statute which revised the form of subs. 662.1(3). It was obvious that its
purpose was to maintain a right of appeal against a direction for an absolute
or conditional discharge as a matter of sentence and effect should be given to
that purpose. Otherwise, there would be the anomalous situation that if., in
the present case, a minimal sentence of imprisonment had been imposed, the
Attorney General could seek leave to appeal against it if he considered the
punishment inadequate, but because no punishment at all was imposed, no appeal
would be possible.

[Page 75]

Miles v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 195, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia allowing an appeal by the Crown against the granting of an
absolute discharge to the appellant following his being found guilty of the
theft of money exceeding $200. Appeal dismissed.

Peter C.P. Thompson, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant was found guilty of
the theft of money exceeding $200 by a judge of the County Court of Vancouver.
The trial judge granted to the appellant an absolute discharge pursuant to the
provisions of subs. 662.1(1) of the Criminal Code .

The respondent applied to the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia for leave
to appeal against the sentence of absolute discharge. Leave was granted, the
appeal was allowed, the direction for an absolute discharge was set aside and a
sentence of imprisonment for one year was imposed. From that judgment, with
leave, the present appeal is brought.

The provision for an absolute discharge, after a
finding of guilt, is contained in subs. 662.1(1) of the Criminal Code , which
provides as follows:

662.1(1) Where an accused, other than a
corporation, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an
offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence
punishable, in the proceedings commenced against him, by imprisonment for
fourteen years or for life, the court before which he appears may, if it
considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the
public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the
accused be discharged absolutely or upon the conditions prescribed in a
probation order.

Subsection (3) of s. 662.1 contains
provisions for an appeal by the accused or by the Attorney General from a
direction made under subs. 662.1(1). They are as follows:

[Page 76]

(3) Where a court directs under
subsection (1) that an accused be discharged the accused shall be deemed
not to have been convicted of the offence to which he pleaded guilty or of
which he was found guilty and to which the discharge relates except that

(a) the accused may appeal
from the direction that the accused be discharged as if that direction were a
conviction in respect of the offence to which the discharge relates;

(a.1) the Attorney General
may appeal from the direction that the accused be discharged, as if that
direction were a judgment or verdict of acquittal referred to in paragraph
605(1) (a);

Paragraph 605(1) (a), referred to in
para. (a.1) above, gives to the Attorney General a right of appeal
to the court of appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal on any ground
of appeal involving a question of law alone. It reads as follows:

605(1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any
ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone.

The submission of the appellant is that
para. (a.1) of subs. 662.1(3) provides the only right of appeal
given to the Attorney General from a direction for an absolute discharge. That
right of appeal is limited, by the reference to para. 605(1) (a), to
an appeal on a question of law alone. As the appeal by the Attorney General to
the Court of Appeal in the present case was an appeal only as against sentence,
and did not involve any question of law, the Court of Appeal did not have the
power. to entertain it.

The contention of the respondent is that the
right of appeal given to the Attorney General by para. (a.1) is
not exclusive and that, in addition to that right of appeal, the Attorney
General can, with leave, appeal against a direction for absolute discharge, as
a matter of sentence.

Paragraph (b) of subs. 605(1)
states that the Attorney General, or counsel instructed by him for the purpose,
may appeal to the court of appeal:

[Page 77]

(b) with leave of the court
of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

The respondent refers to s. 601  of the Criminal
Code  which defines the word “sentence” as follows:

“sentence” includes a declaration made
under subsection 181(3), an order made under subsection 98(1) or (2),
subsection 178.21(1) or 218(6), section 653, 654 or 655 and a
disposition made under subsection 234(2), 236(2) , 662.1(1) , 663(1)  or
664(3)  or (4) ;

This definition applies to Part XVIII of the Criminal
Code , in which Part para. (b) subs. 605(1) is found.
Consequently, when that paragraph gives to the Attorney General the right, with
leave, to appeal against sentence, it confers a right to appeal, with leave,
against a disposition made under subs. 662.1(1).

It should be mentioned that the definition of
the word “sentence” in Part XXIV, dealing with summary convictions, in subs.
720(1) also includes a disposition made under subs. 662.1(1), and that
para. 748(b)(ii) gives the Attorney General a right of appeal
against sentence.

I agree with the submission of the respondent.

The provisions of the Criminal Code  providing
for absolute or conditional discharges, in certain circumstances, are contained
in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1972, 1972 (Can.), c. 13, in
s. 57, which introduced s. 662.1  into the Code. At the same
time, s. 52  was enacted which repealed the definition of “sentence” in
s. 601 of the Code and replaced it with a new definition which
included a disposition made under subs. 662.1(1).

Subsection (3) of s. 662.1, as originally
enacted, read as follows:

3. Where a court directs under
subsection (1) that an accused be discharged, the accused shall be deemed
not to have been convicted of the offence to which he pleads

[Page 78]

guilty or of which he was found guilty and to
which the discharge relates except that

(a) the accused or the
Attorney General may appeal from the direction that the accused be discharged
as if that direction were a conviction in respect of the offence to which the
discharge relates or, in the case of an appeal by the Attorney General, a
finding that the accused was not guilty of that offence; and

The definition of “sentence” was repealed and a
new definition substituted by 1973-74 (Can.), c. 38, s. 6.1 and again
by c. 50, s. 3, but in each case the reference to “a disposition made
under subsection 662.1(1) ” remained unchanged.

The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76
(Can.), c. 93, repealed para. 662.1(3)(a) (cited above) and
substituted instead paras, (a) and (a.1), already
quoted. Again, in this statute, the definition of “sentence” was repealed and a
new one substituted, but the reference to a disposition made under subs.
662.1(1) remained the same.

Counsel for the appellant suggested that the
changes made in subs. 662.1(3) supported his contention that it was intended
that the only appeal permitted to the Attorney General from a direction for an
absolute discharge made under subs. 662.1(1) was on a question of law. I do not
accept this contention. In my opinion the change in subs. (3) was made for
purposes of clarity.

The earlier provision as to an appeal by the
accused was not altered, but was dealt with separately in the new paragraph (a).
The former provision, dealing with the right of appeal of the Attorney
General, referred to an appeal from the direction as if the direction were “a
finding that the accused was not guilty of that offence”.

Paragraph 605(1) (a) provides for
an appeal by the Attorney General against a judgment or verdict of acquittal.
No appeal is provided from a “finding” and the words “finding that the accused
was not guilty of that offence” are not appropriate when it is remembered that
subs. 662.1(1) only comes into operation after an accused has pleaded guilty or
has been found guilty of an offence. The

[Page 79]

words used were inapt and, accordingly,
para. (a.1) was enacted giving a right of appeal “as if that
direction were a judgment or verdict of acquittal referred to in paragraph
605(1) (a)”.

Subsection 605(1)  gives to the Attorney
General, in respect of indictable offences, two rights of appeal. If the
accused has been acquitted, there is a right to appeal from the acquittal on a
question of law. If the accused has been convicted, there is a right of appeal,
with leave, in respect of the sentence imposed.

The provision respecting the direction for an
absolute or conditional discharge in subs. 662.1(1) created a somewhat
anomalous situation. The accused had pleaded guilty or been found guilty but,
nonetheless, he was “deemed not to have been convicted of the offence”. In the
result, as he had not been convicted, there was no right of appeal from
conviction for the accused. As he had not been acquitted, there was no right of
appeal for the Attorney General of the kind provided for in para. 605(1) (a).

That difficulty has been met in the present
subsection 662.1(3)  by enabling the accused, under para, (a), to
appeal, as if he had been convicted and by enabling the Attorney General to
appeal as if the accused had been acquitted.

Subsection (3) is not concerned with
appeals from a direction made under subs. 662.1(3) when considered as a matter
of sentence. The word “sentence” does not appear in the subsection. It is
designed to enable the accused to appeal against the finding of guilt. It is
designed to enable the Attorney General to contest, on the merits, the making
of the direction. The occasions when it might be used are obviously limited,
but it is conceivable that the Attorney General might seek to contest, as a
matter of law, the right of the court to invoke the section. It is also
possible, in a case where the accused has been found guilty of an included
offence that the Attorney General might contend that, in law, he ought to have
been found guilty of the major offence.

[Page 80]

Subsection 662.1(1)  also created difficulty
in relation to the right of the Attorney General to appeal from a direction for
an absolute or conditional discharge when considered as a matter of punishment.
The right of the Attorney General, under para. 605(1) (b), to appeal
against sentence arises in respect of an accused who has been sentenced in
proceedings by indictment. In the absence of special legislative provision, the
right of appeal against sentence in relation to a direction made under subs.
662.1(1) would not exist since a discharge can hardly be regarded as a
sentence. However, this difficulty was met by amending the meaning of
“sentence” in s. 601  so as to include within that definition a disposition
made under subs. 662.1(1). That amendment enabled the Attorney General, with
leave, to appeal against a direction under subs. 662.1(1), by resorting to
para. 605(1) (b) because it would be appealing against “the
sentence passed by a trial court in proceedings by indictment”, and so would be
squarely within the paragraph.

Unless the amendment of the definition of the
word “sentence” had that effect, it would be redundant and meaningless.
Parliament introduced that amendment in the same statute which created the
right to direct an absolute or conditional discharge. It was repeated in the
same statute which revised the form of subs. 662.1(3). It seems obvious to me
that its purpose was to maintain a right of appeal against a direction for an
absolute or conditional discharge as a matter of sentence and, in my opinion,
effect should be given to that purpose. Otherwise, we would have the anomalous
situation that if, in the present case, a minimal sentence of imprisonment had
been imposed, the Attorney General could seek leave to appeal against it if he
considered the punishment inadequate, but because no punishment at all is
imposed, no appeal would be possible.

Reference was made in argument to the judgment
of this Court in Miles v. The Queen[1].
In that case, which dealt with the effect of subs. 662.1(3)

[Page 81]

as it stood before the amendment made by the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1975, it was held that the Attorney General could appeal
from a direction under subs. 662.1(1) as a matter of sentence by reason of the
combined effect of the amendment of the definition of the word “sentence” in
s. 601  and the right of appeal from sentence given by para. 605(1) (b).
The contention of the appellant that, because of the enactment of
para. 662.1(3) (a), an appeal from a direction for an absolute
discharge by the Attorney General was limited to the right conferred by
para. 605(1) (a) was rejected.

The wording of subs. 662.1(3) has been changed,
and so the interpretation, in Miles, of the meaning of para. (a)
of that subsection as it then stood is no longer applicable, but the
definition of “sentence” has not been altered, nor have the provisions of
para. 605(1) (b). For the reasons which I have outlined, it
is my view that the amendment of subs. 662.1(3) does not operate so as to take
away the right of appeal of the Attorney General which was then found to exist.

For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

 The facts 
This is a straightforward case, the facts of which were as follows. The appellant, a former employee of the Housing and Development Board (`HDB`), was dismissed by the HDB on 2 February 1996. Being unhappy with his dismissal, he wrote a number of letters appealing to the HDB. However, his appeals were all rejected. The appellant was under the impression that his dismissal was the result of a conspiracy within the management of the HDB.
On 8 March 2000, which was about four years after his dismissal, the appellant went to the HDB Centre at Bukit Merah Central (`the premises`) to look for the CEO of the HDB, so as to ascertain the truth behind his dismissal. As he was unable to gain entry, the appellant waited at the exit door to Tower A of the premises. At around 4.30pm, one of the HDB staff opened the exit door from the inside so as to leave the premises, and this afforded the appellant the opportunity to slip inside.
The appellant initially went up to the 27th floor to look for the CEO of the HDB. Upon discovering that the CEO was not around, the appellant decided to make his way downstairs to the 25th floor, where the office of the head of the Human Resource department, one Goh Sin Tok, was located. The appellant intended to confront Goh Sin Tok, whom the appellant believed to have been involved in the alleged conspiracy to dismiss him.
Upon reaching the 25th floor, the appellant found the Assistant Security Officer, one Mohd Anwar Bin Wanchik (PW1), waiting for him. PW1 noticed that the appellant was not wearing a security pass, and asked the appellant to follow him to the security office on the second floor. The appellant complied. The police were subsequently summoned, and the appellant was arrested.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The appellant was charged in the court below with having committed criminal trespass. The charge against him read as follows: 
 
You ... are charged that you on 8 March 2000 at or about 4.30pm, at HDB Centre Tower A, Level 25, Bukit Merah Central, Singapore, did commit criminal trespass, to wit, by entering into the said premises in the possession of one Mohd Anwar and caused annoyance to one Mohd Anwar and have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 The hearing below 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s case
 
According to the prosecution`s evidence, the appellant was barred from entering the premises upon his dismissal. His photograph had even been displayed at the security counters to ensure that he would not be allowed back onto the premises. The appellant had nevertheless continued to make unauthorised entries into the premises on several occasions.
By his own statement P7 (the admissibility of which was not challenged), the appellant admitted that sometime in January 2000, he had tried to come into the premises but was barred from entering. He had then effected entry in the same unauthorised manner as on 8 March 2000, ie by waiting for one of the HDB staff leaving the premises to open the exit door from the inside. He had then gone to Goh Sin Tok`s office on the 25th floor, where he scolded Goh Sin Tok for being involved in the alleged conspiracy to dismiss him. The appellant admitted that he was detained by the security officers and advised not to return. This warning apparently went unheeded. In his statement, the appellant further admitted that sometime in February 2000, he once again slipped into the premises through the exit door. Once more, he went to the 25th floor, where the appellant confronted Goh Sin Tok and scolded him. This time, the police were summoned and the appellant was given a final warning. During the course of cross-examination, the appellant testified that he had managed to sneak into the premises a total of three to four times.
The last straw finally came on 8 March 2000, ie the date of the arrest. PW1 gave evidence that on that day, at about 4.15pm, one of the security officers spotted the appellant in the vicinity of the premises. PW1, upon being alerted to the appellant`s presence, had then gone to the 25th floor, anticipating that the appellant would come looking for Goh Sin Tok again. True enough, the appellant showed up at the 25th floor, whereupon PW1 escorted the appellant to the security office downstairs.
PW1 further testified that he was annoyed by the appellant`s repeated unauthorised visits. Being the security officer, he had to go hunting for the appellant each time the latter slipped into the premises, and he was greatly inconvenienced as a result.
 The case for the defence
The appellant testified that he did not know that he was committing an offence by entering the premises, as he did not do anything harmful or illegal. He never intended to cause any inconvenience or annoyance to anyone.
 The finding below
At the end of the trial, the appellant was found guilty and sentenced to pay the maximum fine of $500. However, no custodial sentence was imposed. The appellant, being dissatisfied with the conviction, appealed to this court.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
Section 441 of the Penal Code defines the offence of criminal trespass as follows: 
 
Whoever enters into or upon property in the possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit `criminal trespass`.
 
 
 
Before me, the appellant advanced the same argument as that which he proffered in the trial below, ie that he did not have the requisite intent to annoy anyone (ASS [para ]1).
I have, in a number of authorities, already laid down the various principles applicable to cases on criminal trespass. Firstly, the requisite intent to annoy need not be proven by direct evidence. Most times, the court will have to infer the existence of the intention by examining the circumstances surrounding the offence: 
PP v Seah Soon Keong
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 442
  (at p 444F). Secondly, the intent to annoy need not be the primary or dominant motive prompting entry into the premises: 
PP v Pardeep Singh
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 116
  (at pp 123F and 124C).
In the present appeal, the appellant relied on 
Ong Eng Guan v PP
 
 
[1956] MLJ 44
 . In that case, the accused was an employee of a sewing machine company, from which the complainant had bought a sewing machine on hire purchase. When the complainant fell into arrears in making the instalment payments, the accused went to the complainant`s premises with the intention of either taking possession of the machine or of collecting the instalments due. It was held by Wilson J that, while this may in fact have annoyed the complainant, no intent to annoy could be inferred. 
 Ong Eng Guan 
 thus appeared to support the following proposition: where it is established that the accused possesses the reasonable belief that he has some legitimate grounds for being on the complainant`s premises, the court should generally not infer an intent to annoy.
However, 
 Ong Eng Guan 
 is of no assistance to an accused if it is shown that the accused knows that he has been banned from entering the complainant`s premises. Once the accused knows that he no longer has any legal right to be on the complainant`s premises, it would lie ill in the accused`s mouth to say that he reasonably believed that he had legitimate grounds for being on the complainant`s premises. In 
PP v Ker Ban Siong
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 938
 , the accused was expressly banned from entering the Bukit Turf Club. He was served with a prohibition notice and warned not to return. In spite of this, he still returned to the Club several months later, thus ignoring the ban. From this, it was inferred that the accused in that case possessed the requisite intent to annoy. Likewise, in 
 PP v Seah Soon Keong 
, I offered the following illustration (at p 444F): 
 
Take, for example, an accused who was banned from a club by its management and who persisted in entering the club in knowing violation of the ban. The circumstances of his entry are such that one can infer an intent to annoy the management who banned him. It is difficult to imagine what further evidence the prosecution might be called on to produce in such a situation.
 
 
 
Reverting to the facts of the present appeal, the appellant was of the view that there was a conspiracy by the HDB management to have him dismissed. In fact, he even claimed to have lodged a report at the Bukit Merah Neighbourhood Police Post to have the alleged conspiracy investigated. It was the appellant`s case that on all the occasions when he visited the premises, his intention was to ascertain the truth behind his dismissal. Even so, the appellant had been banned, and he knew that he was so banned, from entering the premises. He thus knew that he had no right whatsoever to be on the premises. Thus, while it may have been the appellant`s position that he had a genuine desire to investigate the alleged conspiracy, it would not have been possible for him to contend that he reasonably believed that he had any legitimate grounds for being on the premises. The facts of this appeal are far more in line with the 
 Ker Ban Siong 
 situation, where the accused person deliberately entered the premises despite having knowledge that he was no longer allowed inside.
As such, the trial judge was amply justified in drawing the inference that the appellant possessed the requisite intent to annoy. In the trial below, the appellant tried to argue that PW1 was never truly annoyed, and that the Human Resource department of the HDB had pressured PW1 into saying that he was annoyed. The short answer to this is that it is immaterial whether the complainant was in fact annoyed or not. What is important is that the intent to annoy was present: see 
 PP v Seah Soon Keong 
 (at 444I) and 
 Ong Eng Guan v PP 
.
The conviction should therefore be upheld.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
The punishment for criminal trespass is prescribed in s 447 of the Penal Code, which reads: 
 
Whoever commits criminal trespass shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $500, or with both.
 
 
 
The appellant in the present case was sentenced to pay the maximum fine of $500. By no stretch of the imagination could the sentence be said to have been manifestly excessive. In fact, in light of the appellant`s conduct, I was of the view that he was let off rather lightly. He had repeatedly intruded into the premises, despite having been warned, on each occasion when he was caught, not to do so. The sneaky manner by which he entered the premises, ie waiting at the exit door until somebody opened it from the inside, was also an aggravating factor. All this was done with a view to continually harass the staff of the Human Resource department during office hours. In short, he had made an utter nuisance of himself.
I therefore exercised my powers under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) and enhanced the sentence, imposing a term of imprisonment of two weeks, over and above the fine of $500.

s 4(2) Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (Cap 92A)
 
: This was an appeal against the decision of district judge S Thyagarajan, who acquitted Kuah Kok Choon (`Kuah`) of a charge under s 4(2) of the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (Cap 92A) (`the Act`) for possession of two Lear`s Macaws without a requisite permit. Despite the acquittal, the district judge ordered the two Lear`s Macaws to be forfeited under s 13(2)(b) of the Act. The prosecution appealed against Kuah`s acquittal while Kuah appealed against the order of forfeiture. I allowed the prosecution`s appeal against Kuah`s acquittal and dismissed Kuah`s appeal against the forfeiture of the two birds. I now give my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
On 18 July 1996, one Dr Leong Hon Keong of the Primary Production Department (`PPD`) spotted the two Lear`s Macaws in a large cage by the window on the first floor of 99 Rangoon Road.
On 20 July 1996 at about 9.30am, the PPD conducted a surprise inspection at 99 Rangoon Road. When their officers arrived at the premises, the two Lear`s Macaws were in the same position as when they were spotted two days earlier by Dr Leong. Kuah was not home but his father, Kuah Thian Swee, was. He came out to speak to the officers. At about the same time, the officers observed the cage housing the Lear`s Macaws on the first floor being moved and brought away from the window into the building.
The officers wanted to conduct the inspection immediately but Kuah`s father asked that they wait until he had spoken to Kuah. He contacted Kuah by telephone. Dr Leong also spoke to Kuah and was asked to wait until Kuah contacted his lawyer. The officers waited for about half an hour.
At about 10am, an officer who was stationed by the road informed Dr Leong that the birds were no longer visible from the road. The officers then insisted on inspecting the first floor immediately. They found that the birds were no longer in the cage. The officers searched the premises and found the two Lear`s Macaws in a room on the first floor. One of them was hidden in a green sports bag with brown trimmings while the other was in a pink and white cloth bag. Both birds were seized.
 The charge 
 
 
 
The charge brought against Kuah read as follows: 
 
You, Kuah Kok Choon, male / 24 years old NRIC No S7410016-C are charged that you, on 20 July 1996, at about 9.30am at 99 Rangoon Road, Singapore, did have in your possession two Lear`s Macaws (Anodorhynchus Leari), a scheduled species under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act (Cap 92A), which were imported without a permit issued by the Director of Primary Production, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 4(2) and punishable under s 4(3) of the said Act.
 
 
 
 
 
 Decision of the trial judge 
 
 
 
 
 
At the trial below, the following points were not disputed: (a) that Kuah was in possession of the two Lear`s Macaws; (b) that Lear`s Macaws are a scheduled species under the Act; (c) that Lear`s Macaws are not indigenous to Singapore and it was highly unlikely that the two in question were bred in Singapore; and (d) that no permit has ever been issued under the Act for the import of Lear`s Macaws into Singapore.
The defence`s case was simply that Kuah bought the Lear`s Macaws before the Act came into force. This meant that they could not have been imported in contravention of the Act and therefore that the elements of the charge had not been proven by the prosecution.
Both the district judge and the prosecution in the court below accepted this defence as legitimate. For want of other supporting evidence, the prosecution sought to prove that the Lear`s Macaws were imported into Singapore after 17 March 1989, the date the Act came into force, by adducing evidence to establish the age of the birds. If the birds were younger than eight years of age in 1998 when they were examined, then the inference would be that they were imported after the Act came into force in 1989.
Therefore, the main issue in the trial revolved around establishing the age of the two Lear`s Macaws. Both sides called upon experts to advance arguments on their behalf. The expert who testified for the prosecution was one Carlos Yamashita. He is a field biologist who has done extensive research on Lear`s Macaws. He examined the two Lear`s Macaws in question and estimated that they were less than five years of age. He reached this conclusion based purely on the method of external morphology. The expert witness for the defence was one Dr Gerry M Dorrestein. Although not an expert on Lear`s Macaws, he is well versed in avian matters, as evidenced by his extensive curriculum vitae. The purpose for which he was called as a witness was to dispute the methodology used by Mr Yamashita to age the birds. The crux of his testimony was that it was not scientifically proven that the age of a Lear`s Macaw could be accurately determined by external morphology.
The district judge upheld the defence`s main objection raised to the prosecution`s expert testimony, that is, over Mr Yamashita`s methodology. The evidence showed that there is no scientific method of using external morphology to determine a Lear`s Macaws age and thus his conclusions were considered to be unreliable. Since the prosecution had not adduced other sufficiently strong evidence as to how, when or by whom the two Lear`s Macaws were allegedly illegally imported into Singapore, Kuah was acquitted of the charge.
After the acquittal, the prosecution asked the court to nonetheless order the forfeiture of the two Lear`s Macaws. The district judge exercised his discretion to do so and ordered that the two Lear`s Macaws be forfeited to the Director-General, Agri-food and Veterinary services pursuant to s 13(2)(b) of the Act.
 The Act 
 
 
 
At this point, it would be convenient to set out the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 4 reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) No person shall import, export, re-export or introduce from the sea any scheduled species without a permit. 
 
(2) No person shall have in his possession, under his control, sell, offer or expose for sale, or display to the public any scheduled species which has been imported or introduced from the sea in contravention of subsection (1). 
 
(3) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.
  
 
 
 
 
 The appeal against acquittal 
 
 
 
 
 
Having perused s 4(2) of the Act, it was clear to me that, for the charge to be made out in this case, the prosecution needed to prove three elements, namely (i) possession; (ii) the two Lear`s Macaws in possession were a scheduled species; and (iii) they must have been imported in contravention of sub-section (1).
It was not disputed by either side that Lear`s Macaws are a scheduled species under the Act and that the two in question were in Kuah`s possession. It was the third element that caused great confusion both at the trial below and at the appeal. The defence alleged that the third element had not been made out because the prosecution could not prove that the two Lear`s Macaws had been imported 
 after 
 the Act came into force and thus could not show that the import was in contravention of sub-s (1).
Section 4(1) of the Act states that `(n)o person shall import, export, re-export or introduce from the sea any scheduled species 
 without a permit 
.` The correct way to construe the third element of s 4(2) is simply to substitute the language of sub-s (1) into sub-s (2). When this is done, s 4(2) will read: (n)o person shall have in his possession, ... any scheduled species which has been imported ... without a permit.`
When construed in this way, it becomes clear that all the elements of the charge, including the third element, were made out in this case, as they were undisputed by the defence in the first place. The defence never disputed that no permit had been issued for the import of the two Lear`s Macaws since the PPD had never issued a permit under the Act for the import of Lear`s Macaws into Singapore.
The prosecution committed a grave error by conceding at the trial below that it had the burden to prove that the Lear`s Macaws were imported after the Act came into force. A plain reading of the relevant provisions of the Act shows that for the charge under s 4(2) to be made out, there is never a requirement for the prosecution to show 
 when 
 the birds were imported. To impute such a burden on the prosecution would be to impose requirements that were plainly not stated in the legislation. The trial judge was clearly misled by this concession of the prosecution, which led to his misinterpretation of the law.
I must emphasise that the charge here pertained to possession rather than to import. As long as possession of a scheduled species, on a date after the Act came into effect, is proved, the offence is made out if there has been no requisite import permit. The date of possession must be after the Act has come into force, but the date of import is irrelevant for a charge under s 4(2). Where any person chooses to possess, have under his control, sell, offer or expose for sale, or display to the public any scheduled species, the onus is on that person to check and ensure that proper import permits have been obtained for the particular scheduled species. If import permits have not been obtained, then the onus is again on that person to seek an exemption from the Director-General under s 18 of the Act.
Returning to the facts of the case, it was not disputed that Kuah possessed the two Lear`s Macaws, which are a scheduled species under the Act, and that no import permit had been granted for these two birds. This being the case, the charge was already made out and the roundabout route that the prosecution chose to prove their case was utterly unnecessary. The great emphasis on expert evidence, to prove the age of the birds, during the lengthy trial was totally irrelevant since the charge had already been proven.
Once the charge is made out, the burden then shifts on to the defence to either dispute possession or that the animal in possession was not a scheduled species, or to argue that import permits were issued or that an exemption applied. None of these elements were made out by the defence in this case. Indeed, the defence conceded that the three elements of the offence were present.
Therefore, since the charge was made out and no defence was raised to disprove any element of the offence, I accordingly allowed the prosecution`s appeal against acquittal and convicted Kuah of the offence as charged.
 The appeal against forfeiture 
 
 
 
The provisions in the Act which provide for forfeiture are found in s 13, the relevant portions of which read as follows: 
 
 
(1) Upon the conviction of any person for an offence under s 4 or 4A, the scheduled species in respect of which the offence was committed and any other thing seized under s 9(4)(b), (c) or (d) shall, without further order, be forfeited to the Director-General. 
 
(2) Where a person who is prosecuted for an offence under s 4 or 4A is acquitted or given a discharge, conditional or otherwise, the court may order the scheduled species in respect of which the prosecution was brought and any other thing seized under s 9(4)(b), (c) or (d) -
  
 
 
 
(a) to be released to the person from whom they were seized or to the owner thereof; or 
 
(b) to be forfeited to the Director-General.
  
 
 
Having acquitted Kuah, the district judge then exercised his discretion and ordered the two Lear`s Macaws to be forfeited to the Director-General under s 13(2)(b). However, since I allowed the prosecution`s appeal and convicted Kuah, forfeiture of the two Lear`s Macaws to the Director-General was no longer discretionary because it became automatic by virtue of s 13(1). As such, I dismissed Kuah`s appeal against the forfeiture of the two Lear`s Macaws.
 The appropriate sentence 
 
 
 
I next proceeded to consider the appropriate sentence to impose on Kuah. The relevant sentencing provision is found in s 4(3) of the Act, which provides that on conviction, the accused may be sentenced to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.
The prosecution submitted that Kuah had several antecedents and this was certainly not his first offence. In 1994, he was convicted in Perth, Western Australia for an unauthorised import of six exotic parrots into Australia. In November 1995, he was fined for attempting to smuggle three birds and one squirrel into Singapore in contravention of s 9(2) of the Wild Animals and Birds Act (Cap 351). In 1996, Kuah was caught by a customs officer in Paris, en route from Brazil to Singapore, transporting two Lear`s Macaws in a duffel bag without any import or export documents. He was subsequently charged and convicted of an offence under the Penal Code (Cap 224) in 1999 for obtaining from Singapore, and using as genuine, a forged PPD import permit to obtain the release of two Lear`s Macaws which had been seized by the French customs. Finally, Kuah had previously pleaded guilty in 1997 to three charges relating to the possession of illegally acquired gibbons, which were seized from his premises in a raid in July 1996.
With such a long list of antecedents, the prosecution urged the court to impose a deterrent sentence. It submitted that such a sentence would also serve to deter like-minded people from committing similar crimes.
On the other hand, counsel for Kuah urged me to consider that Kuah was only 22 years of age at the date of the offence in 1996. He argued that Kuah`s conviction in relation to the possession of gibbons was part of the same transaction as this present offence, as the gibbons were seized at around the same time as the two Lear`s Macaws. He further submitted that Kuah`s offences were all committed in the period of 1995-1996, when he was just a young boy who had gone overboard. Finally, he submitted that the forfeiture of the birds was already a penalty and therefore his client should not be punished any further.
The offence committed in the present instance is not a minor one. The two Lear`s Macaws are undoubtedly valuable and worth a lot. This is because Lear`s Macaws are extremely endangered, with a population of only 130 in the wild in Brazil and on the brink of extinction. They are indigenous only to Brazil. I had no doubt that Kuah was aware of the need to preserve these species. He was obviously not an amateur bird collector who happened to chance upon the two Lear`s Macaws at a bird shop and bought them, being unaware that they were extremely endangered. On the contrary, he had an extensive knowledge of birds, having had papers published in international journals concerning aviculture and ornithology, and having set up his own breeding farm. In addition, he had 600 to 800 birds at his residence in July 1996 at the time of the raid. However, a perusal of his antecedents made me think that he was more concerned with the trading of birds than with their welfare. He had attempted to smuggle various animals through various countries, with no regard for the preservation and protection of these animals.
In Singapore, the Act was enacted to give effect to the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which Singapore has ratified. The main purpose of CITES is to protect certain species of wild fauna and flora against over-exploitation through international trade. I was of the opinion that a deterrent sentence had to be imposed to reflect how seriously Singapore regards its obligations under CITES. Singapore has committed itself to co-operating with other countries to preserve their endangered species and Kuah`s actions went against the spirit of this co-operation.
Therefore, I felt that youth was no excuse for Kuah`s contravention of the Act. He was clearly cognisant of his actions and committed crimes of a similar nature repeatedly without any semblance of repentance. His antecedents and his experience with birds left me in no doubt that he was knowingly in possession of the two Lear`s Macaws without the requisite import permits. I was of the opinion that a fine would be grossly inadequate in the circumstances. The maximum fine would hardly have any punitive effect whatsoever since one Lear`s Macaw alone could be worth more than $10,000. Therefore, to underline the seriousness of the offence, I imposed the maximum sentence of one year`s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000, with six months` imprisonment in default thereof.

: This is an action between the plaintiffs and the third defendant. The plaintiffs` claims against the first and second defendants were not due for hearing before me. No process has been served on the first defendant and the claim against the second defendant has been stayed by an order of court.
The plaintiffs, Itochu Steel Pte Ltd, a company incorporated in Singapore dealt with steel products. The first defendant CV Wira Mustika Indah (`CV Wira`) is a partnership established under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia carrying on business there. The second defendant is a partner in CV Wira. The third defendant is the son of the second defendant and was at the material time carrying on business under the name of Tri Niaga Enterprise (`TNE`) in Singapore.
Between September 1996 and October 1997 sales contracts were entered into between the plaintiffs and CV Wira for cold rolled steel sheets which were shipped to CV Wira in Indonesia. The plaintiffs would draw bills of exchange for the price of the goods sold and the third defendant would accept the bills. Payment on the bills were due on future dates specified.
This action relates to 35 bills that the plaintiffs drew between 24 April 1997 and 16 January 1998. The payees were the Industrial Bank of Japan (`IBJ`) or order. The third defendant accepted each of the bills. The total sum payable on the bills was US$5,992,375.18.
When the plaintiffs presented the bills for payment, they were dishonoured. After giving the third defendant notice of dishonour they commenced legal proceedings. As payment of US$533,063.00 was subsequently received, they claimed the balance of US$5,459,312.18 against him.
 The bills of exchange claims 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs asserted in para 4 of the re-amended atatement of claim that: 
 
Pursuant to and in accordance with the Sales Contracts and the agreement pleaded above, the plaintiffs drew upon the third defendant, Bills of Exchange payable to the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. or order. The third defendant accepted the Bills of Exchange, payable at ING Bank NV Singapore.
 
 
 
They also claimed that the third defendant was liable to them as the accommodation party to the bills. In para 4A of the re-amended statement of claim they alleged that: 
 
Further and/or in the alternative, the third defendant is liable to the plaintiffs as the accommodation party to the Bills of Exchange.
 
 
 
 
 
 The claim as drawer 
 
 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` claim as the drawer of the bills was founded on s 59(4) of the Bills of Exchange Act (`the Act`): 
 
Where a bill payable to, or to the order of, a third party is paid by the drawer, the drawer may enforce payment thereof against the acceptor, but may not reissue the bill.
 
 
 
It was common ground that each of the 35 bills was drawn by the plaintiffs, that it was payable to a third party, namely, the Industrial Bank of Japan or order, and the third defendant was the acceptor.
The dispute was whether the plaintiffs had paid on the bills. That was not pleaded or asserted to by any of the plaintiffs` witnesses.
In the course of arguments counsel for the plaintiffs sought to rely on s 30(1) that: 
 
Every party whose signature appears on a bill is prima facie deemed to have become a party thereto for value.
 
 
 
This would not do. Counsel for the third defendant rightly pointed out that giving value for a bill is not synonymous with making payment on it.
To enable the claim to be determined on its substantive merits, I allowed the plaintiffs to recall their Sales Manager, Hirokazu Murata to give evidence on this matter.
Mr Murata produced a set of letters relating to the return of the 35 bills to the plaintiffs. It started with three letters from ING Bank to IBJ, the first two dated 27 May and the third dated 30 June 1998. In these letters ING Bank informed IBJ that the bills accepted by the third defendant remained unpaid and that they were returning them to IBJ.
IBJ must have informed the plaintiffs about these letters because the plaintiffs instructed IBJ in their letter dated 8 July 1998 that: 
 
With reference to ING Bank NV`s letter dated 27 May 98 and 30 June 98, we will settle all these outstanding bills with the buyer. Therefore please treat all the following accounts as closed.
 
 
 
On 13 July 1998 IBJ replied to the plaintiffs that: 
 
As per your letter dtd 8/7/98, we have closed our file for all the items as per attached list. We enclose herewith all the bill of exchange for your retention.
 
 
 
These letters showed that the plaintiffs did not pay on the bills when they were returned by ING Bank to IBJ.
The plaintiffs also led oral evidence from Mr Murata. Their counsel was very brief with Mr Murata, asking him: 
 
 
Q: Did anyone pay IBJ for the bills of exchange? 
 
A: Yes. Itochu paid. 
 
Q: Was that before or after 13/7/98? 
 
A: Before IBJ returned the bills of exchange.
  
 
 
Counsel for the third defendant went into greater detail with Mr Murata. He elicited from him that the plaintiffs paid the manufacturers of the goods sold to CV Wira by letters of credit issued under credit facilities obtained from IBJ. Then counsel sought clarification on the return of the 35 bills : 
 
 
Q: You told IBJ you will settle the bills with the buyers? 
 
A: Because we were having discussion with Wira and Tri Niaga on rescheduling the debts. 
 
Q: You are telling the bank you will deal with the buyers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You are saying close your accounts with us with regard to the bills of exchange? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You did not require the bank to take action in these matters? 
 
A: We told IBJ we were having discussions. We told them for the time being not to take any action. 
 
Q: You told the bank to treat the accounts as closed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You did not expect them to take any further action? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: P3/1 - the bank confirmed they were closing their files? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In doing so they returned the bills of exchange to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: There is nothing in this letter to show that Itochu had paid for the bills of exchange? 
 
A: Nothing. 
 
Q: Your counsel asked you and you said Itochu made payment to IBJ? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What payments Itochu made was to repay the loan, not for the bills of exchange? 
 
A: I don`t think so. 
 
Q: You told us that the bank had closed the accounts in the bill of exchange? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you made payment to the bank, it was not for the bill of exchange, but to repay the bank for the loans made under the facilities? 
 
A: It depends if we have enough money, we don`t have to take a loan. If we have no money, we take a loan.
  
 
 
The evidence was well short of proof of payment on the bills. Contrary to Mr Murata`s answers to his counsel, the plaintiffs did not pay on the bills before they were returned to them. IBJ released the bills to the plaintiffs without payment because the plaintiffs agreed to seek payment on the bills themselves. The plaintiffs did not have to make payment for the bills after they had them back. If for some reason they paid, they should have records showing when, how and to whom payments were made. No information of this nature was produced.
In the circumstances, the claim as drawers fails because the plaintiffs have failed to show payment to entitle them to sue under s 59(4).
 The claim against the third defendant as an accommodation party 
 
 
 
The third defendant admitted that he was an accommodation party. Any liability he may have as an accommodation party arises out of s 28(2) of the Act: 
 
An accommodation party is liable on the bill to a holder for value; and it is immaterial whether, when such holder took the bill, he knew such party to be an accommodation party or not.
 
 
 
An accommodation party is liable to the holder for value of the bill he accommodated. To be a holder for value, a party must be a holder. `Holder` is defined in s 2 of the Act as `the payee or indorsee of a bill or note who is in possession of it, or the bearer thereof.` The plaintiffs were the drawers, not the payees or indorsees of the bills. They were also not the bearers, as a bearer is defined in s 2 as `the person in possession of a bill or note which is payable to bearer`, and the bills were not bearer bills.
The plaintiffs have not established that they have a claim against the third defendant under s 28(2).
The third defendant had also pleaded that: 
 
It is averred that the third defendant was an accommodation acceptor because he received no consideration for his acceptance. As an accommodation acceptor, the third defendant is entitled to be indemnified by the plaintiffs as drawers against any liability on the Bills of Exchange. Accordingly, if (which is denied), the plaintiffs are holders for value of the Bills of Exchange, their claim fails for circuity of action.
 
 
 
Reference was made to 
 4(1) Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 481: 
 
 
 Duty to provide funds or indemnity
. Where the instrument is an accommodation bill, it is the duty of the party for whose accommodation it was drawn to provide funds to meet the bill at maturity, or in default of that to indemnify the acceptor or any other party who has been compelled to pay the holder. The indemnity to be given may be extended to include the costs of an action fought unsuccessfully against the holder, if there was a prima facie ground of defence.
 
 
 
The duty to provide funds or to indemnify is a contract which may be expressed or implied. It is not required to be in writing.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` response is: 
 
According to the third defendant, he accepted the bills of exchange in order to accommodate the plaintiffs. This submission is not only absurd, but flies in the face of clear evidence of the third defendant that he accepted the bills because he was told to do so by his father.
 
 
 
There is a defect in that retort. The third defendant may have accepted the bills on the instructions of his father. Nevertheless when he became an acceptor to the bills, he was accommodating the principal debtors on the bills, the plaintiffs who drew the bills. If the bills came into the possession of a holder for value, he would be liable under s 28(2), and he may be entitled to be indemnified by the plaintiffs.
On the facts, however, the question of indemnity does not arise because the third defendant did not incur any liability through accommodating the plaintiffs.
 The plaintiffs` alternative claim 
 
 
 
In paras 7, 7A, 7B and 7C of their re-amended statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged that: 
 
 
7. Further and/or in the alternative, by letters dated March 1995 and 1 April 1996 addressed to the plaintiffs, the third defendant represented and warranted to the plaintiffs that: 
 
7.1 `the Principal (Tri Niaga Enterprise) is a duly registered sole proprietorship in accordance with Singapore law,` 
 
7.2 `I am a true and sole owner of such sole proprietorship,` 
 
7.3 `I am fully liable to you for any and all liabilities arising from transactions with you in the name of Tri Niaga Enterprise; and` 
 
7.4 `the Principal (Tri Niaga Enterprise) is a subsidiary of C.V. Wira Mustika Indah (`CV`), a Indonesian partnership and I shall cause the CV to make sure a business of the Principal and further to inject cash into the Principal in case of a shortfall in funds of the Principal.` 
 
7A By means of the aforesaid representations and warranties and acting on the faith thereof and believing them to be true, the plaintiffs were induced and continued to deal with the first Defendants. 
 
7B he representation set out in para 7.4 above was in fact false in that Tri Niaga Enterprises was not a subsidiary of the first defendants. 
 
7C Alternatively, in breach of his warranty as set out in para 7.4 above the third defendant did not cause the first defendant to inject cash into Tri Niaga Enterprises when there was a shortfall of funds by the latter.
  
 
 
The third defendant admitted that he wrote the letters.
Mr Murata deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that: 
 
These documents formed part of the agreed terms for the credit facility. The plaintiffs would not have extended credit to CV Wira if the two documents had not been signed. The plaintiffs relied on these two documents in extending credit to CV Wira.
 
 
 
The representations set out in paras 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 of the re-amended statement of claim were factually correct and unexceptional. Any complaint of the plaintiffs arises out of the representations in para 7.4.
The first representation in para 7.4 was that TNE was a subsidiary of CV Wira. This was a misrepresentation in that TNE was not a subsidiary of CV Wira in any sense of the word. None of the witnesses stated that the plaintiffs would not have accepted the undertaking if the plaintiffs knew that TNE was not a subsidiary of CV Wira, or explained the plaintiffs` understanding of TNE`s status as a subsidiary in the face of the third defendant`s declaration that he was the sole owner of TNE, a sole-proprietorship. The second representation was ambiguous. It is either that the third defendant will cause CV Wira to inject cash into TNE when TNE has a shortfall of funds, or that he will inject the cash into TNE himself, but nothing turned on this.
This is because although the first representation was wrong, the plaintiffs were not prejudiced by it. They failed in their claim against the third defendant because they could not substantiate their claim and not because TNE was not a subsidiary of CV Wira, or that it was short of funds to meet its liabilities to them. The alternative claim therefore fails.
 Release and waiver 
 
 
 
The third defendant relied on an agreement dated 1 May 1998 between him, the plaintiffs and CV Wira to raise the defence of release and waiver. As the agreement did not refer to release or waiver specifically, the circumstances leading to the agreement, and the parties` conduct in relation to it came under consideration.
In 1998, CV Wira was falling behind in their payments to the plaintiffs. The parties met to try to find a solution. The third defendant deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that: 
 
 
36. The plaintiffs agreed to transfer the invoices from TNE to Wira, and to release TNE from any liability. In late April 98, the plaintiffs sent Wira a draft agreement entitled `Letter of Request`, and requested us to sign the Agreement. 
 
38. The agreement entitled `Letter of Request` was signed by Wira and me and forwarded to the plaintiffs on or about 1 May 1998. The plaintiffs` Managing Director, Mr Hitoshi Sato, signed the agreement on behalf of the plaintiffs. Before the plaintiffs signed the Letter of Request, they asked my father to confirm that the plaintiffs would be reflected as a trade creditor of Wira once they signed the Letter of Request. My father confirmed this, and I faxed a copy of a statement (which I received from my father) to the plaintiffs reflecting the plaintiffs as a trade creditor for US$5,992,373.18. 
 
39. 
 Although the agreement was termed a letter of request from Wira and TNE to the plaintiffs, it was drafted by the plaintiffs, and actually arose from the Plaintiffs` concern about not being listed as a trade creditor of Wira in Wira`s balance sheet.

 Request to Issue Invoices to CV Wira Mustika Indah 
 
 
 
We, CV Wira Mustika Indah (the `buyer`) have from time to time purchase steel products from Itochu Steel Asia Pte Ltd (`ISA`) but the invoices are to be sent to Tri Niaga Enterprise as our paying agent.
 
 
 
For these purchases ISA has at our request issued invoices to Tri Niaga Enterprise who has been acting as our paying agent for and on behalf of the buyer for the purchase of the steel products above mentioned.
 
 
 
The buyer hereby requests ISA to issue invoices to the buyer with immediate effect and agree to the following:
 
 
 
 
1. The buyer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to ISA the due and punctual payment of all sums of whatsoever nature due and/or to become due under or pursuant to all sales contracts (`Sales Contract`) entered into between ISA all sums of whatsoever nature from time to time due and payable (but unpaid) at any time under or pursuant to the Sales Contract in the currency and in manner required thereunder. 
 
2. The original invoices issued by ISA to Tri Niaga Enterprise from 10 April 1997 to 29 December 1997 shall remain valid and enforceable against the buyer and the buyer shall make payment thereunder. (Italics added) 
 
3. The buyer indemnify ISA against any loss, cost or expense which it may sustain or incur as a consequence of issuing the invoices as requested by the buyer.
  
 
 
Yours truly,
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the trial, it was established that the text approved by the plaintiffs with the words in italics were added into the copy for signature on the initiative of the third defendant`s solicitors after the draft letter was approved, and without reference to the plaintiffs. I had expressed my disapproval during the hearing. It was well that the insertion did not affect the outcome of these proceedings.
The plaintiffs denied that the agreement was a release or waiver. Mr Murata in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief deposed that: 
 
 
16 Around or about March or April 1998, the second and third defendants approached the plaintiffs and requested for our assistance. They explained to me that the first defendants were being investigated by the police or customs in Jakarta and that the police had questioned them on the outstandings due to the plaintiffs and also as to why the invoices were not made out to the first defendants. 
 
24 The plaintiffs did not at any point of time agree or intend to acknowledge or represent by the letter of request that we release the third defendant from his liability of payment under the bills of exchange or the sales contracts. Neither did the plaintiffs agree or intend to acknowledge or represent by the letter of request that we waived our rights against the third defendant. The third defendant is well aware of this at all times. Even subsequent to 31 May 1998, the plaintiffs continued to send statements of account to the third defendant.
  
 
 
The parties` subsequent conduct and documents bear out the plaintiffs` contention but not the third defendant`s.
After the agreement was signed the plaintiffs sent statements of accounts to TNE, and subsequently to CV Wira at TNE`s request. CV Wira noted on the confirmation copies of the statements for August, October and November 1998 `the mentioned figure is fully understood not in Wira Mustika Indah`s books but in other/internal books.`
If the purpose of the agreement was to have the plaintiffs listed as a trade creditors in CV Wira`s accounts as the third defendant alleged, the notations were entirely contrary to the purpose, but there were no complaints from the plaintiffs. Their acquiescence was however consistent with Mr Murata`s explanation on the purpose of the agreement.
The third defendant`s subsequent actions went counter to a release or waiver. TNE claimed to have issued a debit note dated 30 October 1998, six months after the agreement, to the plaintiffs for the sum of US$5,992,375.18. The note, which the plaintiffs denied receiving, was for a `payment by CV Wira Mustika Indah on our behalf to you` of that sum, and a credit note to CV Wira for a payment in the same amount `made on our behalf to Itochu (S) Steel Asia Pte Ltd` although no payment was made to the plaintiffs.
The third defendant deposed in para 51 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that: 
 
In the event, before TNE`s financial year closed in December 1998, I arranged for TNE to issue a debit note to the plaintiffs to reflect the fact that TNE had no liabilities to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs did not object to the debit note.
 
 
 
without explaining why it was necessary to issue a debit note for a payment that was not made.
If a release or waiver was agreed to, TNE could simply have cancelled the debt on that basis. Its reliance on that dubious debit and credit notes to try to cancel the debt shows that there was no release or waiver.
If the plaintiffs have proved their claim, the third defendant cannot avoid liability on the basis that he has been released from liability or that the plaintiffs had waived their claim against him.
The defence of release and waiver which took a significant part of the trial was lacking in merit and good faith, and should be reflected in the award of costs of the proceedings. With that in mind, I dismiss the plaintiffs` claim and award the third defendant half the costs of the action.

: This is an appeal against sentence only. The appellant had claimed trial and was convicted on 19 July 2000 on the following amended charge: 
 
You, Choy Tuck Sum, are charged that you sometime between September 1998 to 23 December 1998, in Singapore, did abet Ng Yook Sing, in the commission of an offence of employing a foreign worker without a valid work permit, namely, one Mizan, to wit, you intentionally aided the said Ng Yook Sing to use the services of Mizan for his firm`s own work, when the said Ng Yook Sing had not obtained in respect of the said foreign worker a valid work permit allowing the foreign worker to work for him, which offence was committed in consequence of the abetment and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) read with s 23 of the said Act and punishable under s 5(6) of the Act.
 
 
 
The appellant was at the material time a sole proprietor in the construction trade. Sometime in July 1997, the appellant had a construction project in Woodlands for which he supplied 13 of his foreign workers to one of his sub-contractors, Wei Lock, which was owned by one Ng Yook Sing. At around the same time, Wei Lock also had a contract to provide cleaners at the World Trade Centre (`WTC`). One of the 13 foreign workers, Mizan, was later deployed by Wei Lock to work as a cleaner at the WTC. This was even though Mizan`s work permit had allowed him to work only as a construction worker for the appellant. Under this arrangement, which the appellant was wholly aware of, Mizan`s wages were paid for by Wei Lock. On 23 December 1998, an inspection for illegal workers was conducted by officers from the Ministry of Manpower at the WTC and Mizan was one of the workers arrested for working without a valid work permit as provided for under s 12 of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (`EFWA`) (Cap 91A).
 `second or subsequent conviction` 
 
 
 
In determining the sentence, the trial judge took into account the fact that the appellant had a previous conviction for an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA in 1993, for which he was fined $9,600. Section 5(6)(b) of the EFWA provides for enhanced punishment when the court is dealing with a second or subsequent conviction under s 5(1). The trial judge took the view that the present conviction on the abetment offence constituted a second conviction under s 5(1) EFWA for the appellant and therefore imposed the mandatory custodial sentence. The appellant was ordered to serve the minimum one month`s imprisonment and to pay a fine of $7,920.
The appellant has now appealed against the decision of the trial judge to impose the enhanced punishment, arguing that he should not have been regarded as a repeat offender under s 5(6)(b)(i) of the EFWA. At this juncture, it is perhaps useful to set out the provisions in the EFWA that are relevant for the purposes of this appeal. 
 
Prohibition of employment of foreign worker without work permit
 
 
 
 
5(1) No person shall employ a foreign worker unless he has obtained in respect of the foreign worker a valid work permit which allows the foreign worker to work for him.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
5(6) Any person who fails to comply with or contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall - 
 
(a) be liable on conviction to a fine of an amount not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both; and 
 
(b) 
 on a second or subsequent conviction 
, be punished - 
 
(i) in the case of an individual, with imprisonment for a term of not less than a month and not more than 12 months and shall also be liable to a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy; 
 
...
  
 
 
Abetment
 
 
 
 
23(1) Any person who abets the commission of an offence under this Act shall be guilty of the offence and shall be liable on conviction to be punished with the punishment provided for that offence.
  
 
 
In the court below, the trial judge accepted the prosecution`s submission that due to the appellant`s previous conviction under s 5(1) EFWA, he should be sentenced as a second offender. In her reasoning, the trial judge stated: 
 
The offence of abetment carries the same punishment as the substantive offence which is abetted. Abetment is therefore equally culpable as the substantive offence. On counsel`s argument, the enhanced punishment could never be attracted for an offence of abetment. To my mind, it was absurd to restrict the enhanced punishment only to the substantive offence when s 23(1) provides for the same punishment as the substantive offence and the mischief to be protected is identical.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law when she imposed the enhanced punishment on the appellant. Two main grounds of appeal have been advanced. First, in deciding that the offence of abetment is the same as the substantive offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA, the trial judge failed to recognise that an offence of abetment is a distinct offence from the substantive offence. In support of this contention, the case of 
Ong Ah Yeo Yenna v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 73
  was cited as authority. It is submitted that before the enhanced punishment provision in s 5(6)(b)(i) EFWA can apply, it must be shown that sub-s 5(1) was contravened and such contravention amounted to a second or subsequent conviction under s 5(1). Since the abetment offence committed in the present case was an offence under s 23(1) of the EFWA and not an offence under s 5(1), it could not be said that the appellant has contravened s 5(1) for a second time.
The second ground of appeal raised was that the trial judge erred in interpreting the statutory provisions concerned. Counsel argued that the trial judge failed to give effect to the literal meaning of the words in s 5(6)(b)(i). It was further argued that since the EFWA is a penal statute, the trial judge should have adopted the presumption of strict construction in favour of an accused person.
 A distinct offence? 
 
 
 
I will now consider the first ground of appeal raised by counsel for the appellant. I will first point out that, on the present facts, I do not think that the case of 
Ong Ah Yeo Yenna v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 73
 , is useful to the appellant. As noted by the trial judge, this case is clearly distinguishable. In the 
 Ong Ah Yeo Yenna 
 case, although I was similarly dealing with a situation of abetment by aiding, I was, however, considering a different question of whether an abettor could be convicted of abetting the offence even though the principal had not been tried for the substantive offence. I had held in that case that it was not necessary that the principal offender must have been convicted before the abettor could be convicted of abetting the offence, so long as the actus reus of the principal offence was shown to have been committed. This principle is certainly still valid but is not relevant for our present purposes, since here the court is not concerned with the question of the appellant`s liability or conviction but with the issue of what is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on him.
Counsel for the appellant argued that the trial judge`s decision showed that she had failed to realise that an abetment offence is a distinct offence from the principal offence that was abetted. I am unable to agree with such a contention. There is no doubt that, when the court is considering the liability and conviction of an accused for the commission of an offence, the offence of abetment is different and distinct from the principal offence. An abettor who commits the offence of abetment only cannot actually be said to have committed the substantive principal offence. However, in the present case, the issue is not on the appellant`s liability or whether or not he should be convicted. The appellant has already been convicted as an abettor and the question now is how, 
 for the purposes of sentencing 
, the offence of abetment should be treated. In order to answer that, it is imperative to refer to the relevant statutory provisions in the EFWA.
The EFWA provides in s 23(1) for the offence of abetment. It states that `any person who abets the commission of 
 an offence 
 under this Act 
 shall be guilty of the offence 
 and shall be liable on conviction to be 
 punished with the punishment provided for that offence 
` (emphasis mine). It is apparent from the words in the section that this is a general and all-encompassing provision that applies to all the sections in the EFWA that is liability-creating. It is not limited or restricted in its application to s 5(1) only. In my view, the literal meaning of s 23(1) is very clear from the plain and simple words used in the provision. The words `shall be guilty of the offence` make it obvious that a person who abets the commission of any offence under the EFWA will be considered as being guilty of the substantive principal offence. Hence, it should be noted that the charge under which the appellant was convicted states that he had committed an offence under s 5(1), read with s 23, and does not state that he had committed an offence under s 23(1). The distinction in such wording is important.
Counsel for the appellant tried to argue that the words `the offence` in s 23(1) refers to the offence of abetment. I am unable to accept such an interpretation because it is incongruent with the rest of the section and it also makes absurd the whole purpose behind the provision. The words `the offence` must mean the principal offence and not the offence of abetment. The second half of s 23(1) provides in no uncertain terms, that the punishment for the offence of abetment shall be the same as the punishment provided for the principal offence. This follows from the earlier part of the section, since it is precisely because the abettor will be considered to be guilty of the principal offence, that the punishment for the abettor shall be the same punishment as that provided for the principal offender.
Consistent with the above interpretation, is the fact that s 23(1) EFWA does not itself provide specifically for the punishment for an offence of abetment. This is because the appropriate punishment should be determined by referring to the respective section which provides for the principal offence, which in the present case is s 5(1). Therefore, if the principal offence committed had been an offence under, say s 22(1), instead, then the punishment for the abetment of such an offence would depend on what is provided for in s 22(1). To illustrate the point further, I will mention that s 22(1), unlike s 5(1), does not provide for enhanced punishment for subsequent convictions under the section. This means that if the appellant had a second or subsequent conviction under s 22(1), he would not be liable to any enhanced punishment because s 22(1) does not provide for it. The argument by the appellant`s counsel that the trial judge`s reasoning would have the effect that any second or subsequent conviction of any offence within the EFWA will attract enhanced punishment is therefore an absolutely erroneous one. In the context of the EFWA, whether or not there is enhanced punishment for subsequent convictions for offences under the EFWA must depend on the exact wording of the provision relating to the principal offence.
In reading the provisions in the EFWA, it is also important to bear in mind the policy considerations behind the introduction of the EFWA, which was enacted in 1990 to replace the repealed Regulation of Employment Act (Cap 127, 1970 Ed), which Parliament had found to be inadequate. In the parliamentary debates during the second reading of the Employment of Foreign Workers Bill on 4 October 1990, the Minister highlighted, at column 449, that: 
 
To circumvent these controls, some employers have resorted to employing foreign workers illegally without work permits. With the enhancement of penalties under the Immigration Act, the illegal workers are now mostly foreigners with valid social visit passes but no work permits. 
 Some have valid work permits but are deployed illegally to other sectors or companies. Such illegal employment has to be checked as it undermines our economic strategy
.
 
 
 
The Employment of Foreign Workers Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact with amendments the Regulation of Employment Act, which is the current legislation for regulating the employment of foreign workers. 
 The Bill provides enhanced penalties and powers to enable the Ministry to deal more effectively with the problem of illegal foreign workers
. [Emphasis mine. ]
 
 
 
It is clear from the debates that the mischief which Parliament intended to deal with through the introduction of the EFWA and its enhanced penalties, was not confined to the employment of illegal foreign workers but extended also to illegal deployment of foreign workers who have valid work permits. This evidently encompasses the present situation, where a main contractor such as the appellant, abets in the illegal employment of a foreign worker by his sub-contractor, by allowing the illegal deployment of his own worker to his sub-contractor for work not covered under the valid work permit. In such circumstances, the abettor must be viewed as being just as culpable as the principal offender since the offence could not possibly have been committed had it not been for the aid provided by the abettor in supplying the foreign worker. If the argument advanced by the appellant`s counsel is accepted, it would mean that an abettor will not suffer from the enhanced punishment despite repeated convictions for abetting an offence under s 5(1). This is clearly against the intention of Parliament and would seriously undermine the efforts taken by the government to exercise stringent controls on the use of foreign labour in the local market.
Taking into consideration the mischief which the EFWA was intended to deal with and applying the literal meaning of the words in s 23(1), the appellant was evidently a second offender under s 5(1). The present conviction for abetting an offence under s 5(1) is, by virtue of the wording in s 23(1), regarded as an offence under s 5(1). Since the appellant already had a previous conviction under s 5(1), the present conviction must constitute his second conviction under the section. Such being the case, the enhanced punishment provided in s 5(6)(b)(i) must be applied and the mandatory custodial sentence be imposed. To put matters beyond any doubt, I shall further clarify that, if the situation had been the converse, i. e. if the first conviction was for the abetment of an offence under s 5(1) and the second conviction was for committing the substantive offence under s 5(1), the enhanced punishment would similarly be attracted.
Pausing here, it is necessary for me to emphasise that the above interpretation is particular to the provisions of the EFWA, which were specifically worded by Parliament in order to deal with the mischief behind the Act. To illustrate this point, the wording in s 23(1) of the EFWA can be contrasted with the general provisions on abetment in the Penal Code (Cap 224). Section 109 of the Penal Code provides that `whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence`. It should be noted immediately that this provision, as well as the other abetment provisions in the Penal Code, is unlike that of s 23(1) EFWA, in that it does not explicitly provide that the abettor will be treated as being guilty of the substantive offence. At a conceptual level and on the question of conviction, an abetment offence is certainly still distinct from the substantive principal offence. Therefore, the holding in this case should not be interpreted to mean that in all cases, an abetment offence would automatically be treated as being the same as the substantive principal offence. It also does not mean that a conviction for an abetment offence will always attract enhanced punishment once the accused person is shown to have a prior conviction for the principal offence abetted. As I mentioned earlier, whether or not enhanced punishment should be imposed would depend very much on the exact wording of the provisions dealing with the abetment offence and the substantive principal offence.
The effect of the wording of s 23(1) of the EFWA is largely for the purposes of sentencing. Thus, in my view, counsel for the appellant misinterpreted the trial judge`s statement that, `abetment is therefore equally culpable as the substantive offence`. The trial judge had preceded this statement with the remark that the offence of abetment carries the same punishment as the substantive offence. Hence, what the trial judge actually meant was that, for the purposes of sentencing, the offence of abetment shall be treated in the same way as the substantive offence.
 Rules of statutory interpretation 
 
 
 
In the light of the above conclusions, I am of the opinion that there is no room for the application of the rules of statutory interpretation argued by counsel for the appellant. The literal meaning of s 23(1) and s 5(6)(b)(i) is clear and apparent from the words of the provisions and does not require the court to adopt any purposive approach whatsoever in interpreting them. In any case, I do not think that the adoption of a purposive approach towards reading the sections would have reached a different result from that which I have arrived at earlier. In addition, the presumption of construing penal provisions in favour of the accused is only applicable where there is some ambiguity or doubt over the interpretation or where there are two different reasonable constructions of the penal sections. This is not the case in the present appeal.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Whilst counsel for the appellant presented his arguments with diligence before this court, he failed to convince me that he was right on the facts and the law of this case. Given the wording of the provisions in the EFWA and the important policy considerations behind that statute, I am of the view that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was correct and therefore the appeal should be dismissed. Accordingly I so order.

: On 13 November 1999, at about 8.20pm, officers from the Gambling Suppression Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department conducted a raid on a factory located at 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4 (`the premises`). The raiding party found the main gate to the factory compound unlocked. They proceeded to enter and made their way to an office on the ground floor of the factory. Inside, they found a group of eight people gathered around a table, engaged in a game of pai kow. The raiding party identified themselves by shouting `police`, and proceeded to arrest all eight persons in the office. Apparently, there was one other person who managed to escape arrest by slipping out through the rear entrance of the office. The police found several items lying on the table, including cash amounting to $440, domino tiles, a few dice and a pair of chopsticks. A further search of the drawers in the office revealed other items such as English playing cards, sih seh cards, coloured chips, a box of domino tiles and some mahjong tiles. However, the mahjong tiles did not constitute a complete set.
Of the eight people arrested, seven were charged with gaming in a common gaming house under s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49) (`the Act`). All seven pleaded guilty and were fined $1000. The eighth person arrested, the appellant in the present case, was the tenant of the premises. He was charged under s 4(1)(b) of the Act which reads: 
 
Any person who permits a place of which he is the owner or occupier or of which he has the use temporarily or otherwise to be kept or used by another person as a common gaming house shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.
 
 
 
The charge read as follows: 
 
You ... are charged that you on or about 13 November 1999 at or about 8.20pm, at No 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4, office at the ground floor, Singapore, being the temporary owner of the said premises, did permit the said premises to be used as a common gaming house and you have thereby committed an offence under s 4(1)(b) of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49) and punishable under s 4(1) of the same Act.
 
 
 
The trial judge held that by virtue of the gaming paraphernalia seized from the premises, the presumption in s 17 of the Act came into play. Section 17 reads: 
 
Where in any proceedings under this Act any instruments or appliances for gaming are found in any place entered under this Act or upon any person found in such place, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the place is a common gaming house and that it is so kept, used or permitted to be used by the owner or occupier thereof and that any other person found in such place or escaping from it is gaming therein.
 
 
 
At the end of the trial, the judge was of the view that the appellant had failed to satisfactorily rebut the presumption. The appellant was accordingly convicted and sentenced to a fine of $20,000 and a term of imprisonment of two months. The appellant appealed.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The term `common gaming house` is defined in s 2(1) of the Act as follows: 
 
The term `common gaming house` includes any place kept or used for gaming to which the public or any class of the public has or may have access, and any place kept for habitual gaming, whether the public or any class of the public has or may have access thereto or not ...
 
 
 
The definition thus incorporates two alternative limbs: 
(a) there is freedom of access to the place, available to the public or any class of the public, or 
(b) the place is kept for habitual gaming.
A place will be a `common gaming house` if it falls into either of the two limbs. The trial judge below evaluated the facts and formed the view that the premises fell into the second limb, ie that they were kept for `habitual gaming`.
 (i) Frequency of the gaming sessions
It appeared that the chief factor relied upon by the trial judge was the frequency of the gaming sessions. At the trial, the defence called as witnesses three of the persons who were arrested on the premises. They were DW2, DW3 and DW4. Another one of the persons arrested on the premises was called as a witness for the prosecution, PW2. The defence also called DW5, who claimed to be the person who slipped away just as the raiding party was entering the premises. Each of these witnesses gave evidence as to how many times they had ever gambled on the premises. The evidence of these witnesses is tabulated as follows:
 
 
Witness
 
Number of times that witness ever gambled on the premises
 
 
 
PW2
 
Five to six
 
 
 
DW2
 
Two to three
 
 
 
DW3
 
Five
 
 
 
DW4
 
Two to three
 
 
 
DW5
 
Four to five
 
 
 
 
The trial judge further made reference to the following exchange that took place during the appellant`s cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: In a week, how many times do you meet your business associates and gamble with them? 
 
A: Many times a week. 
 
Q: How long has this taken place? 
 
A: Many times.
  
 
 
In the light of all the evidence, the trial judge held: 
 
The varying number of sessions as testified by the various witnesses together with what the accused said during cross-examination indicate that the sessions were frequent, to the extent of many times a week.
 
 
 
It appeared that the trial judge erred, in that he took too literal an approach to the term `habitual gaming`. It is not uncommon for a person to invite his friends over for a game of, say, poker. This may happen more than once a week, and may even take place every week. There may even be monetary stakes involved. In such an example, it would not put too much of a strain on the English language to say that the host`s premises become a place where `habitual gaming` occurs. However, it is absurd to say that the host by doing this opens himself up to criminal liability under the Common Gaming Houses Act. Not surprisingly, the courts take a purposive approach towards the interpretation of the second limb of the definition of `common gaming house`. In 
R v Fong Chong Cheng
 
 
[1930] SSLR 139
 , Stevens J explained that the second limb of the `common gaming house` definition refers to (at p 145): 
 
... a place which, though barred to the public, is kept or used by the owners or occupiers primarily for the purpose of gaming. I say `primarily` because I think it is clear that a place does not become a common gaming house merely because gaming habitually occurs in it. A private residence is not a common gaming house because the owner makes a practice of inviting his friends to it to gamble. Nor in my opinion do the premises of an ordinary social club become a common gaming house merely because the club provides facilities for its members to gamble, and some of them habitually use the premises for that purpose ...
 
 
 
It is therefore not enough merely for the gambling sessions to be frequent. The premises must be kept primarily for gambling. This was prima facie not the case here. The appellant was the director and major shareholder of two timber companies: Tat Hin Timber Co Ptd Ltd (incorporated in 1978) and also Kar Hin Timber Company Pte Ltd (incorporated in 1980). It was the appellant`s case that both companies had been carrying on business at the premises since 1981, which was when he first rented the premises from the Jurong Town Corporation. This claim was also supported by the General Manager of Kar Hin Timber Company Pte Ltd, one Teo Biow Hin (DW6), who testified that Kar Hin Timber Company Pte Ltd had been carrying on business at the premises for about 20 years. That both companies were live and substantial companies was evidenced by the statements of account, sales invoices and delivery orders tendered by the appellant in the court below.
There will of course be instances when premises are ostensibly used for some legitimate purpose, eg as a residential home or as a club, but where the legitimate purpose is in effect only a facade to hide the fact that the primary purpose of the premises is in fact gaming. This possibility was canvassed by me in 
PP v Yap Ah Yoon
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 763
 , where I made the following observation (at p 766): 
 
A common feature of these cases ... is that the premises in question were all social or recreation clubs, or at least purported to be so. In such cases, 
 the real question was whether the club premises were devoted exclusively to gaming
 or to general social purposes among which games of chance were included. The distinction is between a bona fide social or recreation club, and one which is used ostensibly as such but which is in reality kept and used for gaming purposes ...
 
 
 
The approach is similar when it is a private residence which is alleged to be a common gaming house ... 
 The question must be whether it is in reality used as a private residence or it is in fact, behind the facade of a personal dwelling, primarily kept for gaming
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
If the presumption in s 17 of the Act is applicable, the onus will be on the accused to show that it is not just a facade. Thus, when the accused in 
 Yap Ah Yoon 
 tried to argue that the premises were used primarily as a private residence and not for gaming, the burden was held to be on him to show that the premises were in fact not primarily used for gaming. On the facts of that case, all that the accused could show was that there were people living on the premises. As this fact was still equally consistent with the premises being used primarily for gaming, I found that the presumption was not rebutted.
In the present case, however, the testimony of the general manager, DW6, that business associates came to the premises on normal working days to discuss about buying and selling timber, remained unshaken throughout. The photographs of the premises also revealed that timber was in fact stored on the premises. This, coupled with the documentary evidence adduced, tended to show that the businesses of the two companies were genuine and not just a facade. On the totality of the facts, it appeared that the appellant had successfully demonstrated that the premises were not primarily used for gaming.
The frequency of the gaming sessions may nevertheless be a very relevant consideration under certain circumstances. One may well conceive of a situation where the frequency of gaming sessions occurring in a place is so high that an inference may be raised that the place is in fact used primarily for gaming. That may well have formed the basis for the decision in 
R v Singapore British Malay Football Club
 
 
[1934] MLJ 3
 
 
[1933] SSLR 431
 , where it was held that the club in question was used primarily for gaming, and that its other activities were only ancillary.
In the present case, however, there was no evidence that the gaming sessions were frequent. The persons caught gaming on the premises had been acquainted with the appellant for a very long time, for periods ranging from ten to 30 years. The premises had been tenanted to the appellant for about 20 years. Yet PW2, who gave the highest figure (regarding how many times he had ever gambled on the premises), could only say that he gambled on the premises for five or six times. PW2 said that he had known the appellant `for over twenty years`. Six times in 20 years cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be categorised as `frequent` for present purposes.
The evidence of PW1, who was one of the police officers in the raiding party, was as follows: 
 
Prior to 13.11.99 [ie the night of the raid], observations were conducted at the premises. More than two observations were conducted. Thereafter, there was instruction to conduct the raid.
 
 
 
That was it. The prosecution below did not even bother to explain what was seen on those two occasions when observations were conducted. No other evidence was proffered by the prosecution as to the frequency of the gaming sessions on the premises. On the totality of the facts, there is nothing to show that gaming on the premises was ever conducted `many times a week`.
I was therefore far from satisfied that the frequency of the gaming sessions on the premises was such as to bring the premises into the second limb of the definition of `common gaming house`.
 (ii) The stakes involved
Another factor relied upon by the trial judge was the stakes involved. The trial judge held (at GD [para ] 28): 
 
The accused and his witnesses gave varying range of stakes involved during the sessions. PW2 said that the stakes were from $200 to $300, although he further testified that on 13 November 1999, the stakes were only $10 to $50. The accused said that the stakes were from $10 to $100. The remaining defence witnesses said that the stakes were from $10-$50. The evidence of the accused and PW2 as regards the stakes are inconsistent with the evidence of the rest of witnesses. Taking into account that the accused had the burden to rebut the presumptions against him, this reluctance to disclose precisely both the amount of stakes and earlier, the number of sessions are clearly factors not in his favour.
 
 
 
First and foremost, nowhere in the record of appeal did it show that the appellant was cross-examined as to the issue regarding stakes. In his examination-in-chief, the appellant stated quite categorically that each individual`s stake would usually range from $10 to $100. That being the case, one could not help but wonder how the trial judge came up with the observation that the appellant displayed `reluctance to disclose precisely the amount of stakes`.
The trial judge also appeared to be influenced by the apparent inconsistency in the evidence regarding the stakes. With respect, there was no inconsistency here. The appellant said that the stakes ranged from $10 to $100. The other defence witnesses said that the stakes ranged from $10 to $50. PW2 also said that on the night of the raid the stakes ranged from $10 to $50. These figures were corroborated by the fact that, on the night of the raid, there were eight people (including the appellant) playing pai kow, and the total amount of money seized from the table amounted to $440; an inference may therefore be drawn that the stake per person on that night was about $55 per person. The ranges given were thus roughly similar and it would serve no useful purpose to nitpick over what were evidently minor and inconsequential differences in the detail.
The trial judge thus erred in holding that the evidence pertaining to the stakes were `clearly not in [the appellant`s] favour`.
 (iii) The fact that DW5 fled from the scene
DW5 was one of the players on the premises at the time of the raid but he managed to slip away through the rear entrance just when the police stormed in. At the trial below, DW5 was called by the defence and he explained why he had fled. According to him, he thought that the raiding officers were robbers. Being afraid, he ran. This explanation was clearly a lie. It was PW1`s testimony that the raiding party had shouted `police` when they stormed into the factory office. Furthermore, DW5 was unable to explain why he did not stop to ask for help when he saw (and he admitted that he did see) the police cars outside the premises.
DW5`s conduct appeared to have carried great weight in the mind of the trial judge, who held: 
 
If the accused and his business acquaintances were only having a `friendly` session amongst close friends as claimed, why was there a need for DW5 to flee? This goes to show that DW5 knew that they were habitually gambling in a common gaming house and when the police raided the place, he simply fled.
 
 
 
With respect, the trial judge may have attributed to DW5`s conduct a greater significance than it deserved. DW5 may have fled for a variety of reasons. He may personally have had something to hide from the police that was unconnected to the rest of the other gamblers. Or he may have run because he thought that in gaming on the premises, he was doing something illegal. However, whether the gaming that took place that night was in fact illegal depended not on whether DW5, in his panic-stricken state of mind, believed it to be illegal, but on whether it was illegal from the objective viewpoint of the law. And from the objective viewpoint of the law, whether the gaming in the present case was illegal or not depended on the question of whether the premises were used primarily for gaming. If the answer to that question was `no`, then the premises did not constitute a common gaming house; the fact that DW5 may have thought that gaming on the premises was wrong could not convert an otherwise legitimate gathering into an illegal gaming session.
 (iv) The plea of guilt from the other arrested persons
All the other gamblers arrested on the premises pleaded guilty to a charge of gaming in a common gaming house. However, in the court below, DW2, DW3, DW4 and even PW2 said that they pleaded guilty to an offence of `gathering to gamble` and not `gaming in a common gaming house`. They said that they did not even know what a `common gaming house` was.
The trial judge nevertheless held: 
 
The charge which they pleaded guilty to ... clearly stated that 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4 was used as a common gaming house and the seven of them were charged under s 7 of the Act which carried a lesser penalty than the accused`s charge. The statement of facts also stated that they had committed an offence of `[d]id (sic) game in a Common Gaming House ...
 
 
 
... in so far as the gamblers` evidence that they merely pleaded guilty to a charge of gambling and not gambling in a common gaming house, it was my finding that they pleaded guilty to a charge under s 7 for gambling in a common gaming house.
 
 
 
The trial judge then concluded: 
 
It was therefore my finding that the fellow gamblers` plea of guilt and subsequent conviction under s 7 for gambling in a common gaming house is a relevant consideration in determining whether 31 Sungei Kadut Street 4 was indeed used as a common gaming house ... I would however add that it was not my sole criteria of coming to the conclusion that the premises were used as a common gaming house.
 
 
 
With respect, the plea of guilt by the other arrested persons did not in any way show that the premises were in fact a common gaming house. The very fact that they pleaded guilty showed that the crux of the present case, ie whether the premises fell within the second limb of the definition of common gaming house, was never argued.
 Particularity of the charge 
 
 
 
There was one further matter that was not raised on appeal but which nonetheless had some importance. The charge alleged that the premises were used as a common gaming house, but did not say which limb of the term `common gaming house` was being relied on. The charge here was thus similar to that in the case of 
Abdul Kareem v R
 
 
[1957] MLJ 185
 , where the charge read: 
 
You are charged that you ... did assist in the management of a common betting house and you have thereby committed an offence under s 4(1)(c) of the Betting Ordinance ...
 
 
 
In quashing the conviction, Shepherd J held (at p 190): 
 
The definition of `common betting-house` in the Ordinance clearly presupposes as I have said the existence of two types of common betting-house within the meaning of the Ordinance - the first being what I will call the `open type` where the public have access, and the second being what I will call the `closed type`, where the public have no access but where habitual betting is carried on. The prosecution have not made it clear to which type they have referred in the charge and I consider that this omission may well have prejudiced the defence ...
 
 
 
There will of course be situations where the lack of particularity causes no prejudice. A good example is seen in the case of 
 Loh Ah Kow v PP 
 [2000] 4 SLR, which was recently decided by me. In that case, it was clear from the notes of evidence that both the prosecution and the defence proceeded on the basis of the first limb of the definition of `common gaming house`. The accused never bothered to even address or adduce evidence pertaining to the question of whether the premises in question fell within the second limb. All the arguments advanced by the accused were tailored to defend the case on the first limb, ie to show that the gamblers present were friends of the accused`s workers and not members of the public. When the accused was eventually convicted on the basis that the premises did fall within the first limb, it could not realistically be said that any prejudice was caused by the omission of the charge to indicate from the onset that the prosecution was relying on the first limb and not the second.
In the present case, the trial judge held: 
 
Although the defence sought to use the case of 
Abdul Kareem v R
 
 
[1957] MLJ 185
  for the proposition that the prosecution must make it clear which type of common gaming house they are relying on, I wish to point out that throughout the trial and from the way the defence was conducted, they were aware which limb under the definition of `common gaming house` in s 2(1) of the Act they were defending the case on, that is, the `closed type` for habitual gaming. It was the defences` stand throughout the trial that the gambling was between close friends and there was no access to the public.
 
 
 
As can be seen from the case of 
 Loh Ah Kow 
, if the case is fought on the first limb, the accused will invariably seek to adduce evidence showing how the gamblers on the premises were his friends and therefore could not constitute the `public or any class of the public`. That is precisely what happened in the trial below. The witnesses called by the appellant were mainly the people who were arrested during the raid. They were called to give evidence as to how they had known the appellant for between ten and 30 years. It was evident that the appellant`s case below was very much tailored to establish that the premises did not fall within the first limb of the definition of `common gaming house` This was a reasonable course of action to take; seeing as how the entrance to the premises were unlocked, it was conceivable that the prosecution might mount an argument that the premises were open to the public. The very fact that the trial judge could make the observation that 
 
[i]t was the defence`s stand throughout the trial that the gambling was between close friends and there was no access to the public [at GD [para ] 45].
 
 
 
showed that the appellant could well have been defending the case on the first limb. As such, the trial judge may have fallen into error when he declared that the defence 
 
were aware which limb under the definition of `common gaming house` in s 2(1) of the Act they were defending the case on, that is, the `closed type` for habitual gaming [ie the second limb]. [At GD [para ] 45.]
 
 
 
For the above reasons, it was conceivable that the appellant was unsure as to which limb the prosecution would be proceeding on at trial, and that he was left to guess which front would have to be defended. This may then justify an inference that the insufficient particularity of the charge prejudiced the appellant. I repeat once again the observation that I made in the case of 
PP v Anuar bin Arshad
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 52
  (at p 57): 
 
As a general rule, it cannot be satisfactory for the prosecution to prefer charges which lack clarity and specificity. The defence should be entitled to know the prosecution`s allegations with a reasonable degree of particularity, and not left to guess what these allegations will be.
 
 
 
Much less confusion will be created if the charge states clearly from the start whether the prosecution will be relying on the first or second limb, or both.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
The law is clear. In order for premises to be `habitually` used for gaming within the meaning of the second limb of the definition of the term `common gaming house`, they must be used primarily for gaming. This limitation must be borne in mind, for to read the word `habitually` literally would turn the Act into a giant dragnet with no clearly defined boundaries. All and sundry would then be caught by the Act, from the hardcore gaming house operator who earns his living by operating an underground casino, to the bored housewife who invites her contemporaries over for a weekly mahjong session. In the present case, it seemed that the trial judge below did not fully appreciate the purport and extent of the limitation. The evidence showed that the premises were primarily used for the businesses of two live and substantial companies. The gaming that occurred on the premises, if it could even be deemed to have been frequent at all, was only incidental (see 
R v Li Kim Poat & Anor
 
 
[1933] MLJ 164
 
 
[1933] SSLR 129
 ) to the business conducted on the premises. The premises could not have been said to be used primarily for gaming.
On a more general level, it is imperative that one does not lose sight of common sense when deciding whether to bring a prosecution. The totality of the facts must be examined. In the present case, DW2 said that he knew the appellant for `close to 30 years`. DW3 said that he knew the appellant for `more than 20 years`. DW4 said that he knew the appellant `since 1979`. DW5 said that he knew the appellant for `ten years over`. PW2 said that he knew the appellant `for over 20 years`. All of them were involved in the timber business and had thus been business associates. Furthermore, the atmosphere that night was nothing like that in a gaming house. The stakes were not very high. In fact, the raiding officer PW1 herself testified that the excess money from the gaming stakes was used to buy food and drinks. Common sense would thus tell a person that the activity on the premises was strongly characteristic of a friendly game between people who had known each other for a long time. It could not have been the intention of the legislature that such activity should fall within the purview of the Act.
The appeal was therefore allowed and the conviction set aside. The fine paid by the appellant was also ordered to be refunded.

: The plaintiff bank granted banking facility by way of a facility letter dated 1 November 1996 to the defendant. The letter was signed by the parties and it stated that an attached set of Standard terms and Conditions applied to the contract. There was a clause in the standard terms stipulating that the choice of law in the event of dispute shall be Singapore law. The defendant claimed that the standard terms were not attached as stipulated.
The facility granted was up to RM$16,000,000. The defendant also deposited 100,000 shares in Mercury Industries Bhd as security for the facility. Loans were extended from time to time under the said facility on instructions by the defendant to purchase shares. The shares would be deposited as further security and paid for from the facility.
By 25 August 1997 the value of the defendant`s security fell to RM$9,555,520 while her outstanding loan was RM$15,416,000. The plaintiff demanded payment by letter dated 2 September 1997 to the defendant at her home address. The defendant was informed that if payment was not made by 10 September 1997 the plaintiff would proceed to sell some of the security. No payment was made. Another letter was sent on 26 September 1997 but the defendant did not pay. The plaintiff sold various parcels of the security on various dates, leaving presently about 1,300,00 share unsold and an outstanding debt of about RM$13,169,951.19. The facility was cancelled on 20 February 1998.
The defendant disputed liability. She raised three defences. First, a defence in law in that the contract was illegal under Malaysian law. Her counsel Mr Lai submitted that the choice of law clause does not apply because the standard terms were not given to the defendant and in any event, the transactions took place in Malaysia. Since no evidence was adduced as to the law in Malaysia which rendered such contracts illegal, this defence failed at the start. Mr Lai for the defendant urged me to consider the Malaysian statute which created the offence he complained of and make the appropriate finding. I am loathe to do so; the plaintiff was not charged, let alone convicted, of any offence relating to the said statute. A finding of fact of the nature that Mr Lai wishes me to make requires a thorough investigation into facts which were not pleaded. In my view, this is not the appropriate place to find whether the plaintiff had committed an offence under Malaysian law.
The second defence was that the defendant contracted as a nominee for one Dato Peh Teck Quee. The case submitted by Mr Lai bore little resemblance to that pleaded. In the defence, the defendant averred that it was Richard Yong, the plaintiff`s then head of private banking, who `represented to the defendant that she would only be her boss`s (Dato Peh) nominee in accordance with the plaintiff`s internal policies and the inclusion of her name was just a formality`.
The case as pleaded was not one in which the defendant did not know what she signed, or that she signed it as agent for a named principal. The way it was pleaded suggested that the plaintiff knew and accepted that she was not the principal; and further led her to believe that she would not be liable under the contract. A pleading in this vein normally concludes with an averment of estoppel. But not so in this case. The pleading ended abruptly in that one paragraph. In the midst of the defence case at trial Mr Lai sought leave to re-amend that paragraph. Mr Nair for the plaintiff did not object. The defence was then re-amended to state that the facility agreement was made by the defendant as agent for Dato Peh. The defence of estoppel was not raised. It was an outright denial of liability on the ground that the defendant was an agent for a named principal.
Even so, this defence is not supported by the evidence. The facility letter was signed by the defendant with no reference to any principal. The accompanying memorandum of deposit was executed by the defendant in her own capacity. She warranted in writing that she was the beneficial owner of the shares in Mercury Industries Bhd which were deposited as security. Letters were written and signed by her giving instructions to the plaintiff to appoint the chairman for meetings of Mercury Industries Bhd on the defendant`s behalf `as beneficial owner` of the shares.
The defendant and Dato Peh testified in court to the effect that the defendant was only Dato Peh`s secretary and she was holding all the shares on Dato Peh`s behalf. Dato Peh is a qualified architect with diverse business interests. The defendant stated her occupation to be that of a company director (of about four companies) and also a personal assistant. She also declared her net worth to be RM$50,000,000 and an annual income of RM$120,000. Their testimonies in court were contradicted by the express warranties in the documents executed by the defendant.
It may be that the defendant was indeed an agent acting for Dato Peh who was prepared to lend her name to be used in opening an account with the plaintiff. The fact that she worked for him as his assistant may give rise to this suspicion; but suspicion is short of proof. The point, however, which the defendant failed to appreciate is that in law, if she puts her signature to a commercial document agreeing to be bound by it then she will be so bound. In the absence of any proven estoppel there is no defence in such cases. Here the defendant failed to establish any estoppel in fact or in her pleadings. The law is simply but explicitly stated by Scrutton LJ in 
HO Brandt & Co Ltd v HN Morris & Co Ltd
 
[1917] 2 KB 784
 as follows: 
 
The fact that a person is agent and is known so to be does not of itself prevent his incurring personal liability. Whether he does so is to be determined by the nature and terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances. Where he contracts on behalf of a foreign principal there is a presumption that he is incurring a personal liability unless a contrary intention appears; and similarly where he signs in his own name without qualification.
 
 
 
Considering all the evidence, I am unable to conclude that any representation had been made by the plaintiff or their employees to the defendant which led her to believe that she was only a nominee. I am of the view that the defendant held herself out as the principal person responsible for the account by signing the facility letter without qualification.
Business cannot be carried on with confidence if parties to an agreement can repudiate liability merely by alleging that they signed only as an agent. If the so-called principal wishes to acknowledge liability, he must do so when the contract is made, not after a breach has occurred. The plaintiff is entitled to pursue the person they contracted with.
The last defence here was based on negligence. There was, however, no plea for damages in a counterclaim nor was the defence of set-off pleaded. Nonetheless, the defence as it was put forward was that the plaintiff ought to have sold all the security in its possession because it would then clear the defendant`s debt with more to spare. This defence failed for lack of evidence. On the contrary, the evidence shows that by the time the plaintiff called on the loan (about September 1997) the value of the security deposited had fallen much below the debt. The agreement had, furthermore, given the plaintiff the discretion to sell, and therefore, the discretion to hold back if they think it inappropriate to do so. Mr Nair for the plaintiff also referred the defendant and her witness, Dato Peh, to letters which they wrote requesting the plaintiff not to sell the shares and to give them time. It was incumbent upon the defendant, having raised the allegation of negligence, to adduce proof as to how the security was disposed of (or held over) recklessly or negligently. Mere evidence that the plaintiff sold the security at their discretion is woefully inadequate because that was precisely what the contract permitted them to do. In the circumstances, this defence had no merit whatsoever. Accordingly, the plaintiffs` claim is allowed.

: The appellant was convicted of the following charge in the district court: 
 
You, Sivalingam Suresh, Male/32 yrs (NRIC No: S1758963F) (DOB: 30 November 1966) are charged that you, on 6 August 1998, at or about 10am, at Blk 319 Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 [num ]11-1503, did use criminal force to one Mokbul Md Sharaf Ali Shiekh, Male/26 yrs, intending to outrage the modesty of the said person, to wit, by holding a knife in your right hand and pointing it at his lower abdomen and using your left hand to unzip his trousers and to touch the groin of the said person, and in order to commit this offence, you voluntarily caused fear of instant hurt to the said Mokbul Md Sharaf Ali Sheikh, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The appellant was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. He appealed against his conviction. I heard his appeal and dismissed it. These were my reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The victim, Mokbul Md Sharaf, was a Bangladeshi cleaner employed by Boley Contract Company Pte Ltd. On 6 August 1998, at about 10am, the victim was sweeping the corridor on the 11th floor of Blk 319 Ang Mo Kio when the appellant called and gestured the victim towards the appellant`s flat, [num ]11-1503. The victim moved over, thinking that the appellant wanted him to clean that part of the corridor. Instead the appellant gestured for the victim to enter the flat. When the victim refused, the appellant grabbed the victim`s hand, pulled him in, and closed the metal gate and wooden door.
Inside the flat, the appellant forced the victim to sit down on the sofa in the living room by pulling his hand. The appellant then played a video tape which was screened on the television in front of the sofa. After 10 to 12 seconds of watching the tape, the victim realised that it was a pornographic video. He screamed and tried to leave. The appellant prevented him from doing so by taking a knife from the table in front of the sofa with his right hand and pointing it at the victim`s lower abdomen. With his left hand, the appellant unzipped the victim`s trousers and used that hand to stroke the victim`s private parts over his underwear.
After 10 to 12 seconds of stroking, the victim overcame his fear and rushed towards the door. He tried opening the door but had difficulty doing so. The appellant then moved towards the door and opened it. The victim rushed out of the flat and down to the rubbish centre at Blk 305 to inform his supervisor. The victim had only worked in Singapore for about two and a half months before the incident, having arrived in May 1998, and did not speak English. The supervisor paged for another Bangladeshi worker, Najir, to interpret. After Najir`s translation, the supervisor called his boss to inform him of the incident. The boss came down to the rubbish centre and brought all of them to the Neighbourhood Police Post. The boss told the police officer on duty, Sergeant Tan Choon Guan (`Sgt Tan`), what transpired and a police report was made.
The party was told to return to the void deck to meet Staff Sergeant Lee On Keat (`S/Sgt Lee`). After meeting up, they went to the appellant`s flat. When the appellant opened the door and saw S/Sgt Lee, he immediately closed the door. A minute or two later, he opened the door. S/Sgt Lee spoke with the appellant. The appellant denied the incident. S/Sgt Lee then asked the victim, Najir, the supervisor and the boss to proceed to Ang Mo Kio Police Station. While they were on their way, they noticed a videotape lying on the ground floor directly below the kitchen window of the appellant`s flat. The police subsequently came to remove the videotape. The cartridge of the tape was damaged when found. The videotape was sent to the Films and Publications Department to be placed in a new cartridge and to be viewed. The tape was confirmed by the Board of Film Censors to contain an obscene film. When the police raided the appellant`s flat at around 8.30pm on the day of the incident, they recovered a knife which the victim identified as being similar to the one used by the appellant.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The defence was a denial of the incident. The victim`s complaint was attributed as an action carried out in revenge by the victim for being barked at by the appellant`s dogs outside the appellant`s flat. The appellant`s case was that, while returning to his flat with his two dogs, his female dog barked at the victim when they walked past him. The victim tried to chase the dog away with a dustpan, and also tried kicking the dog. The victim claimed that the dog bit him and shouted abuses at the appellant. When the appellant carried his dogs into the flat the victim stood outside and continued to shout at him. As the dogs were barking, the appellant carried them to his bedroom. At this time, the victim entered the living room. In the ensuing argument, the appellant pushed the victim out of the flat.
 Decision of the trial judge 
 
 
 
The trial judge found that the prosecution`s case was proved beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the appellant.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appeal was initially against conviction and sentence. The appellant subsequently applied for leave to withdraw the appeal against sentence and I granted it. The appeal was therefore only against conviction. At the trial the appellant`s defence was essentially that the victim was lying. His ground of appeal was essentially that the trial judge was wrong to believe him.
In respect of appeals against findings of fact, it has been held by the Court of Appeal in 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence, and that, in examining the evidence, an appellate court has to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses. This being a case involving a sexual offence, a further principle was borne in mind, that it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone unless the evidence is unusually compelling; see 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 .
The appellant sought to disturb the trial judge`s findings of fact by raising several inconsistencies in the victim`s evidence. For example, much was made of the fact that the victim admitted under cross-examination that he was forced to drink beer but could not remember whether it was before or after the alleged molest, nor whether it was in canned or bottled form. However, neither the exact timing of the beer incident nor the type of beer container, was material to the victim`s evidence or to the prosecution`s case that a sexual offence was committed.
In a similar vein, the appellant tried to argue that the victim`s inability to positively identify the knife was detrimental to the prosecution`s case. However, the pointing of the knife only occurred for a short period of time, of about 10 to 12 seconds. During this brief period, the victim`s mind could easily, and was more likely to, have been preoccupied with the appellant`s actions of unzipping him and touching him on his private parts.
Much is also made of the fact that there was no mention of molest in the FIR. The text of the FIR read: 
 
Complt infd that he was assaulted by someone and the subject had also threaten him with a knife not to call for police.
 
 
 
This really was an inconsequential quibble. The fact that the word `assault` was used was understandable when the context of the recording of the FIR was taken into consideration. It was the evidence of duty officer Sgt Tan that at the Neighbourhood Police Post, the victim made gestures of pulling, dragging and of a knife being pointed to his abdomen. No translation was made by Najir and it was the victim`s boss who helped to explain what had happened. Sgt Tan then phoned the Division Operations Room (`DOR`) to inform them that `a Town Council cleaner was abused by a male Indian worker and the subject threatened him with a knife not to call the police`. The word `abused` was subsequently recorded as `assaulted` in the FIR by the DOR.
Importantly, it was undisputed that, when the victim first told Najir of the incident at the rubbish centre, he said that he had been molested. There was also no dispute that Najir told the supervisor and the boss that the victim said that he had been molested and that this was their understanding. Neither was there any dispute that, when S/Sgt Lee met up with the party at the void deck, he was told that there was a molest. Moreover, what was recorded in the FIR was consistent with the overall story of the victim.
The appellant also argued that it was unrealistic and unbelievable that the victim made no attempt to run when he was pulled into the flat and made to sit on the sofa. He argued that the victim would not have needed to have watched the pornographic videotape before realising that something objectionable was going on. However, the victim`s explanation was a believable one, that, although he did not want to enter the flat or sit down, he did not scream or hold on to the gate because he did not know at that point of time what the appellant`s intention was. The appellant`s intention only became apparent when the pornographic videotape was screened. The trial judge also noted that the victim was of a diminutive build, of about five feet in height and 50 to 55 kilograms in weight, in contrast to the appellant`s `intimidating and bulky frame`, and that the appellant could have easily pulled the victim in and forced him to sit down.
Neither was it unrealistic that the victim did not attempt to run when being pulled into the house, but did do so while a knife was being pointed at him. As the victim explained, he did not fully resist when being pulled into the house because he did not know at that time what was going on. It was very plausible that, when the appellant started moving his left hand over the victim`s private parts, the horror from what was going on and the fear of what might follow spurred him to try to escape, even in the face of a knife.
In addition, the ability of the victim to escape from the appellant when the knife was being pointed at him was consistent with the victim`s story that the appellant let him out of the house when the victim fumbled at the door. The appellant in turn argued that there was no reason for the appellant to let the victim out of the house. However, the appellant`s intention was molest, not indefinite restraint, and it was very plausible that he would let the victim out after molesting him.
The thrust of the matter was that what the appellant claimed to be vital gaps in the victim`s evidence were in truth immaterial, and what the appellant claimed to be unrealistic behaviour in the victim`s story was in fact highly believable, plausible and consistent.
The weight of the evidence was heavily in the prosecution`s favour. A contemporaneous complaint was made to the supervisor, Najir, the boss and then the police. It has been said in Tang Kin Seng that there is no reason why a complainant`s distress cannot be a weighty piece of evidence in the right circumstances, provided that the danger of feigned distress is kept in mind; see 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
  at 67.
In the present case, there were several factors in firm support of the victim`s complaint. The victim`s story was congruent and believable. While the pornographic videotape was not positively identified as belonging to the appellant, the fact that such a video tape was found directly below the kitchen window of the appellant`s flat at that time was consistent with the victim`s story that he was made to watch a pornographic videotape. The appellant`s actions in closing the wooden door immediately upon seeing Sgt Tan and opening it a minute or two later was highly suggestive that he did so to get rid of incriminating evidence, such as the desperate act of tossing the videotape out of his flat. On the whole, the victim`s evidence was unusually compelling and satisfied

: This was a petition for criminal revision in which the petitioner sought to have his conviction set aside on the basis that his plea of guilt was a qualified one and therefore should not have been accepted. The hearing of the petition came before me on 4 May 2000 and after listening to arguments from both sides, I dismissed the application and enhanced the sentence imposed on the petitioner. I now give my reasons.
The petitioner pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to the following charge: 
 
You, Teo Hee Heng, are charged that you, on or about 1 June 1999, from about 12:02am to about 9.42pm, in order to the committing of extortion of about $100 attempted to put one [ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ] in fear of certain injury to her daughter, to wit, by telling her over the phone, whilst she was at her place of residence at [ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ] Singapore, his friends are currently holding her daughter [ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ][ast ] and they are playboys who prey on young girls and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 385 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Due to an impending rape case in the High Court, the prosecution made an application under s 7(3) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) for the names and addresses of the victim and her daughter not to be published so as to protect their identities and such was ordered accordingly by the district judge. A further charge of insulting the modesty of the same victim, an offence punishable under s 509 of the Penal Code, was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On his plea of guilt and subsequent conviction, the petitioner was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
The essential background facts of the case can be found in the statement of facts which was prepared by the prosecution following the petitioner`s plea of guilt. It was stated that the victim of the extortion was a 44 year-old lady, who was also the mother of a 12 year-old girl. On 28 May 1999, the victim`s daughter left home and went missing thereafter. The victim subsequently reported the matter to the police and on 31 May 1999, placed advertisements in various newspapers, including the 
 Shin Min Daily 
, requesting for assistance in locating her missing daughter. A copy of the 
 Shin Min Daily 
 with the relevant portion of the newspaper notice of the victim`s missing daughter was later shown to the petitioner by one Leow Yong Kee (`Leow`). Leow then asked the petitioner to call the victim on the pretext that he knew the whereabouts of her missing daughter and to demand $100 wrapped in the victim`s panties, if she wanted information on the whereabouts of her daughter. Leow also gave the petitioner a piece of paper with the victim`s mobile phone number written on it and taught him what to say to the victim.
On 1 June 1999, the petitioner called the victim several times, from about 12.02am to 9.42pm, and told her that his friends were currently holding her daughter and they were `playboys` who preyed on young girls. The petitioner then agreed to lead the victim to her daughter and arranged to meet her on the same day at 4.00pm at the top spiral staircase of Chinatown Point Shopping Centre. He also told the victim that when she arrived at the arranged venue, he would ask her to sit with her legs wide apart so that he could peep at her panties. He further warned the victim not to inform her husband or to report the matter to the police. After the phone call, Leow gave $30 to the petitioner. The victim informed her husband of the arrangement and the latter turned up instead for the appointment at 3.30pm. However, the petitioner did not show up. Later on the same day, the petitioner called up the victim at her home at around 8.45pm and reprimanded her for not turning up at the agreed place. Another appointment was fixed for the next day at 3.30pm. The victim then decided to inform the police and an ambush was prepared to apprehend the petitioner. On 2 June 1999, at about 3.30pm, the victim went to the agreed location and whilst there, was contacted by the petitioner who was using a public telephone. Fearing the safety of her daughter, the victim complied with the petitioner`s instructions to spread her legs wide and thereafter took off her panties to wrap the $100. The victim was subsequently re-directed to different places before finally being told by the petitioner to proceed to Mosque Street. The petitioner was eventually arrested by the police at Block B, Mosque Street, after he was spotted using the public telephone. Upon being questioned, the petitioner admitted to the offences and implicated Leow, who was subsequently arrested at his own residence.
The above facts, which were found in the statement of facts, were all admitted to by the petitioner without any qualifications during the proceedings before the district judge. It should be noted that Leow was also similarly charged as an accomplice to the offence and his case was heard and dealt with separately from that of the petitioner`s. A guilty plea was also tendered by Leow, who was consequently sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. As Leow`s case was heard before the petitioner`s, the district judge in the present case took into account what was imposed on Leow when she was determining the sentence to be passed on the petitioner.
The petitioner initially took out a petition of appeal against the sentence that was imposed on him by the district judge. However, he later decided that he wanted to challenge his conviction and sought to appeal against the correctness of his conviction as well. As the petitioner had pleaded guilty to the offence, he was prevented by s 244 of the Penal Code from bringing an appeal against his conviction. Therefore, the appeal against sentence was withdrawn and a petition for criminal revision was brought instead. In the petition, the defence of duress was raised and it was argued that as the petitioner was actually acting throughout under the threats and instructions of Leow, he did not have the mens rea at all for committing the offence.
 Principles of revision 
 
 
 
The revisionary powers of the High Court are conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) and s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). Pursuant to such powers, the High Court has the discretion to exercise any of the powers conferred by ss 251, 255, 256 and 257 of the CPC, which includes reviewing the conviction passed by the lower courts. However, such powers of revision must be exercised sparingly. In 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 , I had particularly emphasised that although the High Court is capable of reviewing the conviction in exercise of its powers of revision, the very scope of these powers obliges the court to act with great circumspection and only where it is manifestly plain that the offence charged is nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts tendered. It is certainly not the purpose of a criminal revision to become a convenient form of `backdoor appeal` against conviction for accused persons who had pleaded guilty to their charges. Indeed, the governing principle is that the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court should be invoked only if the court is satisfied that some serious injustice has been caused which warrants the exercise of its powers of revision: see 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 , 
Ngian Chin Boon v PP
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 119
  and 
PP v Mohamed Noor bin Abdul Majeed
 
 
[2000] 3 SLR 17
 .
 Duress 
 
 
 
In this application for revision, the petitioner sought to push the entire blame for the incident to Leow and exculpate himself by pleading the defence of duress. It was alleged that Leow had forced the petitioner to make all the phone calls to the victim and had instructed him on what to say. The petitioner claimed that he was actually reluctant to do what Leow had told him to do but did so only out of fear for his own life and that of his girlfriend`s. Apparently, Leow had threatened to rape the petitioner`s girlfriend and said that he would make sure that the petitioner suffered for the rest of his life if he did not comply with Leow`s demands. Leow also pointed a knife at the petitioner and forced him to make the initial phone call and said that nobody would find out even if the petitioner had died. It was claimed that every phone call that the petitioner made to the victim and everything he had said was done only in accordance with Leow`s demands as he was overcome by fear of the threats being carried out and was acting under duress.
I noted that the allegation of the petitioner having acted under threats and compulsion was not exactly an entirely new one. It had in fact already been raised at the trial level before the district judge. It was not disputed that Leow was the one who initiated the idea and was the one who instigated the petitioner to commit the extortion. This fact was properly reflected in the statement of facts as was mentioned earlier. It was also highlighted that the petitioner was of a borderline intelligence and was potentially gullible and easily manipulated by others. He had known Leow since young and they shared an unhealthy relationship where the latter would take advantage of the petitioner`s limited intelligence and frequently bullied, physically abused and threatened the petitioner into doing his bidding. Nonetheless, the petitioner continued his friendship with Leow, if it could even be called one, as Leow was the only companion he knew and could not bear to lose. All these facts were meticulously set out in the petitioner`s mitigation plea that was made before the district judge.
I found that whilst the facts that were claimed by the petitioner before the district judge could be considered believable, the same could not be said of the allegations made in his arguments canvassing for a revision. It did not escape my notice that, after a careful scrutiny of the notes of evidence of the proceedings in the lower court, the statement of facts and the petitioner`s mitigation plea, nowhere was it mentioned that the petitioner had been threatened by Leow in the manner that he was now seeking to allege. Leow may have instigated the petitioner, egged him on in committing the offence and even threatened to assault him if he did not do as Leow instructed but this did not then entitle the petitioner to claim a defence of duress.
The defence of duress is found in s 94 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), which states: 
 
Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonable cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence:
 
 
 
Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.
 
 
 
From the clear words of the section, it was apparent that the defence of duress is available only if the threats gave rise to reasonable fear of `instant death` and nothing short of such a serious threat would be sufficient to constitute duress. Furthermore, such threats must have been `imminent, persistent and extreme`:

Wong Yoke Wah v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 246
 , 
Shaiful Edham bin Adam & Anor v PP
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 57
 . In the present case, even if I had been willing to accept the fresh allegations made by the petitioner, I was not satisfied that the defence would be made out on the facts. The supposed threats made by Leow to the petitioner were certainly not imminent, persistent or extreme. The fact was that when the petitioner arranged and went to meet with the victim and made the phone calls to give her further instructions, Leow was not with the petitioner and was not immediately exerting any threat over him. What was undeniable was that the petitioner was arrested and caught acting alone. From the circumstances, I was of the view that even if Leow had made any threats on the petitioner`s life, it was partly the petitioner`s own doing for having placed himself in such a position since he could easily have extricated himself out of the situation by seeking help from the police instead of continuing to act on Leow`s instigation.
I noted that there was a wider doctrine of duress under the common law that was enunciated by Smith J in the Supreme Court of Victoria case of 
R v Hurley & Murray
 
[1967] VR 526 at 543
. The judge there held that an accused may successfully plead a defence of duress if he is able to show that he committed the offence in the following circumstances: 
(i) under a threat that death or grievous bodily harm will be inflicted unlawfully upon a human being if the accused fails to do the act and 
(ii) the circumstances were such that a person of ordinary firmness would have been likely to yield to the threat in the way the accused did and 
(iii) the threat was present and continuing, imminent and impending and 
(iv) the accused reasonably apprehended that the threat would be carried out and 
(v) he was induced thereby to commit the crime charged and (vi) that crime was not murder, nor any other crime so heinous as to be excepted from the doctrineand 
(vii) the accused did not, by fault on his part when free from the duress, expose himself to its application and 
(viii) he had no means, with safety to himself, of preventing the execution of the threat.
The issue of adopting the wider common law position was considered in the local case of 
Wong Yoke Wah v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 246
 . In that case, the Court of Appeal rejected the argument to abandon s 94 of the Penal Code for the position in 
 R v Hurley & Murray 
, stating that there was no reason to depart from what was really settled law. In the face of the clear words of s 94, I was similarly not persuaded to accept a preference for the common law doctrine of duress.
In any event, I found the new allegations made by the petitioner in his application for revision to be completely incredible and unbelievable. There was absolutely no plausible reason why Leow needed to force the petitioner to make the phone calls when he could have done so himself. The victim did not know either of them at all and it was not as if she would have recognised Leow from his voice if he had made the call instead. The petitioner had claimed that Leow suggested demanding money from the victim so that he could repay the sums that he had borrowed from the petitioner. In view of this, it seemed ludicrous and absurd that Leow would then turn around and have to threaten the petitioner into committing the extortion. The petitioner`s assertions were also contradictory to his earlier account given in the lower court. Curiously, there was never any mention of him having a girlfriend and of Leow making threats with regard to her. In fact, it was particularly highlighted in his mitigation plea that he had only one previous failed relationship with a woman and it was suggested that his inability to develop any new friendship after that was part of the reason why he was so reliant on Leow`s companionship. Furthermore, I was not convinced by the petitioner`s argument that he was especially vulnerable to Leow`s threats due to his gullibility and low intellect. From the notes of evidence, it could be observed that the petitioner was himself able to raise objections to the wording of the charge as well as the statement of facts, both of which were subsequently amended to take into account the petitioner`s objections. It was even pointed out by the learned district judge in her grounds of decision that the petitioner did not appear to be afraid of speaking up and that he did not accept the statement of facts readily. All these went towards showing that the petitioner had a mind of his own and was able to think for himself and certainly was not a man of such borderline intelligence who was prone to manipulation by others as he sought to portray himself to be. The petitioner`s case was also substantially weakened by his obvious failure to mention these important allegations to the district judge. The petitioner was represented by counsel even at that stage and there was no suggestion that he had been wrongly advised. No reasons were proffered for the significant omission and I could only infer that the fresh allegations, which were entirely unsubstantiated and far-fetched, were untrue. If the petitioner had kept silent because he was afraid of Leow then, I failed to understand, and no explanation was offered, as to why this fear was now removed.
The court must be satisfied that the plea of guilt made by the accused is valid and unequivocal before it accepts the plea. In order for a plea of guilt to be valid and unequivocal, three safeguards must be observed: see 
Lee Weng Tuck v PP
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 143
 , 
Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 560
 . Firstly, the court must be satisfied that it is the accused himself who wishes to plead guilty. Secondly, the court must ensure that the accused understood the nature and consequences of the plea. Thirdly, it must be established that the accused intended to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. I was satisfied on the facts of the present case that all three of the above safeguards have been complied with. The petitioner clearly intended to admit, without qualifications, to the statement of facts which was interpreted and explained to him. As mentioned, the statement of facts was scrutinised and amended before the petitioner himself stated unequivocally that he wanted to admit to them. In addition, the minimum two years` imprisonment and mandatory caning sentence was also explained to him. I would re-emphasise that the petitioner had the benefit of counsel and in the absence of any suggestion that he had been wrongly advised, I was assured that there was no mistake or misunderstanding at all by the petitioner with regard to his plea of guilt.
In light of all the aforesaid reasons, I was not convinced that this was a case which justified a review of the conviction.
 Sentence 
 
 
 
In reviewing the sentence, I was of the opinion that the sentence of 30 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane was manifestly inadequate. Other than his plea of guilt, which he now sought to withdraw, there were no mitigating factors in favour of the petitioner. Instead, my attention was drawn to the various aggravating circumstances that called for a stiffer sentence. The actions of the petitioner showed that he was aware of what he was doing and that he had actively participated in the commission of the offences. Whilst Leow may have been the instigator who initiated the idea, it was the petitioner who then acted upon it. His cruel exploitation of the victim`s situation and his contemptible demands for the victim to perform those demeaning and degrading acts were truly reprehensible. The petitioner`s application for criminal revision, which was based on allegations that were completely self-serving and designed to absolve himself of any liability for offences which he obviously committed, also demonstrated that he was unrepentant and showed no signs of remorse for his deplorable deeds. Given the entire factual circumstances, I was of the view that the petitioner was the principal offender in this whole incident and was even more culpable than his accomplice, Leow. As Leow was already sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane, the punishment deserved by the petitioner should rightly be more severe. Consequently, I exercised the High Court`s powers on revision, pursuant to s 268 and s 256(b)(ii) of the CPC, and enhanced the petitioner`s sentence to 48 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
Outcome:
Petition dismissed and sentence enhanced accordingly.",2000-07-04 00:00:00,SG High Court
