2225042,Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Stuart-Smith: R v Ashley Mote,"R v ASHLEY NEIL MOTE 

SOUTHWARK CROWN COURT 

SENTENCING REMARKS BY MR JUSTICE STUART‐SMITH 

13 JULY 2015 

 

Ashley Neil Mote, the jury convicted you on compelling evidence on 15 July 2015 on all 12 
counts of this indictment.  They listened to you closely for days as you lied, protested, lied 
and  lied  again  about  the  monies  you  had  fraudulently  claimed  as  expenses  while  serving 
your constituents and your country as an MEP.  During the period from 2004 to 2009 you 
corruptly fiddled over £400,000 in expenses.  Your greed and dishonesty were matched only 
by your hypocrisy, because while this was going on you carried out a high‐profile campaign 
condemning corruption and the improper use of public money in the very institution from 
which you were leeching it.   

You knew perfectly well what the rules were for the claiming of expenses; and you also 
knew perfectly well that what you were doing had nothing to do with funding 
whistleblowers and everything to do with funding your bridging loan, your mortgage, your 
legal expenses that were unrelated to your role as an MEP, and your family.  If there had 
been any truth in your claims that you used these huge sums of money to fund 
whistleblowers you would have been able to show it without in any way compromising 
them.  But you couldn’t.  It was plain for all to see that the monies went into your bank 
accounts or accounts which you controlled, and did not come out except to fund you and 
your family.  You abused your position of trust as an elected representative, and you abused 
the trust that the European Parliament placed in you, consistently making false statements 
in the knowledge that the institutions trusted their MEPs to be reliable and honest.  Along 
the way, you deceived people who shared your declared political ideals and even regarded 
you as something of a political hero.  You are, as was said by the trial judge when you were 
convicted of substantial benefits fraud in 2007, a thoroughly dishonest man.
--------
The consistency of your dishonesty is positively breathtaking.  You started within six months 
of being elected in 2004, dishonestly securing payment of £12,500 on the pretext that it was 
money that you had agreed to pay to BOOF (Better Off Out Fund) for political services when 
you knew that no such services had been or would be provided to justify the payment.  You 
then took the money out of the BOOF account and transferred it to one of your own 
accounts.   That is what you stand convicted of under Counts 1 and 1A.  You kept going, and 
obtained payment of another £3500 in 2005, also on the dishonest pretext that it was to be 
paid to BOOF for the provision of political services, when in fact it was paid out of the BOOF 
account into your account on 29 June 2005.  That is what you stand convicted of under 
Count 2. 

You clearly felt you needed a regular dishonest income, because between October 2004 and 
June 2009 you dishonestly obtained 54 monthly payments of £1,000 each on the dishonest 
pretext that you had received political services from DARTT (Direct Action Resistance to 
Tyranny).  There never was a genuine service contract with DARTT, and most of the monies 
can be seen to have gone from the DARTT account which you controlled into your own bank 
accounts.  You then covered your tracks by submitting false regularisation documents saying 
that you had been invoiced by Mr Nockels on behalf of DARTT for the amount of the 
monthly payments, which was untrue.  That is what you stand convicted of under Counts 3 
and 4. 

In order to fund just under £100,000 in order to fund your unrelated legal expenses you 
made a series of false statements to the effect that the legal services provided by your 
solicitors were for legal and constitutional advice in relation to your activities as an MEP, 
which they were not.   You pushed very hard, to and beyond the point of being downright 
insulting, in your attempts to get these monies paid via one route and then, when that was 
rightly blocked, by another.    Those payments were monthly between mid 2005 and mid 
2009, only stopping when you ceased to be an MEP.  That is what you stand convicted of 
under Count 5.  As you came to the end of your time, you simply claimed the outstanding 
maximum that would have been available if any of these claims had been honest.  That was 
another £17,000 paid to your solicitors, of which you stand convicted under Count 6. 

 

On Counts 7 and 8 you stand convicted of money laundering.  Under Court 7, having 
dishonestly obtained payment to the bank account that you set up and controlled in 
Denmark in the name of Information Centrum OS, you transferred £46,636 to the DARTT 
account from which you funded your HSBC and NatWest accounts; £24,946 to your bridging 
loan account as you set about purchasing a home for you and your wife; and £157,537 to 
your mortgage account once that was set up.  Your suggestion that the funding of your 
mortgage and bridging loan to the tune of about £180,000 was in some way balanced by 
undetectable payments to whistleblowers was one of the most absurd points in your lying 
defence.  Under Count 8 you transferred a further £21,000 to your wife’s account and
--------
£6,994 to the account of your son and his girlfriend.  Once again, your suggestion that these 
were balanced out by undetectable payments to whistleblowers was absurd. 

You may have had some honest dealings with Mr Poolamets of ICOS in Estonia, but you used 
them as the pretext to defraud the European Parliament by inflating your claims and paying 
them into the Danish Bank account and then on for your benefit.    As you came towards the 
end of your time as an MEP, you decided to milk what you saw as your cash cow to the limit.  
Under Count 9, you dishonestly asserted that you had agreed to pay Estonian ICOS £11,306 
per month.  In April 2009 you tried to cover your tracks by submitting a false regularising 
document saying that you had been invoiced in the sum of €83,945 by Estonian ICOS during 
2008; and in September to November you submitted another false regularising document 
saying that you had been invoiced €79,601by Estonian ICOS during 2009.  That is Counts 10 
and 11. 

Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 are counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.  Count 1A is a count of theft, which 
carries a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment.  Counts 4, 10 and 11 are counts of 
false accounting, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment.  
Counts 6 and 9 are counts of fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years 
imprisonment.  Counts 6 and 7 are money laundering counts, each of which carries a 
maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. 

Although the money laundering offences carry a higher maximum sentence, the Crown is 
right to submit that the essence of your offending was a long‐standing fraud which netted 
you over £425,000 during a period of sustained dishonesty lasting just under five years.  It 
would be open to me to treat each of the four main strands (BOOF, DARTT, Edward Hayes 
and ICOS) as separate frauds, and it is instructive to compare both approaches. 

Whichever approach is adopted, your culpability is very high.  You abused your position of 
power, trust and responsibility; you continued your fraudulent activity over a sustained 
period of time; and the steps you took to cover your tracks were sophisticated and involved 
significant planning.   

Your offences had a considerable impact on the victim whether your true victim is regarded 
as the European Parliament or as the tax payers who funded your membership of the 
Parliament and the expenses you dishonestly drew.   On one point you were absolutely 
correct. Dishonesty on the part of those involved in the European Parliament is disgraceful 
and damaging to the institution and its democratic credibility.  The destruction of public 
confidence in democratic institutions by expenses scandals both here and in Europe cannot 
be valued in monetary terms; but it is real and the impact will not dissipate rapidly.  While I 
am prepared to sentence you on the basis that the victim impact in this case is medium, it is 
towards the top of that category, if not at the very top.
--------
If I were to adopt the approach of treating your dishonesty as having four separate frauds, 
the BOOF fraud on its own would fall within category 4, with a starting point of 18 months 
custody; the theft count does not add materially to the overall criminality.  The DARTT fraud 
would fall within category 3, with a starting point of 3 years, while each of the Edward Hayes 
and ICOS frauds would be category 2 frauds, each having a starting point of 5 years.  That 
would suggest that an overall starting point in excess of 5 years is appropriate, which could 
be achieved by a mixture of concurrent and consecutive sentences of imprisonment. 

Alternatively, treating your offending as one sustained fraud would put it high in category 2, 
which takes a starting point of 5 years based on £300,000.  Adopting this approach would 
suggest a starting point close to or at the top of the range, namely about 6 years. 

Those starting points would be for a person of previous good character.  That is not you, 
because you were convicted of 20 benefit fraud offences in 2007 when you dishonestly 
recovered about £60,000 in benefits, for which you were sent to prison for 9 months.  That 
is a statutory aggravating factor, accentuated by the fact that you were convicted plum in 
the middle of your present course of offending and it appears to have had no effect on you 
at all. 

What then can be said in mitigation? 

a)  There was evidence at trial, which I accept, that during your time as an MEP you 
worked hard to discharge your mandate as an anti‐EU member and that you took 
substantial steps to communicate with your constituents better than some of your 
colleagues.  I accept Mr Moloney’s submission that your membership of the 
European Parliament was not simply a cynical campaign to enrich yourself. 

b)  You are 79 years old.  You were in your late sixties and early seventies when you 

embarked on this course of conduct.  You have a past history of atrial fibrillation and 
raised blood pressure.  You are slower than you were, but there is no medical 
evidence of a neurodegenerative disorder and nothing in your health that goes to 
explain your offending.  As with any person of your age, prison will be very tough; 
and I take that fully into account. 

c)  You have ruined your family, having first dishonestly enriched them.  Your wife of 40 
years deserves much better than that.  At a personal level this is an utter tragedy for 
you and for all affected by your conduct. 

When all is said and done, what stands out is the consistency of your dishonesty over nearly 
five years, the financial scale of your fraud, the rank abuse of the trust that was placed in 
you by your constituents and the European Parliament, and the financial and reputational 
damage you have done to the democratic institutions you said you were trying to clean up.  
Leaving on one side your age, application of the guidelines would suggest a sentence of 
about 7 or even 7 ½ years, primarily because of the scale and duration of your fraud and 
your previous conviction.
--------
If you were a young man, I would make a modest reduction to 6 years 8 months on grounds 
of totality.  But you are not a young man, and I consider that such a sentence would be a 
crushing blow which, even if justifiable, should be avoided if possible.  For that reason, and 
that reason only, I have come to the conclusion that I can and should make a further 
reduction because of your age. 

I sentence you to an aggregate sentence of 5 years, essentially treating your offending as 
one continuous fraud but recognising that the four strands involved ever increasing sums of 
money.  Those five years are made up as follows: 

Count 1: Obtaining £12,500 by deception:  18 months.  

Count 1A: Theft of £12,500: 

 

 

6 months 

Count 2: Obtaining £3,500 by deception: 

18 months 

Count 3: Obtaining £54,000 by deception:  3 years  

Count 4: False accounting: 

 

 

3 years 

Count 5: Obtaining £97,531 by deception   4 years 

Count 6: Fraud  

 

 

 

4 years  

Count 7: Acquiring criminal property: 

5 years 

Count 8: Concealing criminal property: 

5 years 

Count 9: Fraud 

 

 

Count 10: False accounting:    

Count 10: False accounting 

 

 

 

 

5 years 

5 years 

5 years. 

All sentences shall run concurrently. 

If the statutory surcharge is applicable in this case you will pay it in the appropriate sum. 

You will serve half of the sentence of 5 years before you are released on license.  After your 
release you will be liable to serve the remainder of the period if you commit any further 
offences.

Central Criminal Court 

 

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Pontius 

 

26th June 2015 

 

1.   This defendant pleaded guilty to Counts 1 & 3 on the indictment on 26 May last, 

      the first day of an intended trial of both the defendant and his wife, who faced all 

      three charges but whose plea to Count 1 (aiding and abetting her husband’s 

      Misconduct in a Public Office) was accepted by the prosecution. I sentenced her 

      straightaway but adjourned Mr. HALL’s sentencing in order that a Pre‐Sentence 

      Report could be prepared. 

2.   Count 1 reflects a course of conduct pursued by this defendant over a period of 

      more than two years during which, as a Registered Psychiatric Nurse at 

      Broadmoor High Security Hospital, he repeatedly sold confidential information 

      about a number of patients, some of whom had committed extremely serious 

      crimes which had achieved nationwide notoriety over the last few decades. 

      The defendant was paid thousands of pounds by the News of the World and 

      Mirror Group Newspapers  ‐  £23,800 in total  ‐  both for that information and 

      for that supplied after his employment ended, using his wife’s bank account for  

      purpose. 

3.   That grave breach of trust  ‐  the trust not only of the public in general, but of 

      course that of the patients themselves, many of them suffering from extremely 

      serious mental illness which had led to their detention in hospital for very many 

      years  ‐  would, on its own, have represented as appalling an offence of its kind
--------
that could be imagined. This defendant’s criminal conduct, however, did not end 

      when his employment at Broadmoor finished in October 2004, because he 

      continued to pursue and to take advantage of his corrupt relationship with Mirror 

      Group Newspapers until July 2006.  During that period he was paid further sums 

      of money for the stories he supplied but, no longer working at Broadmoor and 

      thus having no access to patient records and other confidential information, he 

      provided his journalist contacts with fabricated material, the detail of which was 

      entirely false whilst purporting to relate to actual patients. 

      More seriously still, the police investigation revealed that he had also been 

      making up stories even whilst still employed as a nurse at Broadmoor  ‐  for no 

      other reason than that the more sensational the story, the more money he would 

       receive, at times ‐  presumably ‐ when there was a dearth of genuine material 

       to offer. In order to make those fabricated stories even more newsworthy and    

        thus more lucrative he also forged official hospital patient records in such 

         detail and with a degree of craft that display not only professional experience 

         but also an extremely fertile imagination. 

4.  The defendant’s manufacture of so much false information, of course, totally 

undermines any suggestion that he was acting in, rather than against, the 

public interest. Thus there can be no viable attempt to justify what he did by 

claiming it was altruistic “whistle‐blowing” in order only to bring to public 

attention and urgent official scrutiny some suggested malpractice on the part 

of the hospital authorities or perceived favourable treatment of patients. 

5.  This was, therefore, an abuse of public trust of such gravity as would rightly 
be utterly condemned by all right‐thinking members of the public as causing 

very serious harm to the public interest. 

6.  I accept that the defendant was approached by a journalist, who provided 

him with contact details, at a social event and so did not seek out a potential 

purchaser of the confidential information to which he was privileged to have 

access by virtue of his work. Thereafter, however, it is plain  ‐  as reflected in 

the defendant’s basis of plea  ‐  that for many months he freely carried on 

what became a lucrative trade in information.
--------
7.  There are no sentencing guidelines, as such, for the assistance of the court 
when considering cases of this kind. That is not surprising given the infinite 

variety of facts and circumstances which inevitably arise in such cases, 

perhaps the more so than in most other types of offending. The nearest 

similar cases are those concerning misconduct by prison officers who have 

sold information relating to criminals in their charge. Yet this case is more 

serious than those, in my view, because the individuals to whom the 

defendant owed a duty of care and in respect of whom, as he was well 

aware, he owed, in addition, a duty of confidentiality within the terms of the 

Code of Conduct, whilst many had committed some of the gravest crimes of 

violence to come before the courts of this country, nevertheless had done so 

whilst suffering from mental disorder to a greater or lesser extent and were 

therefore entitled not only to dedicated, professional care but to a high 

degree of respect for their privacy and for the unfortunate circumstances 

which had led to their indefinite detention. 

8.  So far as mitigation is concerned I am able, in the context of these offences, 
entirely to disregard the relatively minor offences which occurred well into 

the defendant’s past. I also must bear very much in mind the plight of his 

wife, who  ‐  I am well aware, having seen her and heard mitigation on her 

behalf before sentencing her last month  ‐  is in poor health and heavily 

reliant on others for assistance in the sort of everyday tasks that a wife and 

mother would take pride in doing unaided. It follows, of course, that in 

addition this defendant bears by far the greater burden of looking after their 

three young children. A prison sentence, therefore, however short, will 

inevitably have a profound effect, both practical and financial, upon the 

whole family. That, of course, is a consequence which I should not hesitate to 

avoid if my public duty permitted as I have no wish to visit such additional 

difficulties on a family which already has very considerable problems, and will 

continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  Nevertheless, it is very often an 

unfortunate consequence of the sentencing process, when a defendant 

receives an appropriate sentence of imprisonment, that it is innocent 

dependants who suffer the effects far more harshly than the offender
--------
himself. That is a consequence, however, for which the offender alone must 

bear responsibility. Given Mrs. HALL’s state of health I very much hope that 

whatever state and local authority assistance may be necessary is provided to 

her and the children without delay. 

9.  I also bear in mind the length of time which has elapsed between the 

commission of these offences and the defendant’s appearance before the 

court. Further, so far as his guilty plea is concerned, normally a plea entered 

for the first time on the first day of an intended contested trial would merit 

minimal credit. However, I accept that his wife’s position as a co‐defendant 

was uppermost in his mind in the weeks and months leading up to trial and in 

consequence I am able to give a little more credit than would otherwise be 

appropriate. Given the contents of the character references written to the 

court by people who know him well, I am also able to accept that the 

defendant’s plea, entered knowing that he faced the prison gates, reflects a 

degree of genuine remorse. 

10.   KENNETH HALL, if you had pursued your pleas of not guilty to conviction by 

a jury I have no doubt, for the reasons I have set out, that the correct 

sentence would have been two and a half years’ imprisonment. In the light of 

all the facts of the case, and the powerful mitigating circumstances put 

forward on your behalf, I am able to reduce that sentence to one of two 

years upon both Count 1 and Count 3, those sentences to run concurrently. 

Of  that sentence you will be required to serve half before automatic release 

on licence, thereafter being liable to serve the outstanding balance if you 

commit any further offence during that time. Any days spent in custody since 

arrest will be deducted from the period you are required to serve. 

11.  If the statutory victim charge applies in this case I make the necessary order 

in the appropriate amount.

Central Criminal Court 

 

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Pontius 

 

30th June 2015 

 
 
On 17th. December last year this defendant appeared at Hendon Magistrates’ Court 

for sentence upon a charge of Harassment to which he had pleaded guilty early that 

month. The sentence included the imposition of a Restraining Order forbidding him 

from further anti‐social behaviour against his neighbours, the MORRISON family. It 

was his earlier, repeated such behaviour that had led to the charge and his 

appearance at court. It is plain from the evidence the jury heard that the defendant 

felt extremely angry and resentful that he alone had been charged. It is equally plain 

that during the rest of that day and overnight, into the following day, he brooded 

upon what he saw, quite wrongly, as an injustice in the way he had been treated.  

 
The next day  ‐  18th. December 2014  ‐  the defendant made up his mind to avenge 

himself, for that perceived injustice, upon the person he regarded as primarily 

responsible for it, ALISON MORRISON. She left home to walk to work shortly after 

7.30am, by which time the defendant had taken two knives from the kitchen, placed 

them in a carrier bag and driven to a nearby road from which he would be able to 

observe Mrs. MORRISON as she made her way to Northolt Park station, along the 

route that the defendant had seen her previously take.
--------
After she had walked past his car he got out, taking the bag containing the knives, 

and followed her. Having removed the knives from the bag he attacked Mrs. 

MORRISON from behind, using the larger knife to stab her more than 33 times in an 

extended attack of truly horrifying savagery. The first fifteen of those wounds were 

delivered to the back before she fell to the ground and the number and severity of 

the seven defensive wounds to her hands demonstrate how desperately ALISON 

MORRISON fought for her life. 

 

The defendant then sat astride her, repeatedly stabbing her to the chest in what the 

witness ADETOKUNBO JOLAOSO described as an attack which “didn’t look frantic, 

just consistent, not too quick”.  This, therefore, was not a frenzied loss of control on 

the defendant’s part but a merciless and deliberate act of vengeance, undoubtedly 

with an intent to kill ALISON MORRISON in the forefront of his mind. The jury has 

unanimously rejected the defendant’s assertion that at the time he was suffering 

from an abnormality of mental functioning born of a depressive illness. As the 

prosecution put it, this was murder, pure and simple. 

 

However, I am prepared to accept  ‐  as did Dr. JOSEPH, the psychiatrist called by the 

prosecution  ‐  that a combination of factors may, over a period of months, have led 

to a measure of stress upon the defendant and those factors obviously would have 

included the on‐going dispute with the MORRISON  family which culminated in his 
court appearance on 17th. December. That stress, in turn, may have resulted in some 

mild depression  ‐  a possibility, again, that Dr. JOSEPH accepted  ‐  and it may well 

have been depression that led to the defendant’s suicide attempt in November.  

 

That depression, however, by the jury’s verdict, did not result in an abnormality of 
mental functioning during the crucial hour or so on the morning of 18th. December 

and thus cannot be regarded as a contributory factor explaining the defendant’s 

acts. Rather, those acts in my view are properly to be seen as the product of 

resentment and festering anger arising from the dispute generally and the 

defendant’s sentencing the day before in particular.
--------
His deliberate planning, early that morning, of what he would do and how he would 

do it  ‐  fetching two knives from the kitchen and driving to a place from which he 

would see the approach of ALISON MORRISON  ‐  entirely rules out any suggestion 

that this might have been a spontaneous act arising from a momentary loss of 

temper and it is that degree of planning and the deliberate execution of that plan 

which most seriously aggravate the facts of this dreadful murder.  

 

I make it plain, however, that the taking of the knives from the kitchen to the place 

where the attack took place, with a clear intention of using them specifically to carry 

out that attack, does not additionally aggravate the crime because that factor of 

itself requires me to take as the starting point for the minimum term of the sentence 

of Life Imprisonment, which I now impose, the increased figure of 25 years created 

by paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act of 2003. 

 

This brutal murder robbed a close‐knit family of a devoted and caring wife, mother, 

sister and aunt, a woman  ‐  the victim impact statements make movingly clear  ‐  

with a zest for life and enthusiasm for her responsible and stimulating job. As a result 

the family is left devastated and  ‐  additionally tragic in itself  ‐  the damaging effects 

upon the relationship between her husband and son may well take a very long time 

to repair. 

 

I have already set out some of the aggravating features of this murder and they are 

clear enough: the extent of the planning and the deliberate ferocity of this merciless 

attack, from behind, upon a totally defenceless woman, delivering a significant 

number of the knife blows with severe force, and doing so in a residential street at a 

time of day when many people would be likely to be nearby, on their own way to 

work or getting ready to leave home. To that list must be added the fact that the 

crime was committed less than twenty four hours after the imposition of the Court 

Order specifically forbidding the defendant from contacting the MORRISON family in 

any way.
--------
The mitigating factors are these: first, the defendant’s previous good character, with 

no instances of violence  ‐  serious or otherwise  ‐  in his forty eight years, which 

must nevertheless be set within the context of his acceptance of guilt the day 

before, reflecting a history of harassment of his neighbours over many months. 

Inevitably, that to some extent dilutes the effect of that piece of mitigation. 

 

Secondly, I accept that the defendant now fully recognises, with genuine horror, the 

enormity of his crime. He has always admitted that it was he who delivered the fatal 

wounds which ended ALISON MORRISON’s life and in accepting that responsibility 

has expressed remorse. I do not doubt that neither he, nor his family, will ever be 

able fully to accept that he was capable of such a dreadful act of violence but he will 

live with the consequences throughout the remainder of his life. 

 

I also must have regard to the fact that the defendant’s obviously mercurial 

temperament had been affected, to some degree, by mounting stress arising out of 

the long‐running difficulties with the MORRISON family, although  ‐  for the reasons I 

have already expressed  ‐  the mitigating value of what I am prepared to accept may 

have been mild depression at the time of the murder is limited, not least because 

those difficulties were, to a very large extent, of the defendant’s own creation. I also 

bear in mind that some additional stress caused by serious illness within his family 

and the pressures of a demanding job is likely to have weighed upon his mind, 

resulting in his low mood. 

 

TREVOR GIBBON, in all the circumstances which I have just explained I have no doubt 

that the minimum term which you must serve of the Life Sentence I have imposed 

upon you is twenty eight years. 

 

That, I make plain, does not necessarily mean that you will be released upon 

completion of that minimum term. I am simply setting the period you must serve in 

prison before becoming eligible to apply for release on licence. When precisely you 

will be released will depend entirely on the Parole Board’s assessment on all the 

material then available. That decision will therefore be a matter for the Board alone,
--------
not for this Court, but after your release you will remain subject to the terms of your 

licence for the rest of your life. 

 

The time you have spent in custody since your arrest  ‐  191 days  ‐  will be deducted 

from that minimum term. 

If this is an appropriate case for the imposition of a Victim Surcharge, that will apply 

in the relevant amount.

2225062,Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Saunders: R v Jules Stenson,"R v Jules Stenson 

 

Central Criminal Court 

 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Saunders 

 

6th July 2015 

1.  Mr. Stenson has pleaded guilty to an offence of conspiracy to 
intercept communications. He has pleaded guilty on a basis which is 
largely accepted by the prosecution. In so far as the basis is not accepted, 
the differences between the prosecution and defence are not such as 
would affect my sentence and I do not consider that it is necessary to 
resolve them.  

2.  I am satisfied on the evidence that I have heard that people working 
for the News of the World were concerned in wide spread phone hacking 
between 2002 and 2006. I do not believe that anyone seriously disputes 
that now. It was mainly carried out by people working for the news desk 
but, when Dan Evans arrived at the beginning of 2005, he started phone 
hacking for the features desk. 

3.  Jules Stenson was head of the features desk   from the beginning of 
2005 to August 2006 which is when Dan Evans was phone hacking. The 
accepted basis of plea is that Mr. Stenson was aware of the practice of 
phone hacking on the news desk at the News of the World before 2005. 
In particular he had heard a widespread rumour that the revelation in the 
paper about Mr. Blunkett’s relationship with a married woman had 
derived from phone hacking. He denies that he conspired with people on 
the news desk. The prosecution accept that. His basis of plea says in 
terms that his co‐conspirators were Coulson Wallis and Evans. Mr. Wallis 
has been acquitted by the jury and nothing that I said in the course of this 
hearing is intended to or could go behind that verdict.  It has emerged
--------
during the sentencing hearing through questions that I addressed to Mr. 
Stenson’s counsel that the basis of plea, in so far as it addressed the 
involvement of Mr. Wallis, was not based on Mr. Stenson’s own 
knowledge but on his reading of the evidence in the case. It follows 
therefore that, where Mr. Stenson’s case is that pressure was put on him 
by his managers to use phone hacking on the features desk to obtain 
stories, he is talking only of Mr. Coulson. In so far as there appeared from 
the documents to be disagreement between Mr. Wallis and Mr. Stenson, 
it would not be the only difference between the cases of Defendants in 
this series of cases.  Those differences may be explicable, as this one 
appears to be, but as Defendants whose accounts differ have not always 
given evidence in the same trial, they have never been resolved.  

4.  Mr. Stenson’s case, accepted by the prosecution, is that Mr. Coulson 
was the driving force behind the recruitment of Dan Evans who, on his 
own admission, had been phone hacking at the Sunday Mirror before he 
went to the News of the World. Dan Evans’ previous experience of phone 
hacking was known to a number of people at the News of the World. 

5.  Mr. Stenson’s case is that he allowed himself to be drawn into phone 
hacking because he was put under pressure to produce stories by Mr. 
Coulson and he was driven to use illegal means in order to avoid the sack. 
There is no doubt that the tabloid newspaper world was, and maybe still 
is, very competitive. At a time when newspaper sales were reducing, 
there was great pressure to maintain market share which could only be 
achieved by taking circulation away from rivals. I have no doubt that the 
management on the News of the World were keen to create intense 
competition between the different desks. Whether that was undue 
pressure or good management, I am not qualified to say, but I think that 
Mr. Evans’ evidence was probably correct when he said that Mr. 
Stenson’s attitude was, if you can’t beat them, join them.  

6.  Mr. Stenson’s case, accepted by the prosecution, was that he was not 
aware that phone hacking was against the law. That is not a defence to 
the charge. Mr. Stenson did know that phone hacking was not permitted 
under the Editors’ Code of Conduct and was a gross breach of privacy. I 
do not consider that that provides significant mitigation nor is it 
suggested that it should. Mr. Stenson’s case   is that the people who were 
hacked by the features department were celebrities who were in the 
public eye. Some people seem to think that it is less serious to hack the 
phone messages of a celebrity than someone who is not in the public eye. 
I am afraid I do not see any difference. Not only that, but many of the 
messages which were intercepted were left on the phones of people who 
were connected with celebrities but were not celebrities themselves. Mr. 
Evans could not limit himself, even if he had wanted to, to listening only
--------
to messages coming from celebrities. He listened to all the messages, 
however personal and private they were. 

7.  It may be that the public interest in phone hacking and the public 
condemnation of the practice which surfaced when the hacking of Millie 
Dowler’s phone was revealed, has waned over the time that the 
investigation and the trials have taken. That is inevitable. Despite that, I 
have to do justice between Defendants. It would be quite wrong for me 
to say that, as it has gone on so long and public interest is less, those 
convicted at the end of the series of trials should receive shorter 
sentences than those who were arrested earlier and sentenced in a blaze 
of publicity. Having to wait a long time to hear your fate is mitigation, but 
the offence is no less serious because public interest has waned. I shall 
therefore adopt the same level of   sentence that I have used in the other 
cases which I have dealt with. 

8.  There are distinctions which can properly be drawn between Mr. 
Stenson and the others that I have had to sentence. Phone hacking was a 
well established means of getting stories at the News of the World before 
Mr. Stenson became involved. He was put in a position of competing with 
people working on the news desk who he knew were phone hacking and 
his editor condoned the practice. It is likely that if he had not come up 
with stories, Jules Stenson would have lost his job.  Further the period 
over which the features department were phone hacking was 
comparatively short and there was only one person doing it; Dan Evans. 

9.  While there are those distinctions to be made in Mr. Stenson’s case, 
his main mitigation is his plea of guilty.   That is often said in cases where 
there really is nothing else to say. In this case there is a great deal of 
other mitigation but nothing is as important as the plea of guilty within 
the context of this case. Over a period of years there was a concerted 
effort to prevent public exposure of the true extent of phone hacking at 
the News of the World. That has been accepted in previous trials. Large 
resources were devoted to it. Whether it is called damage limitation or a 
cover up doesn’t matter, the aim was to prevent what had gone on at the 
News of the World becoming public knowledge. Mr. Stenson’s decision to 
plead guilty and not try his luck with a jury demonstrates courage and 
some remorse for what he has done. 

10. The credit that I could have given Mr. Stenson, would have been 
greater had he told the police what he knew. He exercised his right to 
remain silent. Only Daniel Evans, of those who have pleaded guilty, has 
given evidence for either the prosecution or the defence.  I have already 
commented on the irony of this   when the Defendants are people whose 
vocation is to reveal information that the public have a right to know but 
others wish to keep secret.
--------
11. Mr. Stenson was a senior figure at the News of the World and a 
distinguished journalist. He should have been setting an example to more 
junior journalists. The nature of his offending means that the custody 
threshold is passed. The starting point to reflect his offending as 
compared with others is 8 months imprisonment. Mr. Stenson is a man of 
good character. In addition to his lack of convictions I have read a number 
of character references which speak highly of him. To reflect his positive 
good character and, what I consider to be genuine remorse, I reduce that 
starting point to 6 months. I reduce that by a third to reflect Mr. 
Stenson’s plea of guilty.  

12. It has been submitted to me that I should suspend the sentence of 
imprisonment. I am asked to consider the length of time that this has 
been hanging over Mr. Stenson and the strides that he has taken, since 
the closure of the News of the World, to re‐build his life. Having given this 
matter considerable thought, I have concluded that justice would be done 
in this case by suspending the sentence. Mr. Stenson, the sentence of 4 
months imprisonment will be suspended for 12 months. You will also 
carry out 200 hours unpaid work for the community. You will pay the 
prosecution costs which amount to £18,059.61. In addition, because I am 
satisfied that you have the means, you will pay a fine of £5000.

Central Criminal Court 

 

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Pontius 

 

29th May 2015 

 
 

It was, and apparently remains, journalistic practice at the Sun newspaper (and, I dare 

say, at many others) to pay members of the public for their stories. That practice is 

promoted, supported and encouraged by the paper at all levels within the internal 

structure, as reflected in the message, “We pay cash for your stories”, which appears 

in each edition. It is a practice which is certainly not improper, still less is it to be 

condemned, least of all by me, as long as it does not involve  ‐  as it did in this case  ‐  

encouragement by a journalist to anyone holding public office to abuse their trusted 

position, for payment, by providing confidential information obtained in the course of 

their work in order that it might be used to feed the public’s appetite for news which 

sometimes amounts to no more than titillating gossip. 

 

Of course, the fact that the public, generally speaking, is ready to read such material is 

no more than an unsurprising reflection of the curiosity of human nature which we all 

share and does not in any way diminish the importance of the high degree of trust 

which that same public places, and rightly expects confidently to be able to place, in
--------
those who serve it. When that trust is seriously betrayed, for significant sums of 

money, to the grave extent that TIMOTHY EDWARDS repeatedly betrayed the public’s 

trust in him as a constable serving in the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism 

Command, offenders must expect to be punished severely  ‐  the public deserves no 

less if others in similar positions of trust are effectively to be deterred from such 

behaviour and thus the highest standards maintained. 

 

This defendant’s encouragement of EDWARDS’s misconduct carried on for well 

over two years, during which EDWARDS was paid more than £22,000. I accept that at 

the beginning of their relationship the defendant was unaware of what EDWARDS did 

for a living but that soon changed  ‐  at the latest by the end of 2008  ‐  nor could it 

sensibly have been otherwise, given the nature of the information the defendant 

received from EDWARDS. 

 

I do not doubt  ‐  and I accept the defendant’s evidence on the point  ‐  that some 

of the articles he wrote, using the details supplied by EDWARDS, were upon subjects 

very much in the public interest, not surprisingly so given his experience in, and pursuit 

of, responsible investigative journalism. Obvious specific examples are those stories 

which concerned airline safety, such as drunken pilots and the smuggling by crews of 

drugs, the importation from the United States of vicious “X‐men” style weapons and 

the movement in and out of this country of British Islamic extremists. 

 

Others, however, were plainly chosen and published for their obviously salacious 

subject‐matter, sometimes at the wholly unjustified expense of personal privacy. The 

Heathrow “Body Scanner” story is an example, intended to titillate and published 

regardless of the private life of the woman concerned  ‐  herself already the victim of 

disgraceful behaviour by a colleague  ‐  to the inexcusable extent of revealing her name 

and printing her picture. The apology, a couple of centimetres square and tucked away
--------
at the bottom of a page deep inside the paper, regrettably did not appear until about 

eighteen months after the original article. 

It was, similarly, unjustifiable to print the name, address and photo of the British 

Airways engineer, who was never charged with any offence, and the more so to reveal 

his wife’s name and other family details. 

 

Those two examples are the worst of a kind which, when the overall picture is 

considered, appears fortunately to have been in a minority amongst the articles 

written and submitted for publication by this defendant. 

 

It is important that I should bear in mind that there was clearly a recognised procedure 

at the Sun so far as payment for stories was concerned. The defendant was required  ‐  

once an article had been submitted for, and had received, editorial approval and legal 

vetting  ‐  to present a request for payment to his editor. It follows first, that payment 

of a fee, and determination of the appropriate sum, were matters for editorial 

discretion and not for the defendant and, secondly, there was no handing over of a 

grubby envelope, produced from the defendant’s pocket in a dark corner of a pub. The 

defendant, holding a fairly junior post at the Sun, was therefore following an accepted 

procedure that doubtless had existed for some time, and doing so in relation to a 

source of information  ‐  TIMOTHY EDWARDS  ‐  he had not recruited himself but one 

he had inherited from a colleague and to whom payments had previously been made 

for information. The fact that it was acceptable within the organisation, however, does 

not of course for a moment make it acceptable as a practice if such payments were 

knowingly made to those who had revealed confidential information obtained in the 

course, and in flagrant breach, of a public duty. I emphasise that I heard no evidence at 

all during the course of this trial that has led me to suspect that any editor or in‐house 

lawyer at the Sun was ever made aware by this defendant, or anyone else, of the 

occupation of the source of the information on which these articles were based. That 

said, the colleague from whom this defendant inherited EDWARDS as a supplier of
--------
confidential information is likely to have known, but I accept the defendant’s evidence 

that he was not told by that colleague what EDWARDS did for a living at the time he 

took him over as a source. 

 

Any abuse of the public’s trust, especially by a person holding public office who has 

access to confidential material which he knowingly supplies without authority, in 

return for substantial sums of money, will be treated by the court as deserving of a 

sentence which not only punishes the offender with appropriate severity but which  ‐  

more importantly, perhaps  ‐  establishes a very clear deterrent message to other 

potential offenders. That much is beyond question. 

 

In those circumstances, it is unsurprising that TIMOTHY EDWARDS received a sentence 

of two years’ immediate imprisonment, having pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. 

On the assumption that his plea, in consequence, attracted and received full credit it 

follows that if he had contested the charge and been convicted by a jury the 

appropriate sentence would have been three years.  

A public servant who abuses his office and the trust of the public so gravely as did P.C. 

EDWARDS, doing so out of pure greed, can in my view justifiably be considered more 

blameworthy and thus in a significantly more serious position than a journalist who 

encourages that misconduct, albeit that encouragement takes place over a period of 

many months. 

 

In expressing that view I do not ignore the obvious fact that without the offer, by a 

journalist, of money for confidential information it might well be that a public official 

would not be tempted to abuse the trust reposed in him but nevertheless in my 

judgment a distinction ought properly to be made between their different roles, 

particularly where  ‐  as in this case  ‐  the defendant did not seek out his source and 

offer money for information;  rather, he was presented with a ‘ready‐made’ source.
--------
Sentences in a succession of cases of this type which have come before the courts over 

recent months reflect the same realistic, common sense approach as I have expressed 

and I have had an opportunity to study the schedule of such cases helpfully provided 

by the prosecution after this defendant’s conviction.    

All things being equal a journalist in the position that this defendant now finds himself, 

in my considered view, deserves and ought to receive a sentence of roughly half that 

imposed upon the public official.  

 

Having said that, it is my responsibility in this particular case, faced with this     

particular defendant, convicted by an obviously fair‐minded and conscientious jury 

after a trial in which the cases for both prosecution and defence were presented and 

examined with meticulous and thorough professional care, to determine whether the 

public interest demands, and expects, the imposition of a sentence of immediate 

imprisonment upon an experienced journalist of hitherto entirely unblemished 

character who, I am satisfied, is  ‐  this aberrant course of conduct excepted  ‐  

essentially a decent man of solid integrity and social responsibility.  

 

I have reached that view not only having had the opportunity to observe and listen to 

him at length, in the witness box, an incalculable advantage in itself, but upon the 

written evidence provided during the trial by his two character witnesses  ‐  both, 

themselves, men of impressive and unquestionable integrity and strength of character  

‐  to whom the defendant has repeatedly shown a high degree of kindness, 

understanding and valuable practical assistance, as he plainly has to those witnesses 

who have provided written character references today.  In particular, the defendant’s 

work for charities such as the Damilola Taylor Trust and the Spirit of London Awards is 

itself impressive testament to a man they all hold in the highest regard. 

 

In my firm view, therefore, the entries on the credit side of the page of account for this 

defendant significantly outweigh those on the debit side to the extent that when I ask
--------
myself whether those mitigating circumstances allow me, consistently with my public 

duty and the interests of Justice, to suspend the prison sentence that undeniably must 

be imposed in this case the answer is undoubtedly ‘yes’. The experience of arrest, then 

a trial following a very lengthy delay and the loss of his good character and perhaps his 

livelihood will, I have no doubt, have had a profound and salutary effect on the 

defendant and I am sure that a suspended sentence will serve effectively to ensure 

that the behaviour which has brought him before this court will never be repeated. 

 

ANTHONY FRANCE, for the reasons I have explained I am entirely satisfied 

first, that the appropriate sentence upon you is one of eighteen months’ imprisonment 

and, secondly, that the circumstances justify the suspension of that sentence for a 

period of two years. It follows that you will only have to serve that sentence if you are 

foolish enough to commit any other offence during the next two years. I have seen and 

heard enough about you during the trial to make me confident that it is unlikely, in the 

extreme, that you will do so. 

Further, it is essential that the sentence should contain a meaningful punitive element 

and I therefore attach to the suspended prison sentence a requirement that you carry 

out 200 hours of unpaid work, community service in other words, which will I hope not 

only be rigorous and demanding on your time (and rightly so, being a punishment) but 

also be fulfilling and rewarding, because you will be doing something worthwhile and 

constructive for those less fortunate than yourself. That is something from which, with 

your experience in working for the benefit of others, I have no doubt you will derive 

considerable satisfaction. You must attend to carry out the work whenever and 

wherever your work supervisor directs. Failure to do so, or to carry out the work to a 

satisfactory standard, is likely to lead to your being returned to the court on breach 

proceedings with a request to me to reconsider the sentence. 

 

In addition, there is no good reason why the taxpayer should foot the whole of the 

prosecution’s bill for bringing you before the court. I shall therefore make an order
--------
that you pay the full prosecution costs but I do so on the assumption that, having had 

the cost of your representation by leading and junior counsel and solicitors paid by 

News International, they will also pay my costs order. If that turns out not to be the 

case then the matter can be relisted so that I can vary the order to a sum more fairly 

adjusted to your personal circumstances.   

 

Finally, if it applies to this case you must pay the statutory victim surcharge in the 

appropriate amount.

2225074,Sentencing Remarks of of Mr Justice Haddon-Cave: R v Mann,"R v. Anthony MANN 

SENTENCING REMARKS  

 

by The Hon.  Mr Justice Haddon-Cave 

Crown Court at Warwickshire Justice Centre – 13th April 2015 

 
 

 

 
Introduction 
1.  This is an exceptionally sad and tragic case.   
 
2.  On 20th June 2014, the Defendant, Mr Anthony Mann (aged 78) stabbed his wife, 
Janet  Mann  (also  aged  78),  in  the  heart  and  killed  her.  They  had  been  happily 
married  57  years  and  were  a  devoted  and  loving  couple.  Mrs  Mann,  had  been 
suffering  for  several  years  with  complex  medical  problems  and  increasing  dementia. 
Mr Mann had been her constant and devoted carer. Her condition had considerably 
worsened in the previous days and weeks.  She did not want to return to hospital or 
to  suffer  any  more.    He  was  under  intolerable  strain  at  the  time  and  acted  under 
impulse. He called the emergency services and admitted what he had done. 

 
3.  As Counsel for the Prosecution, Mr Grieves-Smith, said in his characteristically fair 

and balanced opening, context is everything.  Mr Mann, I will turn shortly to outline 
the context in which you committed this act.  Please remain seated for the moment.  

 

 
Procedural history 
4.  When the case was first listed before the Crown Court a guilty plea to murder was 
indicated  under  the  Early  Guilty  Plea  scheme.    However,  following  a  conference 
with his client, Mr Mann, and the family on 26th September 2014, leading counsel 
Mr Jonas Hankin QC, sensibly advised that a psychiatric opinion should be obtained 
as  to  the  potential  question  of  diminished  responsibility.    Mr  Hankin  QC  was  no 
doubt mindful of R v. Inglis [2011] 1 WLR 1110 (paragraphs [41]-[42]). 

 
5.  The  matter  came  before  me  on  10th  October  2014  and,  after  hearing  helpful 
submissions from Mr Hankin QC and Mr Grieves-Smith, I granted time for both the 
Defence  and  Prosecution  to  instruct  suitable  consultant  forensic  psychiatrists  to 
examine the effects upon Mr Mann’s mental health of his wife’s physical and mental 
deterioration during the period preceding her death.   

 

 
Psychiatric reports 
6.  I  have  had  the  benefit  of  reading  and  studying  the  reports  of  two  eminent  and 
experienced  Consultant  Forensic  Psychiatrists:  Dr  Dinesh  Maganty  MBBS 
FRCPsych  (instructed  by  the  Defence),  and  Dr  J.P.  Kenney-Herbert  MBBS 
FRANZCP  MRCPsych  (instructed  by  the  Prosecution).  Dr  Maganty  and  Dr 

 

1
--------
Kenney-Herbert are ad idem:  at the time, Mr Mann, you killed his wife, you were 
suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning brought about by a combination 
of a moderate depressive episode (or adjustment  disorder)  combined with enforced 
insomnia, due to your round-the-clock caring responsibilities for your wife, which 
substantially impaired your ability to make rational judgments.  I am grateful to both 
doctors for their lucid and powerful reports.   

 
7.  Dr Maganty referred, insightfully, to the “perfect storm of events” which led tragically 

to you doing what you did that night. 

 
8.  First and foremost was the deteriorating physical and mental health of your dear wife, 
Janet. She had suffered medical problems for a long time. In 2008, she was admitted 
to hospital to remove some piles but due to a urinary infection had to be fitted with a 
catheter. She found this traumatic and difficult to endure. She complained of pains all 
down her legs and not being able to sit down and of her skin being ‘on fire’ and not 
wanting to wear any clothes as a result. Attempts were made to pinpoint the problem 
and ameliorate the symptoms but without much success, although by 2012 the pain 
had stabilised somewhat. However, by this time Janet began to suffer from memory 
loss and the onset of dementia, which included her being unable to recall how to use 
light switches or to wash.  

 
9.  Second,  was  the  death  of  your  brother  (and  her  brother-in-law),  Roger,  which 
caused her physical and mental health to deteriorate significantly. She was admitted 
to hospital on 7th May 2014 in a considerable state of distress rocking back and forth, 
crying and wailing.  She remained in hospital until 20th May 2014 and whilst there 
she  said  word  to  the  effect  of  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this”  or  “I  don’t  want  to  live 
anymore”.  She was re-admitted to hospitable on 1st June until 11th June 2014.  Due 
to  problems  with  her  catheter  which  caused  her  great  pain  and  distress,  Janet  was 
then  returned  to  hospital  on  12th  to  13th  June  and  again  on  14th  June  2014.    She 
pulled out several catheters. 

 
10. Third, from the very beginning of these medical problems in 2008, you had been a 
most  devoted  and  assiduous  carer  for  your  wife,  Janet.  From  2012,  this  effectively 
became  a  full  time  job:  washing  her,  preparing  special  purée  foods  for  her, 
accompanying her to the toilet (at least ‘twenty times’ a day), and making sure she 
was comfortable at night. You slept on a sofa for six years because your movements 
on  the  bed  made  her  pain  worse.    You  rarely  had  more  than  3  hours  sleep  at  a 
stretch.  You wanted to remain close at hand. 

 
11. Fourth, you were described as very “stoical” and “a proud man” who felt that it was 
your duty to care for your wife Janet yourself. You were never head to complain, 
however difficult it was. Your daughters, Michelle Holmes and Elaine Hassall, visited 
regularly.  You  are  blessed  with  a  close  and  loving  family.  There  was  community 
nursing support. But you effectively became homebound to look after your wife as 
her main carer. And it is clear that you tried your best to cope on a daily basis in very 
difficult circumstances, including her regular manifestations of pain and distress and 
her  confusions.    You  almost  certainly  did  not  appreciate  the  physical  and  mental 
strain and toll that all this was having on you. It was only latterly, on 18th and 19th 
June, when things began to deteriorate very seriously, did you begin to ask for extra 
help from social services. It is significant, as Dr Maganty has pointed out, that you 
had not slept for 24 hours before the night in question.   

 

2
--------
Events of 20th June 2014 
 
12. You called 999 at 02.20 hours on 20th June 2014 and told the call handler “I  have 
just killed my wife”. You said “she’s in dementia; she’s not slept for two days and she’s very 
very  distressed  telling  me  to  help  her  to  go”.  The  police  arrived  at  your  house  in 
Nuneaton in 4 minutes and you showed them to the downstairs bedroom and said “I 
hope she’s gone.”  The police found your wife lying on her back in bed with an 11 cm 
kitchen knife sticking out of her upper abdomen, just below the rib cage. You said 
“I gave her her medication tonight, she has been struggling to go to the toilet, she was asking 
me to help her and said that I had promised.”  You explained what you had done and 
told the officer ”I was in the Army.  I was taught to do it properly”.   

 
13. The  post  mortem  evidence  suggested  that  she  would  have  died  quickly.  You  were 
arrested and taken to the police station. You explained in interview how your wife’s 
condition  and  ability  to  cope  with  her  catheter  had  been  rapidly  deteriorating  and 
that the previous two days had been particularly bad. You explained “she’s never been 
as bad as this; she’s never never screamed, it was like a howl”.  She said did not want to go 
on or go to hospital and had spat out the sleeping pills you gave her and was trying 
to pull out the catheter again. You explained how at this point “I went into the kitchen 
and she was screaming, howling. I thought God Janet and that’s when I did it.” You said “I 
walked  straight  in  and  stabbed  her  and  that’s  it  finished.    I  put  some  new  underwear  on 
[her]… and kissed her and said I love you.” 

 
14. Mrs Mann’s death was caused by a single directed thrust into heart. There were no 
defensive injuries or injuries to indicate forceful restraint or resistance. Death would 
have occurred rapidly. 

 

 
Psychiatric reports conclusions – diminished responsibility 
 
15. Dr Maganty stated in the conclusion to his report: 

 

 

“3.  Mr  Mann,  at  the  material  time  of  the  index  offence,  was  suffering  with  a  moderate 
depressive episode, which is a mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 
1983  (amended  2007).  This  combined  with  enforced  insomnia  due  to  his  round  the  clock 
caring responsibility would individually and in combination constitute an abnormality of mental 
functioning.  A  moderate  depressive  disorder  is  a  recognised  medical  condition.  Mr  Mann’s 
moderate depressive episode together with the concurrent insomnia affected his rational judgment 
at the material time and his ability to exercise self-control. Mr Mann was a devoted husband 
and cared and supported his wife, Janet Mann, on a round the clock basis for years. His love 
and  care  for  her  has  not  been  questioned  by  the  numerous  individuals  that  have  provided 
witness statements and also have come into contact with the couple. Unfortunately this led to 
underestimation of her care needs and his ability to provide the care due to his unquestioning 
devotion to her. His psychological makeup, which led him to take a position that he did not 
want  to  “put  on  to  others”  what  he  saw  as  his  duty  to  care  for  his  wife,  led  to  reduced 
professional  care  for  his  wife  and  him.  In  my  opinion,  I  could  no  identify  any  other  more 
probable  explanation  for  the  killing  other  than  his  moderate  depressive  episode  affection  his 
rational judgment and his exercise of self-control leading the index offence. In my opinion, his 
moderate depressive episode in the circumstances outlined above would provide an explanation 
for the killing. In my opinion his moderate depressive was a significant contributing factor to the 
killing.”

16. Dr Kenney-Herbert stated in the conclusion to his report: 

 

“87. Mr Mann in many ways underplays the burden of looking after his wife and the effects 
upon  on  physically  and  psychologically.  To  this  end  it  is  difficult  to  gain  a  clear  history  in 
details from him regarding his psychological and mental health leading up to the alleged index 
offence.  However,  based  on  all  the  available  information,  I  think  it  is  highly  likely  he  was 
suffering from an abnormal mental state at the time of the alleged index offence. He had not 
slept for days and this was with a background of chronic poor sleep. He had lost weight and 
described  to  Dr  Maganty  feeling low  in  mood.  He  is  unable  to  grasp  the  complexities  of  his 
wife’s  situation  and  does  in  particular  focus  that  all  the  problems  were  somehow  related  to  a 
fractured coccyx from many years ago. It is clear from the information I have seen no-one told 
him that this was the cause of all her problems. It would appear at the time of the alleged index 
offence he saw no way forward other than to do what Janet Mann from his perspective wanted 
him to do and that was to end her suffering and to honour their agreement to do so in such 
circumstances. This may present a moderate depressive episode; it could also be described as an 
adjustment disorder.” 

 
17. I accept both their reports and conclusions. I am also satisfied that, not only did you 
love  your  wife  very  much,  but  you  were  at  the  time  under  the  most  unbearable 
strain and suffering from the abnormality of mind described by Dr Maganty and Dr 
Kenney-Herbert  in  their  reports.  The  use  of  a  knife  to  kill  your  wife  in  this  way 
exceptional,  but  perhaps  symptomatic  of  your  desperation  in  the  heat  of  the 
moment. You had not forgotten your training in the Army and knew how to use a 
knife. As I have said, I am satisfied that you acted on impulse. 

 
18. Mr Grieves-Smith had indicated that, in view of the context and the evidence in this 
case, the Prosecution will accept a plea to manslaughter in this case on the grounds of 
diminished  responsibility.    In  my  judgment,  in  the  light  of  the  facts  and  evidence 
which I have outlined, it is entirely right and appropriate that the Prosecution should 
do so and I sentence on that basis. 

 
Principles  
 
19. I  have  considered  the  authorities  including,  in  particular,  R  v.  Leslie  Susan  Higgins 
[1996]  1  Cr  App  R  (S)  271,  R  v  Chambers  5  Cr.  App.  R.  (S)  190),  Attorney 
General’s  Reference  No.83  of  2009  (Patrick  John  Andrew  Moore)  [2010]  2 
Cr.App.R.(S.) 26 at 161, R v Webb  [2011] 2 Cr. App. R. (S) 61, R. v Beaver (Peter 
Richard) [CACD 24 March 2015, unreported]).  In the light of the authorities, it seems 
to me that the principles to be applied when sentencing in cases of manslaughter by 
diminished responsibility such as the present are as follows: 

 

 

 

(1)  The  fundamental  principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  is  always  to  be 

respected and reflected in the sentence passed. 

 
(2)  The  culpability  of  the  defendant  in  diminished  responsibility  manslaughter 
cases may sometimes be reduced almost to extinction, whilst in others it may 
remain very high.  Each case will depend on its own particular facts. 

(3) 

Subject  to  the  specific  element  of  reduced  culpability  inherent  in  the 
defence, the assessment of the seriousness of the instant offence of diminished 

4
--------
responsibility manslaughter should have regard to the guidance in Schedule 
21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 

In  assessing  the  seriousness  of  a  killing  consequent  on  manslaughter  rather 
than  murder,  regard  should  be  had  to  the  criteria  for  determining  the 
minimum term to be served in murder cases and then to reduce the sentence 
to allow for the extent to which the culpability of the offender was reduced 
by his or her mental condition. 

In diminished responsibility cases, there are various courses open to a judge. 
In  cases  where  the  evidence  indicates  that  the  responsibility  of  the  accused 
for his acts was so grossly impaired that his degree of responsibility for them 
was minimal, a lenient course will be open to the judge. Provided that there 
is no danger of repetition of violence, it will usually be possible to make such 
an  order  as  will  give  the  accused  his  freedom,  possibly  with  some 
supervision. 

It is of central importance that a court must not overlook the feelings of the 
family  of  the  deceased.  It  is  of  the  greatest  importance  that  those  feelings 
should be respected. 

In an appropriate case, the principle of the sanctity of human life would not 
be undermined if an immediate custodial sentence was not imposed.

Analysis 
 
20. As I said at the beginning, this is an exceptionally sad and tragic case. I am satisfied 
that the night you killed your wife and were under the most extreme pressure and 
suffering from an abnormality of mind as described.   

 
21. This  case  has  some  features  in  common  with  R  v.  Webb  (supra)  and  the  following 

observations of Lord Judge LCJ are pertinent: 

 

 

“24. 
 On any view this was an exceptionally difficult sentencing exercise. The killing 
of Mrs Webb was, and will always be, the result of an unlawful act. On the basis of 
diminished  responsibility  it  was  not  murder,  but  manslaughter  committed  as  a  mercy 
killing intended by the appellant to help his wife achieve her settled intention to end her 
own life, notwithstanding his pleas to her that she should not do so. In our judgment his 
actions in this case came very close to the offence of assisting in his wife's intended suicide, 
acting as he did to fulfil her clear, unequivocal wishes to end her life, so that when she 
failed to achieve what she wanted, he took over from her. 
25. 
 All  this  must  be  set  in  the  context  of  a  man  whose  responsibility,  if  not 
altogether extinguished, was substantially reduced. We accept the submission that if he 
had  not  been  in  the  situation  in  which  he  was  and  suffering  from  the  condition  from 
which he did suffer, it is most unlikely that this killing would have occurred. We remind 
ourselves of the turmoil which he must have suffered as he committed the last fatal act. 
26. 
 The  appellant  has  now  served  the  equivalent  of  a  sentence  of  six  months' 
imprisonment. In the unusual and particular circumstances of this case we do not believe 
that  the  principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  would  be  undermined  if  the  sentence 
imposed  on  the  appellant  were  now  reduced  to  one  of  twelve  months'  imprisonment, 
suspended, so that this lonely old man may receive the help that he will need to come to 
terms with the disaster that has overtaken him.” 

5
--------
22. In  R  v.  Webb  (supra),  the  Court  of  Appeal  quashed  the  order  of  immediate 
imprisonment  and  substituted  an  order  of  twelve  months'  imprisonment  suspended 
for twelve months and attached a supervision order. 

 
23. R v. Webb was recently considered and applied in R. v Beaver (Peter Richard) (CACD 
24  March  2015,  unreported),  on  facts  striking  similar  to  the  present  (although  Beaver 
could not be described as a case of mercy killing).  The Court of Appeal in that case 
quashed a sentence of imprisonment of three years and substituted a sentence of two 
years suspended for two years, with conditions. 

 
Defence submissions 
 
24. I am grateful to Mr Hankin QC for his measured and helpful submissions.  I accept 
his  central  submission  that  your  responsibility,  Mr  Mann,  for  killing  hour  wife  is 
substantially  reduced,  if  not  altogether  extinguished,    by  virtue  of  the  depressive 
episode and adjustment disorder from which you was suffering at the material time. 
If you had not been in the situation in which you were was and suffering from the 
condition from which he did suffer, it is most unlikely that this killing would have 
occurred.  

 
25. I  also  accept,  in  the  light  of  all  the  evidence,  that  your  residual  culpability  was 
minimal. You are selfless and decent man and devoted to your wife and were, to a 
large extent motivated, by a desire to alleviate your wife’s suffering and to honour 
what  you  saw  as  your  commitment  that  you  should  do  so.  You  were  appalled  by 
what, cruelly, she was having to endure. You felt were driven to act as he did.   I 
repeat that the act of killing was an impulsive one, committed under extraordinary 
stress.   

 

26. Mr Hankin QC rightly acknowledges this was not a case of assisted suicide. It was, 
rather, a case of ‘mercy killing’ by manslaughter. It is right to acknowledge, however, 
that this is compelling evidence that Mrs Mann had wanted her suffering to end: 

 

(1)  Mrs Mann repeatedly told you that she didn’t want “to go on”. As presaged 
above,  when  asked  during  the  999  call  why  he  had  killed  his  wife  the 
defendant said “she’s very, very distressed, telling me to help her go…she asked me 
for days”. In interview, when explaining why you waited some time before 
calling the police (to ensure your could not be revived) you said  “she didn’t 
want  to  come  back,  I  knew  that,  she  didn’t  want  to  come  back…when  we  were 
younger we always said we’d look after each other…she said ‘I don’t want to live like 
this’…you’ll help me’”. 

(2)  During  Mrs  Mann  time  in  hospital  in  May  2014,  she  was  heard  by  her 
daughter,  Michelle  Holmes,  to  say  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this  anymore”. 
Michelle Holmes also reports that on the 17th June Mrs Mann, when she was 
crying in agony, said to her “I don’t want to live like this…I don’t want to live 
anymore”.  

 

(3)  Mrs Mann’s other daughter Elaine Hassall says that she told her “I can’t live 

like this” and “I don’t want to live like this” many times in May and June.  

 

6
--------
(4)  Your  sister  Maxine  Jardine  also  reports  that  during  the  same  period  Mrs. 
Mann  said  to  her  “I  don’t  want  to  live  like  this,  this  isn’t  living”  and  on  one 
occasion while in hospital said “I want to die”. 

 
27. As  Mr  Hankin  QC  has  rightly  emphasised,  an  indication  of  how  great  was  the 
burden was on you that neither daughter, Michelle Holmes or Elaine Hassall, bears 
any  resentment  towards  him;  indeed  each  expresses  their  relief  that  their  mother’s 
suffering has ended. As Mr Grieves-Smith has highlighted, both have spoken of you, 
their father, in the most glowing terms and spoken movingly of the privations your 
wife suffered and your devoted care for her.  

 
28. Michelle Holmes said in her statement to the Court:  
 

“I  was  devastated  by  the  news  but  in  some  ways  felt  great  relief.  Mum  was  no  longer 
suffering or in pain and it felt like at last she was at peace as she had been suffering for so 
long. Immediately I had no hard feelings to my dad. I only felt love, support and gratitude 
to him…Dad provided mum with amazing care and utter devotion and we are glad of how 
he cared for her. All our family support him and want him home, none of us feels any ill 
will towards him.”  

 
29. Elaine Hassall said in her statement to the Court: 

 

“I hold no ill feelings towards dad and fully support him. I understand that he loved her 
and did it for her…I love my dad, I support my dad, I support what he has done. He 
adored mum and only did what he did out of love. We do not want him to be in prison, 
we want him home with us”. 

 
Mitigation 
 
30. You are now 78 years old. You were born in Nuneaton and have lived there all your 
life. You met your wife at a dance when you were seventeen and since then have 
never spent much time apart, save for you stint on National Service. You have led an 
exemplary  life.    After  National  Service  you  worked  as  a  mechanic  in  the  motor 
industry before joining the Coal Board. You and your late wife were very much part 
of the local community and had a strong network of friends. You and Janet enjoyed 
many  activities  together  including  ballroom  dancing,  gardening  and  cycling.    You 
and  your  wife  did  voluntary  work  for  a  number  of  years  at  the  George  Elliot 
Hospital  and  for  a  local  cancer  charity.  Your  have  been  described  you  as  a  “very 
devoted father and husband” and as a very generous person who would “do anything for 
anyone”.  You have a close and loving family who do not blame you for what you 
have done.   

 
31. You are a man in your late seventies. You are someone of positive good character 
with an impeccable employment record and a long history of voluntary work.  You 
have  led  an  industrious,  hardworking  and  decent  life.  You  have  been  devoted  to 
your wife and family.  

 
32. I  have  been  provided  with  a  file  overflowing  with  testimonials  from  friends, 
neighbours, acquaintances from all walks of life, many of whom have know you and 
your wife, Janet, for 30 years or more, who speak eloquently about the strength of 
your marriage and what a kind, caring couple you were. They speak poignantly and 
movingly  about  the  years  of  devoted  care  you  gave  to  your  wife.    They  speak  of 

 

7
--------
your  kindness  and  generosity  to  everyone  you  met.  I  quote  from  one  letter,    in 
particular, by way of example: 

 

“The best way of describing Tony would be say that he is a prime example of a 
PERFECT ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. Over the years, he and his wife were 
inseparable.  He adored her.” 

 

 
33. In  my  judgment,  in  the  exceptional  circumstances  of  this  case,  an  immediate 
custodial sentence for manslaughter is not required. This case is at the lowest end of 
culpability. Your daughters and other family members have clear and unequivocally 
expressed  the  wish  that  you  (and  they)  do  not  suffer  further  by  you  being  sent  to 
prison.  This  seems  to  me  to  be  a  paradigm  case  for  leniency  and  mercy.  The 
principle  of  the  sanctity  of  human  life  would  not  be  undermined  if  the  sentence 
imposed on you were to be suspended.    

 
34. There is no public interest or need to send you to prison.  I am satisfied that, given 
the exceptional circumstances of this case, and whilst mindful of the need to reflect 
the sanctity of human life, this case can nevertheless properly be dealt with by way of 
a Suspended Sentence Order. 

 
35. You reported what you had done and fully assisted the police in their enquiries into 
the  circumstances  of  his  wife’s  death.  You  pleaded  guilty  at  the  first  opportunity. 
You do not pose a danger to the public in any way. I am satisfied that is not a case 
where  any  form  of  supervision  is  necessary.  The  recent  amendments  to  the 
suspended  sentence  provisions  by  LASPOA  2012  now  allow  for  a  suspended 
sentence for up to two year’s duration and for a sentence to be suspended without 
any community requirements being attached to that sentence (c.f. Archbold 5-538). 

 

 
Sentence 
36. Mr Mann, please stand up. You have pleaded not guilty today to murder but guilty 
to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. That is a plea with the Court 
accepts. For this offence, for the reasons I have given, the sentence which I impose is 
a  sentence  of  two  years  imprisonment,  suspended  for  two  years.  The  usual  victim 
surcharge order applies. 

 
37. I  am  grateful  to  Mr  Grieves-Smith  and  Mr  Hankin  QC  for  their  able  assistance 

today.

2225075,Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw: R v Victorino Chua,"R v Victorino Chua 

 

In the Manchester Crown Court 

 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw 

 

19th May 2015 

 

 

 

After a trial of four months, including a jury retirement of three weeks, the defendant Victorino 
Chua has been convicted by the jury of the murder of two patients, the poisoning of nineteen 
other patients and the attempted poisoning of seven other patients. I must set out the facts, in 
accordance with the verdict of the jury.  

The defendant is now aged 49. He was born in the Philippines; he claims to have qualified as a 
nurse in Manila.  He came to the UK in 2002, with his wife and two children. After working in a 
couple of local Care Homes, he became a Staff Nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital, in Stockport.   

The defendant always worked the night shifts on the male and female acute medical wards, A1 
and  A3.  Nearly  all  the  patients  in  those  wards  received  saline  solutions  dripped  from  bags, 
either  for  hydration  or  as  a  means  of  introducing  prescribed  medication;  the  bags  were 
administered through cannulae; these sometimes became blocked and had to be flushed using 
a  saline  solution  from  a  plastic  ampoule.  In  the  hospital,  huge  numbers  of  saline  bags  and 
ampoules were used; these were stored in the Treatment Rooms, attached to the wards. All 
nurses had access to the Treatment Rooms, where insulin was also kept, for the treatment of 
diabetic patients. 

The  evidence  establishes  that  in  the  three  weeks  between  the  end  of  June  and  the  15  July 
2011, the defendant injected saline bags with insulin.  He did so with considerable cunning: he 
made  a  tiny  slit  in  the  outer  plastic  packaging,  just  above  the  rubber  port  or  septum  of  the 
inner saline bag through which a nurse could properly inject prescribed medication; he then 
inserted the needle of a hypodermic syringe through the slit of the packaging and through the 
septum  of  the  saline  bag  and  by  that  means  injected  insulin  into  the  bag.  Since  insulin  is 
colourless, he knew and intended that if a contaminated saline bag was to be taken from the 
Treatment Room by a nurse it would then be administered to a patient without any chance of 
the contamination being detected.  

 

1
--------
Only  a  very  small  amount  of  insulin  will  cause  the  glucose  levels  in  the  body  to  fall;  since 
glucose is the fuel for most of the body’s vital processes, falls in the glucose levels results in the 
unpleasant and  dangerous  symptoms  of  hypoglycaemia;  typically  the patients  sweat,  and  go 
pale, their heart races, often the body temperature falls; in more severe hypoglycaemia, the 
patient may experience tremors or shaking and even fits; the patient may become confused or 
irrational.  Hypoglycaemia  can  be  rapidly  corrected  by  the  administration  of  glucose  but 
effective  treatment  depends  on  timely  detection  and  intervention.  Without  treatment,  the 
prolonged deprivation of glucose will result in an insult to the brain, leading to a reduction of 
consciousness and eventually deep coma; irreversible brain damage and even death can result.  

Elderly and infirm patients are particularly susceptible, since they may be unable to throw off 
the effects of insulin. Most patients in those wards were elderly and frail, some were seriously 
ill, some even had terminal illnesses. All these patients were therefore acutely vulnerable and 
susceptible  to  the  effects  of  insulin  poisoning.  The  defendant  was  an  experienced  nurse;  he 
knew and intended that the administration of insulin would cause these effects. 

Furthermore,  he  also  injected  insulin  into  saline  ampoules,  by  piercing  the  plastic  container 
with a hypodermic syringe. 

It  is  a  striking,  sinister  and  truly  wicked  feature  of  the  case  that  he  did  not  personally 
administer contaminated products directly to most of these the patients, for having left saline 
bags and ampoules contaminated with insulin in the Treatment Rooms, he did not know which 
nurse  would  innocently  collect  them,  still  less  to  which  patient  the  nurse  would  then 
unwittingly administer the poison. Thus, nearly all the victims were chosen at random; it is as if 
he left it to fate to decide who would be the victim.    

I  turn  then  to  the  counts  of  murder;  these  were  among  his  random  victims;  the  defendant 
killed these patients by contaminating saline bags or ampoules with insulin, which other nurses 
then unwittingly administered to them.  

Count 9 the murder of Tracy Arden 

Tracey  Arden  was  aged  44  at  the  time  of  her  admission  to  Stepping  Hill.  She  had  a 
degenerative disease similar to Multiple Sclerosis, which over the years had caused a gradual 
deterioration in her condition: she had lost mobility; she had become bed bound; she had lost 
her  speech  and  then  her  sight;  she  had  to  be  fed  by  tube.  She  lived  at  a  Residential  Home, 
where she was well looked after. In spite of these many misfortunes, she retained her happy 
personality;  she  was  ready  to  smile  and  she  could  respond  by  sound  and  gesture  to 
conversations. Her condition was attended by many and frequent complications, which often 
required hospital treatment; in this way she became well known and well liked by the nurses at 
Stepping Hill. 

On 6 July, she was sent to Stepping Hill for observations. She had some mild infection, but it 
was expected that after the administration of anti‐biotics she would recover.  

However  there  was  a  sudden  and  unexpected  deterioration  in  her  condition;  her  breathing 
became  slow  and  distressed;  she  was  taking  as  little  as  one  breath  a  minute,  which  is  not 
enough to sustain life. Tests showed that she had catastrophically low blood glucose levels. She 
had  been  poisoned  by  exogenous  insulin  that  is  to  say  by  synthetic  insulin  which  had  been 
unlawfully administered to her.  

An  examination  of  her  medical  records  strongly  suggests  that  the  means  by  which  this  was 
administered to her was by her cannula being flushed by a contaminated saline ampoule.  

 

2
--------
Tracy  Arden  was  severely  disabled  by  her  pre‐existing  condition;  she  was  prone  to  chest 
infections,  but  this  infection  was  relatively  mild;  she  was  expected  to  recover.  During  the 
course  of  her  treatment;  she  developed  very  severe  and  unexplained  hypoglycaemia,  which 
lasted for nearly 8 hours. The hypoglycaemia caused her brain damage and it caused her acute 
respiratory problems; her copious secretions made her breathing more difficult, therefore she 
could not get oxygen into the lungs, and hypoxia ensued, that is brain damage resulting from a 
lack of oxygen. Therefore, the hypoglycaemia and the consequent hypoxia, contributed to her 
death; they made a substantial contribution to advancing or hastening her death. 

I quote from her victim personal statement from Mrs Arden, Tracey’s mother, which ends in 
this way: ‘Tracey battled for twelve years with her illness and was still fighting. It hurts to know 
that she wanted to fight and the chance to keep going was taken away from her. It should have 
been her choice to stop and die peacefully and naturally. …’ 

Instead  of  which  she  died  in  great  distress  because  she  had  been  wickedly  poisoned  by  the 
defendant.  

Her murder is alleged in count 9 in the indictment. In the light of the conviction on that count, 
there  was  no  need  to  take  a  verdict  on  the  alternative  charge  of  attempting  to  cause  her 
grievous bodily harm with intent as charged in count 9A.  

Count 16 the murder of Derek Weaver  

I turn Derek Weaver, who was aged 83.  

In the early evening of Sunday 10 July, he was taken to Stepping Hill, with Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease, with heart failure and in a confused state, he was obviously very unwell, 
even then in a critical condition.  

In the early hours of the following morning, 11 July: he was found grey and unwell; a blood test 
was taken, which showed grossly unnatural levels of insulin and disastrously low blood glucose 
levels. He also had been poisoned by insulin. 

When his sister arrived, he was fighting for his breath, convulsing violently, sweating profusely 
and his eyes rolling back into his head. He appeared to her to be in agony. 

His condition deteriorated; he declined into unconsciousness; he died on 21 July; that is to say 
10 days later. 

The expert evidence was to the effect that the hypoglycaemia caused reduced consciousness, 
during which time the body’s protective reflexes are impaired: the patient does not cough, nor 
are  deep  breathes  taken  to  clear  the  lungs,  so  the  infection  increases.  In  this  way,  the 
hypoglycaemic episodes increased the severity of his illness and made it more certain that he 
would die and were a material contribution to him dying when he did. 

His  passing,  and  what  his  sister  calls  the  indescribable  pain  that  he  suffered  has  caused 
immense sadness to his family, as his sister movingly describes.  

His murder is the subject of count 16 in the indictment. In the light of the conviction on that 
count, there was no need to take a verdict on the alternative charge of attempting to cause 
him grievous bodily harm with intent as charged in count 17.  

Both these patients, Tracy Arden and Derek Weaver were random victims of the defendant’s 
acts.

--------
Count 20 Grant Misell 

I turn next to those patients who suffered insulin poisoning at the time that they were being 
treated by the defendant personally: the most serious case concerns Grant Misell.  

In count 20 of the indictment the defendant was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm to 
Grant Misell with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 18 of the Offences 
against the Person Act 1861.  

Grant Misell was aged 41. He had a history of clinical depression. On 10 July 2011, he took an 
overdose;  fortunately,  he  alerted  his  sister  and  she  called  the  ambulance;  he  was  taken  to 
Stepping Hill. 

The doctor who examined him on admission considered that everything seemed to be all right 
with  the  patient;  he  was  only  admitted  as  a  precaution,  so  that  his  condition  could  be 
monitored.  His  progress  through  the  emergency  ward  was  essentially  uneventful  and  his 
condition was not causing concern.  

At about half past one in the morning, he was taken to ward A1 and put in one of the beds in 
the Bay where the defendant was on duty as the staff nurse. The defendant took his medical 
history  on  admission,  he  recorded  that  he  was  fully  mobile,  was  aware  of  his  surroundings, 
with no communication problems; he assessed that he presented only a ‘low risk’. 

At  a  quarter  past  3,  he  recorded  the  administration  of  one  litre  of  normal  saline  delivered 
intravenously; there is, of course, only the defendant’s word that it was actually delivered at 
that time. 

At  04.34  (the  time  is  recorded  electronically),  the  defendant  took  a  Point  of  Care  Test  to 
measure  the  patient’s  blood  glucose  reading;  considered  on  its  own  that  might  have  been 
justified  but  at  or  about  the  same  time  the  defendant  took  similar  tests  from  all  the  other 
patients  in  his  Bay.  This  had  no  possible  medical  justification.  It  is  impossible  to  avoid  the 
conclusion  that  these  tests  were  done  to  cover  what  the  defendant  was  about  to  do  (or 
possibly what he had just done).  

At or about a quarter past six, the defendant took a sample of blood; this had been requested 
by the doctor on admission; by chance, that sample was not destroyed; it was later retrieved 
and  laboratory  analysis  showed  that  even  at  that  time  the  patient  had  very  high  levels  of 
insulin, consistent only with the administration of exogenous insulin. I have no doubt that the 
defendant took that test also as a device to show his apparent confidence that all was well; he 
cannot   have   known  that  the  sample  would  by  chance  be  preserved  and  that  advanced 
techniques at another hospital might reveal the presence of insulin.  

A  patient  in  a  nearby  bed,  Mr  Derek  Inge  (who  has  now  died)  described  Grant  Misell’s 
condition early that morning: he appeared to be really unwell; he was making strange noises, 
at first Mr Inge thought it was just snoring but he then realised it was something else, more like 
moaning and groaning; Grant Misell was lying on his side in a foetal position; he was making 
these noises for maybe a couple of hours. Quite plainly Grant Misell was in the grips of severe, 
even catastrophic hypoglycaemia.  

Yet, the defendant described the patient’s condition as at six o’clock as being ‘left comfortable 
in bed’. At 7 o’clock he described him as being ‘alert’. Even as he went off duty at a quarter to 
eight, he gave no indication that there was any thing wrong – let alone seriously wrong ‐ with 
Grant  Misell;  he  told  the  day  staff  at  the  handover  that  all  that  was  needed  was  for  him  to 
sleep it off.  

 

4
--------
He must have realised that Grant Misell was gravely ill with severe hypoglycaemia. The entries 
that he made at 6 and 7 o’clock and what he said when he went off duty were plainly untrue, 
intended to conceal what he had done.  

When  the  day  staff  came  to  check  him  on  their  ward  round  at  a  quarter  past  8,  he  was 
twitching all over his body; he was in a coma, deeply unconscious; not rousable to pain. He had 
laboured breathing; he even stopped breathing entirely for fully 10 seconds; it was a medical 
emergency. He was given a Glasgow Coma Scale of just 3; the lowest possible. He was rushed 
to intensive care but he was still connected to the contaminated saline drip; his catastrophic 
hypoglycaemia therefore continued for many hours. 

Despite  the  very  best  skilled  medical  attention  which  he  received,  he  had  sustained  severe 
brain damage, from which he made a very slow, gradual but imperfect recovery. The expert 
opinion  was  to  the  effect  that  the  insulin  poisoning  caused  his  unconsciousness  and  that 
resulted in the irreversible brain damage. 

The  only  mechanism  for  the  insulin  to  have  been  delivered  was  the  saline  bag  which  the 
defendant had administered to him. Quite when and how and why the defendant administered 
insulin to Grant Misell, only the defendant now knows, and plainly he will not answer any of 
these questions but he must known and intended the result.  

The  effects  upon  Grant  Misell  have  been  catastrophic.  He  has  been  transformed  from  a 
professional accountant, transacting multi‐million pound deals to someone who, quite literally, 
can no longer hold down a job stacking supermarket shelves. It would be unkind to recite all his 
difficulties but, with help from his sisters, he has set them down in moving statement which I 
have  read  with  great  care.  His  statement  ends  with  these  words:  ‘In  short,  the  attack  has 
destroyed my life, not only in financial terms but in the area of self esteem and self worth; I 
now feel completely worthless and can see no way forward to improve this in the future’.  

This  offence  committed  upon  Grant  Misell  is,  in  itself,  a  grave  crime;  it  deserves  condign 
punishment. 

The counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent 

I  turn  now  to  the  other  patients  each  of  whom  received  a  health  care  product  which  the 
defendant had contaminated with insulin; this gave rise to the charge of attempting to cause 
them  grievous  bodily  harm  with  intent,  contrary  to  section  18  of  the  Offences  against  the 
Person  Act  1861.  First  I  mention  those  patients  to  whom  the  defendant  personally 
administered the insulin. 

Count 7 Beryl Hope  

So I come to count 7 and Beryl Hope. She was aged 70 when she was admitted to Stepping Hill 
on 5 July 2011. She was very ill with cancer of the oesophagus; the tumour had spread to her 
liver.  She  could  not  swallow;  so  she  had  not  eaten  and  was  wasting  away  and  was  weak; 
because  she  could  not  drink,  she  had  become  dehydrated;  she  was  therefore  peculiarly 
susceptible to the effects of insulin poisoning.  

There was an incident, trivial in itself, which I consider to be highly significant. There was in an 
adjacent bed, another patient (whom I need not name); she was a retired nurse. She realised 
that  Beryl  Hope  was  very  poorly;  from  her  experience  she  thought  that  Mrs  Hope  required 
some more active nursing and she went to find the defendant, who was the nurse in charge; 
and she told him what she thought. Plainly the defendant resented this act of interference, as 

 

5
--------
he  saw  it:  she  said  that  he  became  very  angry,  he  just  exploded;  she  was  astonished  at  his 
aggressive and contemptuous reaction.  

In view of what happened, I am driven to conclude that he took this out on Mrs Hope. During 
his  shift,  at  03.00,  the  defendant  recorded  that  he  had  administered  a  saline  bag,  to  the 
patient;  that  might  have  been  the  vehicle  by  which  she  was  poisoned  or  he  may  later  have 
flushed her cannula with a contaminated ampoule but that he knowingly administered insulin 
to her in some way is clear, as the jury have found. 

The defendant made a series of entries in the records, at 07.00 and 07.10 noting that all was 
well  with  Beryl  Hope;  but  all  was  not  well,  just  5  minutes  later,  she  was  found  to  be 
unresponsive,  sweaty,  with  a  very  high  heart  rate;  a  blood  test  showed  that  she  also  had  a 
catastrophically low blood glucose reading. In fact, because her condition was caught in time, 
she  was  given  glucose  and  she  rallied  to  some  extent  but  her  family  believes  that  she  was 
never the same again.  

Sadly, she died from her cancer a couple of months later.  

Count 2 ‘Jack’ Beeley  

I turn to count 2 and to John Beeley, known as Jack. He had meningitis as a boy, which caused 
some residual learning difficulty. He also had brain damage following a road traffic accident. In 
June 2011, he had bowel cancer and needed full time nursing care.  

On  27  June  2011,  he  was  admitted  to  Stepping  Hill,  suffering  from  a  variety  of  ailments 
including  vomiting  and  shortness  of  breath.  He was  confused  and  unable  to  give  a  coherent 
history of his condition. He was continually shouting but not making any sense. He often pulled 
out his cannula.  

Early the following morning, one of the treating nurses became concerned because the patient 
had suddenly become uncharacteristically quiet; she went to see him; his eyes were shut; he 
seemed  clammy,  the  nurse  shook  him  but  he  was  not  responsive.  It  was  obvious  that 
something was seriously wrong; tests showed that he had hypoglycaemia with very low blood 
glucose levels. He was given glucose and he recovered.  

The  nurse  noticed  that  he  was  hooked  up  to  a  saline  bag;  that  bag  must  have  been 
contaminated by insulin. But such a bag was not prescribed for him; it does not appear in his 
medical records. The defendant must have administered that bag; if anyone else had done so, 
they would have entered it on the patient’s records, for they would have nothing to hide; the 
only person with an interest in concealing the administration of the bag was the poisoner. So 
the  defendant  must  have  done  this,  presumably  to  shut  up  a  patient  whom  he  found  to  be 
particularly troublesome.   

It is quite clear from the statement provided by his sister that this incident in fact had a very 
serious effect upon the victim whose personality changed; he lost his zest for life. 

The deliberate poisoning of such an acutely vulnerable patient is truly despicable.   

I turn then to the other patients, those who were treated with saline bags or saline ampoules 
which the defendant had contaminated by insulin, and who had, in that way, the misfortune to 
be his random victims. 

Count 1 Josephine Walsh  

Josephine Walsh was aged 68. On 23 June 2011, she was admitted to Stepping Hill with long 
standing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. On 27 June, whilst she was receiving a saline 

 

6
--------
bag,  she  was  found  slumped  on  her  chair;  she  was  very  pale,  conscious  but  not  responding 
normally.  Mrs  Walsh  herself  remembered  being  soaking  with  perspiration;  she  felt  dizzy;  it 
was, she said, the scariest thing that had ever happened to her; she thought she was going to 
die.  

Fortunately her hypoglycaemia responded to treatment by glucose. Later, she must have been 
given  another  contaminated  bag  because  she  had  another  hypoglycaemic  episode,  with  the 
same distressing effects.  

Count 3 Mrs Linda McDonagh  

 

Mrs  Linda  McDonagh  was  aged  59.  She  had  a  history  of  Motor  Neurone  disease,  with 
difficulties  of  swallowing  and  speech.  Latterly  she  communicated  only  by  iPad.  She  was 
admitted to Stepping Hill on the 28 June with severe chest infection and aspiration pneumonia. 
She was seriously ill.  

She  was  treated  with  a  contaminated  saline  bag;  she  did  not  call  out  because  of  her 
communication  problems.  She  was  found  unresponsive  and  slumped;  she  also  was  suffering 
from hypoglycaemia. She was treated with glucose and recovered physically.  

However,  although  terminally  ill,  she  was  reluctant  to  again  to  seek  medical  attention, 
although  she  needed  it,  being  fearful  of  being  returned  to  hospital.  Furthermore,  when  she 
died, the family had to go through the additional trauma of intervention by the Coroner and a 
post mortem examination. This in turn has caused great stress to other members of the family, 
all of which is very clearly set out in the statements made by Mrs McDonagh’s daughters and 
her sister, which I have read with care.  

Count 4 Joseph MacDonald  

Count  4:  Joseph  Macdonald  was  aged  66.    On  27  June  2011,  he  returned  to  the  hospital  to 
receive  intra‐venous  anti‐biotics  to  treat  a  recurrence  of  his  cellulitis;  his  cannula  had  to  be 
flushed, because it was blocked with congealed blood; almost at once, he complained that he 
felt unwell; the nurse – understandably ‐ thought that he had had a reaction to the drugs. Mr 
Macdonald  said  that  he  felt  dreadful;  he  began  to  sweat  profusely;  he  felt  dehydrated;  he 
knew that he had an adverse reaction.  

The next day he again came back for another dose of anti‐biotics; again the nurse flushed the 
cannula  and  then  again  the  anti‐biotic  was  administered  intra‐venously,  using  a  saline  bag. 
Again,  very  shortly  afterwards  he  complained  of  being  unwell,  feeling  terrible,  sweating 
profusely; with the same symptom as the day before. The nurse said that he looked drowsy, 
clammy and sweaty; as if he was out of it; and he seemed to get worse; the nurse thought that 
he might be having a heart attack. This time a blood glucose reading was taken, which was very 
low.  

As the jury have found, he had two incidents of hypoglycaemia induced by insulin poisoning. 

Count 5 Anthony Smith  

Count 5: Anthony Smith was aged 48. He was admitted to Stepping Hill on 27 June 2011 with a 
number of symptoms related to his alcoholism. 

He  seemed  to  be  making  good  progress  until  he  had  an  unexpected  hypoglycaemic  episode 
with  increased  respirations  and  heart  rate.  He  became  agitated,  he  was  mumbling  and 
otherwise unresponsive, the nurse treating him thought he was having a seizure; a test showed 
a  very  low  blood  glucose  reading.  He  was  prescribed  intra‐venous  dextrose,  which  was 

 

7
--------
delivered and he very quickly became more responsive. He then had another similar episode; 
again he recovered after being treated with glucose.  

He later described how terrible and awful the experience was but he has now turned his life 
around and just feels grateful to be alive. 

Count 6 Joyce Atherton  

Count  6:  Mrs  Joyce  Atherton,  was  aged  81  when  admitted  to  Stepping  Hill  on  3  July,  with a 
chest infection and a productive cough, with a high temperature.  

Her  hypoglycaemia  was  observed  by  her  daughter,  who  described  how  her  mother  had 
become  wringing  wet  with  sweat,  yet  cold  and  clammy;  she  recognised  this  to  be  a 
hypoglycaemic  episode  and  called  for  help.   She   was  given  glucose  and  recovered  but  later, 
after  another  saline  bag  had  been  administered  she  had  another  attack:  she  complained  of 
feeling hot and clammy, she was not confused but she was drenched in sweat, she said that 
she  felt  rubbish;  the  nurse  thought  this  might  be  another  hypoglycaemic  episode  so  she 
administered another blood test which again showed very low glucose levels; so low as to be 
extreme and dangerous. Again she received glucose and recovered. 

She describes how what happened was a terrible ordeal; not a day goes by but that she thinks 
of it; for a long time it had a serious effect upon her mood.  

Count 8 Doreen Brace  

I move onto count 8 and Mrs Doreen Brace. She was aged 87. On the morning of 5 July 2011, 
she was admitted to Stepping Hill with chronic urinary tract infection, pulmonary disorder and 
many other age related illnesses including chronic kidney failure.  

Now there is a peculiar entry on one of her medical records; this is the ‘Infusion Chart for Fluid 
Replacement’ which is in the jury bundle at page 33 of divider 14 which purports to show the 
prescription of a litre of saline. The doctor did not sign that entry; it is a forged entry; since that 
same record shows that that litre of saline was administered to this patient by the defendant 
personally, in the context of the jury’s other findings, it must follow that he forged that entry. 
However, the patient did not suffer a hypoglycaemia as a result of the administration of that 
saline. I am sure that there must be some sinister explanation for this singular occurrence, but I 
cannot speculate as to what this might be; it is one of the unexplained mysteries of the case.  

There  is  no  doubt  that  Mrs  Brace  did  later  suffer  a  hypoglycaemic  episode.  This  must  have 
followed  the  administration  to  her  of  an  anti‐biotic  in  saline  solution;  in  fact  there  was 
evidence  that  this  drip  was  not  running  freely,  so  Mrs  Brace  did  not  in  fact  suffer  her 
hypoglycaemia until she had been transferred to another ward but she remained attached to 
the contaminated saline drip which she had received on Ward A3; a nurse saw that Mrs Brace 
did not look very well; she was damp with sweat yet ‘cold and clammy to touch’; she gave a 
very low blood glucose reading. She was given glucose and recovered.  

Count 10 Kathleen Murray 

Count 10: Kathleen Murray was aged 53. On 7 July, she went to Stepping Hill with labyrinthitis, 
an infection of the inner ear; the condition responded to treatment and she was shortly to be 
discharged.  She had however been given a saline drip contaminated with insulin; Mrs Murray 
herself described how she woke up in a terrible state, shaking violently, sweating, completely 
wet through, she called for the nurse. The nurse said she was cold, sweaty and clammy; she 
had a very low blood glucose reading; she gave her some glucose powder and a Mars bar, to 

 

8
--------
bring the blood sugar up; she increased the rate of flow of the intra‐venous fluid, thinking that 
that would help. 

For  a  short  time,  the  patient  recovered  but  later  Mrs  Murray  had  another  hypoglycaemic 
episode, she said that she had exactly the same symptoms as before. Again she responded to 
glucose. 

She has had a series of health related problems since being treated at Stepping Hill; it is not, I 
think, clear that all are related to her insulin poisoning but I do not doubt that she has suffered 
from  an  on  going  stress  related  condition,  which  was  caused  by  what  happened  to  her  at 
Stepping Hill. 

Count 11 Lilian Baker  

Count  11:  Lilian  Baker.  She  was  aged  85.  She  had  various  age  related  health  problems, 
including asthma and angina. In the early hours of 7 July, she was admitted to Stepping Hill, 
with internal bleeding.  

She was given a saline drip; after which she complained of feeling hot and flushed.  A blood 
sample revealed what one of the experts called ‘astronomically high’ levels of insulin, with very 
low levels of glucose. She also had been poisoned. 

Lilian Baker herself was later interviewed on video; she variously said that she was frightened; 
how it was awful; how her breathing was shocking, really bad; that she thought that she was 
going to die; indeed she said that she was that ill, she wanted to die.  

She responded to treatment with glucose but she was still attached to the contaminated drip 
and  suffered  another  attack,  with  the  same  consequences.  Again  she  recovered  after 
treatment with glucose. 

Count 12 Beatrice Humphreys 

I come to count 12 and Beatrice Humphries. She was aged 84. In the early morning of 8 July, 
she was taken to Stepping Hill, having coughed up blood. The provisional diagnosis was cancer 
of the throat with a possible kidney infection. 

She was later found to be ‘sweaty and clammy’ with a very low blood glucose reading. She was 
again treated with glucose and recovered.  

Beatrice Humphries was herself interviewed on video, she had only an imperfect memory of 
what happened and little or no understanding of why it had happened.  

Count 13 Mary Cartwright  

Count 13: Mary Cartwright. She was aged 88. On 9 July 2011, Mrs Cartwright was brought to 
Stepping Hill with a high temperature; with an infection of the urinary tract.  

Over the course of her stay at Stepping Hill, she gave many very low blood glucose readings; a 
later  laboratory  analysis  demonstrated  beyond  doubt  that  she  also  had  been  poisoned  by 
insulin. 

She rallied after being given glucose but her family thought that she was never the same again. 
They also had to go through the anguish of a post mortem examination. 

Count 14 ‘Eileen’ Armstrong  

Count 14, Eileen Armstrong. She was aged 83 when admitted to Stepping Hill on 9 June, with 
shortness of breath. 

 

9
--------
Mrs Armstrong herself was interviewed about these matters but she was unable to remember 
anything beyond being in the hospital. 

She also suffered from epilepsy and unfortunately did have some epileptic seizures whilst at 
the hospital but later an experienced nurse realised that the patient was seriously unwell from 
some other cause; she had a very low blood glucose reading.  

Her  family  who  had  been  attentive  to  her  condition  described  how  she  was  breathing 
erratically; they thought that she was dying. 

She responded to treatment by glucose but had other hypoglycaemic incidents when treated 
with other saline bags from which she also later recovered but again, her family felt that she 
was  never  the  same  again,  losing  her  confidence  in  the  hospital,  in  the  medical  profession 
constantly  terrified  that  something  similar  may  happen  again.   Her   daughter  feels  that  her 
mother’s last few years have been blighted by this crime.  

Count 15 Philip Jones 

I  come  then  to  the  events  of  the  night  of  the  10/11  July,  when  4  patients  had  unexpected 
hypoglycaemia on the same ward. The first is Philip Jones, the victim named in count 15. He 
was aged 67.  On the morning of 10 July he was taken to Stepping Hill, with cellulitis. 

Mr Jones remembers that his cannula had to be flushed because it had blood in it. He said that 
a  few  minutes  later,  he  became  hot;  the  sweat  was  dripping  off  him;  he  felt  as  if  he  was 
hallucinating, unable to answer simple questions; he was struggling to breathe; he thought he 
was  going  to  die.  He  had  no  idea  what  had  happened  to  him.  He  was  given  glucose  and 
thereafter he recovered.  

He considers himself lucky to have survived but is sad that others did not. 

Count 19 Arnold Lancaster 

Arnold Lancaster was aged 71. He had advanced untreatable and terminal oesophageal cancer.   

On 10 July 2011, he was taken to Stepping Hill, over and above the advancing cancer; he had 
widespread infection to the urinary tract and chest.  He was seriously ill; he received most of 
his many medications by way of saline bags. 

Suddenly just after 3 o’clock on the morning of 11 July, his condition deteriorated; he became 
pale, not as alert, he was thrashing his arms around and sweating; she could not account for 
that; the experienced nurse who was treating him checked his blood sugar levels which were 
the  lowest  she  had  ever  seen  in  any  patient.  He  had  very  severe  hypoglycaemia,  which  was 
brought about by insulin poisoning.  

He died later that afternoon but having regard to his advanced cancer, the jury were not sure 
that  it  was  proved  that  the  insulin  caused  or  contributed  to  his  death.  The  defendant  was 
therefore  acquitted  of  his  murder  as  alleged  in  count  18  and  of  the  alternative  charge  of 
manslaughter but convicted of the charge of attempting to cause him grievous bodily harm.  

It is indescribably wicked to cause a dying man to be poisoned with insulin. 

Count 21 William Dickson  

I turn then to count 21 and the poisoning of Mr William Dickson, who aged 82. In the morning 
of 10 July, he complained of shortness of breath arising from an infective exacerbation of his 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder; he was taken to Stepping Hill. 

 

10
--------
Despite  treatment  with  anti‐biotics  and  nebulisers,  his  condition  deteriorated  and  in  the 
middle of the night, his wife was called to the hospital.  

She described how, even as she was speaking to her husband: ‘all of a sudden, [he] was gone; 
he went blank, straight in front of my eyes.  The talking stopped and he fell backwards onto the 
bed’ she ran to the nurses’ desk shouting their help. It was, of course, fortunate that she was 
there, otherwise his condition may have passed unnoticed and more serious injuries may have 
resulted. 

The  nurse  on  duty  found  him  completely  unresponsive,  ‘just  staring  into  space’.    His  blood 
sugars  were  dangerously  low.  He  was  immediately  given  glucose,  and  recovered.  A  later 
laboratory analysis confirmed that he had been poisoned by insulin.  

Count 22 the discovery of the contaminated ampoules  

The following evening, 11 July, an alert nurse on duty in A3 noticed that a saline ampoule that 
she had picked up from the treatment trolley in the ward, which she was about to administer 
to  a  patient,  appeared  to  be  ‘foamy’,  like  washing  up  liquid;  it  should  have  been  clear; 
furthermore, it had the characteristic disinfectant smell of one type of synthetic insulin, which 
was administered to patients with diabetes. She immediately informed more senior staff of her 
discovery; following which, a thorough search was made of the ward and the treatment room 
on  ward  a  where  the  ampoules  were  stored.  45  ampoules  were  found  which  had  been 
punctured with a hypodermic syringe, 19 of which had been contaminated with insulin. In due 
course, all these would have been used for the treatment of patients.  

Count 22 is charged as attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to the 
contamination of one such ampoule, on the basis that in due course the ampoule would have 
been  administered  to  a  patient  without  the  contamination  being  detected  by  the  treating 
nurse.  Although  there  was  no  actual  harm  to  any  patient,  the  potential  for  causing  serious 
harm is obvious. 

Quite  why  so  many  ampoules  had  been  punctured  but  not  injected  with  insulin  is  another 
unexplained mystery in the case. 

Count 23 Daphne Harlow 

I  move  on  to  count  23:  Daphne  Harlow  was  aged  86.  On  the  morning  of  July  12,  she  fell  at 
home and hurt her knee. The ambulance was called and she was taken to Stepping Hill.  

She developed some infection but she seemed to be making progress until a nurse found her 
clammy and unresponsive, with a vacant expression; she then started to jerk or shake, as if she 
was having a fit; she opened her eyes but her eyes were fixed and not dilating; a blood test 
gave a very low glucose reading, which was dangerously low.  

She was given glucose and she improved but again her family thought that she was never the 
same again, being confused, anxious and suspicious.  

Count 24 Zubia Aslam  

Count 24: Zubia Aslam. She was only 24. On the evening of 13 July, she became ill with gastro‐
enteritis.  

She  was  prescribed  a  litre  of  normal  saline  solution  intravenously,  to  be  dispensed  over  an 
eight hour  period. In the light of the general alert about the contaminated saline ampoules, 
two staff nurses carefully examined the saline bag to see whether there were any leaks; they 
found  none;  this, 
incidentally,  thereby  shows  that  even  a  careful  examination  the 

 

11
--------
contamination  could  not  be  detected;  therefore  they  administered  the  saline  bag  to  the 
patient.  

Zubia Aslam herself described what happened: she woke up and felt really unwell, sweating 
buckets, feeling dazed, lifeless and unable to talk; she even thought that she was hallucinating; 
her vision became blurred; she was unable to get up and called her help; she felt so unwell that 
she thought that she was going to die. The nurse said that the patient looked very weak and 
about to collapse.  She was slumped to one side and looked as if she was about to fall into a 
deep  sleep.  A  blood  test  showed  very  low  glucose  levels.   She  responded  to  treatment  with 
glucose. 

The  doctor  arranged  for  the  saline  bag  to  be  preserved;  laboratory  examination  established 
that  the  bag  had  indeed  been  contaminated  with  insulin,  which  had  been  injected  by 
hypodermic needle through the rubber septum in the resealable port.  

Prof Ferner, one of the expert witnesses said that the huge amount of insulin found in the bag 
must have resulted from the injection of more than two full insulin syringes.  The bag was set 
to run for 8 hours, had it done so, then her hypoglycaemia would have continued, this would 
have caused irreversible brain damage and very likely death. 

Zubia Aslam herself became withdrawn and depressed by what had happened to her, which 
has had other effects upon her life, her job, her marriage and even her state of mind. 

Counts 25 – 28 the contaminated products  

Following  the  unexpected  and  unexplained  hypoglycaemic  episode  suffered  by  Zubia  Aslam, 
the treatment room in Ward A3, was sealed and searched; a number of health care products 
were found to have been contaminated by insulin. 

Count 25 is laid following the discovery of a single glucose bag contaminated with insulin, out 
of 77 recovered from the Treatment Room. 

Count 26 is laid following the discovery of a single bag of saline contaminated with insulin. 

Count  27  is  laid  following  the  discovery  of  a  bottle  metronidazole,  which  was  also 
contaminated  with  insulin;  metronidazole  is  an  anti‐biotic,  which  is  administered  intra‐
venously; so this was another vehicle by which the defendant intended to administer insulin 
intra‐venously.   

Count 28 is laid following the discovery of a saline bag contaminated not this time with insulin 
but with lidocaine, which is a local anaesthetic; clinically it is administered externally but it is 
potentially  dangerous  if  administered  intra‐venously,  for  it  would  tend  to  anaesthetise  the 
heart. This is charged as attempting to commit an offence of administering poison, contrary to 
section 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, which carries a maximum sentence of 
5 years. 

The pulse chart and Venn diagram  

This is perhaps a convenient point at which to refer to the staff shift patterns. 

There is a striking correlation between the defendant’s working pattern and the incidence of 
the hypoglycaemic attacks suffered by the patients; this is well shown in diagrammatic form by 
the so‐called pulse chart; such a correlation cannot be explained by co‐incidence. 

The  defendant’s  duty  on  A3  on  the  night  of  the  26/27  June,  followed  by  the  hypoglycaemic 
attacks of Josephine Walsh on 27th and Linda McDonagh in the early hours of 29th. 

 

12
--------
His duty on A1 on the night of the 27/28 June, coinciding with the hypoglycaemic attack of Jack 
Beeley in the early hours and morning of 27th and followed by the hypoglycaemic attacks of 
Joseph Macdonald and Anthony Smith on the 29th.  
He  then  moved  from  A1,  where  the  hypoglycaemic  attacks  ceased  and  moved  back  to  A3; 
there were no hypoglycaemic attacks for some days; he was on duty on 2/3; 3/4; 4/5; 6/7 July; 
he was off for a few days and back on A3 for 8/9 and 9/10 coinciding with the hypoglycaemic 
attacks of Joyce Atherton later on 3rd and another one the following day, the 4th; followed by 
the hypoglycaemic attacks of Beryl Hope on 6th; Doreen Brace on 6th and again on the 7th; Tracy 
Arden  on  7th;  Kathleen  Murray  and  Lilian  Baker  and  Beatrice  Humphries  on  the  8th;  Mary 
Cartwright on the 10th and again on the 11th and Lilian Armstrong on 10th and again on the 11th.  
All the while the incidence of hypoglycaemic attacks had ceased on A1; he returned there on 
duty in A1 on the night of the 10/11, which was accompanied by the attacks on Philip Jones, 
Derek Weaver, Arnold Lancaster, Grant Misell and later that morning by the attack of William 
Dickson.  

He  returned  to  A3  on  12.13,  followed  by  the  hypoglycaemic  attack  of  Daphne  Harlow  and 
Zubia  Aslam  on  15th,  following  which  the  contaminated  saline  bag  was  found  and  further 
security systems were put in place.  

A similar point is shown, in slightly differently form in the Venn diagram. 

Improved security 

Following the discovery of the contaminated healthcare products and the realisation that there 
was  a  poisoner  at  work  at  Stepping  Hill,  there  were  improvements  to  the  security 
arrangements in the Treatment Rooms; in particular insulin was to be kept in locked fridges 
and there was to be a proper system of stocktaking and recording of insulin withdrawal and 
administration.  Therefore  it  became  impossible  for  the  defendant  to  continue  to  withdraw 
insulin undetected, so his first campaign of poisoning was brought to a halt. 

For some time, he managed to control himself; I move forward to the night of the 2/3 January 
2012, when again the defendant was on duty.  The events of this night give rise to the charges 
as set out in counts 29 – 36 of the indictment.  

Counts 29 – 36 the altered prescriptions  

I come to Maria Pawlyszyn; she was aged 86; she was taken ill after a flight back from Dubai 
with breathlessness and swelling of the legs. She was taken to Stepping Hill; she was diagnosed 
with a mild heart attack. She was transferred to a Bay in Ward A3, where the defendant was 
the nurse in charge.  

She was accompanied by her daughter Mrs Anna Dodd, who understood that the doctor in the 
emergency ward had advised that her  mother should be attached to a heart monitor;  when 
she reached the Ward, she asked the defendant to arrange that. The defendant pointed out 
that there was no mention of the heart monitor in the medical notes and if it wasn’t in the 
notes, it wasn’t going to happen, or words to that effect. Mrs Dodd considered his manner to 
be rude, and un‐caring; she said that he did not like being challenged. Eventually, with what 
she took to be a bad grace, he bought the monitor, threw it down on the table, as if in anger 
but said that there was no cable or lead for it. So her mother was not attached to the monitor; 
she  told  him  that  if  anything  happened  to  her  mother  during  the  night,  he  would  have  to 
answer to her. According to her, he then walked off ‘in a strop’. She was left crying in sheer 
frustration.  

 

13
--------
Later that night, a series of forged entries were made to Mrs Pawlyszyn’s prescription record. 
The jury have found that the defendant made those alterations; I have no doubt that he did so 
in order to get his own back on the patient’s daughter; to do so by attempting to poison her 
elderly  mother  is  yet  another  despicable  and  odious  act.  This  is  charged  in  Count  30  of  the 
indictment as attempting to administer poison, which is an offence contrary to section 24 of 
the Offences against the Person Ac 1861. 

One entry, namely for the administration of Bisoprolol, was added to her prescription chart; 
this was a forgery, the defendant attempted to imitate the doctor’s writing on the line above. 
This drug reduces the heart rate and the ability of the heart to act as a pump, which could in 
turn have produced respiratory problems if the drug had been given to her.  

In view of the jury’s verdict, I have no doubt that the print from the side of his left palm was 
made as he steadied the paper whilst he forged this entry.  

Nor was this the only alteration: the prescription of 8 mgs of Candesartan was altered to 18 
mgs; the prescription for Amlodipine was altered from 5 mgs to 15 mgs; both were to lower 
blood pressure; if they had been administered in the altered dosages, there would have been a 
risk of precipitating acute heart failure. 

The  prescription  of  90  mgs  of  Tickegrelor  was  doubled  to  180  mgs;  this  was  prescribed  to 
inhibit platelet aggregation; had it been administered in the altered dosage, there would have 
been the risk of internal bleeding.  

The prescription for Furosemide has been altered so that the 13.00 dosage of 20 mgs had been 
altered to 40 ms and also to add another dosage of 40 mg at 22.00. Furosemide is a strong 
diuretic;  the  altered  prescription  would  increase  the  production  of  urine;  it  would  cause  at 
least inconvenience and discomfort but could also produce dehydration, with other attendant 
risks; the administration of such a drug at night would cause the obvious risk of distress and 
inconvenience throughout the night.  

Possibly  in  order  to  cover  what  he  had  done  to  Maria  Pawlyszyn,  but  possibly  also  to  cause 
extra  work  for  the  day  staff,  he  also  altered  the  prescription  charts  for  a  number  of  other 
patients, each of whom was elderly and vulnerable that is to say for Jean Moss (aged 82) as 
alleged in count 29; Audrey Fallows (aged 79) as alleged in count 32; Edith Hardman (aged 92) 
as alleged in count 33; Marion Stait (aged 88) as alleged in count 34 and Freda Bingham (aged 
80) as alleged in count 35. I need not I think detail here the precise alterations made but the 
amount of medication prescribed to each was altered so as to increase the dose; each patient 
would have been put at risk if the dosages had been administered as altered.  

The alterations made to prescription chart of one patient were actually administered to her. 
This is the subject of count 36. Theresa Bailey was aged 82; she had been admitted to Stepping 
Hill on 30 December, with angina. Her prescription of Ivabradine was altered from 5 mgs twice 
a day to 15 mgs twice a day and the prescription of Nicorandil was altered from 10 mgs twice a 
day  to  40  mgs  twice  a  day.  That  these  alterations  were  unauthorised  was  unfortunately  not 
noticed the next morning and the altered dosages were given.  

Theresa  Bailey  herself  gave  a  statement;  she  said  that  she  thought  that  she  had  been  given 
more pills than usual, indeed she questioned it, but the nurse re‐assured her and so she took 
them and went into what she called a long sleep and she awoke feeling very tired with a head 
ache. The expert evidence was to the effect that the administration of these increased doses 
would be to slow the heart rate and to cause the blood pressure to fall, which could have very 
serious effects, including precipitating strokes, heart attacks and kidney damage. Fortunately 

 

14
--------
the alterations were then discovered before she continued with the increased dosage; so – as 
it  turned  out  –  she  suffered  only  minor  effects.  But  her  confidence  was  badly  affected;  her 
daughter wrote that her mother was left to live in fear.  

I need not mention count 31, charged as attempting to administer poison in the form of some 
unknown tablets to another patient, because the jury acquitted the defendant of that charge. 

Following the discovery of these further incidents of poisoning at the hospital, the police were 
again informed.  

Arrest and the ‘letter’ 

On 5 January, two days later, the defendant was arrested at his home at 28 Churchill Street, 
Stockport. During the course of a search of his house, a document was found; the defendant 
called it a letter, plainly he intended that it should be read by others, although it is not at all 
clear  to  whom  it  was  addressed.  Nor  it  is  entirely  clear  when  it  was  written,  some  internal 
references suggest that parts of it were written in 2010 but he told the police in interview that 
parts were written much later, possibly even shortly before the insulin poisoning. I cannot here 
quote the whole letter but some extracts may give a flavour of what he wrote: ‘… I go straight 
to hell, no question … So I’m writing this letter in case something happen to me … and work 
out how an angel turn to an evil person. The bitter nurse confession. Got lots to tell but I just 
take it to my grave. My family will make history here in England’.   

Again: ‘at home, I can control not to take my painkiller but in hospital because of staff, I can’t 
help it to take more than the limit or else I won’t cope or carry on with my job. I’m just telling 
them I’m fine and all right, just to shut their mouth.  Still inside of me I can feel the anger that 
any time it will explode; just still hanging on can still control it but if pushed, they’re going to 
be sorry’.  

Hw wrote this as if he knew what he had done or – more likely – what he was about to do but 
there  is  nothing  here  to  explain  why  he  acted  as  he  did;  for  what  he  did  is,  of  course,  
inexplicable and irrational.  

The relevant sentencing considerations  

I turn then to the relevant sentencing considerations.  

Following  a  conviction  for  murder,  there  is  a  mandatory  sentence  of  imprisonment  for  life, 
which I pass on each of the counts 9 and 16.  

I  must  also  fix  the  minimum  term  which  he  must  serve  before  he  is  considered  for  release, 
according to Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  

I identify the following aggravating factors. 

These murders and indeed all the incidents of insulin poisoning were committed in a sustained 
course of conduct, which necessarily involve some planning and pre‐meditation, no doubt all 
poisonings require planning and premeditation but I doubt whether he had formed a settled 
intention to kill. 

The  minimum  term  imposed  for  the  two  murders  must  reflect  also  the  19  other  victims  of 
insulin poisoning, including Grant Misell who sustained permanent and severe brain damage, 
and indeed the contamination of the other health care products which were withdrawn before 
they were administered, thereby poisoning other patients.  

 

15
--------
Each  of  these  patients  was  vulnerable,  either  because  of  age  and  illness,  or  often  both; 
furthermore, each suffered significantly, and some continue to do so. 

Opinions  may  differ  as  to  whether  it  is  more  abhorrent  for  the  defendant  personally  to 
administer  the  poison  directly  to  patients  in  his  care  or  to  cause  victims  to  be  selected  at 
random but the combination of both seems to me to be unusually wicked.  

His course of offending caused others members of staff to fall under suspicion, indeed one was 
actually arrested and indeed charged. 

I must also reflect the second series of offences committed in January 2012. 

Furthermore, these offences have damaged the reputation of the hospital and may also have 
adversely affected public confidence in the health care system. 

As against that, it is said that he did not intend to cause death; that may be so and that – and 
that alone – saves him from a whole life sentence but it is otherwise a point of limited force, 
since administering insulin to elderly or sick patients carried a gross and obvious danger to life, 
as he must have known, more particularly so after he had killed Tracy Arden.  

I realise that he will be an old man before he is to be considered for release; however, when 
Parliament enacted that age could be a mitigating factor, I doubt that they had in mind a man 
who is only 49. He has committed a dreadful crime, he must now pay the price. 

I appreciate that he has no previous convictions but that also carries little or no weight when 
set against the enormity of these crimes. 

In  my  judgment  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  aggravating  factors  entirely  overwhelms  such  
mitigating factors as there may be.  

This is a murder of two or more victims, the seriousness of which is particularly high.  

In all the circumstances, I consider that the starting point is 30 years but for all the reasons that 
I  have  given,  there  must  be  a  considerable  uplift  from  the  starting  point;  I  fix  the  minimum 
term at 35 years before he is considered for release. 

The other offences as charged in counts 1 – 8, 10 – 15, and 19 – 27 inclusive are so serious that 
only a discretionary life sentence is appropriate; here I am required by law to fix a minimum 
term, which by law is only one half of the appropriate determinative sentence. 

The sentences   

The sentences will be as follows: on count 9 for the murder of Tracy Arden and on count 16 for 
the  murder  of  Derek  Weaver:  life  imprisonment,  with  a  minimum  term  of  35  years;  he  will 
have credit for the time served. 

On count 20, for causing grievous bodily harm to Grant Misell with intent: there are so many 
aggravating factors that I  consider I am justified – indeed I am required ‐ to sentence outside 
the  Guidelines:  the  sentence  will  be  life  imprisonment,  with  a  minimum  term  of  12½  years, 
predicated upon a determinate sentence of 25 years.  

Counts 1 – 8, 10 – 15, 19, 21, 23 and 24 inclusive, where patients were poisoned,  there will be 
a life sentence with a minimum term of 10 years, predicated upon a determinate sentence of 
20 years.  

On counts 22 and 25 – 27 inclusive, where saline bags and ampoules were contaminated with 
insulin  but  which  were  not  administered  only  because  the  contamination  was  discovered; 

 

16
--------
again  the  sentence  will  be  life  imprisonment  but  because  there  was  no  actual  victim,  the 
minimum term will be reduced to 8 years, predicated on a determinate term of 16 years. 

On counts 28 – 30 and 32 – 35 inclusive for attempting to administer poison and on count 36 
for administering poison, I pass the maximum sentence of 5 years.  

I am anxious that this sentence is not misunderstood or mis‐reported. The sentence is not just 
35 years the sentence is a sentence of imprisonment for life. The defendant will serve at least 
35 years; there is no early release from such a sentence; even then he will be released only if 
the Parole Board considers that he no longer presents a continuing risk to the public; and even 
if released he will be subject to licence for the rest of his life.  

I will cause a transcript of this judgment to be put with the case papers so that in due course 
the Life Sentence unit in the Prison Department and Parole Board may understand my findings.  

I am required by law to apply the statutory surcharge, as I do.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Globe 

 

22nd May 2015 

 
 
Yesterday, the jury convicted you, on count one, of the murder of Sergeant First Class Randy 
Johnson on 27 September 2007 and, on count two, of conspiracy to murder between 1 
January 2007 and 22 November 2007. 
 
The offences were committed in Iraq at a time when American troops were present as part of 
the 2007 “Surge” Operation and, in the relevant area that concerns this case, were doing no 
more than route security and reconnaissance.  
 
The offences relate to your participation in constructing Intrusive Explosive Devices (IEDs) that 
were thereafter buried in the ground within the sector being patrolled by the Americans in a 
confined area of North West Baghdad.   
 
One of the IEDs exploded on 27 September 2007 under an American armoured patrol vehicle 
killing Sergeant First Class Johnson. It was a vehicle that had been engaging in no hostile action 
against anyone. Three more unexploded IEDs were recovered from within the sector on 19 
March, 20 March and 14 October. 
 
Sergeant First Class Randy Johnson was a married man with two young children. He was a 
Platoon Sergeant in K Company in the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment. His commanding officer, 
Major Eric Adams, described him as “the father of the Platoon” who was responsible for 
running the Platoon on a day‐by‐day basis. He was “the critical leader” who worked closely 
with the Platoon Lieutenant in synchronising the operations of the Platoon. The Platoon was 
told about its mission in Iraq in the Spring of 2007 at a time when they were operational in 
Germany. Sergeant First Class Johnson was instrumental in training the members of the 
Platoon so as to create a cohesive team when the Platoon was eventually deployed to Iraq. 
Major Adams says Sergeant First Class Johnson was “pivotal” in that transitional period. He led 

 

1
--------
his Platoon in such a way that the other soldiers in the Platoon showed him more loyalty and 
affection than Major Adams has ever seen in any other Platoon. “He deeply cared” about all 
welfare matters and “showed great compassion” to all members of the team. As a direct result 
of his leadership, the Platoon outperformed all other platoons. In Iraq, before every mission, 
he was known personally to spend many hours preparing so his troops stood the best chance 
of retuning uninjured. It is therefore the saddest irony that, when the eight wheel armoured 
Stryker containing five American soldiers ran over and exploded an IED, it was Sergeant First 
Class Johnson who was killed. He was buried at Arlington cemetery. His family can be proud 
that he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for distinguished Service. However, his 
loss is one of the sad tragedies of what was ongoing in Iraq in 2007. By the jury’s verdict, it is a 
loss for which you are directly responsible. 
 
It is necessary to put the jury’s verdict into perspective for the purposes of passing sentence 
upon you.  
 
There has been no special verdict, nor should there have been any special verdict. The facts 
upon which you therefore need to be sentenced need to be determined by me in accordance 
with the directions the jury received. 
 
During the trial, evidence was received from two Americans who, at the relevant time, were 
the two leaders of the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Team – “EODs”; “the bomb disposal 
squad”. Each was stationed at Camp Liberty. Each had a tour of duty that lasted just over a 
year. Each tour fully covered the dates stated in the indictment.  

 

One of the “EODs” gave evidence that, during his tour of duty, he dealt with about 120 IEDs. 
He could only remember between 3 or 4 that were constructed in the way the IEDs were 
constructed in this case. 

 

The other “EOD” gave evidence that, during his tour of duty, he dealt with 325 IEDs. He only 
encountered 6 to 12 that were constructed like the ones constructed in this case. All of the 
other IEDs were completely different types of devices. They were flimsy devices with pressure 
plates made out of hacksaw blades.  

 

The ones recovered in this case were far from flimsy. They were professionally made. They 
had sturdy pressure plates with corrosion filed off one end and notches inserted to 
accommodate the wiring. The pressure plates had wooden blocks placed between them and 
rubber hosing placed around them. They were then taped together with various types of 
adhesive tape. The wiring led to a battery and timer providing detonation to explosives if the 
pressure plates were pressed together by a heavy vehicle travelling over them. The type of 
main explosives used varied, IED to IED. The explosives used in the IED that killed Sergeant 
First Class Johnson was the equivalent of an artillery mortar round. It tore away the 
underneath of the armed vehicle with deadly effect. It also caused a major leg injury to Staff 
Sergeant Mark Aggers and minor injuries to others in the vehicle. The explosive used in the 
other IEDs ranged from TNT, PETN and a home made explosive called UREA NITRATE. A 
controlled explosion of one of the bombs containing UREA NITRATE caused echoes and 
reverberations and there was a blast cloud of 150 to 200 feet. The EOD described it as an 
“enormous explosion”. 
 

 

2
--------
These are the bombs you were making. Your fingerprints were found on the adhesive tape of 
two of the IEDs. By the jury’s verdict on count one, they were sure you were also participating 
in making more.  
 
Sajjad Adnan was also involved in constructing the IEDs. His fingerprints were found on all four 
IEDs that were recovered. 
 
Who else, if anyone, was involved in the construction is unknown because you have not 
revealed their identity.  
 
Your evidence was that there were 4 or 5 people in total who were involved. However, the 
verdicts of the jury discredit your evidence generally. I do not accept your account that you 
merely went to an unknown house one afternoon and helped to put a bit of sticky tape onto a 
couple of objects. The jury haven’t accepted that and neither do I.   

 

The fingerprint evidence establishes that there were a number of unidentified fingerprints 
found on the IEDs. How many people were involved is unknown. 

 

However, what is beyond doubt is that you were involved in a group activity, which the jury 
have found to have been unlawful. 
 
No one, including the prosecution, has disputed the difficult sectarian issues that were 
plaguing Iraq in 2007 and which were a dominant reason for the American “Surge”. In the 
course of my summing‐up, I commenced my review of the evidence by reading out to the jury 
some admitted facts. By summarising them in a few sentences now, I do not intend to 
minimise their importance. 

 

From at least 2005, the elections in Iraq following the downfall of Sadam Hussain had led to 
the country being run by Shia Muslims, which in turn resulted in serious sectarian conflict 
between Shias and Sunnis. So bad was the conflict that local communities were known to form 
watch groups within their areas and to patrol defence lines in key locations.  
 
Your defence was that the IEDs were being made solely to protect and defend Sunni villages 
from imminent attack by Shi’ite militia and that such action was both necessary and 
reasonable. 
 
The jury have rejected that defence. 
 
One possibility is that they rejected the proposition that what you were doing was reasonable 
in that it was not proportionate action to defend the villages. In other words, there is a 
distinction, even in the midst of sectarian violence, between shooting at advancing militia 
from a defensive position in or around the villages and blowing up vehicles and their 
occupants by use of what can only be described as land mines. If that was what was rejected, 
it still means that you were unlawfully intending to cause explosions with the intention of 
killing Shias. However, that finding was not the prosecution’s prime case.   
 
The prosecution presented the case throughout upon the proposition that, together with 
others, you were either wholly or partly targeting the American troops or, if not targeting 

 

3
--------
them, you were prepared to place the IEDs in places where it did not matter who was going to 
be blown up, Shias or Americans, because, effectively, in your minds, they were as bad as each 
other. 
 
I am satisfied so as to be sure that your actions were not solely focussed on the Shi’ite militia. 
Your focus was either wholly or partly the Americans. I reach that conclusion from the 
following facts. 
 
First, there were not hundreds of bombs scattered all around areas that the Shi’ite militia 
travelled. There were only a few bombs strategically placed. Their placement could not 
possibly have kept out the Shi’ite militia from all the villages on the West of the canal and 
were not even placed on the approach routes to the crossing areas of the canal. By way of 
contrast, those that were recovered were within the midst of the sector being patrolled by the 
Americans. It was a sector that was being patrolled day and night, week after week by 
numerous vehicles and Platoons. The Americans had a major presence at Camp Liberty in the 
South of the sector and at Taji in the North. Their presence was highly visible. It was meant to 
be. There is evidence that the patrols were engaging with locals in order to try and obtain 
information about insurgents. That engagement was being done openly in an attempt to gain 
trust. It is inconceivable that such action went unnoticed and without comment within the 
villages. I reject your evidence that you rarely saw such patrols and knew little or nothing 
about their existence.  

 

Second, there is evidence from which one can draw the conclusion that the deployment of the 
double pressure plates was such that they were designed to be activated by heavy wide 
tracked vehicles such as those used by the American army rather than lighter narrower 
vehicles.    
 
Third, the inescapable fact is that, when you returned to this country in November 2007 from 
Damascus, you brought with you a collection of CDs within which there was not only an 
explosives manual, which included a formula to make TNT, but also material of a violently anti‐
American nature. It may be that since your return you have sought to hide from your past and 
have not looked at that material on any computer examined by the police. That doesn’t mean 
you were not looking at it on computers when not in this country. In that it may be said that 
there is no evidence to that effect, I have had the opportunity of observing you in court and 
listening to you while you gave evidence. When pressed in cross‐examination by Mr Hill, you 
let down your guard. In your attempt to protest your innocence, it was illuminating to watch 
and listen to what the prosecution described as your “fury” at the Americans’ intervention 
into Iraq. I am satisfied that at the material time, you had the mind‐set that made the 
Americans every bit as much the enemy as the Shi’ite militia. Both were in your contemplation 
at all times. 
 
Fourth, good evidence of the fact that it was the Americans who were targeted comes from 
the IED that was recovered on 20th March 2007. When the Americans found it and were about 
to report their findings they came under attack from sniper fire. Three American soldiers were 
hit. Two received serious injuries. The Americans were in the area ostensibly supporting the 
Shias. Shias had little reason to fire on the Americans. The much more likely explanation was 
that it was a concerted Sunni attack. That in itself is indicative of the Sunni attitude generally 

 

4
--------
towards the Americans at the time, despite their peace‐keeping role at the time. It mirrored 
what I find to be your own personal views. 
 
Fifth, your explanation for saying nothing to anybody about having gone to Iraq, still less 
saying anything to anyone about what you did in Iraq defies logic and belief. If your evidence 
was true, you had been providing defensive humanitarian aid to people who could not defend 
themselves. All that you did was necessary, reasonable and proportionate. Why would you 
hide those facts from everyone, including those close to you such as your wife, your extended 
family and the two people who are so close to you, who you called to give evidence on your 
behalf ‐ your cousin and good friend? This is not the same as making no comment to the police 
upon legal advice because you have a right to remain silent. These were your family and 
friends. Why hide your humanitarian actions from them? I am driven to conclude that you said 
nothing to any of them, not because you simply wanted to forget, but because the truth of 
what you did would have revealed the offences in respect of which you have now been 
convicted.       
 
Sentence  
 
And so, it is against that factual background that I now have to pass sentence. 
 
There is only one sentence that can be passed for an offence of murder and that is a sentence 
of life imprisonment.  
 
However, the provisions of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 require me to set out 
in court any minimum term of that life sentence that you must serve as the punitive and 
deterrent term of your sentence before consideration can be given to your release within the 
ambit of the statutory early release provisions. It is important to understand that the 
expression minimum term in this context is not to be confused with the pronouncement of a 
determinate sentence of imprisonment in respect of which a defendant will only serve half of 
that sentence before being released on licence. 

 

If a minimum term is imposed, it means the term that must be served before your case may 
be referred to the Parole Board for a consideration of your release upon licence. It means the 
actual term that you must stay in prison before that process may take place. Whether or not 
you will be released after the minimum term has been served will be a matter entirely for the 
Parole Board to consider at that time. They will not do so unless satisfied that you are not a 
risk to the public and are ready for release into society. If you are released at that time, or any 
later time, you will be released on licence with specific conditions attached to it. You may be 
recalled to continue serving your life sentence if you breach any licence conditions that are set 
for you. 
 
Pursuant to these provisions, I first of all have to consider what is the term of the life sentence 
that you must serve. 
 
Paragraph 4(1) states that, if the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the 
combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is exceptionally high, 
the appropriate starting point is a whole life order. Relevant cases that would normally fall 

 

5
--------
within that sub‐paragraph are murders done for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, 
racial or ideological cause. 
 
Paragraph 5(1) states that, if the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1), but the court 
considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or 
more offences associated with it) is particularly high, the appropriate starting point in 
determining the minimum term is 30 years. Relevant cases that would normally fall within that 
sub‐paragraph are murders involving the use of explosives and murders that are racially or 
religiously aggravated. 
 
I bear in mind the observations of the Lord Chief Justice in the case of Reynolds & Rossiter 
[2015] 1 Cr.App.R.(S.)24; [2014] EWCA Crim 2205. He emphasised four points in relation to the 
imposition of whole life orders: 

1.  The judge must have regard to the guidance provided in schedule 21, but each case will 

depend critically on its own particular facts. 

2.  Where a whole life order is called for, often, perhaps usually, the case will not be on 
the borderline. The facts will leave the judge in no doubt that the defendant must be 
kept in prison for the rest of his life. 

3.  One should always bear in mind a guilty plea if one is tendered. 
4.  A whole life order is reserved for the few exceptionally serious offences where, after 

reflecting on all of the features of aggravation and mitigation, the judge is satisfied that 
the element of just punishment requires the imposition of a whole life order. 

 
I have reviewed various sentencing cases in relation to terrorism sentences, including Barot 
[2008] 1 Cr.App.R.(S.) 31; Khan & Ots [2013] EWCA Crim 468, most notably at paragraphs 74‐
76; and Dart & Ots [2014] EWCA Crim 2158.  
 
I have reached the following conclusions. 
 
First, in deciding whether the case is exceptionally or particularly high, I must have regard not 
only to the murder of Sergeant First Class Johnson on count one but to the wider conspiracy to 
murder on count two. The appropriate sentence on count one must therefore be adjusted to 
reflect this additional feature of the case. The approach is consistent with the terminology 
within the sub‐paragraphs. 
 
Second, the introduction of the word racial in paragraph 4(1) was introduced by the Counter 
Terrorism Act 2008 for murders committed on or after 16 February 2009. The definition of a 
racial group for the purposes of the schedule means a group of persons by reference amongst 
other things to nationality. That would apply to the targeting of Americans. However, your 
offending was in 2007. That limitation does not apply under paragraph 5(1) where the full 
expression of racially or religiously aggravated was in force in 2007. 
 
Third, notwithstanding the absence of the word racial in paragraph 4(1), I am satisfied, for the 
reasons already given, that the rationale for making the bombs was at least in part for the 
purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. 
 
Fourth, I emphasis the expression “at least in part” because I am prepared to accept that, 
amidst the turmoil of Iraq in 2007, the sectarian problem was so great that there is some 

 

6
--------
limited mitigation born out of provocative and offensive actions of the Shi’ite militia that did 
justify some defensive action on the part of the Sunni population. Factors of provocation and 
self defence not amounting to defences are legitimate aspects of mitigation specifically 
referred to in paragraph 11 of schedule 21. I further emphasise that such mitigation only 
applies to your actions against the Shi’ite militia and not in relation to your actions against the 
Americans. 
 
Fifth, the mitigation I have just referred to must also be set alongside two specific aggravating 
factors identified in paragraph 10, namely, under paragraph 10(a), significant planning and 
premeditation and, under paragraph 10(f), in the case of the American forces and Sergeant 
First Class Johnson in particular, at least some of the intended victims and the victim in count 
one were performing National Service as part of the American “Surge” operation. 
 
Sixth, I take into account the fact that you did not travel to Iraq direct from London, but went 
from Syria where I am prepared to accept you found yourself after travelling there for the 
original legitimate purpose of studying. 
 
Seventh, I take into account your age, previous good character, the evidence of your two 
character witnesses and the fact that, for about eight years since your return to England, there 
is no evidence of you holding any extremist views or participating in any actions of an 
aggressive nature against anyone. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that, despite the lack of such 
evidence, there remains an underlying concern about your ideology. The closest possible 
attention will have to be given by the Parole Board in due course to the risks to public safety 
that you might pose in the future. That fact flows through into the element of risk justifying an 
indeterminate sentence for any discretionary life sentence. 
 
Putting all of that together, I am entirely satisfied that you must be detained for an extremely 
long time as part of the life sentence that must be imposed upon you. 
 
However, on the totality of the facts, in my judgment, yours is not one of the cases where the 
element of just punishment requires me to impose a whole life order. 
 
The minimum term I am about to pronounce will be reduced to take the time you have so far 
spent in custody into account, which I am informed is 204 days. 
 
The sentence on count one, murder, is life imprisonment with a minimum term that you must 
actually serve, prior to any consideration of whether you may be released on licence, of 38 
years.  
 
The sentence on count two, conspiracy to murder, where no one was actually killed, is a 
concurrent life sentence with a concurrent minimum term of 25 years.

2225077,Sentencing Remarks of of Mr Justice Haddon-Cave: R v Heath,"R v. Colin HEATH 

SENTENCING REMARKS 

By The Hon. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave 

At Birmingham Crown Court - 17th April 2015 

 
 
Colin Heath, 
 
1.  You  have  pleaded  guilty  to  the  manslaughter  of,  Kealeigh-Anne  Woolley,  who 

died on 6th February 2011 aged 11 years 7 months. 

 
2.  The circumstances are as unusual as they are tragic. Over 10 years earlier, on 4th 
December 2000, you pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to, Kealeigh 
when she was baby (aged 7 months), contrary to s. 20 of the Offences Against the 
Persons Act 1861 (“the Act”).  On 16th January 2000 you shook Keakeigh causing 
her  profound  brain  damage  and  life-threatening  and  life-limiting  injuries.  Sadly, 
despite a long and brave struggle by Kealeigh and her mother who cared for her, 
she eventually succumbed to her injuries, and died in 2011.  

 
Background facts 
 
3.  The history of the matter is as follows. In late 1999 and early 2000 you were in a 
relationship  with  Kealeigh’s  mother,  Amanda  Woolley.  On  16th  January  2000, 
Amanda Woolley went out with friends for the evening and left you in sole charge 
of  Kealeigh.  When  she  returned  home  late  at  about  11.30  that  night,  it  was 
obvious that her daughter was unwell.  She was lying flat on her back and looking 
pale and jaundiced. She had a bright red mark on her forehead.  You told Amanda 
Woolley  that  Kealeigh  had  been  vomiting  and  unwell  but  did  not  tell  her  what 
you had done.  She, unwittingly, left her daughter to sleep overnight but took her 
to hospital in the morning. On arrival, it was immediately clear to the medics that 
Kealeigh was in a very poor state indeed. A consultant paediatrician, Dr Davidson, 
found that Kealeigh had suffered very severe head injuries including a brain injury. 
A  second  consultant  paediatrician,  Dr  Magnay,  referred  to  the  injuries  as  “life 
threatening”  and  concluded  that  they  were  “non-accidental”.    A  consultant 
opthalmologies,  found  50%  haemorrhaging  in  the  eyes  suggestive  of  a  severe 
shaking injury.  There were bruises to  the child’s arms and torso consistent with 
gripping.  The  injuries  were  indicative  of  a  non-accidental  shaking  using  severe 
force.  There  were,  however,  no  fractures  or  other  injuries  suggestive  of  any 
prolonged  violence  or  abuse.  This  was  a  case  of  one  brief  incident  of  shaking 
causing  catastrophic  brain  injuries.  The  initial  prognosis  was  that  Kealeigh  was 
unlikely to survive for very long. 

 

 

1
--------
4.  You were arrested on 21st January 2000 and interviewed. You described the events 
of that evening and the difficulties you had in coping on your own that evening 
with  Kealeigh  who  was  being  sick.  You  initially  denied  any  ill  treatment  of 
Kealeigh. You were prosecuted under s.18 of the Act for causing grevious bodily 
harm  with  intent.    Shortly  before  the  trial  you  pleaded  guilty  to  the  less  serouis 
offence of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievious bodily harm on Kealeigh 
contrary to s.20 of the Act. You were sentenced on 4th December 2000 by HHJ 
Shand at Stafford Crown Court to 18 months imprisonment for the s.20 offence. 
You served your sentence and were released sometime in 2001. Due to the passage 
of time the Judge’s sentencing remarks are, unfortunately, no longer available.  

 

5.  As a result of exceptional medical skill, Kealeigh pulled through and survived but 
was profoundly disabled. As a result of the brain injuries you caused, Kealeigh has 
suffered  from  a  variety  of  serious  and  complex  medical  conditions,  including 
cerebral  palsy,  severe  scoliosis,  epilepsy,  spastic  quadriplegia,  blindness  and  global 
development delay.  She had reflux and has had to be fed via a PEG (which was 
prone to infection). She was confined to a wheelchair.  She has required constant 
care.    The  fact  that  Kaeleigh  has  survived  so  long,  is  due  in  large  part  to  the 
extraordinary dedication and hard work of her mother, Amanda Woolley, and the 
medical and support staff. Despite her profound disibilities, and the extraordinary 
pain and privations she enduring during her life, there were bright moments and 
she was able to smile and turn her head to her mother’s voice. 

 
6.  Sadly, as I have said, on Sunday 6th February 2011, following earlier problems and 
admissions  to  hospital  due  to  problems  and  infections  association  with  her  PEG 
site, Kealeigh was found to have died in her sleep at home.   She had lived another 
11  years  after  her  initial  injuries.    Despite  the  terrible  pain  and  privations  she 
suffered  during  her  young  life,  Kealeigh  would  have  known  that  she  was  truly 
loved and cared for. 

 
7.  Kealeigh’s  death  at  a  relatively  young  age  was  not  unexpected.    In  a  statement 
produced  for  the  original  trial,  Dr  Magnay,  stated  his  opinion  that  Kealeigh’s 
injuries were so severe that she had a considerably higher risk than most people of 
acute  deterioration  due  to  factors  such  as  the  aspiration  of  gastric  juices  or 
pneumonia. 

 
Cause of death in 2011 
 
8.  The  unanimous  medical  opinion  is  that  Kealeigh’s  death  in  2011  was  directly 

attributable to the injuries she suffered at your hand that night in January 2000. 

 
9.  Although  the  exact  mechanism  of  her  death  is  not  apparent,  it  is  clear  that  the 
underlying brain injury can be said to have been the principal cause of her death.   
Five  distinguished  experts  have  written  reports  to  this  effect.    In  particular,  the 
Home Office pathologist, Dr Kolar, concluded that Kealeigh’s death was cause by 
“late complications from the brain injury”. Dr Malcolmson is of the opinion that her 
original  brain  injury  was  the  untimely  cause  of  her  death  10  years  later.    They 
observed  that  the  fact  that  Kealeigh  had  survived  so  long  was  a  testament  to  the 
remarkable  level  of  love  and  care  that  she  had  received  during  her  life  from  her 
mother and the medical services. 

 

 

2
--------
Aggravating factor  
 
10. The aggravating factors in this case are: 
 

(1)  First, the extreme vulnerability of a baby of this age – Kealeigh was only 

aged 7 months.  

 
(2) 

Second, the breach of trust – she had been left in your care as baby-sitter 
when, her mother went out for the evening. 

 
(3)  Third, the fact that severe force was used when you shook her in a 

moment of frustration and temper.  

 
(4)  Fourth, the fact that you did not come clean straight away to her that 

night, or subsequently when the medical staff became involved. 

 
 

Mitigating factors 
 
11. I have listened carefully to everything that has ably been said by Mr Muldoon on 
your  behalf.    The  key  points  to  be  born  in  mind  by  way  of  mitigation  are  as 
follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

(1)  First, there was no intent to kill or harm.   
 
(2) 

Second, you shook Kealeigh in a momentary act of frustration and temper.  
The level of actual violence use was at the lower end of the scale. This was 
a ‘one shake’ case. Though, as is depressingly familiar, we know that even 
low  levels  of  momentary  violence  towards  young  vulnerable  babies  can 
have momentous and life-changing consequences. 

 
(3)  Third,  it  was  an  isolated  incident.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  other 

violence or cruelty inflicted that night by you on Kealeigh.   

(4)  Fourth,  it  was  out  of  character.    You  are  a  person  with  no  convictions 
before  or  after  this  incident.    Since  your  release  in  2001  you  have  been 
employed and led a quiet life. 

(5)  Fifth, I accept Mr Muldoon’s submission that that you are and always have 
been  genuinely  remorseful  for  what  you  have  done.  You  drafted  letters 
back in 2000 seeking to apologise to Kealeigh’s mother.  You have had to 
live with the knowledge of what you had done and that it was likely that 
Kealeigh would die prematurely and the police would come knocking on 
your door.  You told the officers that you have always known that this day 
would  come.  You  told  police  officers  that  you  felt  guilty  that  you  were 
given such a short sentence at the time.  

(6) 

 
(7) 

Sixth, I have read the Psychiatric Report dated 20th March 2015 prepared 
by Dr David Vaggers regarding the effect on you. 

Seventh, I have also read the Pre-Sentence Report dated 27th March 2015 
prepared by Ms Jane Finnesey which refers to the fact that you are a carer 
for his aged mother and re-inforces some of the points in mitigation.  

3
--------
(8)  Your  early  plea  of  guilty.  I  accept  Mr  Muldoon’s  submission  that  your 
legal  advisers  were  right  to  advise  you  to  seek  independent  medical 
evidence before indicating your plea.  I shall therefore give you a full third 
credit. 

 
Victim 
 
12. The  effect  on  Amanda  Woolley  and  the  immediate  family  has,  of  course,  been 
profound.    Her  life  was  turned  upside  down  in  2000.    Her  happy,  healthy  baby 
was sudden profoundly disabled. It is to her great credit that she has shown all the 
love and care that a mother could and devoted every fibre of her being in the past 
decade to looking after Kealeigh. As I have noted, the fact that Kealeigh lived as 
long as she did is a testament to the remarkable care that she received.  Kealeigh 
certainly would have known all her life that she was truly loved and cared for and, 
therefore, known happiness.   

 
13. I  have  carefully  read  and  re-read  the  witness  statement  of  Kealeigh’s  mother, 
Amanda Woolly. She describes movingly of the lifetime of pain and anquish which 
you have caused and speaks eloquently of the life that Kealeigh has had taken from 
her.  I would like to quote a few passages: 

 

“Keals would have been 16 years old this year. She should be getting excited for 
her school prom as she would have left school this year! She should be here with 
her family, she should be asking me for advice on what she should be doing with 
her career. She should be here because she needs her mummy! You took it all 
away from her.” 
 
“From that day onwards our lives were changed forever.” 
 
“But no matter what my little girl went through she always had a smile. That’s 
something you didn’t take away.” 
 
“I  thank  Keals  for  giving  me  11  years….11  amazing  years.  I  would  do 
anything to have Keals back here with us. I can’t have her back though because 
she has gone forever, and you did that.” 

 
 
11 years between injury and death 
 
14. As counsel have said, this is unusual case which involves the death of a child as a 
result of a serous assault committed on her more than a decade earlier.  It is a fact, 
and a matter of record, that during the past 11 years Kealeigh has suffered daily and 
grievously  from  the  numerous,  serious  painful,  life-limiting  medical  conditions 
consequent on the catastrophic brain injuries. She has endured many years of post-
trauma  suffering.      This  Court  has  the  advantage  of  knowledge  of  the  actual 
sequelae over the previous sentencing Court. 

 
Issues 
 
15. How is the Court to approach this unusual sentencing exercise and the fact of this 
long gap in time between the assault in 2000 and the eventual (but almost certainly 
inevitable) fatal outcome in 2011?  

 

 

4
--------
16. Two particular issues arise. First, whether, how and to what extent the Court takes 
into account the suffering of Kaeleigh between the infliction of the original injuries 
in 2000 and her eventual death 2011. Second, to what extent does the court have 
regard to the increase in severity of sentencing involving death, consequent on the 
2003 Criminal Justice Act 2003.  

 
First issue:  11 year interim period 
 
17. I turn to the first question,  namely  whether,  how  and  to what extent the Court 
takes into account the suffering of Kealeigh between the infliction of the original 
injuries in 2000 and her eventual death 2011. 

 
18.  There is some guidance to be found in R v. Owen [2009] 2 Cr App R (S) 113, a 
case involving strikingly similar facts. In that case, the appellant began a relationship 
with the mother of a young child in 2000. The child aged six months was taken to 
hospital  where  she  was  discovered  to  have  injuries  indicative  of  having  been 
violently shaken. She suffered a significant brain injury with spasticity of the limbs, 
remained blind and unconscious, unable to be moved or fed orally and requiring 
continual  suction  to  clear  her  airways.  The  appellant  pleaded  guilty  to  inflicting 
grievous  bodily  harm  on  the  child  and  was  sentenced  in  2001  to  three  years’ 
imprisonment. In 2007 the child became ill and died. A post-mortem examination 
found that the cause of death was pneumonia secondary to cerebral palsy caused by 
shaking or impact. The appellant was subsequently charged with manslaughter and 
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. 

 
19. The sentencing judge in Owen considered the length of sentence that would have 
been appropriate if the child had died in 2000 when the injuries were inflicted and 
concluded that the appropriate bracket for the offence of manslaughter would have 
been  four  to  five  years.  The  appellant  submitted  that  the  sentence  of  12  months 
should have been suspended and that the sentencing judge did not give sufficient 
weight to the fact that this was a second sentencing exercise, more than six years 
after  the  appellant’s  release  from  prison  for  the  same  criminal  act  committed  by 
him  and  since  his  release  the  appellant  had  worked  hard  and  lived  a  nearly 
blameless life. The Court rejected this submission and stated as follows: 

  

“14. We disagree. There was a purpose. The purpose was to mark the death of Shauna 
and to punish the appellant not only for destroying her quality of life, for causing her years 
of pain and misery, but for killing her. The flaw in Mr Robert’s argument, as it seems to 
us, is that he accepted that a total immediate sentence of four years for manslaughter had it 
been  imposed  back  in  2001  could  not  be  described  as  in  any  way  excessive;  some  way 
argue  it  would  not  be  long  enough.  The  question,  therefore,  is  whether  the  appellant’s 
excellent behaviour in the period between the two convictions means the judge was obliged 
to suspend a perfectly proper sentence.” 
 

20. The focus and debate in Owen was whether or not an immediate custodial sentence 
was called for.  The CA made it clear that it was.  Hallett LJ did mention en passant 
in paragraph 14 that the purpose of the sentence was inter alia “to punish not only for 
destroying her quality of life, for causing her years of pain and suffering, but for killing her”. 
The CA did not grapple with, or consider, in any detail the question of how the 
Court approaches the interim period – in that case 6 years and in the present case 
11  years  –  between  injury  and  death.  The  issue  perhaps  did  not  arise  directly  in 

 

5
--------
argument because it was not suggested (perhaps unsurprisingly) that the additional 
sentence of 12 months was in any way excessive. 

 
21. Ms Brand, for the Prosecution submitted that the period of 11 years of suffering 
should  be  taken  into  account,  but  simply  as  one  of  the  factors  in  the  overall 
sentencing  exercise  but  she,  rightly,  did  not  seek  to  elevate  it  to  an  overriding 
factor. Mr Muldoon, for the Defence, agreed that the period of 11 years should be 
taken into account but it should be balanced with the other factors, including the 
impact on the Defendant. 

 
22. In my judgment, the relevant principle to be applied is the well-known Common 
Law principle that you take your victim as you find him or her.  The Court must 
have  proper  regard  to,  and  take  full  account  of,  everything  that  has  happened  in 
intervening  11  years  between  the  infliction  of  the  original  injuries  in  2000  and 
Kaleigh’s eventual death 2011. It is clear, and a matter of record, as I have said, that 
the Kealeigh suffered greatly for 11 years from her disabilities, including blindness, 
quadriplegia  and  numerous  operations  and  hospital  visits  consequent  on  her 
disabilities  and  complex  conditions.    It  is  clear  also  that  the  need  to  care  for 
Kealeigh  in  life  for  so  many  years,  and  the  need  now  have  to  grieve  for  her  in 
death,  has  had  a  profound  effect  on  the  lives  of  who  loved  her,  particularly  her 
mother, Amanda Woolley. 

 
23. However, one does not look simply at that undoubtedly important factor of what 
Kealeigh’s prolonged suffering in isolation. It is tempered and to be balance with 
the other features of this period, in particular, that the fact of life and that during 
this  period  there  were  no  doubt  many  moments  of  joy  and  happiness  which 
Amanda Woolley describes.  In addition, the Court takes into account the effect of 
that having this ‘Sword of Damocles’ hanging over you for so many years has had 
on  the  defendant.  It  has  undoubtedly  circumscribed  your  life  as  Mr  Muldoon 
described.  It seems to me that the Court should take into account and balance all 
these multi-faceted features of the case in arriving at the eventual sentence. 

 
Second issue: Increased tariff for cases involving death  
 
24. The  second  issue  is  the  extent  does  the  Court  have  regard  to  the  increase  in 
severity of sentencing involving death, consequent upon the 2003 Criminal Justice 
Act 2003. 

 
25. In  R.  v.  Burridge  [2011]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  27,  Leveson  LJ  cited  Lord  Judge  LCJ’s 
judgments in Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 2 and AG’s References Nos. 60, 62 and 
63 of 2009 (Appleby and others) [2010] 2 Cr App R (S) 47 and went on to say this 
(at para. 139): 

 

 

“139.  Having  considered  the  authorities  and  referred  back  to  Wood  and  the  disparity 
between a sentence for murder with the tariff fixed by reference to Sch.21 of the 2003 
Act and that for manslaughter, he went on (at [22]):  
“[C]rimes which result in death should be treated more seriously, not so as to equate the 
sentencing in unlawful act manslaughter with the sentence levels suggested in Sch. 21 of 
the 2003 Act, but so as to ensure that the increased focus on the fact that a victim has 
died  in  consequence  of  an  unlawful  act  of  violence,  even  where  the  conviction  is  for 
manslaughter,  should,  in  accordance  with  the  legislative  intention,  be  given  greater 
weight.” 

6
--------
26. Ms Brand submitted that since the act in question took place in 2000, the Court 
should have regard to the levels of sentencing for manslaughter cases in 2000.  She 
submitted that the cases on sexual offences where the Sentencing Guidelines had 
increased  the  tariffs  in  relation  to  historic  sex  offences  were  sui  generis.  Mr 
Muldoon did not demur from this approach. The point was not raised or argued in 
Owen (supra) and Counsel are not aware of any guidance. 

 
27. In my view, however, this approach is flawed and it would be wrong in principle 
to approach the question of tariffs on this basis that the Court was tied to the levels 
of sentence for manslaughter current when the injuries were inflicted in 2000.  In 
my  view,  the  correct  and  principled  approach  is  to  ask  ‘when  was  the  current 
offence  (of  manslaughter)  committed?’.  The  offence  of  manslaughter  was  not 
committed  in  law  until  6th  February  2011  when  Kealeigh  died  aged  11  years  7 
months.  The fact that the actus reus took place some years before is not to point.  
The  offence  of  manslaughter  was  not  committed  until  her  death.  Again,  the 
principle to be applied is that one takes one’s victim as one finds him or her. 

 
28. Accordingly,  in  my  judgment,  the  Court  is  bound  to  have  regard  to  the  current 
(i.e. 2011) levels of sentencing in manslaughter cases.  As highlighted by Leveson 
LJ  in  R.  v.  Burridge  [2011]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  27,  since  the  2003  Act  there  is  an 
increased focus no on the fact that a victim had died as a result of an unlawful act 
of violence and greater weight must be given to that fact (see Lord Judge LCJ in 
Wood and Appleby (supra, passim). 

 
 
Relevant cases 
 
29. It is right to re-iterate once again that each case depends on its own fact.  I have, 
however,  considered  a  number  of  recent  cases  regarding  the  manslaughter  of 
young children in order to assist in calibrating the current sentence.   

 
30. In particular, I have considered AG’s Reference Nos. 125 of 2019 (Draper) [2011] 2 
Cr  App  R  (S)  97.    I  have  had  regard  to  the  observations  and  guidance  of  Lord 
Judge LCJ in relation to cases of manslaughter of young children and directed my 
self  accordingly.  In  that  case,  a  4  month  old  baby  was  thrown  as  a  result  of  a 
sudden loss of temper. It was noted that the aggravating features present in Burridge 
were  not  present.    Nevertheless,  the  CA  increased  the  sentence  from  3  ½  to  5 
years. Some reliance was placed on R v. Owen (supra) where, as noted above, only 
12  months  was  added  to  the  original  sentence  of  3  years.  It  is  noteworthy  that 
Hallet LJ’s passing remark that for some a sentence of four years “would not be long 
enough” was particularly highlighted by Leveson LJ in Burridge (at para. 136).   

 
31. Draper  (and  the  present  case)  are  to  be  contrasted  with  the  facts  of  cases  such  as 
AG’s  References  Nos.  84  of    2014  (Pearce)  [2014]  EWCA  2095  where  numerous 
injuries were inflicted on a 6-week old baby with implements, including a sandal 
and a bottle, causing blunt injury traumas leading to the child’s death.  In Pearce a 
sentence of 9 years was held not to be unduly lenient. 

 
32. Save for Owen, none of the cases involved long-term post trauma suffering.

Sentence 
 
Colin Head, please stand up 
 
33. The  approach  I  take  is  to  start  by  asking  what  sentence  would  be  passed  if  you 
were being sentenced today for the first time in relation to this matter, i.e. without 
any element of double–jeopardy. Then to make the relevant deduction for (a) your 
plea of guilty and (b) your previous sentence. 

 
34. Taking all the factors into account, all the 5 aggravating and mitigating features of 
this case which I have outlined, and the approach in law which have I have set out, 
the starting point which I take is one of seven years.  I give you full credit of 1/3rd 
for your early plead of guilty which reduce that figure to 4 years 8 months. From 
that figure of 4 years 8 months, I further deduct your first sentence of 18 months 
which you have already served, to arrive at a net figure of 38 months, i.e.  3 years 2 
months imprisonment. 

 
35. So,  Colin  Heath,  I  sentence  you  to  3  years  2  months  imprisonment  for  the 

manslaughter of Kealeigh-Anne Woolley.   

 
36. Your  counsel  will  explain  the  nature  of  the  sentence.    The  statutory  surcharge 

applies.  Please go with the officer.

Lord Hughes: 

R -v- Asiedu 

The  applicant  renews  his  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  his  conviction  for 
conspiracy  to  cause  explosions  likely  to  endanger  life  or  to  cause  serious  injury  to 
property, after refusal by the single judge.  He had pleaded guilty to this offence at his 
re-trial in November 2007.  He had previously been tried together with others on an 
indictment  charging  both  conspiracy  to  murder  and  this  offence,  arising  from  the 
same alleged conduct. At the end of a long trial in July 2007, the jury had convicted 
others, but had been unable to agree about this applicant.  Upon his plea of guilty to 
this  offence  at  the  outset  of  the  re-trial,  the  Crown  did  not  ask  for  a  re-trial  of  the 
graver alternative count, nor of count four which charged possession of an explosive 
substance with intent.  His contention that his conviction is unsafe is grounded upon 
complaints of lack of proper disclosure by the Crown of material relating to scientific 
evidence, and associated criticism of the evidence of one of the scientists called by the 
Crown at the effective (first) trial. 

The charges against this applicant and his five co-accused arose out of the taking of 
home-made bombs onto the London Transport system on 21 July 2005.  That was two 
weeks after terrorist suicide bombers had exploded bombs on underground trains and 
a bus on 7th July, causing some fifty-two deaths.  The case against the applicant and 
his co-accused was that they had similarly taken home-made bombs onto underground 
trains  and  buses.    The  bombs  were  contained  in  rucksacks,  and  were  triggered  by 
battery-driven  electric  devices  which  fired  home-made  detonators  when  an  electric 
circuit was completed by the wearer.  On 21 July there were five such bombs, taken 
separately by five of the six defendants from a common starting point in west London 
onto  either  trains  or  buses.    Four  of  those  devices  were  activated  by  four  of  the 
applicant’s  co-accused,  called  Omar,  Osman,  Mohammed  and  Ibrahim.    Omar 
activated his on a Victoria Line train in the tunnel approaching Warren Street Station.  
Osman activated his on a train near to Shepherd’s Bush station.  Mohammed activated 
his device on a northern line train between Stockwell and the Oval.  Ibrahim activated 
his on a number 26 bus in Hackney. In each of these cases, the electric circuit when 
completed successfully fired the home-made detonator, but the detonator did not set 
off the bulk charge. There was a bang, and some resultant confusion, but no major 
explosion.  The fifth device was carried by Asiedu. He abandoned it in some parkland 
in Little Wormwood Scrubs.   

The Crown case was that this was a plot to explode bombs which would kill.  The 
devices, which were recovered, were all of the same construction.  The bulk charge 
(which  failed  to  explode)  was  made  of  domestic  ingredients,  flour  and  hydrogen 
peroxide.  The detonators were all the same, comprising high explosive primers made 
from household materials publicly available.  The electric firing devices were again 
the same and similarly home-made.  Packed around the bulk charges was shrapnel, in 
the form of bolts, screws, washers or tacks, such as would increase the injuries in the 
event  of  explosion.    Because  in  the  event  the  bulk  charges  did  not  explode,  the 
carriers  were  able  initially  to  escape  in  the  confusion,  but  some  could  be  seen, 
undisguised, on CCTV and one had left clear evidence of his identity in his rucksack.  
They were arrested one by one in Birmingham, London and Rome. The police rapidly 
identified two London flats as having been used by them, one at Curtis House in north 
London and one in the west at Dalgarno Gardens near Ladbroke Grove.

R -v- Asiedu 

Asiedu  when  arrested  gave  long  police  interviews.    What  he  said  was  very  largely 
untruthful; he lied about who he was and about knowing the other defendants; he said 
he knew nothing at all about the bombs; he denied having anything to do with buying 
the hydrogen peroxide.  As to the day when the bombs were set off, he asserted a false 
alibi.  A police officer had to go to Ghana to establish the truth about his identity.  

In  the  weeks  and  months  after  the  arrests,  the  police  were  able  to  assemble  clear 
evidence  that  Asiedu  had  been  instrumental  in  the  purchase  of  some  442  litres  of 
hydrogen  peroxide  from  several  different  suppliers,  lying  to  the  sellers  about  the 
purpose  for  which  it  was  required.    He  was  shown  to  have  asked  for  70% 
concentration if available, but ordinarily the product is sold only at 18%, and that is 
what he had been able to get.  There was then evidence from Curtis House that the 
peroxide had been cooked in the kitchen, and concentrated from this 18% solution.  
There  were  rotas  for  this  cooking  duty,  and  notes  of  the  specific  gravity  achieved, 
which  indicated  a  strength  in  the  region  of  70%.    There  was  much  other  evidence 
uncovered connected with the construction of the bombs by the defendants. 

Sometime towards the end of 2006, over a year after the event and when the trial was 
imminent,  the  first  four  defendants  (but  not  Asiedu)  served  amended  defence  case 
statements.  In them, they asserted for the first time that they had indeed made the 
bombs, but that they had always intended that they should not explode; rather they 
were hoaxes intended to frighten or to make a political statement about UK actions in 
Iraq.  The trial had to be delayed for this hoax assertion to be investigated.  Much 
later,  during  the  trial,  the  other  defendants,  through  Ibrahim,  advanced  a  further 
assertion not previously contained in their defence statements, namely that they had 
concentrated  the  hydrogen  peroxide  to  about  70%,  but  having  done  so,  watered  it 
down by adding an equal volume of water, thus reducing the strength to around 35%.  
It was their positive case that the bombs were constructed of a mixture of flour and 
hydrogen peroxide, in proportions of roughly 1:2.   

At a late stage in the trial Asiedu went to some lengths to distance himself from the 
other defendants.  Inconsistently with his previous stance, and with a letter which he 
had written to Ibrahim’s sister whilst awaiting trial saying that all the defendants were 
totally innocent, his case underwent a sea change after the Crown case was closed and 
Ibrahim had given evidence in chief.   His case as put to Ibrahim in cross examination 
was that Ibrahim had, personally and via his solicitors, put pressure on him in prison 
to  change  his  solicitor  and  to  adopt  the  hoax  defence.    Consistently  with  his 
instructions,  leading  counsel  roundly  attacked  the  hoax  assertion  as  absurd.    By 
contrast,  his  defence,  which  he  supported  by  evidence  on  oath,  was  that  there  had 
been a plan to make real bombs, but that he had learned of it only the night before 
they  were  deployed,  and  he  was  never  a  party  to  it.    He  had  earlier  bought  the 
hydrogen peroxide innocently, believing that the others were using it for painting and 
decorating, or, later, that they were making cosmetics.  Later Ibrahim had told him 
that the others were making “firecrackers”, but he was never party to such a plan. On 
the  night  before  the  bombs  were  detonated  he  was  with  the  others  in  Dalgarno 
Gardens and realised for the first time that they were talking about a suicide bombing 
mission  and  expected  him  to  take  part.    He  was  afraid  to  voice  his  disagreement 
because the others were now seen to be terrorists who would kill him, so he bided his 
time, and when once separated from them, abandoned his device in the park in Little 
Wormwood Scrubs.

8. 

After  the  jury  disagreed  in  his  case,  but  had  convicted  the  first  four  defendants, 
Asiedu  was  re-tried  some  four  months  later.    At  the  outset  of  his  re-trial,  having 
sought in open court information from the judge as to the range of likely sentence in 
such  event,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  the  lesser  alternative  count  of  conspiracy  to  cause 
explosions  likely  to  endanger  life  or  to  cause  serious  damage  to  property.    The 
tendering of this plea of guilty followed detailed discussions between his lawyers and 
those acting for the Crown.  He asserts that the Crown initiated them, but it does not 
matter who did so; he was represented then, as now, by tenacious leading and junior 
counsel plus solicitors.  Prior to tendering his plea, a detailed statement of the factual 
basis for it was prepared on his behalf, discussed with the Crown, and submitted to 
the judge so that a sentence indication might be given.  It ran to three pages.  In it he 
said (amongst other things) that: 

i) 

ii) 

he  had  agreed  in  March  2005  to  take  part  in  making  bombs  by  buying  the 
hydrogen peroxide;  he was reluctant but did as asked;  he appreciated that any 
explosion  of  the  bombs  would  be  likely  to  endanger  life  and  that  he  thus 
committed the offence charged in count 2 from March 2005; 

at  this  time  he  was  living  at  Curtis  House  with  Omar,  as  he  was  for  the 
majority, but not all, of the period from March to the deployment of the bombs 
in July;  he had been aware of the cooking of the hydrogen peroxide in the 
kitchen;  he had not personally taken part in this activity, but continued to buy 
the peroxide for the process; and 

iii) 

at  Dalgarno  Gardens  overnight  on  20/21  July  he  had  learned  of  a  planned 
suicide mission the next day;  he had refused to be one of the suicide bombers 
but had helped to mix the materials to make one of the five bombs.   

9. 

On  20  November  2007  Asiedu  was  sentenced  to  33  years  imprisonment  for  the 
offence  to  which  he  had  pleaded  guilty.    An  application  to  this  court  for  leave  to 
appeal  that  sentence  was  refused  on  10  July  2008  (Sir  Igor  Judge  P,  Rafferty  and 
Grigson JJ).  

Scientific evidence and disclosure 

The  deployment  of  these  bombs  took  place  just  a  fortnight  after  the  fatal  suicide 
attacks on the London transport system of 7th July had killed and injured a very large 
number  of  people.    The  use  of  home-made  starch/peroxide  bombs  was  new  at  the 
time, and expertise in such material was scarce.  The Forensic Explosives Laboratory 
(“FEL”) could undertake some of the necessary reporting work, but it seems that it 
was  not  in  a  position  to  deal  with  analysis  of  the  content  of  the  devices.    In 
consequence,  Dr  Black,  who  was  an  academic  expert  in  isotopic  analysis  without 
experience  of  trial  (forensic)  work  was  instructed  to  undertake  this  analysis.    The 
present  application  for  leave  to  appeal  is  built  entirely  around  the  evidence  of  this 
expert. In due course his was by no means the only scientific evidence at the trial.  
Very  important  evidence  was  given  by  FEL  scientists  as  to  the  potential  of 
flour/peroxide mixtures of various recipes to explode and as to the manufacture and 
potency of the detonators.  But Dr Black’s evidence was relied on by the Crown and 
was  in  parts  challenged  by  the  defendants  other  than  Asiedu.  In  particular,  his 
evidence refuted the re-dilution assertion when it appeared during the trial.

11. 

The particular issues which Dr Black was initially asked to address were these: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

v) 

the composition of the starch/peroxide residues recovered from the bombs; 

the origin of the starch; 

whether the bombs were made from a single mix or from a number of mixes 
made independently; 

whether there was or was not scientific evidence that the bombs were prepared 
at Curtis House and/or Dalgarno Gardens; 

whether there was or was not scientific evidence of concentration of peroxide 
at either address. 

12. 

Dr  Black  produced  a  first  report  in  June  2006.  He  had  proceeded  by  way  of  (1) 
isotopic  analysis,  (2)  chemical  analysis  of 
trace  elements,  (3)  microscopic 
examination,  (4)  Xray  diffraction,  and  (5)  Xray  fluorescence.    At  the  end  of  a 
substantial report, his stated summary of conclusions read, omitting inessential detail, 
as follows: 

“7.1  Isotopic analysis of the scene residues found on 21 July 
2005 show them to be flour-hydrogen peroxide mixtures. 

  Isotopic  analysis  of  all 

7.2 
the  scene  residues  and 
commercially available flour types shows the flour used in the 
devices was similar to control sample GL12, labelled chapatti 
flour, and the control FUDCO chapatti flour GDA 353. 

7.3  X  ray  diffraction  analysis  of  the  scene  residues  also 
supports  the  isotopic  analysis  and  shows  the  incorporation  of 
inorganic components to the residues which are consistent with 
stabilisers from the hydrogen peroxide. 

7.4  Lead isotopic analysis of all the scene residues show them 
to  be  identical  to  one  another  [and]….  to  residues  recovered 
from the bins at Curtis House and from Curtis House. 

7.5  Trace  element  analysis  of  the  scene  residues  shows  clear 
links to cooking pans at Curtis House….. 

7.6  Physical  shapes  and  structures  of  …residue  found  [at] 
Curtis  House  show  them  [sic]  to  be  identical  to  those  from 
scene  residues  originating  from  Warren  Street,  No  26  bus, 
Shepherd’s  Bush,  the  bins  at  Curtis  House,  The  Oval  and  58 
Curtis House. 

7.7  There is thus scientific evidence to suggest that the devices 
were prepared at Curtis House. 

7.8  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the devices 
were prepared at …Dalgarno Gardens.

7.10  Analysis of the isotopic data for the hydrogen peroxide, 
scene residues and control flour materials suggests a mixture of 
between approximately 68-74% hydrogen peroxide was used at 
a  strength  between  approximately  3  and  4  times  the  initial 
concentration (between 54-72%).” 

This report was seen by forensic scientists working at the FEL who, whether or not 
directly  concerned  in  the  case,  were  concerned  that  some  conclusions  appeared  to 
them to be unjustified. Within the service there was a system for such concerns to be 
made known to the Head of the Laboratory, and if appropriate via him to others, in 
order to avert any risk of a potential miscarriage of justice.  The procedure set out in 
the  laboratory  quality  manual  (section  9  paragraph  3)  shows  that  this  is  a  system 
rightly  taken  seriously.    Where  anything  emerges  which  might  indicate  that  a  past 
miscarriage  of  justice  has  occurred,  its  stated  aim  is  to  enable  the  information  to 
reach,  by  one  route  or  another,  the  Criminal  Cases  Review  Commission.    Where 
something emerges which might have the potential to cause a future miscarriage of 
justice, then its stated aim is to ensure that it is corrected and the correction provided 
to  anyone  outside  the  laboratory  to  whom  uncorrected  material  has  been  given.   
Defence teams who have been given information which needs correction are, rightly, 
identified in the manual as examples of those in the latter situation. 

It  is  now  known  that  particular  officers  of  the  FEL  prepared,  first,  a  document 
beginning  “Is  Dr  Black’s  report  fit  for  purpose?”  (“the  fit  for  purpose  document”) 
and, second, draft comments on his report (“the draft comments document”) .  The 
second was certainly sent in electronic copy to the principal forensic scientist dealing 
with this case, Mr Todd.  It is also now clear that the gist of the concerns expressed in 
these  documents  was  communicated  orally  (i)  to  Dr  Black  at  a  meeting  with  other 
scientists (including Mr Todd) on 13 November 2006, attended by two police officers 
and  (ii)  to  counsel  at  a  visit  they  made  to  the  FEL  and  subsequently  at  a  case 
conference, both on 22 November.  As part of that conference there was a telephone 
conversation between Mr Hill QC (then first junior counsel for the Crown) and Dr 
Black, at which some queries arising from the expressed concerns were discussed.  

The  outcome  of  this  was  that  Dr  Black  wrote  two  additional  witness  statements  in 
December 2006, both duly served on all parties and forming to a large part the basis 
of his evidence in due course at the trial.  The first was entitled an “amendment” to his 
original  statement.    It  began  by  saying  that  “a  number  of  errors  occurred  in  the 
original report”, and offered his apology.  It went on to re-work some paragraphs of 
his  original  report  in  a  way  which  to  an  extent  altered  their  import,  including 
subparagraphs 7.2 and 7.10 of the conclusions which we have set out at paragraph 12 
above. The second was a substantial addendum statement, setting out a good deal of 
further work and the conclusions which he drew from it.  Thereafter the defendants 
instructed a scientific expert, Professor Michels, who met Dr Black on one or more 
occasions  and  discussed  his  conclusions  with  him  and  who  in  due  course  gave 
evidence at the trial, differing in some respects from him.  Both addressed the late-
appearing re-dilution assertion.

Although Dr Black thus corrected his first report, and added to it, what did not happen 
was the disclosure to the defence of either the Fit for Purpose document or the Draft

Comments document.  Both were, we are satisfied, clearly disclosable.  We consider 
below, to the extent appropriate without re-hearing scientific evidence, what impact in 
the  end  any  of  the  concerns  might  have  had  at  the  trial  of  the  six  defendants  who 
included Asiedu.  But whatever hindsight may now tell us about that question, those 
two documents plainly had at least the potential to be of assistance to the defence as 
possibly undermining a part of the Crown case, namely some, though by no means all, 
of Dr Black’s conclusions.  As such, they fell to be disclosed to the defence.  It is true 
of course that Dr Black’s amendment statement clearly stated that he acknowledged 
errors and was correcting them, so that the defence was not only on notice that he had 
made errors but also could see which conclusions he agreed involved error.  But this 
did not obviate the disclosability of the two documents.  It would be for the defence to 
examine,  on  its  own  terms,  whether  the  corrections  adequately  met  the  criticisms, 
whether the final conclusions ought to be challenged or not, and whether or not Dr 
Black’s general standing as an expert witness ought to be challenged. Moreover, the 
amendment  statement,  whilst  it  corrected  the  first,  said  nothing  about  the  errors 
having been drawn to Dr Black’s attention by others and to that extent did not provide 
the defence with the same potential ammunition that ought to have been available to 
them.  And since Dr Black adhered to some conclusions about which the FEL critics 
had expressed doubt, there was in those cases no correction and therefore also neither 
acknowledgement nor disclosure of peer criticism.   

The  factual  position  which  we  have  been  able  to  set  out  above  has,  even  now, 
emerged only piece by piece. In January 2013, in response to the present application 
for leave to appeal and to grounds which raised the issue of the FEL concerns, the 
Crown properly traced and disclosed the key documents, namely the Fit for Purpose 
document and the Draft Comments document (the two principal documents) together 
with  the  notes  of  the  meeting  on  13  November  2006.    The  case  conference  of  22 
November, however, emerged only at the two day hearing before us some two years 
later in February 2015.  That led leading counsel for the applicant understandably to 
seek further assurance that full disclosure had now been made, and indeed he went on 
to raise a query as to the good faith of those representing the Crown. He asked us to 
order  an  independent  enquiry  into  the  disclosure  history  by  fresh  counsel.    We 
concluded that that was not called for, but in response to his concerns we ordered, 
after the hearing before us was otherwise completed, a further disclosure investigation 
and specifically required to know whether either of the two principal documents had 
been seen by counsel, solicitors, or the police officers present at the case conference.  
We have been told that the necessary records have been exhumed from storage and 
inspected by their authors.  There is no sign that any of those persons saw either of the 
two  documents  and  none  has  any  recollection  of  doing  so.    There  is  no  reason  to 
doubt this information, nor the good faith of those who have provided it.  The case 
conference was not only, or even principally, about Dr Black.  The notes of it do not 
suggest that the relevant discussion was conducted over a document, rather than being 
initiated by an oral report of topics of concern.  Its outcome was that further work was 
to be done, and that two further statements would be made, one a correction and the 
other an update or addendum.   

That does not alter the facts that (a) the two principal documents were not identified 
as apt for disclosure pre-trial, as plainly they should have been, and (b) the discussion 
at the case conference of part of material which derived from them was produced only 
at the hearing before us, eight years or so after the trial, and only after specific request

for  its  disclosure.    We  are  satisfied  that  the  first  was  a  clear  failure  of  the  duty  of 
disclosure.    If  disclosure  of  the  two  principal  documents  and  of  the  gist  of  the  13 
November discussion had been made, as it should have been, there would probably 
have  been  no  occasion  for  disclosure  of  the  telephone  conversation  at  the  case 
conference.  As it is, the late emergence of the latter has lent some limited colour to 
the applicant’s assertion that there has been a deliberate cover-up. Having considered 
detailed  additional  written  submissions  made  after  the  hearing  on  behalf  of  the 
applicant, we see no evidence of this.  We are, however, on an application for leave to 
appeal  against  conviction,  concerned  solely  with  the  safety  of  the  conviction.    We 
therefore need in any event to consider the relevance of non-disclosure, of whatever 
kind, to that issue. That involves considering (i) the applicant’s plea of guilty and (ii) 
the  significance  of  the  undisclosed  material.    We  have  heard  argument  about  both 
matters.   

The plea of guilty    

A defendant who pleads guilty is making a formal admission in open court that he is 
guilty of the offence.  He may of course by a written basis of plea limit his admissions 
to only some of the facts alleged by the Crown, so long as he is admitting facts which 
constitute the offence, and Asiedu did so here. But ordinarily, once he has admitted 
such facts by an unambiguous and deliberately intended plea of guilty, there cannot 
then be an appeal against his conviction, for the simple reason that there is nothing 
unsafe about a conviction based on the defendant’s own voluntary confession in open 
court.    A  defendant  will  not  normally  be  permitted  in  this  court  to  say  that  he  has 
changed his mind and now wishes to deny what he has previously thus admitted in the 
Crown Court.  

It does not follow that a plea of guilty is always a bar to the quashing by this court of 
a conviction.  Leaving aside equivocal or unintended pleas (which do not concern us 
here), there are two principal cases in which it is not.  The first is where the plea of 
guilty was compelled as a matter of law by an adverse ruling by the trial judge which 
left no arguable defence to be put before the jury.  So, if the judge rules as a matter of 
law that on the defendant’s own case, that is on agreed or assumed facts, the offence 
has been committed, there is no arguable defence which the defendant can put before 
the  jury.    In  that  situation  he  can  plead  guilty  and  challenge  the  adverse  ruling  by 
appeal to this court.  If the ruling is adjudged to have been wrong, the conviction is 
likely to be quashed.  Contrast the situation where an adverse ruling at the trial (for 
example as to the admissibility of evidence) renders the defence being advanced more 
difficult, perhaps dramatically so.  There, the ruling does not leave the defendant no 
case to advance to the jury.  He remains able, despite the evidence against him, to 
advance  his  defence  and,  if  convicted,  to  challenge  the  judicial  ruling  as  to 
admissibility by way of appeal. If he chooses to plead guilty, he will be admitting the 
facts which constitute the offence and it will be too late to mount an appeal to this 
court.  For this important distinction see R v Chalkley & Jeffries [1997] EWCA Crim 
3416; [1998] 2 Cr App R 79, which on this point is clear law.  That was a case in 
which  the  defendants  had  failed  to  persuade  the  trial  judge  to  exclude  evidence 
pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and, faced with 
evidence which they judged to be difficult to overcome, had pleaded guilty, indeed in 
explicit terms which made it clear that they now admitted the conspiracy to rob which 
was charged.  Giving the court’s judgment, Auld LJ said this at 94D: 

19. 

20.

R -v- Asiedu 

“Thus,  a  conviction  would  be  unsafe  where  the  effect  of  an 
incorrect  ruling  of  law  on  admitted  facts  was  to  leave  an 
accused with no legal escape from a verdict of guilty on those 
facts. But a conviction would not normally be unsafe where an 
accused  is  influenced  to  change  his  plea  to  guilty  because  he 
recognises that, as a result of a ruling to admit strong evidence 
against him, his case on the facts is hopeless. A change of plea 
to guilty in such circumstance would normally be regarded as 
an  acknowledgment  of  the  truth  of  the  facts  constituting  the 
offence charged.” 

21. 

The  second  situation  in  which  a  plea  of  guilty  will  not  prevent  an  appeal  is  where 
even if on the admitted or assumed facts the defendant was guilty, there was a legal 
obstacle to his being tried for the offence. That will be true in those cases, rare as they 
are,  where  his  prosecution  would  be  stayed  on  the  grounds  that  it  is  offensive  to 
justice to bring him to trial.  Such cases are generally described, conveniently if not 
entirely accurately, as cases of ‘abuse of process’.  The classical example of such is R 
v Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court ex p Bennett [1994] AC 42 and later [1995] 1 
Cr App R 147, where the defendant had been charged in England after being illegally 
routed here from a foreign country with which there was no extradition treaty.  His 
committal for trial was quashed and the prosecution was stayed.  In the subsequent 
similar case of Mullen [1999] 2 Cr App R 143, where the prosecution had proceeded 
to conviction after trial, that conviction was quashed.  As this court there said,  

“.  .  .  for  a  conviction  to  be  safe,  it  must  be  lawful;  and  if  it 
results from a trial which should never have taken place, it can 
hardly be regarded as safe.” 

By parity of reasoning, if the trial process should never have taken place because it is 
offensive to justice, a conviction upon a plea of guilty is as unsafe as one following 
trial. 

22. 

Chalkley was not such a case, and the court there went too far in offering, obiter, the 
opinion  that  a  plea  of  guilty  would  prevent  an  appeal  even  in  such  circumstances. 
That dictum was inconsistent with the reasoning in the later case of Mullen (although 
there had been no plea of guilty there) and it was corrected in Togher [2000] EWCA 
Crim 111; [2001] 1 Cr App R 457.  There this court referred to the ratio of Chalkley 
as set out above at paragraph 20 and said: 

“We would not wish to question this passage in the judgment of 
Auld LJ.  However, it cannot be applied to the situation which 
exists here, where the defendants were unaware of the material 
matters alleged to amount to an abuse of process. If they could 
establish  an  abuse,  then  this  Court  would  give  very  serious 
consideration  to  whether  justice  required  the  conviction  to  be 
set  aside.  We  would,  however,  emphasise 
the 
circumstances  where  it  can  be  said  that  the  proceedings 
constitute an abuse of process are closely confined. The reason 
for this is that the majority of improprieties in connection with 
bringing  proceedings  can  be  satisfactorily  dealt  with  by  the 
court  exercising  its  power  of  control  over  the  proceedings.  It

23. 

has to be a situation where it would be inconsistent with the due 
administration of justice to allow the pleas of guilty to stand.” 

And the court had earlier made clear that: 

“Certainly,  if  it  would  be  right  to  stop  a  prosecution  on  the 
basis that it was an abuse of process, this Court would be most 
unlikely to conclude that if there was a conviction despite this 
fact, the conviction should not be set aside.” 

That  position  was  further  endorsed  by  this  court  in  the  later  case  of  Early  [2002] 
EWCA Crim 1904; [2003] 1 Cr App R 19.  The case arose from the notorious London 
City Bond investigations into evasion of duty upon bonded goods.  The appellants had 
all pleaded guilty, in several cases after applications for a stay on grounds of abuse of 
process  had  failed.    Those  applications  had  been  made  on  the  basis  of  entrapment 
which is, of course, no defence but may be grounds for a stay:  see R v Latif  [1996] 
UKHL 16;  [1996] 1 WLR 104.  Subsequently it transpired that a key manager at the 
bonded warehouse, who was a Crown witness, had been a participating informer, that 
he had lied on oath about this and other matters to the knowledge of the investigators 
who had not revealed the lie, that the judge had been given false information about his 
status, and that that the investigators had facilitated offences, in other words that there 
had indeed been entrapment.  

24. 

This court approached the appeals in accordance with Mullen and Togher.  Rose LJ 
first made some general remarks as to the gravity of perjury in PII or abuse of process 
hearings.  He said this: 

“Judges can only make decisions and counsel can only act and 
advise  on  the  basis  of  the  information  with  which  they  are 
provided. The integrity of our system of criminal trial depends 
on judges being able to rely on what they are told by counsel 
and on counsel being able to rely on what they are told by each 
other. This is particularly crucial in relation to disclosure and 
Pll hearings. Accordingly, Mr Gompertz QC, rightly, accepted 
that  when  defence  counsel  advised  Rahul,  Nilam  Patel  and 
Pearcy  as  to  plea,  they  were  entitled  to  assume  that  full  and 
proper  disclosure  had  already  been  made.  He  also  rightly 
accepted that a defendant who pleaded guilty at an early stage 
should not, if adequate disclosure had not by then been made, 
be  in  a  worse  position  than  a  defendant  who,  as  the 
consequence of an argument to stay proceedings as an abuse, 
benefited from further orders for disclosure culminating in the 
abandonment of proceedings against him. Furthermore, in our 
judgment,  if,  in  the  course  of  a  PII  hearing  or  an  abuse 
argument,  whether  on  the  voir  dire  or  otherwise,  prosecution 
witnesses lie in evidence to the judge, it is to be expected that, 
if the judge knows of this, or this court subsequently learns of 
it, an extremely serious view will be taken. It is likely that the 
prosecution  case  will  be 
tainted  beyond 
redemption, however strong the evidence against the defendant 
may otherwise be. Such an approach is consistent with the view 

regarded  as
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

expressed by this court, in Edwards [1996] 2 CAR 345 @ 350F 
where,  in  a  different  context,  Beldam  LJ  referred  to  the 
suspicion  of  perjury  starting  to  infect  the  evidence  and 
permeate  other  similar  cases  in  which  the  witnesses  are 
involved.” 

The ratio of the case appears from what follows immediately: 

“We  approach  the  question  of  safety  of  these  convictions, 
following pleas of guilty, in accordance with Mullen [1999] 2 
Cr App R 143 as approved in Togher & others [2001] 1 Cr App 
R 457, namely a conviction is generally unsafe if a defendant 
has  been  denied  a  fair  trial.  We  bear  in  mind,  in  particular, 
three  observations  by  Lord  Woolf  CJ  in  Togher.  First,  at 
paragraph 30, “if it would be right to stop a prosecution on the 
basis that it was an abuse of process, this court would be most 
unlikely to conclude that, if there was a conviction despite this 
fact,  the  conviction  should  not  be  set  aside”.  Secondly,  at 
paragraph 33, “The circumstances where it can be said that the 
proceedings constitute an abuse of process are closely confined. 
It has to be a situation where it would be inconsistent with the 
due  administration  of  justice  to  allow  the  pleas  of  guilty  to 
stand”. Thirdly, at paragraph 59, freely entered pleas of guilty 
will not be interfered with by this court unless the prosecution’s 
misconduct is of a category which justifies this. A plea of guilty 
is binding unless the defendant was ignorant of evidence going 
to innocence or guilt. Ignorance of material which goes merely 
to  credibility  of  a  prosecution  witness  does  not  justify 
reopening a plea of guilty.” 

25. 

It is clear from the sentences which directly follow the reference to a defendant being 
denied  a  fair  trial  that  Rose  LJ  was,  consistently  with  principle,  in  this  context 
referring to the case of abuse of process such as renders it unfair to try the defendant 
at all.  Entrapment, if made out, can be an example of such unfairness. The court was 
clearly satisfied that the defendants who had pleaded guilty had been deprived of a 
stay on such grounds.  

26. 

In the present case, the submission of Mr Kamlish QC for the applicant is that:  

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

the non-disclosure of the FEL documents was an abuse of process, moreover 
one committed in bad faith; 

Dr Black committed perjury at least at one point in his evidence when asked to 
explain something which had been in his original report and was removed by 
the amendment in December; 

had the non-disclosure been exposed before or during the trial the proceedings 
would have ended by order of the court (it seems by way of stay) and there 
would  never  have  been  a  second  trial  or  occasion  for  the  applicant  to  plead 
guilty;
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

iv) 

v) 

vi) 

alternatively  but  for  the  non-disclosure  the  applicant  might  have  been 
acquitted at the trial; 

the  non-disclosure  led  to  the  applicant  being  misled  by  the  Crown  and  to 
pleading guilty to a false case; 

the applicant was deprived of any real choice but to plead guilty, and his plea 
was accordingly a nullity; and 

vii) 

in the circumstances, the plea was not a true confession to the offence. 

 Carefully presented as they are, these submissions are unarguable.  Non-disclosure is 
not by itself an abuse of the process of the court.  It is a failure of duty on the part of 
the prosecution as a whole.  It may in some cases be serious.  A conviction after trial 
may be unsafe if material was left undisclosed, especially (but not only) if it provided 
a defence;  R v Barkshire [2011] EWCA Crim 1885 and  R v Bard  [2014] EWCA 
Crim 463, cited to us, were examples.  But non-disclosure does not by itself amount to 
a  circumstance  making  it  unfair  to  put  the  defendant  on  trial  at  all  and  it  does  not 
afford grounds for a stay.  The remedy for non-disclosure will ordinarily be orders for 
the  defendant  to  be  provided  with  the  necessary  material,  and  such  order  as  will 
ensure  that  he  is  not  unfairly  damaged  by  its  late  delivery.    Usually  the  trial  can 
proceed fairly.  Sometimes, if the material emerges late, a re-trial may be necessary if 
the  defendant  seeks  it;  in  others  he  may  judge  that  he  will  be  better  served  by 
continuing the trial and making a point of the Crown’s failures.  But there is nothing 
akin to the kind of misbehaviour which characterises either the ex p Bennett type of 
case, or others of gross executive misconduct of a kind which makes it offensive to 
justice to put the defendant on trial at all.   

This is well illustrated by Togher.  After the defendants had entered pleas of guilty, it 
had emerged at a linked re-trial that there had been concealment by the investigators 
of breaches of internal guidance for surveillance and that false assurances had been 
given by counsel to the trial judge to the effect that authority for the surveillance had 
been  obtained.    In  the  context  of  a  defence  which  asserted  plant  and  the  dishonest 
framing of the defendants by the investigators, this was plainly of great importance.  
The  non-disclosure  was  characterised  by  deliberate  failure  on  the  part  of  the 
investigators.  The case reached the Court of Appeal after the trial judge at the re-trial 
had stayed the proceedings for abuse of process, and thus it was that this court had to 
resolve  the  law  as  to  when  an  appeal  may  be  mounted  notwithstanding  a  plea  of 
guilty.  But, having done so, this court went on to hold that the re-trial ought not to 
have been stayed at all; the remedy for the non-disclosure was a fair re-trial with all 
exposed.    For  this  reason,  the  appeals  against  conviction  were  dismissed.  It  was 
otherwise in Early because there the non-disclosure concealed entrapment, which is a 
ground for a stay.   

As will be seen, we are not satisfied that Dr Black’s evidence at the trial justifies the 
description of perjury.  But even if at the single point of explaining one of the changes 
from original to amendment statement it did so, that is not a ground for staying the 
proceedings.    The  references  in  Early  to  the  significance  of  perjury  were  to  false 
evidence given in PII or voire dire proceedings when the issue of entrapment fell to be 
decided by the judge; there the perjury concealed grounds for a stay.

33. 

Accordingly,  we  do  not  agree  that  if  the  FEL  documents  had  been  exposed  at  or 
before trial the proceedings would have been brought to an end against this applicant, 
or, for that matter, against any of the others; indeed it is clear that they would not.   
Whether this applicant would have been acquitted is a matter of complete speculation.  
Despite  his  abandonment  of  his  own  device,  he  had  no  doubt  a  formidable  case  to 
meet, but no one can say.  Similarly, he might or might not have been acquitted at the 
re-trial had he fought it, but he did not.  These speculations have nothing to do with 
whether his plea of guilty amounted to an unambiguous and voluntary confession. 

It is entirely clear that it did.  Of course a defendant who is confronted by a powerful 
case may have difficult decisions to make whether to admit the offence or not. He will 
of course be advised that if he does plead guilty that fact will be reflected in sentence, 
but that general proposition of sentencing law does not alter his freedom of choice in 
the absence of an improper direct inducement from the judge, such as there was in R v 
Inns (1974) 60 Cr App R 231.  He will always have it made clear to him that a plea of 
guilty, should he choose to tender it, amounts to a confession.  Only he knows the true 
facts, which usually govern whether he is guilty or not and did so here.  If he is guilty, 
the fact that the choice between admitting the truth and nevertheless denying it may 
be a difficult one does not alter the effect of choosing to admit it.  We do not begin to 
agree that Asiedu had no real choice but to plead guilty.  He had a completely free 
choice.    Nor  do  we  agree  with  the  further  submission  made  on  his  behalf  that  the 
conviction of the others in some way altered the climate against him.  That would be 
irrelevant to his freedom of choice, but as a matter of fact the disagreement of the first 
jury in his case, when he had distanced himself from the hoax defence advanced by 
those whom it convicted, might if anything have been taken as some encouragement.   

Because it is of cardinal importance that a defendant makes up his own mind whether 
to confess by way of plea of guilty or not, and because only he knows the true facts, it 
is not open to him to assert that he was led to plead guilty by mistaken overstatement 
of  the  evidence  against  him.    As  Sir  Igor  Judge  P  observed  in  R  v  Hakala  [2002] 
EWCA  Crim  730  at  paragraph  [81],  the  trial  process  is  not  a  tactical  game.  A 
defendant  knows  the  true  facts;    he  ought not  to  admit  to  facts  which  are  not  true, 
whatever the evidence against him, and this will always be the advice he is given.  If 
he  does  admit  them,  the  evidence  that  they  are  true  then  comes  from  himself, 
whatever may be the other evidence advanced by the Crown.   

In the present case, moreover, it is in any event impossible to see that the admissions 
which  this  applicant  made  can  to  any  material  extent  have  been  influenced  by  the 
evidence of Dr Black at all, still less by those parts of it which had received adverse 
comment within the FEL.  By the time of the trial it was common ground that the 
devices were made of flour and hydrogen peroxide.  It was the positive assertion of 
those  who  admitted  that  they  had  made  them  that  those  ingredients  were  mixed  in 
proportions of about 1 to 2.  It was common ground amongst all the defendants that 
the hydrogen peroxide had been cooked at Curtis House to a concentration of about 
70%.  The only remaining issue to which the scientific evidence of Dr Black had any 
relevance was whether it might be true that, after first being concentrated to 70%, the 
hydrogen peroxide had been watered down to about 35%, so as to make the devices 
into hoaxes.   

34. 

But this was not Asiedu’s case.  His positive case at trial was that he had been led to 
believe, at least on the night before the devices were deployed, that they were real and
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

intended to be used in suicide attacks.  He ridiculed the hoax defence, joining with the 
prosecution in doing so.  The issue in his case was whether he had ever taken part in 
making  the  devices  with  the  intention  to  endanger  life.    As  counsel’s  very  full 
skeleton argument on his behalf rightly asserts, the central issue in his case was his 
own state of mind – his intention.   In due course, the admissions which he made upon 
his plea of guilty, carefully reduced to writing, owed nothing whatever to the evidence 
of Dr Black.  The evidence that he had been the procurer of the hydrogen peroxide, in 
enormous quantities, owed nothing to Dr Black.  The evidence that he had lied to the 
suppliers to obtain it likewise had nothing to do with Dr Black.  Dr Black’s evidence 
could  offer  no  assistance  on  the  intention with  which  Asiedu  did  those  things.    He 
alone knew the truth of that, and what he admitted was that he had himself had the 
intention  to  make  real  bombs  from  March.  That  was  contrary  to  the  positive  case 
which  he  had  sworn  at  the  trial  was  true,  namely  that  he  had  bought  the  hydrogen 
peroxide  in  all  innocence,  believing  it  to  be  for  decorating  or  for  cosmetic 
manufacture.  It was thus, and very clearly, an unambiguous admission.    

35. 

It follows that Asiedu’s plea of guilty unequivocally establishes his guilt.  There is 
nothing arguably unsafe about his conviction, whatever may be the true analysis of Dr 
Black’s evidence.  The failure of disclosure has for these reasons no impact on the 
safety of his conviction.  

The impact of the failure of disclosure on the scientific evidence and the trial 

36. 

That  is  sufficient  to  dispose  of  this  application,  which  must  be  refused.    Since, 
however, we have been addressed at some length on the impact both of Dr Black’s 
evidence and the failure to disclose the FEL documents criticising some parts of it, we 
ought to deal with those two matters so far as the material permits us properly to do 
so.  In doing so, we emphasise that we have not embarked upon any determination of 
any  scientific  dispute.  We  were  provided  with  further  reports  or  statements  both 
supporting  Dr  Black  and  differing  from  him,  but  have  not  examined  them  in  any 
detail  and  have  not  heard  evidence  from  any  of  the  scientists.    Given  the  plea  of 
guilty, that was unnecessary and inappropriate when dealing with this application for 
leave.  What  can,  however,  be  done,  and  is  appropriate,  is  to  identify  the  extent  to 
which there was, by the time of the trial, any remaining scientific issue, and how far 
any  issue  which  remained  might  be  affected  by  the  non-disclosure  of  the  FEL 
criticisms of Dr Black’s initial statement. 

37. 

The  concerns  expressed  by  the  FEL  authors  of  the  two  principal  documents  were 
these. 

i) 

ii) 

Conclusion 7.1 was overstated and unjustified because isotopic analysis, being 
of the atoms of elements (here oxygen and carbon) can tell one the elements 
but does not identify the compounds in which they are present.  

Conclusion 7.2 (and an earlier statement at 6.2.6 that the scene residues were 
mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and chapatti flour) were overstated because all 
wheat  flours,  including  FUDCO  chapatti  flour,  had  broadly  similar  isotopic 
values for carbon and the isotopic readings were not specific to chapatti flour. 

iii) 

A  statement  at  6.1.10  that  oxygen  isotopic  readings  in  the  scene  residues 
indicated  that  additional  components  “rich  in  oxygen  (e.g.  hydrogen
--------

peroxide)” had been added to the flour was overstated because other additions 
could have supplied the oxygen – including water. 

iv) 

Paragraph 6.2.7 stated  

  “The  difference  in  the  oxygen  isotope  ratios  between  the 
 
starting  flour  and  the  scene  residues  is  related  to  the 
  proportion  of  hydrogen  peroxide  added  to  the  material 
  during the preparation of the mixture.  This can be quantified 
through  use  of  a  weighed  isotope  mixing  curve  …figure 
 
  A7.2…  This  shows 
the  proportions  of  unevaporated 
  hydrogen  peroxide  in  the  mixture  is  between  82-87%, 
  however note results in section 6.4 (evidence of evaporation 
  of hydrogen peroxide).” 

Firstly, this was said to contain the assumption without proof, also reported at 
7.1,  as  to  what  the  two  components  in  the  mixture  were  (for  which  see  (i) 
above).  Secondly, the quantification was said to be wrongly derived from the 
mixing curve, which showed, it was said, inadvertent transposition of the flour 
and peroxide percentages.  

v) 

Paragraph 6.4.1 stated:   

  “The  carbon  and  oxygen  isotope  data  from….the  scene 
residues shows that the hydrogen peroxide was concentrated 
 
in order to make the samples.  The isotopic composition of 
 
 
the  samples  can  only  be  achieved  by  concentrating  the 
  hydrogen peroxide…” 

 

Readings from Dr Black’s own experimental cooking of peroxide were then 
given  in  6.4.2,  from  which  a  peroxide  concentration  in  the  samples  of 
approximately 54-72% was deduced.  Firstly, this was said to be unsupported 
by evidence of concentration in the scene residues, which might have achieved 
their isotopic profiles by other means, including the mixing of water with the 
flour.    Secondly,  there  was  said  to  be  an  inconsistency  between  the  second 
sentence  and  6.2.7  above.    Thirdly,  there  was  said  to  have  been  no 
consideration  given  to  the  possible  decomposition  of  the  peroxide  during 
cooking, which could alter the isotopic ratios (“fractionation”). Generally, it 
was said that isotopic ratio measurements do not show conclusive evidence of 
the concentration of the peroxide.   

vi) 

Paragraph  6.5.2  recorded  that  the  scene  residues  recovered  shared  the  same 
isotopic  profiles,  save  that  those  which  were  moist  when  recovered  differed 
slightly  (but  not  enough  to  suggest  different  origins)  as  a  result  of 
fractionation.  This conclusion was said to be “incongruous”, it seems because 
dry and moist samples could not both contain 68-74% peroxide. 

Point (i): conclusion 7.1 

38. 

It  is  easy  to  see  the  force  of  this  criticism,  which  is  in  fact  apparent  from  the 
description  of  isotopic  study  provided  by  Dr  Black  himself  in  the  same  report  at
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R -v- Asiedu 

Appendix  A1  and  A1.1.      Some  elements,  including  carbon  and  oxygen,  have  a 
mixture of atoms, most of them with the usual number of neutrons and a few with a 
slightly  larger  number,  giving  a  raised  atomic  weight.    Isotopic  analysis  involves 
measuring the ratio of the heavier atoms to the normal ones.  Thus it seems clearly 
correct  that  by  itself  this  process  detects  the  characteristics  of  this  particular 
manifestation of the element concerned, in whatever compound it is contained, but it 
does not follow without more that this necessarily identifies the compound.  Whether 
if there were sufficient control samples of different compounds this would or would 
not be possible is not discussed in the materials we have seen.  Conclusion 7.1, insofar 
as  it  gave  the  impression  that  isotopic  analysis  by  itself  had  identified,  or  could 
identify, the compounds as flour and peroxide, was at least potentially misleading.  At 
first sight, and without hearing scientific evidence, we provisionally conclude that it 
ought not to have been written in that form.  Nor was this paragraph amended in Dr 
Black’s Amendment Report.  

39. 

7.1, however, is only the summary conclusion.  The rest of the report shows the full 
position.  At 6.1.1 it shows that flour was identified not by isotope analysis but by X 
ray diffraction.  At 6.1.4 it shows that X ray diffraction also detected the presence of 
sodium stannate, which is used as a stabiliser in one of the two brands of hydrogen 
peroxide bought by Asiedu and of which empty bottles were found at Curtis House.  

40.  More  importantly,  however,  there  was  at  the  trial  no  issue  at  all  about  the  two 
components of the devices.  They were admitted by those who made them to be flour 
and hydrogen peroxide.  Although Asiedu’s defence differed from that of the others 
when it came to the suggested watering down of the peroxide and the construction of 
hoax  devices,  there  was  no  possible  reason  to  doubt  the  two  components.    To  the 
extent that there was an overstatement in conclusion 7.1 it was irrelevant to the case.  
Its  only  possible  materiality  might  have  been  if  it  were  thought  to  bear  on  the 
scientific  credentials  of  Dr  Black  (as  distinct  from  his  familiarity  with  the  way  to 
frame  reports  for  forensic  purposes).    It  must  have  been  apparent  to  any  scientist 
reading his report.  The point was not even touched upon in cross-examination. 

Point (ii): conclusion 7.2 & para 6.2.6 

The point made in the FEL documents was that all wheat flours, of which FUDCO 
chapatti flour was one, were examples of flour made from C3 plants, for which the 
average  ratio  for  carbon  13  atoms  is  -27  per  mill.  That,  it  was  said,  called  into 
question the “uniqueness” of FUDCO flour.   

The  average  ratio  figure  of  -27  was  derived  from  Dr  Black’s  own  report,  where  it 
appears  at  Appendix  A3  and  was  fully  explained.    He  had  at  no  point  used  any 
expression such as “uniqueness”, which was the critics’ word.  Rather he had said that 
his  analysis  showed  that  all  wheat  flours  clustered  together  with  broadly  similar 
ratios, but that there were sufficient differences between FUDCO and ordinary wheat 
flour to differentiate them.  It is not obvious what was suspect about that. 

By  way  of  defence  statement  in  advance  of  the  trial,  one  or  more  of  the  other 
defendants  advanced  the  positive  case  that  the  devices  had  been  made  with 
Sainsbury’s flour rather than with FUDCO flour.  When Dr Black came to make his 
amendment  statement  in  December  2006,  he  also  made  an  addendum  statement 
detailing  further  work,  part  of  which  addressed  this  assertion.    The  addendum 

41. 

42.

--------

R -v- Asiedu 

statement set out trace element analysis which distinguished clearly between FUDCO 
flour  and  Sainsbury’s  flour.      A  table  at  A6.1  clearly  showed  marked  differences 
between the two in strontium, sodium, calcium, iron and copper and table A6.2 and 
slide  32  supported  the  stated  conclusion  (at  6.2.1)  that  trace  element  and  isotopic 
analysis  both  showed  that  the  two  flours  were  “different  to  a  degree  well  outside 
analytical uncertainty”.   Meanwhile, the amendment statement, which said that it was 
devoted  to  correcting  errors,  drew  attention  to  the  original  conclusion  7.2  and 
corrected it to:   

“7.2    Isotopic  and  trace  element  analysis  of  all  the  scene 
residues and commercially available flour types shows the flour 
used  in  the  devices  was  similar  to  control  sample  GL/12 
labelled  chapatti  flour  and  the  control  FUDCO  chapatti  flour 
GDA 353”   (emphasis added) 

44. 

It is very difficult to see how it made any difference to the issue of hoax construction 
which flour it was.  The suggestion made in argument before us was that the type of 
flour went, first, to Dr Black’s scientific credibility as an expert and, second, to the 
credibility of Asiedu’s narrative account that an experimental mix had been made at 
Curtis House but the main mixing had been done at Dalgarno Gardens. As to the first, 
the  point  might  go  to  Dr  Black’s  occasionally  casual  writing  of  reports,  but  if  the 
addendum material was accurate his scientific credibility would scarcely be affected.   
The  second  suggestion  is  far-fetched.    True  it  is  that  Asiedu  gave  a  circumstantial 
account of events at Dalgarno Gardens on the morning of the day when the devices 
were deployed, and true it is that he narrated the mixing of the components.  But the 
identity  of  the  flour  variety  did  not  point  to  either  Curtis  House  or  to  Dalgarno 
Gardens.  Wherever the mixing was done, it could have been either type of flour.  

45. 

The reality is that it simply did not matter which type of flour it was. Indeed, whilst 
counsel for Mohammed dutifully put to Dr Black that it might have been Sainsbury’s 
flour,  suggesting  that  the  difference  between  dry  and  moist  scene  residue  samples 
might  muddy  the  picture,  he  shied  away  from  the  trace  element  analysis  and 
understandably made little of the cross examination.  

Point (iii):  paragraph 6.1.10 

46. 

This point appears to add little.  Dr Black’s original paragraph 6.1.10 said no more 
than  that  the  scene  residues  contained  something  more  than  just  flour,  which  was 
unarguably correct, that the extra something contained a lot of oxygen, which no one 
doubted, and that it could be hydrogen peroxide – “e.g. hydrogen peroxide”.  In this 
instance there does not seem to be any overstatement of the conclusion.  

Point (iv):  paragraph 6.2.7 

47.  When Dr Black met other scientists including his critics on 13 November 2006, a note 
was made after the discussion.  There is no sign that it was sent to him for approval, 
and in places it is not easy to be sure to whom comments ought to be attributed.  But 
at least on its face it suggests that Dr Black was asked about the figures of 82-87% for 
the  proportion  of  unevaporated  peroxide  in  the  mix  and  agreed  that  the  figures  for 
peroxide and flour had been inadvertently transposed.  It also suggests that he went 
away to think about it.  The next event was the telephone conversation with counsel
--------

R -v- Asiedu 

on 22 November, when, apparently without the original FEL documents before them, 
they asked if any mistake went to the mix proportion, or to the concentration figure 
for the hydrogen peroxide, or to both.  Dr Black told them that the mix proportion 
might be “slightly different” and that he wanted to run more tests.  He also told them 
that  there  were  “more  ingredients”  which  were  better  at  showing  mix  and 
concentration; that was clearly a reference to trace element work.  It was left that he 
would write two further statements, one of correction and one dealing with additional 
work.  

The amendment statement, when made a little later, drew attention to paragraph 6.2.7. 
as  a  place  where  a  mistake  had  been  made,  and  removed  from  it  the  last  sentence 
containing  the  figures  of  82-87%.    It  also  substituted  the  word  “illustrated”  for 
“quantified”.  A fresh diagram of the mixing curve referred to was provided.  This 
differed, however, only marginally from the first one.  There were some modifications 
to the labelling.  It left out percentage figures which had previously appeared along 
the  curve,  and  which  may  or  may  not  have  been  the  source  of  inadvertent 
transposition if it had occurred.  But the plotted positions were the same, for flour and 
peroxide samples, and for scene residues, and also for different mixture proportions.  
What the amendment statement did not, however, say, was that there had been any 
previous inadvertent transposition of the two components, flour and peroxide.  Nor 
did it say that the error had been drawn to the author’s attention, together with other 
criticisms, by reputable scientists in the field.  

This correction in the report being apparent, Dr Black was cross-examined about the 
disappearance of the figures of 82-87% flour as the mix.  Perhaps understandably, the 
questions  assumed  a  connection  between  these  figures  and  the  fact  that  he  had 
conducted a second set of peroxide cooking/concentration experiments.  It is by no 
means clear that the two had any connection;  the concentration experiments no doubt 
yielded plots on the mixing curve, but any inadvertent transposition/misreading of the 
end points of that curve seems to have been independent of them.  What Dr Black told 
the  court  was  (i)  a  second  concentration  experiment  was  his  own  idea  because  the 
speed of heating had been very rapid the first time, it seems in part because of the 
apparatus  used,  and  (ii)  the  substituted  mixing  curve  in  his  addendum  report  used 
concentrated  peroxide  at  the  relevant  end  rather  than  unevaporated  peroxide  as  the 
first (from which he said he had derived these figures) had done.  What he did not say 
was that there had been any transposition of figures.  We take the view, at least in the 
absence of any further explanation, that he ought to have done.  It does not, however, 
follow  that  Mr  Kamlish’s  characterisation  of  this  evidence  as  perjured  is  justified.  
Rather, it would appear to be a failure to appreciate the extent of an expert witness’ 
duty to the court.  Given the likely suggestion that the chemical qualities and isotopic 
characteristics  of  the  peroxide  might  be  altered  in  the  course  of  cooking 
(“fractionation”), it is understandable enough why the experiment was repeated at a 
much  slower  speed.  The  speed  of  cooking  and  possible  effect  on  composition  had 
been discussed at the meeting of 13 November; once again we make the assumption 
in the applicant’s favour that Dr Black can properly be criticised for not referring to 
this  in  his  addendum  report,  and  any  failure  is  similarly  of  the  expert’s  duty  of 
frankness. Fractionation was very fully explored before and at trial.  It was addressed 
by Professor Michels for the defence and was the principal point of challenge to Dr 
Black’s evidence. Thus the failure to disclose the initial references to it in the FEL 
documents does not appear to have occasioned damage to any defendant on this point 

48.

R -v- Asiedu 

(and  see  point  (v)  below).    The  evidence  that  the  first  mixing  curve  had  relied  on 
unevaporated peroxide as one terminus seems consistent with what paragraph 6.2.7 
said, although why it was ever thought that unevaporated material was the best marker 
point is less than clear.  

50.  Whatever may be the correct analysis of paragraph 6.2.7, the mixing curves and any 
inadvertent transposition, the 82-87% figures went to the mix of ingredients not to the 
level  of  concentration  of  peroxide,  which  was  the  only  significant  live  issue  in  the 
trial to which Dr Black’s evidence was relevant.  These figures were removed by him 
from his report well before the trial and attention was drawn to their removal.  The 
mix was not significantly in doubt at the trial, for those who made the devices made a 
positive case that it was peroxide to flour at 2:1.  Dr Black’s evidence on this point 
was in no sense critical to the Crown case.   

Point (v):  concentration of hydrogen peroxide 

The concentration of peroxide, as mixed with the flour, was an issue central to the 
hoax  defence  of  the  defendants  other  than  Asiedu.    The  issue  was  not,  however, 
whether  the  peroxide  had  been  cooked  to  70%.    That  was  clearly  established  by 
documents and bottle labels left behind at Curtis House, and was expressly common 
ground at the trial. The issue was whether there had subsequently been a re-dilution 
by adding to the concentrated peroxide the same volume of tap water, thus reducing 
the concentration from 70% to 35%, or thereabouts.  The case of the other defendants, 
given in evidence by Ibrahim, was that only 12 of the bottles of 70% concentrate had 
been used, leaving lots more of it unused and thrown away after the event.  Dr Black’s 
evidence  went  to  this  contention  directly  and  in  two  ways.    First  his  original  and 
addendum  reports  derived  a  concentration  in  the  devices  of  about  54-72%,  from 
isotopic and to an extent from trace element work.  Secondly, when the re-dilution 
assertion  was  raised,  late,  in  the  course  of  the  trial,  it  was  he  who  was  asked  to 
consider it.  His evidence was that the trace element and isotopic evidence was not 
consistent  with  such  re-dilution  with  London  tap  water,  for  which  he  had  used 
published chemical data.  The scale of the difference between what was found and 
what  would  have  been  involved  if  tap  water  had  been  used  as  alleged  by  the 
defendants was very large.  

The matters raised by the FEL documents (point (v) above) necessarily went to the 
first of these two areas of evidence, since re-dilution had not then been raised by the 
defendants.  Moreover, they, or the other points discussed above, might be relevant to 
Dr Black’s scientific standing and thus to the reliability of his later conclusions about 
re-dilution.  However, his conclusions that re-dilution had not occurred appear to have 
been fully supported by the trace element analysis, never mind any isotopic analysis.  
Chiefly,  this  established  that  tin,  which  originated  from  one  of  the  two  brands  of 
peroxide  bought  by  the  defendants,  was  present  in  the  final  mixtures  in  quantities 
which were consistent with the total peroxide bought and used and not consistent with 
re-dilution and the throwing away of much of the concentrate. Nor (although this was 
not  the  defence  case)  could  all  the  re-diluted  concentrate  have  been  used,  because 
there would then be too much volume for the devices. On the face of it this evidence, 
combined  as  it  was  with  the  absurdity  of  first  taking  a  great  deal  of  trouble  to 
concentrate the peroxide only to re-dilute it, with the compellingly late appearance of 
any suggestion of re-dilution, and with the considerable body of other evidence that 

51.

R -v- Asiedu 

what was intended were real bombs, fully supported Asiedu’s contention at the trial 
that the hoax assertion was false.  

53. 

In  any  event,  the  re-dilution  and  hoax  assertions  formed  no  part  of  Asiedu’s  case 
either at trial or when he pleaded guilty at his re-trial. He positively disclaimed them 
at trial.  When he pleaded guilty, it was his own intention that he was admitting, not 
anyone else’s. 

Point (vi):  paragraph 6.5.2 

54. 

This appears to add nothing of significance.  So far as can be seen, there was nothing 
suspect  about  the  observation  that  the  moist  and  dry  residue  scene  samples  both 
pointed to a peroxide concentration in the region of 54-72% and that the differences 
between them were not significant. In due course Dr Black’s evidence in answer to 
cross examination was that his conclusions were based on comparing like with like, 
viz dry with dry.  Fractionation was an issue and has been considered above.   In any 
event,  the  question  was  not  whether  54-72%  was  less  than  perfectly  accurate,  but 
whether  it  was  double  the  true  concentration,  and  that  depended  on  whether  re-
dilution was a live possibility or not (see above).  

Conclusions relating to the scientific evidence 

55.  We  have  not,  as  explained,  embarked  on  any  re-hearing  of  the  scientific  evidence.  
But  nevertheless,  for  the  reasons  given,  and  making  the  assumptions  in  favour  of 
Asiedu  which  can  properly  be  made,  we  reach  the  following  conclusions.    Whilst 
there  may  well  be  criticisms  which  can  properly  be  made  of  Dr  Black  in  the 
presentation of a report for forensic purposes, and in the giving of expert evidence, the 
matters raised in the FEL documents do not appear to undermine his conclusions on 
the  topics  on  which  there  was  an  issue  at  the  trial.  In  any  event,  the  failure  of 
disclosure  had  no  impact  on  Asiedu’s  case,  nor  can  it  have  affected  the  voluntary 
nature of his confession by way of plea of guilty.

SENTENCING REMARKS  


OF THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE CARR DBE 


 
 
Colin Capp, you are aged 23 years old. You now stand convicted by a unanimous jury 
of the murder of Darren Thomas on 6th March 2014. 
 
On 10th July 2012 you were convicted of arson being reckless as to whether life would 
be endangered on 4th July 2012, contrary to s. 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. 
After mental health assessment, you were sentenced to 32 months’ detention in a 
Young Offenders’ Institution.  The circumstances of that offence were that you set 
light to 7 Wyfan Place, Cardiff, where you were staying at the time.  After an 
argument with your then girlfriend you sprayed lighter fluid around your first floor 
room which you then set alight.  You were released on licence but recalled to HMP 
Cardiff on 7th February 2014. 
 
It was in those circumstances that you came to be sharing a cell with Darren Thomas 
on the night of 5th and 6th March 2014.  Darren Thomas was a vulnerable 45 year old, 
essentially a vagrant not coping with life on the outside, and who was serving a 12 
week custodial sentence for breach of an anti-social behaviour order as a result of 
begging in Cardiff City Centre. 
  
You had been assessed as at risk of self-harm and were on an Assessment Care in 
Custody Teamwork plan and to be the subject of hourly checks as a result.  You were 
both locked up in your cell at about 7pm, with you on the top and Mr Thomas on the 
bottom bunk.  In the early hours of 6th March 2014 , including at 0230 hours, you 
were noted to be sitting on your bed.      
 
At 0325 am you rang the internal alarm requesting assistance.  Prison staff attended.  
 
Mr Thomas was found lying face down on the floor with a blanket partly over him 
with fatal injuries.  Over his head was a plastic bag which had been pulled tight and 
screwed up at the back of the head.  A bed sheet was also around his neck. Mr 
Thomas also had some 100 puncture marks on the left hand side of his neck which 
you had caused with a plastic biro through the plastic bag.  The cause of Mr Thomas’ 
death was strangulation or suffocation or a combination of both. 
 
You had waited for Mr Thomas to fall asleep, and then, for whatever reason, chose to 
kill him. I have no doubt that you intended to kill him.  This was a concerted, 
sustained and vicious attack. You have shown no remorse. 

 

1
--------
The court has heard a victim impact statement from Ms Susan Davies, the mother of 
Mr Thomas. She describes how he was a much loved son, stepson and brother whose 
death has caused deep anguish to his family and friends.  Mr Thomas was intelligent 
and articulate, and not violent in any way. Your lack of remorse has prevented the 
family from achieving closure, despite extensive counselling.   
 
You have a complicated background. You were born in Inverness. You suffered 
considerable adversity during your childhood due to disruption of family life, 
rejection by your parents, reception into care and the suicide of your elder half-brother 
when you were aged 14 years. You say that you were the victim of physical and 
sexual abuse when you were a young boy. You were in and out of care.  You left 
school with no qualifications but managed to achieve short periods of work before 
coming to Cardiff.   
 
You have a history of alcohol and drug abuse and a history of previous offending : 
apart from a caution in 2006, you were convicted in 2011 of sending offensive 
messages (and sentenced to detention in a Young Offenders’ Institution) and for 
possession of a class B controlled drug; in 2012 you were convicted of criminal 
damage and given a conditional discharge.   None of those matters are of any real 
significance in the present context, but your conviction for arson is of course material.  
 
The court has also heard medical evidence about you from two consultant forensic 
psychiatrists, Dr Melanie Croy and Dr Philip Joseph. It is clear in my judgment that 
you suffer from a mental disorder, namely a long standing personality disorder with 
antisocial, psychopathic and borderline features. A personality disorder is a 
longstanding developmental condition in which, due to adverse life experiences, 
personality development is disordered.  You suffer from emotional instability, leading 
to difficulty in controlling your emotions, resulting in self-harm and aggressive acts 
towards others. 
  
By way of aggravation, there was here a significant degree of premeditation.  You sat 
on your bed for a couple of hours contemplating your actions.  Mr Thomas was a 
vulnerable man whom you attacked in a confined environment when he was 
defenceless in his sleep.  The fact that you committed this offence whilst already 
serving a custodial sentence for a serious offence is an aggravating factor.    
 
By way of mitigation, you are a young man with a troubled and difficult past, as 
already indicated.  Whilst your criminal responsibility was not substantially 
diminished as a result of mental health problems, you do have a longstanding 
personality disorder.  This lowers your degree of culpability, but I assess your 
culpability as nevertheless substantial. You knew what you were doing and that it was 
very wrong and you could have prevented or stopped your actions.  
 
I am obliged by law to sentence you to imprisonment for life on the count of murder 
of which you now stand convicted.  I then have regard to Schedule 21 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 2003. 
 
The appropriate starting point in determining the minimum term under Schedule 21 of 
  
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, not to be applied mechanistically, is 15 years. 
 

 

2
--------
Having regard to all the aggravating features and all the mitigating features in your 
case, I consider an appropriate minimum term to be 16 years. I therefore fix the 
minimum term which you will serve in custody, before the Parole Board may consider 
your possible release, at 16 years. 
 
In my judgment this minimum term accurately reflects the seriousness of the offence 
taking account of the statutory starting point, all relevant aggravating and mitigating 
factors. 
 
It is important that you – and everyone concerned with this case – should understand 
what this in fact means.  The minimum term is not a fixed term after which you will 
automatically be released but the minimum time that you will spend in custody before 
your case can be considered by the Parole Board.  It will be for the Parole Board to 
say at that time whether or not you will be released.   If it remains necessary for 
public protection, you will continue to be detained after that date.  If and when you 
are released you will be subject to licence and this will remain the case for the rest of 
your life.  If for any reason your licence were to be revoked, you would be recalled to 
prison to continue to serve your life sentence in custody.  
 
The victim surcharge order applies.

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Spencer 

In the Crown Court at Blackfriars 

 

 

15th April 2015 

 

Elvis  Kwiatkowski  and  Chas  Quye,  I  have  to  sentence  you  for  the  murder  of 

Neill Buchel, and for your part in a conspiracy to pervert the course of public 

justice  by  avoiding  any  police  detection  of  his  body.  Scott  Hunt,  Alan  Quinn 

and  Bradley  Andison,    I  have  to  sentence  each  of  you  for  your  part  in  that 

same conspiracy. 

 

For  murder  there  is  only  one  sentence,  life  imprisonment,  and  that  is  the 

sentence I shall pass in due course upon you, Elvis Kwiatkowski and you, Chas 

Quye.  I am, however, required to determine the minimum period which each 

of you must serve in prison before you are eligible even to be considered for 

release on parole.  

 

This was a brutal and callous murder. Neill Buchel was 39 years old when he 

died.  He  was  a  harmless  and  inoffensive  man.  He  and  his  wife  had  come  to 

this country from their native South Africa in 2001 with their young daughter. 

 

1
--------
Their second daughter was born here two years later. They wanted to make a 

better life for themselves. Neill Buchel had strong links with this country. His 

grandfather  had  been  a  fighter  pilot  in  the  Battle  of  Britain.  Sadly  Neill 

Buchel’s working life disintegrated when he descended into alcohol addiction, 

and  the  family  eventually  spilt  up.  It  is  clear  on  the  evidence  the  jury  heard 

that his wife and his children never for a moment stopped loving and caring 

for  him,  even  in  the  most  difficult  of  circumstances.  I  have  read  the  moving 

impact  statements  from  his  mother  and  from  his  wife.  The  family’s  loss  is 

immeasurable. The girls have been deprived of their father, and of the chance 

that the family would one day get together again, as they all hoped. 

 

Neill  Buchel  was  befriended  by  you,  Scott  Hunt,  and  you,  Chas  Quye.  He 

thought you were his friends. By the time of the fateful events in March last 

year  Neill  Buchel  had  become  a  vulnerable  and  pathetic  figure,  largely 

dependent on you, Scott Hunt, for his accommodation and on the two of you 

for  his  daily  living.  His  life  seems  to  have  revolved  around  you  and  your 

activities. He was in reality incapable of independent living. 

 

 On  the  afternoon  of  Thursday  13th  March  you,  Scott  Hunt,  got  yourself 

arrested  following  a  disgraceful  display  of  drunken  aggression  in  public  on 

The  Green  near  to  your  home.  You,  Chas  Quye,  came  to  Scott  Hunt’s 

assistance when he called you to say that he was under attack by some lads. 

Neill  Buchel  did  not  come  to  Hunt’s  aid.  That  supposed  failing  on  Neill 

Buchel’s part seems to be the only explanation for what followed that evening. 

Neill Buchel had been drinking all day. It is also plain on the medical evidence 

that he must have been suffering from some degree of brain injury caused a 

few days earlier, although none of you were to know that at the time.  

 

On  your  own  admission,  Chas  Quye,  at  your  flat  that  evening  you  subjected 

Neill Buchel to degrading and humiliating violence and aggression.  By now he 

had become the victim of almost casual violence on your part.  You admit that 

a day or two previously you had struck him to the knees with a mallet, leaving 

him  limping  and  in  pain.  On  this  occasion,  in  the  flat  that  evening,  you  had 

him  kneeling  on  the  floor,  with  a  cloth  over  his  head,  whilst  you  threatened 

 

2
--------
him  with  violence.  He  must  have  been  terrified.  Although  you  deny  it  I  am 

quite sure that you were reinforcing those threats by holding close to his head 

the  same  mallet  you  had  used  previously  on  his  knees,  as  Amber  Aires 

described.  A  little  later  you  struck  him  two  forceful  blows  to  the  top  of  his 

head with your fist, as described by Claire Sacco. You told the jury, as you told 

her on the night, that you did this because he was bleeding on your floor.  

 

You,  Elvis  Kwiatkowski,  had  arrived  in  Dagenham  that  afternoon  for  a 

drinking  session.  You  were  already  drunk,  and  got  even  drunker  as  the  day 

wore  on.  You  were  also  taking  drugs.  You  had  never  even  met  Neill  Buchel 

before  that  day,  but  on  the  evidence  you  joined  in  with  Chas  Quye’s  verbal 

abuse and threats. You, Scott Hunt, arrived at the flat later on and, according 

to  your  own  evidence,  witnessed  Kwiatkowski  using  some  physical  violence 

towards  Neill  Buchel,  apparently  on  the  pretext  that  Neill  Buchel  had  done 

nothing to help you when you were involved in the confrontation with the lads 

on The Green that afternoon immediately prior to your arrest. I am sure on all 

the  evidence,  including  the  evidence  of  Hunt,  that  you,  Elvis  Kwiatkowski, 

were taking your lead from Chas Quye in abusing Neill Buchel in this way and 

that you did use some physical violence towards Neill Buchel in the course of 

the evening as Hunt described, albeit no more than with a punch or a knee.  

 

 It is a measure of your attitude towards Neill Buchel that night, Chas Quye,  

that you assert that you deliberately struck him on the top of the head with a 

full beer can, causing the gaping wound which was noted at post mortem. You 

could  give  no  explanation  as  to  why  you  struck  him  such  a  serious  blow, 

suggesting  that  it  must  have  been  part  of  the  so  called  “jackass”  style 

behaviour that you had indulged in with him previously, which had included 

the knee episode. I seriously doubt whether that is how he came by the wound 

to the top of his head.  It is difficult to see how that double laceration could 

have been caused by a single blow from the rim of a can. But it matters not. 

What  your  evidence  demonstrated  is  the  level  of  your  admitted  aggression 

towards  him  that  night,  even  before  the  fatal  attack,  and  your  willingness  to 

inflict serious pain and injury upon him.  

 

 

3
--------
The  precise  circumstances  in  which  Neill  Buchel  met  his  violent  death  later 

that night will forever remain unclear. What is certain, however, is that he was 

subjected  to  a  brutal  and  merciless  attack  in  the  course  of  which  he  was 

stamped on and/or kicked repeatedly and with such force that he suffered 25 

separate fractures of the ribs, with some of the ribs fractured in more than one 

place. His right leg was stamped on with such force that the tibia was broken. 

There were blows to his head as well. The result of these crushing injuries to 

his chest and abdomen was also to cause severe internal bleeding. The overall 

effect  of  the  injuries  was  so  serious  as  to  cause  his  death  within  a  matter  of 

minutes.  

 

This attack took place in the sitting room of your flat Chas Quye. You were not 

asleep in bed when it happened, as you claimed in evidence. Far from it. You, 

Elvis Kwiatkowski, were also fully involved in the attack. It is not possible on 

the  evidence  to  determine  the  precise  role  which  each  of  you  played  in  that 

attack, or to be sure which of you did the kicking and stamping, if it was not 

both  of  you.  By  the  jury’s  verdicts,  however,  each  of  you  either  took  part 

actively in kicking or stamping on Neill Buchel, or at the very least took part in 

the  attack  upon  him,  physically  or  by  encouragement,  realising  there  was  a 

serious risk that the other would  kick or stamp on him with intent to do him 

really serious injury. It was a classic joint enterprise. It matters not in the end 

which of you did what. You bear joint and equal responsibility for the injuries 

that were inflicted, and for the outcome. I have no doubt that both of you were 

heavily  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs,  or  both,  at  the  time  of  the 

attack  but  that  affords  no  excuse  whatsoever.  It  merely  aggravates  the 

seriousness of your offending.  

 

Both of you must have realised straightaway that Neill Buchel was very badly 

injured and in need of urgent medical treatment. Neither of you did anything 

to  help  him.  You  Alan  Quinn  had  also  been  present  in  the  room  when  this 

attack  took  place,  drifting  in  and  out  of  consciousness  through  alcohol  and 

drugs.  You  did  nothing  to  assist  Neill  Buchel  either.  I  make  it  clear  that  in 

sentencing  Quye  and  Kwiatkowski    I  disregard  your  account  in  interview  of 

how the attack began, in so far as it implicated the two of them. In particular I 

 

4
--------
cannot be sure on all the evidence that a hammer was used in the fatal attack. 

Your  account  was  not  repeated  from  the  witness  box,  and  is  not  evidence 

against them, and there are features of your own account which do not square 

entirely with the rest of the evidence.  

 

Next  morning,  when  the  three  of  you  saw  the  battered  and  bruised  body  of 

Neill  Buchel  in  the  cold  light  of  day,  common  humanity  demanded  that  an 

ambulance  be  called  in  case  there  was  anything  that  could  be  done  for  Neill 

Buchel. You, Alan Quinn, promptly left the flat, although not as quickly as you 

would  have  the  police  and  the  jury  believe  in  the  account  you  gave  in 

interview. You remained at the flat for fifteen minutes or more before deciding 

to  leave.  At  that  stage  the  full  detail  of  the  plan  to  dispose  of  Neill  Buchel’s 

body, and to conceal his death from the police, had not been formulated. But 

by the jury’s verdict you joined the conspiracy to pervert the course of justice 

by avoiding any police detection of his body. By your conduct thereafter, if not 

by express words, you agreed to play your part in achieving the object of that 

conspiracy.  I  do  not  accept  for  a  moment  that  you  were  motivated  solely  by 

fear of Quye. That is disproved by the fact that on the Sunday you voluntarily 

contacted him by phone, asking him to call you, and you voluntarily associated 

with him on 29th March as the covert surveillance demonstrates. I shall return 

to this. I observe, however, that it would have been very easy for you to have 

made an anonymous phone call to the police to report or even hint that a man 

had died at the flat. That would at least have ensured that those you knew to 

be  responsible  for  Neill  Buchel’s  death  would  be  apprehended,  and  his  body 

preserved. 

 

Within  half  an  hour  of  Quinn  leaving  the  flat  that  morning  you,  Chas  Quye, 

and  you,  Elvis  Kwiatkowski,  set  about  disposing  of  Neill  Buchel’s  body.  You 

first tried to contact an old friend, Colin Bushaway, who you hoped would be 

able to take the body away in his van. You were both active in trying to contact 

him by phone, calling and texting him. When Bushaway came to the flat next 

day, Saturday 15th March, and refused to help, you turned instead to Bradley 

Andison. 

 

 

5
--------
Disposing  of  the  body  intact  would  have been bad enough. What makes this 

part  of  your  offending  so  much  more  serious,  Chas  Quye    and  Elvis 

Kwiatkowski,  is  the  way  in  which  you  desecrated  Neill  Buchel’s  body  by 

dismembering it. On your own evidence to the jury, Chas Quye , the two of you 

methodically cut and sawed up the body into ten pieces. This, in my judgment, 

was  for  the  sole  purpose  of  maximising  the  chances  of  the  body  never  being 

found  once  it  was  dumped.  The  anguish  that  this  final  indignity  has  caused 

Neill Buchel’s family is summed up in his mother’s statement: “Not only did 

they  kill  my  son,  but  the  awfulness  of  knowing  they  ruthlessly  chopped  his 

body into pieces, this child who I had loved, watched grow from a baby into a 

man,  whole  in  body  and  soul,  the  absolute  horror  of  this  is  indescribable. 

What  they  saw,  what  they  touched  and  handled,  what  they  desecrated  so 

callously, was a living human being, worthy of respect even after death”. 

 

I do not propose to dwell on the detail of how the two of you dismembered the 

body. Suffice it to say that it must have been a considered decision by both of 

you, and it was a long drawn out and strenuous business, taking several hours. 

No  doubt  you  gave  yourselves  Dutch  courage  to  do  it  by  consuming  large 

quantities  of  alcohol  but  you  were  fully  in  possession  of  your  senses.  The 

evidence  of  Professor  Black,  the  bone  expert,  confirms  your  evidence,  Chas 

Quye, that an attempt was made to remove the jaw from the head, hence the 

stray saw cuts to the jaw, and you admitted that your intention was to smash 

the teeth so there could be no dental identification, although you abandoned 

this attempt. You told the jury, Chas Quye, that you had no choice but to act as 

you  did  in  dismembering  the  body.  That  suggestion  is  as  outrageous  as  it  is 

offensive.  

 

What  makes  matters  even  worse  in  your  case,  Chas  Quye,  is  that  on  the 

Saturday  afternoon,  around  the  time  you  were  dismembering  the  body,  and 

despite  the  alcohol,  you  were  exchanging  texts  with  Neill  Buchel’s  daughter 

Megan.  Throughout  the  weekend  you  were  in  contact  with  her,  and  on  the 

Sunday with Neill Buchel’s mother as well, pretending to be concerned for his 

welfare and offering your help to try and find what had become of him. You 

even descended to the depths of making calls to Neill Buchel’s phone to lay the 

 

6
--------
ground for the pretence later on, should it be necessary, that you still believed 

at that time that he was alive, and that you were trying to contact him.  

 

You, Elvis Kwiatkowski, played a full part in this gruesome dismemberment. 

Having seen Quye give evidence, however, I am satisfied that he was the more 

dominant personality of the two of you, and that he took the lead in deciding 

what must be done with the body. You must have been involved with the clean 

up,  or  at  least  with  its  initial  stages,  before  you  returned  to  Royston  on  the 

Monday. The only mitigation in your case  is  that  you  played  no  further  part 

after  that  and  that  you  at  least  pleaded  guilty  to  count  2  before  the  trial 

started, if only minutes before the jury were sworn.  

 

In  your  case,  Scott  Hunt,  I  am  unable  to  conclude  with  certainty  that  you 

participated in the dismemberment of the body, and do not sentence you on 

the basis that you were physically involved in it. I am, however, quite certain 

that  you  were  well  aware  of  what  had  taken  place  and  played  your  part  in 

cleaning  up  Quye’s  flat,  as  you  let  slip  in  the  conversation  that  was  covertly 

recorded  in  the  probe  evidence.  That  was  a  two  day  clean-up,  probably  over 

the  weekend  the  body  was  dumped.  I  reject  as  wholly  implausible  the 

suggestion that you knew nothing of the circumstances of Neill Buchel’s death. 

I am also quite satisfied on all the evidence that you were in regular contact 

with  Quye  over  that  weekend.  You  were  together  on  the  Friday  afternoon  at 

around 4 o’clock when the two of you visited the shop. Your suggestion that 

this came about when you had gone round to Quye’s flat and called out to him 

from the street was plainly untrue and did not even accord with Quye’s own 

evidence. It was an invention to avoid admitting that you had been into his flat 

that afternoon when the body was there to be seen. 

 

 It is also an aggravating factor that you as well, Scott Hunt, went through the 

pretence  of  calling  Neill  Buchel’s  own  phone  that  Friday  afternoon.  It  is 

significant,  in  my  judgement,  that  you  renewed  phone  contact  with  Quye  at 

lunchtime on the Sunday, by which time Bradley Andison had already driven 

over to the flat and made the first trip to the lake. At 14.39 that afternoon you 

and  Quye  were  together  at  the  shop  again,  buying  alcohol.  It  beggars  belief 

 

7
--------
that  you  would  not  have  discussed  the  progress  that  had  been  made  in  the 

attempt to dispose of Neill Buchel’s body. At 15.54 you were on the phone to 

Quye.  At  19.05  on  the  Sunday  evening  you  called  Quye  for  nearly  three 

minutes. That was only 10 minutes before the start of the evening journey to 

the lake in Andison’s vehicle. I accept that you were not present  at and took 

no  part  in  the  deposition  of  the  body  in  the  lake  that  evening.  You  were  on 

your  phone  for  half  an  hour  at  precisely  that  time,  trying  to  sort  out  your 

contract.  But  I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  you  were  fully  aware  of  what 

was going on and fully approving of it. It is also an aggravating factor that at 

15.19  that  Sunday  afternoon,  when  you  and  Quye  must  have  been  together, 

you  were  again  trying  to  cover  your  tracks  by  sending  text  messages  to  the 

dead man’s phone to lay a false trail that you both thought Neill Buchel was 

still alive, You told the jury you loved Neill Buchel, and that you were as close 

as  that.  Those  were  hollow  words  in  view  of  your  involvement  in  this 

conspiracy.  

 

You, Bradley Andison, had the sense to plead guilty to count 2, well in advance 

of the trial. There was an overwhelming case against you, of course, because 

Neill Buchel’s blood was found in your vehicle and there was no conceivable 

innocent  explanation  for  this.  Moreover  the  CCTV  evidence  pin-pointed 

almost  every  move  of  your  vehicle  on  the  Sunday,  to  and  from  the  lake.  I 

strongly suspect, but cannot be sure, that you knew from the start what was 

being asked of you when Quye first contacted you and you agreed to help. You 

certainly  knew  when  you  first  arrived  at  the  flat  that  Sunday  that  you  were 

being asked to move a body, and it must have been explained to you that this 

was the body of someone who had met an unnatural death in which Quye and 

Kwiatkowski were involved. You knew, therefore, that you were taking part in 

a plan to prevent the police discovering the evidence of what had happened to 

Neill Buchel and to prevent the police from bringing his killers to book. 

 

On your version of events, and Chas Quye’s version in his evidence to the jury, 

there were two separate trips to the lake, one in the morning and one in the 

evening. I seriously doubt whether the  three  of  you  would  have  been  foolish 

enough  or  brazen  enough  to  dump    any  of  the  body  parts  in  the  lake  at  11 

 

8
--------
o’clock  on  a  Sunday  morning,  when  anglers  were  bound  to  be  fishing  in  the 

lake, rather than under the cover of darkness in the evening when the lake was 

likely  to  be  deserted.  But  the  very  fact  that  you  were  prepared,  on  your  own 

version  of  events,  to  return  to  the  flat  later  that  day,  in  order  to  dispose  of 

further body parts, travelling again all the way from Kent, demonstrates all too 

clearly  the  extent  to  which  you  were  willing  to  involve  yourself  in  this  very 

serious conspiracy, and to do so willingly and not under any threat or duress.  

 

You, Chas Quye, and you, Scott Hunt, thought that you had got away with it 

when the body had been dumped and the flat had been cleaned of all traces of 

the murder. Both of you made false witness statements to the police on 20th 

March, once the missing person investigation began. In your two statements, 

Scott  Hunt,  you  kept  up  the  pretence  that  you  had  seen  nothing  of  Neill 

Buchel since the Thursday afternoon on The Green . You, Chas Quye, claimed 

you had last seen Neill Buchel on the Thursday evening in your flat, and that 

by the time you woke up next morning he had left the flat and you had no idea 

where he had gone.  In the same way you both kept up a cruel pretence with 

Neill  Buchel’s  family,  to  the  effect  that  neither  of  you  had  seen  Neill  Buchel 

since the Thursday when he was alive and well.  

 

 You, Alan Quinn, continued to stay in touch with Quye, despite your assertion 

that you were terrified of him. Your part in the conspiracy was to agree not to 

say  anything  to  anyone  about  seeing  Neill  Buchel’s  dead  body  in  the  flat,  or 

how  he  had  died.  In  law  there  was  no  positive  duty  on  you  to  report  to  the 

police  what  you  had  seen,  but  your  involvement  in  the  conspiracy  went  far 

beyond that. When in due course you were seen by the police in June you put 

into practice what you had always agreed to do, and that was to say nothing of 

the true circumstances surrounding Neill Buchel’s disappearance. You made a 

thoroughly  dishonest  witness  statement.  On  29th  March,  within  a  day  of 

Quye’s  release  from  custody  following  his  initial  arrest  on  suspicion  of 

murder, you were quite voluntarily associating with him again. The evidence 

of the probe confirmed that you were offering him hospitality at your mother’s 

home. You were speaking of your undying loyalty to him as a friend, not just 

in  his  presence  but  in  conversation  with  Amber  Ayres  when  he  was  not 

 

9
--------
present. You joined in the pretence that Neill Buchel was still alive. You knew 

or  strongly  suspected  that  the  flat  was  bugged  and  I  am  quite  sure  that  this 

pretence  was  for  the  benefit  of  the  police  you  knew  would  be  listening.  You 

were doing this in order to help out your friend Quye and, to a lesser extent, 

Hunt. It is significant that you arrived with Hunt at the flat that day. Had it 

not been for the fact that you were eventually arrested yourself, in August, you 

would never have told the police about what you had seen at the flat that night 

and about the body you had seen the following morning.  

 

Quye and Kwiatkowski 

I deal first with you, Chas Quye and Elvis Kwiatkowski. You are both 36 years 

old. Parliament has decreed that for a murder in circumstances such as these 

the starting point for the minimum term you must serve is 15 years. I have to 

consider  whether  there  are  aggravating  or  mitigating  factors  which  make  it 

appropriate to depart from that starting point.  

 

There  are  several  aggravating  factors,  some  of  which  are  to  be  found  in 

paragraph  10  of  the  schedule,  some  of  which  are  more  general  aggravating 

factors to be found in guidance applicable to serious offences of violence.  This 

was a joint attack, of great brutality and ferocity, against a man who was quite 

unable to defend himself, although there are signs he attempted to do so. You 

were  both  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  and  drugs.  You  showed  him  no 

mercy.  He  was  stamped  on  and  kicked.  Such  use  of  a  shod  foot  is  to  be 

equated with the use of a weapon. He was vulnerable, for the reasons I have 

already explained, even if not because of age or disability such as to amount to 

a statutory aggravating factor. From the ferocity of the attack  and the extent 

to  which  he    clearly  attempted  to  defend  himself,  it  is  to  be  inferred  that  he  

must have endured severe physical suffering before death. That is a statutory 

aggravating factor. Whilst there may not have been an abuse of a position of 

trust  in  the  sense  envisaged  in  the  statutory  aggravating  factors,  you,  Chas 

Quye, had promised Neill Buchel’s daughter that evening that you would look 

after him when she asked you to do so. That was because you recognised how 

vulnerable he was that night. Within a short time you had grievously broken 

that  promise  by  abusing  him  in  the  way  I  have  outlined,  including  on  your 

 

10
--------
account  striking  him  forcefully  to  the  head  with  a  can  of  beer  to  cause  that 

serious head wound. Within a matter of hours from making that promise you 

had  taken  part  in  his  murder.  All  these  aggravating  factors    in  themselves 

justify a significant increase in the starting point for both of you. 

 

The  most  serious  aggravating  factor,  however,  is  the  concealment  and 

dismemberment of the body. It is common ground that the appropriate way to 

reflect  this  aggravating  factor  is  to  add  substantially  to  the  minimum  term, 

commensurate with the determinate sentence that count 2 would merit on its 

own in the case of each of you.  

 

In  relation  to  count  2,  I  have  considered  carefully  a  number  of  authorities 

which  have  been  cited  by  counsel,  including  in  particular  Godward  (1998), 

Skinner  (1993),  Swindell  (1981,)  Lang  (2002)    Downey  (1994)  and  Stretch 

(2014). As was said by the Lord Chief Justice in Godward, where the intention 

is  to  obstruct  the  course  of  justice  by  disposing  of  or  concealing  a  body, 

making it difficult or impossible for the prosecuting authority to bring home a 

charge  against  the  defendant,  then  a  sentence  at  the  top  end  of  the 

appropriate range is called for. And as was said by the Lord Chief Justice in 

Downey, in such a case a deterrent sentence is called for. 

 

Here the conspiracy was to pervert the course of justice in relation to the most 

serious offence of all, murder. Had the body parts all sunk to the bottom of the 

lake and remained there, as you hoped, it might never have been possible to 

bring you to justice.  

 

This was as bad a case of its kind as it is possible to imagine. In my judgement 

the  appropriate  determinate  sentence  for  each  of  you,  following  a  trial  on 

count  2,  would  have  been  9  years  imprisonment.  You  each  pleaded  guilty, 

albeit  it  at  a  very  late  stage.  Nevertheless,  those  guilty  pleas  did  have  a 

significant impact on the trial. I therefore propose, for each of you, to make a 

modest reduction of 1 year. The appropriate concurrent sentence on count 2 

would therefore be 8 years imprisonment. But the additional criminality from 

this aggravating factor alone will be reflected in an appropriate increase in the 

 

11
--------
minimum term by half that figure, an increase of 4 years in the minimum term 

being the equivalent of an 8 years determinate sentence.  

 

As for mitigating factors, there is in my judgment, only very limited mitigation 

in  the  fact  that  there  was  here  an  intent  only  to  cause  grievous  bodily  harm 

rather than to kill. The relentless ferocity and persistence of the attack, with 

the use of a shod foot as a weapon, makes it one of those cases where there is, 

in  my  judgment,  no  justification  for  any  significant  reduction.  Similarly, 

although  the  murder  itself  was  not  premeditated,  that  lack  of  premeditation 

counts  for  comparatively  little  in  this  case  bearing  in  mind  the  build  up  of 

abuse, aggression and violence in the earlier part of the evening. This case is to 

be  distinguished,  for  example,  from  a  sudden  and  spontaneous  explosion  of 

violence during an incident in the street. 

.  

 

After the most careful consideration I see no reason to make any distinction 

between the two of you. I take into account that each of you has little against 

him by way of previous offending, and certainly not in the recent past. I take 

into  account  the  matters  of  personal  mitigation  that  have  been  advanced  on 

behalf of each of you. In particular, Elvis Kwiatkowski, I take into account the 

progress you have made in prison, and the remorse expressed in the letter you 

have written to me. 

 

 Balancing  all  the  aggravating  and  mitigating  factors,  in  my  judgment  the 

appropriate minimum term that each of you must serve is 21 years.  

 

Stand up, Chas Quye, On count 1, I sentence you to life imprisonment. You 

will  serve  a  minimum  term  of  21  years,  less  the  347  days  you  have  already 

served on remand or whatever the correct figure proves to be. When you have 

served that period in custody it will be for the parole board to decide whether, 

and  if  so  when,  you  should  be  released,  and  if  released  you  will  remain  on 

licence for the rest of your life. On count 2 there will be a concurrent sentence 

of 8 years imprisonment.

Scott Hunt 

Scott  Hunt,  you  are  41  years  of  age.  As  I  have  already  made  clear,  I  do  not 

sentence you on the basis that you were physically involved in dismembering 

the body of Neill Buchel. However, I have no doubt that you were fully aware 

that his body had been dismembered, and I have no doubt  that you knew or 

believed that he had died in Quye’s flat as a result of foul play. Such was your 

relationship with Quye that it is quite inconceivable, in my judgement, that he 

would have been able to keep the truth from you. You helped with the two day 

clean-up,  and  that  in    must  have  taken  place,  or  begun,  over  the  weekend 

when the body was dumped. I am sure that you knew full well that the plan 

was to dump the body parts in the lake. There was no need for more than two 

people to accompany Bradley Andison on the journey on either occasion. For 

the reasons I have already explained in reciting the history of the offences, I 

am sure that you were well aware of what was going on and fully assented to 

it.  You  were  doing  everything  you  could  to  protect  your  friend  Quye,  and  to 

prevent  the  finger  of  suspicion  falling  upon  him,  and  indeed  upon  you.  You 

lied to the police in your two witness statements. In making phone calls and 

sending a text to a man you knew full well to be dead you laid the ground for a 

false story that you believed Neill Buchel still to be alive.  

 

Your culpability is considerably less than that of Quye and Kwiatkowski, but it 

is still a very serious offence that you have committed, and all in relation to a 

man you claimed was someone you loved.  I  accept  that  you  feel  remorse  for 

his  death,  and  your  failure  to  prevent  it.  Although  you  have  a  serious 

conviction for supplying drugs, it was a long time ago. You have done a great 

deal whilst in prison on remand to address your alcohol and drug addictions, 

 

13
--------
and  you  have  an  excellent  prison  report.    There  is  of  course  no  credit  for  a 

guilty plea. 

 

Taking all these matters into account the sentence on count 2 in your case is 5 

years’ imprisonment.  

 

Bradley Andison  

Bradley Andison, you are 47 years of age. Your involvement in this conspiracy 

was short lived and very specific, but it was absolutely vital. Kwiatkowski and 

Quye had already failed to persuade Bushaway to help them dump the body of 

the man they had killed. You were perfectly willing to do so. It may well have 

been out of loyalty to Quye, who was your half brother, but I am satisfied that 

you  knew  perfectly  well    not  only  that  it  was    a  body    you  were  helping  to 

dump, but also that it was a body which had been dismembered, hence  (on 

your account) the need for a second trip. If as I suspect, and contrary to your 

account,  the  body  parts  were  taken  to  the  lake  all  in  one  go  on  the  Sunday 

night, they would have had to be taken in several parcels. In that event again 

you would have been bound to realise that the body had been dismembered. 

You must have known or believed that the man whose body you were helping 

to dump had met a violent death, otherwise there would be no reason for the 

others not to have reported his death to the police. You must have known the 

purpose of dumping his body in the lake was to prevent it ever being found, 

and  to  prevent the police from bringing  his killers to justice. These all make 

your involvement in the offence very serious.  

 

 On  the  positive  side,  you  pleaded  guilty.  You  did  not  do  so  at  the  first 

opportunity but you did so early enough to avoid the need for the trial to be 

prepared with you still as a defendant. Had you pleaded guilty at the plea and 

case management hearing, you would have been entitled to credit of 25%. In 

my judgment the appropriate level of credit in your case is 20%. Although you 

have  some  convictions  many  years  ago,  I  ignore  them  for  present  purposes. 

Since  then  you  have  led  an  industrious  life,  doing  well  in  your  trade.  I  also 

bear  in  mind  the  progress  that  you  have  made  whilst  in  custody  and  the 

attempts  you  have  made  to  improve  yourself  and  to  give  something  back  to 

 

14
--------
society. Taking all those matters into account, had you been convicted after a 

trial  the  sentence  would  have  been  5  years  imprisonment.  You  will  receive 

credit of one fifth for your guilty plea. I sentence you to 4 years imprisonment. 

You will serve half in custody and you will remain on licence for the remainder 

of your sentence following your release.  

Alan Quinn 

Alan Quinn, you are 28 years old. You do not have the mitigation of a guilty 

plea but you did at least tell the police eventually and in frank terms what you 

say happened in the flat that night. In particular you told them what you saw 

of  the  body  the  next  morning.  It  is  a  great  pity  you  did  not  have  the  moral 

courage to speak out at the start, if only by making an anonymous call to the 

police.  Instead,  on  the  jury’s  verdict,  you  willingly  agreed  to  become  part  of 

this conspiracy to avoid any police detection of Neill Buchel’s body. I do not 

accept  that  you  joined  the  conspiracy  only  through  fear.  As  I  have  already 

spelt out in reciting the history, the very fact that you remained in contact with 

Quye,  by  phone  and  by  going  to  his  flat  on  29th  March,  shows  where  your 

loyalties  lay.  On  29th  March  you  went  along  with  the  pretence  that  Neill 

Buchel was still alive, in order to put the police off the scent. You were doing 

your  utmost  to  help  your  friend  Chas  Quye.  I  bear  in  mind  that  the  false 

witness  statement  you  made  to  the  police  was  outside  the  period  of  the 

conspiracy and that the statement was made when the defendants had already 

been charged. To that extent it did not hamper the police enquiry. However, 

the making of that false statement was the merely culmination and the natural 

consequence  of  your  agreement,  as  part  of  the  conspiracy,  not  to  reveal 

anything  to  the  police  if  you  were  asked  questions.  Had  it  not  been  for  your 

own arrest in August I am quite sure you would have remained silent. 

 

You  have  been  remanded  in  custody  since  the  end  of  the  trial.  I  take  into 

account  the  positive  side  of  your  character,  although  you  have  had  regular 

brushes with the law. I take into account the efforts you have made to address 

your addictions to alcohol and drugs. You are fortunate to have the support of 

your partner and your parents here at court. I have read the references from 

other members of your family, and your own letter to the Buchel family which 

I  accept  was  well  intended.  It  is  a  shame  your  remorse  could  not  have  been 

 

15
--------
reflected in a guilty plea. Even in your case, however, this remains a serious 

offence for which a substantial custodial sentence is inevitable.  

 

For  this  offence  of  conspiracy  to  pervert  the  course  of  public  justice  the 

sentence  in  your  case  is  3  years  imprisonment.  You  will  serve  18  months  of 

that sentence in custody and will remain on licence for the remainder of the 

sentence,  and  you  will  be  liable  to  be  recalled  to  serve  the  balance  if  you 

breach the terms of your licence or you commit any further offence.

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Popplewell 

 

 

R v Justin Robertson & Ben Carr 

 

Winchester Crown Court 

 

21st April 2015 

Pennie Davis was newly married for only three months when she 
was stabbed to death as she tended her horses in a field in the New 
Forest last September.  It was a brutal attack in which at least 10 
blows were struck. 

It was a contract killing.  Justin Robertson, aged 36, was the killer.  

Ben Carr, aged 22, recruited him to carry out the murder.   

Ben Carr was incensed at facebook messages which she had posted 
two weeks before the killing, in which she threatened to revive 
allegations first made when she was the partner of Ben Carr’s father 
in 2006.  Ben Carr was then aged 14 and living in the family unit 
with his father and Pennie and her five younger daughters.  At that 
time Pennie Davis accused Ben Carr sexually assaulting two of her 
daughters, then aged 10 and 12.   Those allegations were never 
investigated.  For the purposes of sentencing I proceed on the 
assumption that they were unfounded.  They had made Ben Carr 
bitter for many years and their revival last summer determined him 
to silence Pennie Davis for ever.   

The very same day that the facebook messages were sent, Ben Carr 
approached Justin Robertson, whom he knew because they were 
both Class A drug dealers.  Justin Robertson is a career criminal 
with a string of convictions for theft and burglaries.  Ben Carr was to 
pay him £1,500.  He persuaded Justin Robertson to kill her not just 
by paying him money, but by a perversion of the allegations Pennie 
Davis had made.  Ben Carr told Justin Robertson that she was a 
paedophile, a nonce in Justin Robertson’s vocabulary, which Ben 
Carr knew would push a button with Justin Robertson because he
--------
6. 

hated nonces with a passion.  In their twisted minds this was a 
justification for killing. 

Over the next two weeks Ben Carr and Justin Robertson carefully 
planned the killing.  In the week before hand there were several 
meetings a day, some in the early hours of the morning, and many 
communications by phone.  Reconnaissance was carried out on her, 
which included Justin Robertson following her on at least two 
occasions to the field where she died.  They chose it as the location 
for the murder because of its remoteness and her vulnerability. 

 
 
Justin Robertson  
 

7. 

The sentence which I am required by law to impose upon you for 
the murder of Pennie Davis is one of life imprisonment.  I have to 
determine the minimum term of imprisonment which you will serve 
before being eligible to apply to the Parole Board to be considered 
for release. 

This case falls under paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 21 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 2003 because the seriousness of the offence is 
particularly high.  It was a murder for gain.  The starting point is 30 
years. 

In your case there are the following aggravating features: 

i.  This was a carefully prepared, planned and premeditated 

murder. 

ii.  You targeted a helpless woman alone in a field in a 

remote location. 

iii.  The stabbing was brutal and ferocious, causing no doubt 

terror and physical suffering before she died. 

iv.  You have shown no remorse. 
v.  Your conduct in the witness box was deplorable.  You 

were arrogant and offensive.  You addressed your victim’s 
family in the public gallery in a way bound to increase 
their distress.  You openly made threats to kill Ben Carr.  
It was a disgusting and misguided attempt at bravado.   

There are no mitigating features.  

You also fall to be sentenced for another offence for which you were 
on bail when you carried out this murder.  You pleaded guilty to 
handling stolen goods which were the product of a night time 
burglary of a florists shop in Gloucestershire in August 2013.  The 
goods in question were greetings cards, picture frames and bunches 
of roses.  Giving full credit for your guilty plea and taking into 
account your record, I will impose a custodial term for that offence 
which will run concurrently with the sentence for the murder.   

 
8. 

9. 

 

 

 
10. 
 
11.
--------
Taking all these matters into account: 
 
The sentence of the Court for the murder is Life 
Imprisonment, with a minimum term to be served of 32 
years, less 217 days to reflect the period you have spent on 
remand awaiting trial.   
 
On the handling charge I impose a concurrent sentence of 4 
months imprisonment  
 
The statutory charges apply.

You have been convicted of conspiracy to murder.  I am satisfied 
from the circumstances of this offence that you are dangerous: you 
pose a significant risk of causing serious harm by committing 
further specified offences.   

Your part in this murder was no less culpable than that of JR 
although you did not deliver the fatal blows yourself.  It was your 
plan, for your ends, and I am satisfied that you were an equal 
partner in planning its execution. 

In accordance with s. 225 Criminal Justice Act 2003, the 
seriousness of the offence justifies the imposition of a life sentence.   

I am required by law to determine the minimum term of 
imprisonment which you will serve before being eligible to apply to 
the Parole Board to be considered for release.  In doing so I have 
regard to terms of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, 
although they do not directly apply.  In this case it is appropriate 
that the same considerations should apply to you as would apply if 
you had carried out the killing yourself.  Your share of the blame is 
no less than that of Justin Robertson.   

In your case there are the same aggravating features I have already 
identified for Justin Robertson, save for that relating to his conduct 
in the witness box. 

There is one mitigating factor in your case which is your youth.  Its 
force is tempered by the fact that although you are only 22, you are 
already a hardened criminal dealing high purity cocaine.     

Taking all these matters into account:
--------
The sentence of the Court is Life Imprisonment, with a 
minimum term to be served of 30 years less 178 days to 
reflect the period you have spent on remand awaiting trial.   
 
The statutory charge applies.

The evidence in R v Chapman, Gaffney and Panton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
As is well known, in 1993 Jon Venables and another young person were convicted of 
 
the murder of Jamie Bulger.  In due course he was released on licence for that offence 
 
under a new identity.  That identity was protected by various orders of the court.  In 
 
early 2010 he was recalled to prison in relation to further offences.  In March 2010 
 
Venables was held at HMP Woodhill.

One of the officers at HMP Woodhill was the first appellant in the first appeal, Scott 
Chapman, who had been employed there from 2003.  Between then and 20 June 2011 
 
Scott Chapman provided information about  Venables to the newspapers.  It  was his 
 
case  and  his  evidence  that  at  first  he  did  so  because  he  believed  Venables  was 
receiving what he saw as special treatment which he believed to be wrong, unfair and 
 
contrary to the ethos of the prison.  However  he  accepted that  in the course of the 
period  in which  he  supplied  information to  newspapers,  his  motivation  changed  to 
 
that of obtaining money, particularly after he had lost his job at HMP Woodhill on 6 
 
April  2011.  He  had  obtained  more  than £40,000.  Nonetheless  he  contended  that, 
  
although what he had done was wrong, it was not so wrong as to amount to a crime. 
 
The prosecution case was that he had deliberately exploited his public office for gain. 

 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

  

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 

 
  

 
The  money  that  was  paid  by  the  newspapers  was  paid  to  the  bank  account  of  the 
 
second appellant, Lynn Gaffney.  Scott Chapman had had a relationship with her for 
  
many years; their  son had been born in 1997.  He remained close  friends with her. 
 
That was not in dispute.  It was Scott Chapman’s account that at first he did not tell 
 
her the truth as to where the money was coming from but later he had said he told her 
that he was selling stories to newspapers which he had made up.  Although the money 
 
was in her bank account he considered that the money was his.  Her evidence was that 
 
when she saw the cheques were coming from News International, she asked him why 
 
he was being paid.  He told her that he had been making up stories and selling them. 
 
The prosecution case was that she knew that her bank account was being used because 
 
of the seriousness of the misconduct he was committing in breach of his duties as a 
 
prison officer.

One  of  the  journalists  to  whom  the  information  had  been  provided  was  the  third

journalist.  It was the prosecution case against her that she had obtained information

from Scott Chapman which resulted in two articles about  Venables and for which a 
payment of £1,250 had been made.  It was her evidence and case that Scott Chapman 
 
had been referred to her in 2010 by the newsdesk when he telephoned the newspaper. 
  
 
He had been referred to as “Adam” and was an anonymous tipster.  He was not the 
 
only anonymous source with information about Venables; she had published several 
stories  but  “Adam”  was  the  source  of  only  two.  He  told  her  that  he  had  sold 
 
information to The Sun.  She found him on the system with the payment  details for 
 
  
Lynn Gaffney; she could see from the system that he was a tried and trusted source. 
Her evidence was that it was not her practice to cause public officials to be paid for 
 
  
stories; any  decision to make a payment was for the legal managers and the editors. 
 
 
It was not her practice to ask for identification where the source was anonymous.  She 
did not know he was a prison officer.  She had sent an e-mail where she referred to 
having seen the source’s Woodhill pass and wage slip; her case was that she probably 
made that  up  in order  to  ensure that  her  story was  not  “pulled”.  There was also  a 
 
  
 
reference by her in an e-mail to a “prison tipster” but that did not necessarily mean a 
 
prison officer.  She believed that the story was in the public interest. 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

She was charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office on the basis 
 
 
she  had  entered  into  an  agreement  which  would  involve  Scott  Chapman  who  she

As is also well-known, HRH Prince Harry was an officer in the Blues and Royals of 
 
the  Household  Cavalry  Mounted  Regiment  in  2006-7.  There  was  intense  press 
 
interest in any stories about him. 
  

 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

   

 
 

 
  

Paul Brunt  was a Lance Corporal in the same Regiment.  He provided  information 
about  Prince  Harry to  The News of  the  World  between April 2006  and November 
 
2007  in  return  for  payments.  There  was  evidence  that  all  members  of  the  armed 
forces were instructed not to talk to the media without permission; this instruction was 
 
reinforced  when  the  Royal  Princes  joined  the  regiment.  Paul  Brunt  did  not  give 
 
 
evidence, but his account in his interview (when he chose not to be represented by a 
lawyer) was that  he had provided the information for money.  The prosecution case 
 
was that he had abused his position as a soldier and received from The News of the 
 
World  and  The Sun  (to whom he had also provided information) a total of £16,000.

touch with Paul Brunt, telling him that there was someone with a potential story.  He 
rang back.  He was told his name was Steve and he might have a story.  He kept in 
 
touch and some weeks went by before he provided information about the Prince horse 
 
   
riding.  In the course of his dealings, Paul Brunt passed him a story with pictures of a 
 
soldier in his regiment with KKK dress and swastika symbols.  He accepted that he 
learnt that Paul Brunt was a serving soldier and that Paul Brunt had been paid.  The 
 
jury were provided with an e-mail in which Ryan Sabey asked if he could pay £1,500 
in cash instead of paying it into his bank account as Paul Brunt had said his position 
could be jeopardised if the army ever asked to see his bank accounts.  That payments 
 
was made in cash.  His evidence was that many much more senior people in the paper 
 
 
had  known  he  was  receiving  stories  from  a  serving  soldier  and  he  had  made  the 
 
payments.  It was the prosecution case that he encouraged Paul Brunt to provide the 
information,  knowing  that  Paul  Brunt  was  not  allowed  to  provide  it.  Ryan  Sabey 
 
contended that looked at overall the stories were in the public interest.

They were tried at the Central Criminal Court also before HH Judge Wide QC and a 
 
jury on 19 February 2015;  both were convicted.  Sabey seeks  leave to  appeal on a 
 
single ground – the direction of the judge in respect of aiding and abetting.  We grant 
 
leave.  At the time of the hearing, the time for Paul Brunt to seek leave to appeal had

The issues.

Four issues arose on the first appeal.  The second appeal involved the first and second 
 
issues only: 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
i)	 

 

Was the judge’s direction in respect of the threshold required for misconduct 
 
in public office correct? 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ii)	  Was the judge’s direction in respect of the mens rea of Lynn Gaffney/ Ryan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Sabey as aiders and abettors correct? 
 

 
 

 

 

 

iii)	  What  was  the  mens  rea  required  to  convict  Lucy  Panton  in  relation  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
count of conspiracy? 
 

 
 

 

 

 

Did the judge’s response to a jury note in R v Chapman amount to a material 
 
irregularity affecting the safety of the conviction? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
iv)	 

 

(1)	  Was the judge’s direction in respect of the threshold required for misconduct in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public office correct? 
 

 

 

(a)	 
 

The elements of the offence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17.	  Misconduct  in public office is, as we have said,  an ancient  common law offence; it 
 
can be traced back to the thirteenth century, though the development  of the present 
 
offence only began in 1783 in the judgment of Lord Mansfield CJ in R v Bembridge 
 
(1783) 3 Doug 327.  The most recent formulation of the elements of the offence was

set  out  in  the  judgment  of  this  court  (Pill  LJ,  Hughes  and  Aikens  JJ)  in  Attorney 
General’s Reference (No. 3 of 2003)  [2004] 2 Cr App R 23, [2005] QB 73.  After the 
 
acquittal of four police officers in a trial involving a death in custody, the Attorney 
 
 
General sought the opinion of the court on the question: “What are the ingredients of 
the  common  law  offence  of  misconduct  in  public  office?”  The  Court  after  an 
extensive review of the authorities answered the question at paragraph 61 by stating it 
 
comprised four elements: 
 

 
  
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

A public officer acting as such 
 

 

 

 

 

wilfully neglects to perform his duty and/or wilfully misconducts himself 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  such a degree as to  amount  to  an abuse of the public’s trust  in the office 
 
holder 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without reasonable excuse or justification.

The  element  in  issue  on  the  applications  before  us  was  the  third  element  –  the 
 
 
threshold test for the misconduct to be sufficiently serious to amount to an abuse of 
the public’s trust in the office holder.  In the court’s examination of the authorities on 
this element it relied in particular on the decisions in R v Dytham (1979) 69 Crim App 
 
R 722 (Lord Widgery CJ,  Shaw  LJ  and McNeill  J)  and Shum  Kwok Sher [2002]  5 
 
 
HKFAR 381 (Final Court  of Appeal,  Hong Kong,  where the leading  judgment  was 
given  by  Sir  Anthony  Mason).  Its  conclusion  in  respect  of  the  third  element  was 
 
expressed at paragraphs 56-8: 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

“56.  …  There  must  be  a  serious  departure  from  proper 
 
standards  before  the  criminal  offence  is  committed;  and  a 
 
departure not  merely negligent  but  amounting to an affront  to 
 
the standing of the public office held.  The threshold is a high 
one requiring conduct  so  far  below acceptable standards as to 
amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder. 
  
A mistake, even a serious one, will not suffice. The motive with 
 
which  a  public  officer  acts  may  be  relevant  to  the  decision 
whether the public’s trust is abused by the conduct

interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

58  …  The  conduct  cannot  be  considered  in  a  vacuum:  the 
 
 
consequences likely to flow from it, viewed subjectively as in R 
 
v G will often influence the decision as to whether the conduct 
 
amounted  to  an  abuse  of  the  public’s  trust  in  the  officer  … 
 
 
There will be some conduct which possess the criminal quality 
 
even  if  serious  consequences  are  unlikely,  but  it  is  always 
necessary to assess the conduct in the circumstances in which it 
 
occurs.” (emphasis added) 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the light of the modern restatement of the law it is not necessary to refer to earlier 
 
 
cases as it was not suggested before us that the formulation in AG Reference No 3 of

2003 was in any way inaccurate.  What was in issue was whether the way in which 
the judge set out this element of the offence accorded with the law as so formulated. 
  
 
 
It is, as was submitted to us, therefore helpful briefly to refer to that issue as raised in 
   
Dytham and Shum Kwok Sher. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

In Dytham a police officer was charged with the offence in circumstances in which he 
 
had  witnessed  a  very  serious  attack  on  an  individual  who  died,  but  had  failed  to 
 
 
intervene;  this  was  not  an  allegation  of  nonfeasance,  but  of  deliberate  failure  and 
wilful neglect.  The judge ruled that the offence was one known to the law and the 
 
officer was convicted.  On appeal, the court said: 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

This involves an element of culpability which is not restricted 
to corruption or dishonesty but which must be of such a degree 
 
that the misconduct is calculated to injure the public interest 
 
so  as  to  call  for  condemnation  and  punishment.  Whether 
 
 
such a situation is revealed by the evidence  is a matter that  a 
jury has  to  decide.  It  puts  no  heavier  burden upon them than 
when in more familiar contexts they are called upon to decide 
 
 
whether  driving  is dangerous or  a publication is  obscene or  a 
place of public resort is a disorderly house. (emphasis added) 
 

   
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  Shum  Kwok  Sher  a  senior  government  officer  had  used  his  position  to  provide 
 
 
preferential  treatment  to  a  company and  its  directors to  whom  he  was  related.  Sir 
Anthony Mason observed  that  the passage  in the  judgment  of Lord  Widgery CJ to 
which we  have  referred  was  not  the  language  of  definition.  He  went  on to  say at 
 
paragraphs 77 and 78: 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Read  in  context,  the  words  suggest  that  his  Lordship  was 
endeavouring to  convey the  idea that  the conduct  complained 
 
of must be injurious to the public interest and of a sufficiently 
serious  nature  to  warrant  conviction  and  punishment.  The 
 
linkage  his  Lordship  makes  with  the  idea  of  culpability 
reinforces this view of his lordship’s purpose. In this respect, it 
 
 
 
is  to  be  noted  that  Lord  Widgery  employs  the  concept  of 
culpability to  embrace  two  different  matters,  namely  first  the 
 
absence  of  reasonable  excuse  and  justification  and  secondly 
that the conduct  complained of may not  involve corruption or 
 
dishonesty but must be of a sufficiently serious nature. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The second point  is that there was no clear previous authority 
 
 
for the proposition that, in any category of case of misconduct 
 
in public office the prosecution must prove to the satisfaction of 
 
a  jury,  as  elements  of  the  offence,  that  the  conduct  of  the 
 
defendant was calculated to injure the public interest so as 
 
to call for condemnation and punishment” (emphasis added)

20.	 

 
21.	 

 
(b)	 

 

 

 

 
22.	  We  turn  therefore  to  consider  whether  the  direction  given  by  the  judge  accurately 
reflected  the  third  element  of  abuse  in  the  public’s  trust  in  the  office  holder  as 
 
outlined in these cases.

R v Chapman & Ors; R v Sabey 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
23.	 

 
24.	 

 
25.	 

The judge directed the jury, orally and in his route to verdict, as follows: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Are you sure that Mr Chapman’s misconduct was so serious as 
 
to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in him as the holder 
 
 
of public office and that Mr Chapman has no reasonable excuse 
or justification for selling the stories.” 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This direction set out together and in a single sentence the third and fourth elements 
 
identified in Attorney General’s Reference No3 of 2003.  He then went on to amplify 
 
that  by  a  further  direction  which  he  recorded  in  his  route  to  verdict  in  a  footnote 
 
(footnote 3) which read:

the 
 

importance 
 

“There must have been a serious, blameworthy departure from 
 
proper standards amounting to an affront to the standing of the 
 
 
public office held. Have regard to all the circumstances as you 
 
find  them  to  have  been  including  (what  follows  is  not 
exhaustive) the responsibilities entrusted to Mr Chapman as an 
 
 
office  holder, 
 
the  public  of  his 
 
 
 
responsibilities,  the  nature  and  extent  of  his  departure  from 
 
those  responsibilities  and  his  motivation  for  doing  so  (for 
 
 
example, to try to right a perceived wrong/making money), the 
 
nature  of  the  information  sold  by  him,  his  perception  of  the 
 
 
potential and actual consequences of his  misconduct  and how 
that  misconduct  was  viewed  by  him  and  others.  Consider 
 
whether the information he provided was information which the 
 
 
public  really  ought  to  have  known  but  was  being  kept  from 
them  and  what,  if  any  alternative  means  of  addressing  any 
wrong reasonably perceived by him was available to him. Bear 
 
in mind that  for the members of the public to be interested in 
 
certain facts is not necessarily the same as it being in the public 
 
interest for those facts to be published.” 
 

   
 

 
 
 

   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The direction given in respect of Paul Brunt was the same.  In that case the jury asked 
 
 
a question: 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According  to  law,  can  the  seriousness  of  the  misconduct  be 
 
determined by the nature of the misconduct alone or can it/must 
 
 
 
it depend on the seriousness of the information imparted? 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The judge answered it by saying that they had to take into account both but they also 
 
 
had to take into account all the circumstances set out in his direction at footnote 3.

At the trial each of the appellants invited the judge to give a direction that the test for 
 
   
establishing criminal misconduct was a high one.  They contend that the omission of a 
reference to the threshold being a high one, requiring conduct so far below acceptable 
 
standards as to  amount  to  an abuse of public trust  in the office holder  should  have 
 
 
been used.  It was submitted that the judge should have made it clear that the conduct 
 
was so serious that it required punishment through the criminal courts.

It was also submitted on behalf of Lynn Gaffney, as part of the argument in relation to 
 
her  position as an accessory,  that  the standard of  misconduct  was  not  to  be  judged 
 
objectively, but that the prosecution had to prove that the office holder  intended his 
 
 
conduct  to  be  so  serious  as  to  cross  the  threshold.  We  consider  this  argument  at 
 
paragraphs 47 and following below as it arose solely in that context.  For the reasons 
we give it  is for the jury to decide whether, on the information known to the office 
 
holder,  the  conduct  crossed  the  threshold.  It  is  not  necessary to  establish  that  the 
 
   
office holder intended to cross the threshold. 
 

 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Our approach 
  

 

 

 

 

 

28.	  We were referred to the direction given by Fulford J (as he then was) in a similar case 
 
involving a police officer’s provision of information to a newspaper which was heard 
 
 
in  January  2013. 
 
In  it  that  judge  said  in  relation  to  the  third  element  that  the 
   
 
 
prosecution must establish that: 
 

 
   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“What  the  defendant  did  was  “wrong”,  in  the  sense  that  her 
 
actions were an abuse of the public’s trust in her position as a 
 
 
police officer and what she said during the telephone call to the 
News of the World … substantially fell below the standards that 
 
the public are entitled to expect of police officers, particularly 
at  a  senior  level.  It  must  involve  wrongdoing,  therefore,  that 
 
 
harms the public interest  and is sufficiently serious to merit  a 
 
criminal conviction in the context of this trial. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  represent  the  public  in  this  trial  and  it  is  for  you  to  say 
 
 
whether the defendant’s actions were wrong and constituted an 
abuse  of the  public’s  trust  in the  sense  I  have  just  described. 
 
However,  the  defendant’s  actions  clearly  must  have  been 
 
graver  than  a  simple  and  straight  forward  mistake  or  an 
understandable error of judgment even a serious one. Instead it 
 
must  constitute  an  abuse  of  the  public’s  trust  in  this  senior 
 
police officer.” 
 

 
 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29.	  We were given no explanation why the judge was not helped by the provision to him 
 
of this direction.  Prosecuting counsel had not been made aware of it.  This is without 
 
doubt a difficult area of the criminal law.  An ancient common law offence is being 
 
used in circumstances where it has rarely before been applied.  The judge was entitled 
to far more help by the prosecution than he was given.

It is clear, in our judgment, that no exact form of words is necessary to direct the jury 
 
 
as  to  what  is  required  by the  third  element  - misconduct  of  such  a  degree  that  it 
amounts to a breach of the public’s trust in the office holder.  However any direction 
must  take  into  account  the  context  in  which  the  misconduct  has  occurred.  In this 
 
 
appeal two points arise in the context of information being supplied by office holders 
to the media. 
 

 
     
 

 
 
 

  
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

First,  the  judge  had  to  make  clear  that  the  necessary misconduct  was  not  simply a 
 
 
breach of duty or breach of trust.  The judge directed the jury in respect of the first 
two elements identified in  Attorney General Reference No 3 that they had to be sure 
 
 
there was wilful misconduct, that is to say a deliberate breach of duty.  In the context

of both trials, as there was overwhelming evidence that the prison officer and soldier 
had acted in breach and neglect  of their duties and had done so deliberately,  it  was 
 
therefore  necessary when turning to the third element to make clear in the direction to 
the jury that the misconduct must be more than a breach or neglect of duty or breach 
of trust; as was observed in R v Borron 106 ER 72, (1820) 3 B & Ald, to condemn 
anyone who had fallen into error or made a mistake, belonged only to the law of a 
 
despotic state.  Although the  judge  did  not  make  this expressly clear  (and  it  might 
 
 
have been better if he had), we are in no doubt that it was clear from the direction read 
as a whole that misconduct at the level of breach of duty, neglect of duty or breach of 
 
 
trust was insufficient to satisfy the third element. 
 

 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second it was necessary in our view to explain to the jury how they should approach 
determining  whether  the  necessary  threshold  of  conduct  was  so  serious  that  it 
 
amounted  to  an abuse  of the  public’s  trust  in the  office  holder.  Each of the  cases 
 
refers (as we have indicated in the emphasis we have given to the citations) to that 
 
 
level  as  being  one  where  it  is  calculated  to  injure,  that  is  to  say  has  the  effect  of 
injuring, the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment. 
  

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Again context is important in determining how the jury should be directed - the wilful 
 
misconduct of the office holder involved in the provision of information to the media. 
  
In a democratic society the media carry out an important role in making information 
 
available to the public when it  is  in the public  interest  to  do so,  not  simply (as the 
 
judge pointed out) because the public may be interested in it.  Those employed by the 
state in public office will generally be  in breach of the duty owed by them to their 
 
employers  or  commanding  officers  by  providing  unauthorised  information  to  the 
 
 
press.  However, information is sometimes provided by such persons in breach of that 
duty where the provider of that information may benefit the public interest rather than 
harm it.  The provision of the information may well in such a case be an abuse of trust 
 
by the office holder to his employer or commanding officer, even if the disclosure of 
 
 
the information may be in the public interest.  It may therefore result in disciplinary 
action  and  dismissal  of  the  officer  holder.  That  is  because  the  abuse  of  the  trust 
 
reposed  in the office  holder  by the  employer/commanding officer  in such a case  is 
 
viewed  through  the  prism  of  the  relationship  between  the  office  holder  and  his 
 
 
employer or commanding officer.  That is not the prism through which a jury should 
approach the issue of the abuse of the public’s trust in an office holder. 
 

 
   
 

 
  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

The offence requires, as the third element, that the misconduct must be so serious as 
 
 
to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder.  It is not in our view 
sufficient simply to tell the jury that the conduct must be so serious as to amount to an 
 
abuse  of  the  public’s  trust  in  the  office  holder,  as  such  a  direction  gives  them  no 
 
assistance on how to determine that level of seriousness.  There are, we consider, two 
ways  that  the  jury  might  be  assisted  in  determining  whether  the  misconduct  is  so 
 
serious.  The first is to refer the jury to the need for them to reach a judgment that the 
 
 
misconduct is worthy of condemnation and punishment.  The second is to refer them 
 
to the requirement that the misconduct must be judged by them as having the effect of 
harming the public interest.  The direction adopted by Fulford J encompassed both of 
 
 
these. 

 
 
 
 

 
   

 
  
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
In the argument before us, the emphasis was on the failure of the judge to refer to the 
conduct  being  of  such  seriousness  as  to  require  condemnation  as  criminal  and 
 
 
punishment.  We  were  referred  to  the  type  of  direction  given  in  gross  negligence

manslaughter where the court makes clear that simple negligence is not enough; the 
level of conduct must be criminal.  It is not necessary for us to consider the decisions 
 
in  R  v  Adomako  [1995]  1  AC  171  or  R  v  Misra  [2005]  1  Cr  App  R  21  and  the 
 
   
difficulties that arise if a jury is told that the conduct must be so bad as to amount to a 
 
criminal  act.  We  do  not  think  that  it  was  necessary  in  relation  to  the  offence  of 
misconduct  in  public  office  to  tell  the  jury  that  they  must  decide  if  conduct  must 
 
amount to criminal conduct.  It is not, as we read the decisions, required and it has the 
 
 
dangers of circularity.  It is, in our view, sufficient if the judge tells the jury that the 
  
threshold is a high one. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

   
 

 
  
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

36.	  We therefore turn to examine the second way in which the standard of seriousness can 
 
be judged - by reference to the harm to the public interest.  In our view, in the context 
of provision of information to the media and thus the public, that is the way in which 
the  jury  should  judge  the  seriousness  of  the  misconduct  in  determining  whether  it 
 
 
amounts to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder.  The jury must, in our 
 
view,  judge the misconduct  by considering objectively whether the provision of the 
information  by  the  office  holder  in  deliberate  breach  of  his  duty  had  the  effect  of 
 
harming the public interest.  If it did not, then although there may have been a breach 
 
 
or indeed an abuse of trust by the office holder vis a vis his employers or commanding 
officer, there was no abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder as the misconduct 
 
had not had the effect of harming the public interest.  No criminal offence would have 
 
 
been committed.  In the context of a case involving the media and the ability to report 
 
information provided in breach of duty and in breach of trust by a public officer, the 
harm  to  the  public  interest  is  in  our  view  the  major  determinant  in  establishing 
 
whether the conduct can amount to an abuse of the public’s trust and thus a criminal 
 
 
offence.  For  example,  the  public  interest  can  be  sufficiently  harmed  if  either  the 
information disclosed itself damages the public interest (as may be the case in a leak 
 
of budget information) or the manner in which the information is provided or obtained 
 
damages the public interest (as may be the case if the public office holder is paid to 
provide the information in breach of duty).

The judge did not direct expressly direct the jury in these terms.  He referred to the 
 
conduct being so serious as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the prison 
 
 
officer  and the soldier.  Did that  sufficiently make clear,  in the context  with which 
these cases were concerned, the issue as to the public interest? 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

The  provision  of  information  which  had  the  effect  of  harming  the  public  interest 
 
would have been very properly viewed as an abuse of the public’s trust in the prison 
officer/soldier as an office holder so as to amount to the necessary serious degree of 
 
misconduct.  But the simple use of the term “an abuse of the public’s trust in him as 
 
 
the holder of a public office” is simply conclusory.  It does not explain to the jury how 
to determine whether the conduct was of a sufficient level of seriousness.  Their task 
was to determine the level of seriousness by reference to whether the misconduct had 
 
the effect of harming the public interest.  Does the footnote achieve this? 
 

  
   
 

 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

  

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  footnote  refers  to  the  circumstances  which  the  jury  must  take  into  account  as 
 
extending to include whether the information was information the public really ought 
 
 
to have known, if there were alternative means of addressing the wrong and the nature 
 
of the public interest.  It did not directly ask the jury to determine whether the conduct 
had the effect of harming the public interest as a step in deciding whether the conduct

As the third ingredient of the offence was a central element of the case against Scott 
 
Chapman, Lynn Gaffney and Lucy Chapman and as it was not properly explained to 
the jury, there was a material misdirection.  We have no doubt that it was open to the 
 
jury,  in  a  case  where  the  information  itself  might  not  be  said  to  harm  the  public 
 
 
interest,  to  conclude  that  the  manner  in  which  the  information  was  provided  for 
payment would be of a sufficient level of seriousness to harm the public interest.

have set in the knowledge (a) that Scott Chapman was being paid for information and 
 
(b) that Scott Chapman’s activity amounted to wilful misconduct.  The allegation in 
Ryan Sabey’s trial was that he had assisted and encouraged Paul Brunt as the holder

Although  the  nature  of  the  participation  of  these  two  appellants  was  different,  the 
 
directions given to the jury in the route to verdicts in the different trials in relation to 
what had to be proved against them were very similar.  The judge first made it clear to 
 
the jury in each case that Lynn Gaffney and Ryan Sabey only could be convicted if 
the principal offender – whether Scott Chapman or Paul Brunt –were to be convicted. 
  
The  routes  to  verdict  then  set  out  the  questions  to  be  answered  in  relation  to  the 
 
 
principal offender.  Only after answering those questions against the interests of the 
  
principal was the jury required to consider the case of Lynn Gaffney or Ryan Sabey. 
The routes to verdict document in the case of Ryan Sabey was as set out below.  That 
 
relating to  Lynn Gaffney differed  in relation to the  nature of the  assistance  said to 
 
have been given by her.  This is of no consequence to the issues in these appeals and 
 
 
 
it has not been raised as an issue for our consideration.

Paragraph 5 was subject to two footnotes. 

 

 

 

 

 
i) 

 
ii)	 

  
The first concerned the word “wilful”.  The explanatory footnote read: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Deliberate,  being aware of his duty not  to  conduct  himself in 
   
the way that he did.” 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The second related to the word “misconduct”.  The explanatory footnote was 
  
as follows: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“i.e. that he breached a duty, of which he was aware, not to 
 
sell  information/photographs to  newspapers.  The existence 
 
 
of that  duty and his awareness of it  need not  derive from a 
  
specific regulation.” 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
As  we  have  observed,  these  two  questions  related  essentially  to  their  respective 
  
knowledge that  Scott  Chapman/Paul Brunt  were in deliberate breach of their duties. 
 
They did not relate to the seriousness of the misconduct. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The element relating to the seriousness of the misconduct was dealt with in question 6 
 
and the footnote at the conclusion of paragraph 6 which added to and explained the 
contents of that paragraph.  It referred back to the lengthy footnote direction given in 
 
 
relation to the principal in respect of what has been termed the threshold as set out by 
  
us at paragraph 23 and then added: 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
“but note you may take into account only those circumstances 
 
of which you are sure Ryan Sabey (Lynn Gaffney) was aware.” 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
During the course of their retirement the jury in the trial of Scott Chapman and others 
 
asked if they should interpret the question as meaning: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
“Did  Lynn  Gaffney  believe  that  Scott  Chapman’s  conduct 
 
crossed a criminal threshold.” 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The jury was given the answer “No”.

Both Lynn Gaffney and Ryan Sabey argued that the directions given were deficient in 
that  they  did  not  require  the  jury  to  find  that  each  knew  or  intended  that  the 
 
misconduct of the holder of the public office should be so serious as to amount to an 
 
abuse  of the  public’s  trust  in the  office  holder.  They  submit  that  this  omission  is 
 
contrary to the test of mens rea for an aider and abettor as expressed in Lord Goddard 
 
CJ in Johnson v Youden [1950] KB 544: 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Before a person can  be  convicted of aiding  and  abetting the 
 
 
commission of an offence, he must at least know the essential 
 
 
matters which constitute that offence”. 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

The first submission made on behalf of Lynn Gaffney was that anyone charged with 
the offence of misconduct  in public office whether as a principal or as an accessory 
 
must intend the misconduct to be so serious as to cross the threshold and amount to a 
   
 
breach of the public’s trust in the holder of the public office.  It is to be noted that this 
 
was not a submission made by Scott Chapman, the principal in her case.  It was not 
supported  by Ryan Sabey,  the  other  defendant  in the  position of aider  and  abettor. 
  
Indeed  the  written  submissions  made  at  trial  on  behalf  of  Ryan  Sabey  were  to 
 
precisely  the  opposite  effect  in  relation  to  the  principal.  The  submission  finds  no 
direct support in any reported authority on the elements of the offence of misconduct 
 
in  a  public  office.  In  the  perfected  grounds  of  appeal  lodged  on  behalf  of  Lynn 
Gaffney, it is said that “the starting point is clearly the words of the statute”.  Section 
 
1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977 then is cited.  Since that is the statutory provision 
relating to the offence of conspiracy, this is of no assistance. 
   

 
 
 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

The prosecution submission was that, for the holder of a public office to be convicted 
 
of misconduct in a public office, he must know of the facts and circumstances which 
would lead the right-thinking member of the public to conclude that the misconduct 
 
was such as is required by the third element set out in Attorney General’s Reference 
 
No 3 of 2003.  However,  it  was not  necessary for the prosecution to prove that  the 
 
holder of the public office himself reached that conclusion.  It was sufficient to prove 
 
that  he  had  the  means  of  knowledge  available  to  him  to  make  the  necessary 
 
assessment of the seriousness of his misconduct; the assessment was for the jury. 
 

   
 

 
 
  

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49.	  We agree with that submission.  In R v Rimmington [2006] 1 Cr App R 17 the House 
 
of Lords considered the mental element in relation to the offence of public nuisance. 
  
At paragraph 39 Lord Bingham of Cornhill said: 
 

  
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
   

The  argument  in  this  appeal  was  very  largely directed  to  the 
 
issue of mens rea: what state of mind must be proved against a 
   
defendant  to  convict  him  of  causing  a  public  nuisance?  The 
 
Crown contended that the correct test was that laid down by the 
 
Court of Appeal in R. v Shorrock [1994] Q.B. 279, 289, that the 
 
defendant  is  responsible  for  a  nuisance  which  he  knew,  or 
 
 
ought  to  have  known (because the  means of knowledge  were 
available to him), would be the consequence of what he did or 
 
omitted to do. That  was a test  clearly satisfied on the facts of 
 
 
that case, where the defendant deliberately permitted use of his 
 
field and should have known what  the result  would be. It is a 
test  satisfied,  I  think,  in  all  the  public  nuisance  authorities 
 
 
considered  above,  save  those  based  on  vicarious  liability

(which are hard to reconcile with the modern approach to that 
subject in cases potentially involving the severest penalties, and 
 
may well be explained, as Mellor J. did in R v Stephens (1866) 
 
LR  1  Q.B.  702,  708–709,  by  the  civil  colour  of  the 
 
 
 
proceedings). I would accept this as the correct test, but it is a 
test to be applied to the correct facts.

Public nuisance involves (inter alia) endangering the life, health, property or comfort 
 
of the public or obstructing the public in the exercise of common rights.  A defendant 
 
will be guilty of public  nuisance  if  he ought  to have known (because the  means of 
 
knowledge  were  available  to  him)  of  the  consequences  of  his  actions.  Similar 
 
considerations apply to the holder of a public office who engages in misconduct.

The second submission made by Lynn Gaffney was that, whatever the relevant mental 
element  for the principal, an aider and abettor must  have actual knowledge that  the 
 
 
misconduct was or would be so serious that it amounted to criminal misconduct as we 
  
have discussed under the first issue.  This submission was supported by Ryan Sabey. 
 
 
It was argued on his behalf that “the essential matters which constitute (the) offence” 
as  per  Johnson  v  Youden  included  the  fact  that  the  misconduct  as  assisted  and 
 
 
encouraged  by  the  aider  and  abettor  would  cross  that  threshold.  To  reflect  that 
 
 
proposition Mr Pownall QC in oral argument  offered this formulation of the proper 
direction on the mental element: 
 

 
   

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Are  we  sure  that,  by  the  ordinary  standards  of  reasonable 
 
 
people,  what  was  done  amounted  to  misconduct  in  a  public 
office so serious as to amount to a breach of public trust in the 
 
office holder? 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If  yes,  are  we  sure  that  Ryan  Sabey  must  have  realised  that 
 
what he assisted and encouraged was by the ordinary standards 
 
of reasonable people misconduct in a public office so serious as 
 
to amount to a breach of public trust in the office holder? 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

As well as arguing that this formulation was necessary because of the requirement of 
 
 
knowledge of “the essential matters which constitute (the) offence”, Mr Pownall QC 
 
submitted that there was a clear distinction to be drawn between the position of the 
principal and the aider and abettor because the offence in relation to the principal was 
 
one  of  strict  liability.  Finally  it  was  said  on  behalf  of  Ryan Sabey  that,  if  actual 
 
knowledge on his part of the fact of the breach of public trust were not required, there 
 
 
would be a lack of legal certainty as to his liability. 
 

 
   
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The prosecution accept  that Johnson v Youden accurately sets out the state of mind 
 
 
required of an aider and abettor.  However, they argued that  “the essential matters” 
did not include knowledge of how right thinking members of the public would regard 
the conduct.  That was not a matter which had to be proved in relation to the principal. 
  
 
The principal must know that he had a duty not to conduct himself in the way that he 
 
did  and  he  must  deliberately  breach  that  duty.  He  did  not  need  to  know  that  his 
deliberate breach of duty would be so serious as to amount to the conduct required in 
the third element of Attorney General’s Reference No3 of 2003.  Reliance was placed

the person who is assisting is guilty of aiding and abetting that

The prosecution contended that the offence of misconduct in a public office was not 
 
 
an offence of strict liability.  The misconduct had to be wilful in the sense explained 
 
in  the  routes  to  verdict  i.e.  the  office  holder  must  act  deliberately and  he  must  be 
aware of his duty not to conduct himself in the way that he did.  Moreover, he must 
 
act without justification.  Whilst he did not have to intend or foresee that the level of 
 
   
misconduct must be so serious as to amount to the criminal offence, there remained a 
significant mental element in the offence for the principal. 
 

 
 
  

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 

   

 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
   
 

55.	  We agree that misconduct in a public office is plainly not an offence of strict liability 
 
 
for the reasons identified above.  Thus, this does not provide a basis for an enhanced 
mental element on the part of the aider and abettor.  We also consider that there is no 
 
more lack of legal certainty for an aider and abettor if he is not required to know that 
 
 
the misconduct will be so serious as to amount to the criminal offence of misconduct 
 
in public office than there is for the principal in respect of whom, as Mr Pownall QC 
accepts, no such knowledge is required.  We conclude that, just as the principal does 
 
not  need to  know or  intend  that  the consequence  of all of the  facts of which he  is 
 
 
aware  will  be  so  serious  as  to  amount  to  the  third  element  of  the  offence  of 
misconduct  in  public  office,  the  aider  and  abettor  does  not  have  to  have  such 
knowledge or intent.  “The essential matters” which he must know are those set out in 
 
the routes to verdict: encouraging and/or assisting the principal in particular conduct; 
 
that  conduct  amounting  to  wilful  misconduct  i.e.  deliberate  breach  of  a  duty  as  a 
public office holder; the circumstances which resulted in the conduct being so serious 
 
as  to  amount  to  the  third  element  of  the  offence.  Due  to  the  requirement  of 
 
knowledge on the part of the aider and abettor of the essential matters, the routes to 
verdict in relation to Lynn Gaffney and Ryan Sabey required the jury to be sure as to 
the circumstances of which they were aware.  In assessing whether  the  misconduct 
 
aided and abetted by them was so serious as to amount to the third element, the jury 
 
 
were prohibited from taking into account matters not known to Lynn Gaffney and/or 
Ryan Sabey.  That was sufficient to ensure that they were not convicted other than on 
the basis of “the essential matters” known to them.  As Mr Christopher QC put it in 
relation to Ryan Sabey, it had to be shown he knew all of the facts and he encouraged 
 
Paul Brunt to do what he did in the light of that knowledge.

of under two years a little over £40,000 was paid into two bank accounts in her 
name,  the  payments  clearly  coming  from  various  newspapers.  There  was 
 
documentary and other evidence to show that much of the money coming into 
 
her accounts was paid over to Scott Chapman.

Ryan Sabey was a Royal reporter at the News of the World.  He knew that Paul 
 
Brunt  was  a  serving  soldier.  He  knew  that  Paul  Brunt’s  position  would  be 
 
 
compromised  if  it  became  known  that  he  was  providing  information  to  the 
News  of the  World  yet  he  continued  to  encourage  him  (and  to  pay him)  to 
provide the stories to which we have referred.  It  is against  that  background 
 
that  the  jury  in  each  case  were  considering  the  circumstances  as  known  to 
Lynn Gaffney and Ryan Sabey respectively.

aware?

It is also against that background that we must consider a subsidiary complaint raised 
by Mr  Pownall QC about  the footnote to paragraph 6 of the route to verdict.  This 
 
 
required the  jury to take into  account  only those  circumstances of which they were 
sure Ryan Sabey was aware.  Mr Pownall QC argued that this meant that Ryan Sabey 
had to  prove to the criminal standard circumstances on which  he wished to  rely to 
 
suggest that there would not have been.  It is not clear whether this issue was raised at 
   
trial. 

   
 

 
  
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58.	  Mr Christopher QC on behalf of the prosecution could not recall it being raised but he 
 
 
took no point on it only being raised before us if that were the position.  It is also not 
 
clear which were the circumstances on which Ryan Sabey wished to rely to suggest 
that  assessment  thereof would have militated against  a conclusion that there was an 
abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder.  Whatever the position we accept the 
 
 
answer to this complaint is as given by Mr Christopher QC.  By the time that the jury 
came  to  consider  the  footnote to  paragraph 6,  they had  convicted Paul Brunt.  The 
 
footnote in reality was  concerned only with  issues pointing to  guilt.  The direction 
 
would not have led to the jury applying the criminal standard of proof to exculpatory 
 
matters.

The  particulars  of  the  charge  of  conspiracy  against  Lucy  Panton  to  commit 
 
misconduct  in public office, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act  1977 
 
(“the 1977 Act”)  were that: 
  

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“between  the  5  April  and  11  September  2010  she  conspired 
 
together with Mr. Chapman, Ms. Gaffney and a third person to 
commit misconduct in public office.” 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

As we have said, Scott Chapman and Lynn Gaffney were not charged with conspiring 
 
but  with the substantive offence.  We asked Mr  Rees QC why a conspiracy charge 
 
 
was preferred against Lucy Panton.  He explained that conspiracy was used initially 
for Lynn Gaffney as well and, to avoid further changes to the indictment, conspiracy 
 
as regards Lucy Panton was continued with to trial.  It was for the same reason that

she was not charged with aiding and abetting in the same way Ryan Sabey had been 
charged.  It would have been much simpler if she had, for the additional complexities 
 
of a conspiracy count should if possible be avoided.

Section 1(1) and 1(2) of the 1977 Act  provide as follows: 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“The offence of conspiracy 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
(1) Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Act, 
if  a  person  agrees  with  any  other  person  or  persons  that  a 
 
 
course of conduct  shall be pursued which,  if the agreement  is 
 
carried out in accordance with their intentions, either— 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

(a) will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of any 
 
offence  or  offences  by  one  or  more  of  the  parties  to  the 
 
agreement, or

knowledge  on  the  part  of  the  person  committing  it  of  any 
particular fact or circumstance necessary for the commission of 
 
the  offence,  a  person  shall  nevertheless  not  be  guilty  of 
 
 
conspiracy to  commit  that  offence  by virtue of subsection (1) 
above unless he and at  least  one other party to the agreement 
 
intend or know that that fact or circumstance shall or will exist 
 
at the time when the conduct constituting the offence is to take 
 
 
place."" 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
62.	 

 

 

 

 

In his route to verdict, the judge directed the jury that if the prosecution against Scott 
 
Chapman  failed,  it  could  not  succeed  against  the  other  defendants.  As  to  Lucy 
 
Panton, the jury had to be sure about four matters: 
 

 
   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

(1) Are we sure that Ms. Panton agreed with Mr. Chapman and 
 
 
 
that  Mr.  Chapman  provided  information  for  payment  for 
 
inclusion in a newspaper, intending that he would do so? 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) Are we sure that  Ms.  Panton knew,  when she did so, that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chapman was a public official? 
 

   

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

(3) Are we sure that,  when she did so,  Ms.  Panton knew that 
 
Mr.  Chapman’s  selling  the  information  to  newspapers 
 
amounted to wilful misconduct by him? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

(4) Are we sure that, in the circumstances of which Ms. Panton 
 
was aware, Mr. Chapman’s misconduct was so serious as to 
 
amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in him as the holder 
of public office and for which he had no reasonable excuse 
 
 
or justification?

As  regards  (4),  the  judge  referred  the  jury  back  to  his  explanation  of  the 
circumstances to which the jury could have regard in relation to Chapman as set out 
 
earlier at paragraph 23 above and added: 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
“but note you may take into account only those circumstances 
of  which  you  are  sure  Ms.  Panton  was  aware.  When 
considering  Ms.  Panton’s  awareness  of  Mr.  Chapman’s 
 
 
motivation  and  whether  he,  Mr.  Chapman,  had  reasonable 
excuse or justification for selling the information, bear in mind 
 
 
that this question is not concerned with Ms. Panton’s opinion as 
 
 
 
a journalist of whether publication of the information would be 
 
in the public interest.” 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

Before the judge and before us, Mr Butterfield QC contended that in relation to issue 
 
 
(4), the seriousness threshold,  the  jury should  have  been directed that  Lucy Panton 
 
had  to  intend  or  know  that  Scott  Chapman’s  conduct  would  meet  the  requisite 
threshold.  In other words, Lucy Panton’s mens rea had to extend to the four elements 
 
of the offence identified by this court in Attorney General’s Reference No. 3 of 2003 
 
 
as we have set out at paragraph 17 above,  including the seriousness threshold.  The 
judge  was  wrong  in  his  direction  that  the  seriousness  threshold  as  regards  Lucy 
Panton was simply an objective test for the jury, albeit that they had to approach the 
 
matter through the prism of the circumstances of which Ms Panton was aware. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
 
In Mr Butterfield QC’s submissions both sections 1(1) and 1(2) of the 1977 Act lead 
to  this  result.  Section 1(1)  required  an  agreement  and  a  true  agreement  could  not 
 
 
 
cover  something  which  was  unknown  at  the  time  i.e.  that  the  jury  would  decide 
 
whether the threshold test of seriousness is met.  To avoid that, what was required was 
that the conspirator intended or knew that the misconduct was so serious as to meet 
 
 
the threshold.  Mr Butterfield invoked R v Saik [2007] 1 AC 18 in support. 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

  
 

 
 
In his submission s.1(2) also drove that result.  The threshold test of seriousness was 
in  the  statutory  language  a  “particular  fact  or  circumstances  necessary  for  the 
 
 
commission of the offence” and the sub-section demanded that  there be  no  liability 
 
 
unless at least one of the conspirators intended or knew that it would exist at the time 
the conduct took place.  Even if the threshold test was not part of the mens rea for the 
 
public official, it had to be for the journalist.  Mr Butterfield called in support Smith 
 
and Hogan’s Criminal Law, by Professor David Ormerod, 13th edition 2011, pp 442­
3,  that  in  appropriate  circumstances  the  mens  rea  required  for  conspirators  should 
 
 
rightly be in excess of that required for the substantive offence. 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
67.	  Mr  Butterfield QC contended that  we should approach the  matter  with legal policy 
 
firmly in mind.  That legal policy was to adopt an interpretation which favoured the 
defendant  in  criminal  matters,  especially  when  the  prosecutor’s  approach  would 
 
criminalise the activities  of  journalists  acting as  part  of a  free  press.  Although we 
 
accept  this  proposition,  we  note  that  legal  policy  could  also  be  said  to  be  to  put 
 
roadblocks  in  the  way  of  corrupting  public  officials  by  paying  them  to  provide 
 
information.  Moreover,  Mr  Butterfield  QC’s  interpretation  might  also  enable 
 
journalists  to  do  this  without  consequence  on  their  evidence  that,  given  the  public 
 
interest in the information being available, they did not believe that its disclosure was 
 
 
a sufficiently serious  breach of the public official’s duties  so  as to  satisfy the third 
element in  Attorney General’s Reference No3 of 2003.

In our judgment the judge was correct: to convict Lucy Panton the jury had to be sure 
first,  that  Scott  Chapman  was  guilty  of  the  substantive  offence  and  secondly,  that 
 
there was an agreement  between Scott  Chapman and Lucy Panton which,  if it  were 
 
 
carried  out  in  accordance  with  their  intentions,  would  necessarily  involve  Scott 
 
Chapman,  acting  as  a  public  official,  wilfully  breaching  his  duties.  The  mental 
element  on  Lucy  Panton's  part  was  in  the  making  of  the  agreement  and  intending 
Scott Chapman's wilful breach.  Moreover, that misconduct on his part had to be in 
 
circumstances known to Lucy Panton which, on an assessment  by the jury,  met  the 
threshold of seriousness.  In our view nothing in section 1(1) of the 1977 Act requires 
 
that the prosecution make the jury sure that, at the time of the agreement, Ms Panton 
 
 
knew or intended that Mr Chapman's misconduct would meet the requisite threshold 
 
 
of seriousness.  Nor does anything in R v Saik [2007] 1 AC 18. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
  

   

 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
   

As to s.1(2), ""fact or circumstance"" is not directed to the mens rea of an offence but to 
the elements of the actus reus: R v Saik [2007] 1 AC 18, [9], per Lord Nicholls.  We 
 
accept  Mr  Rees  QC’s  submission  that  the  elements  of  the  actus  reus  for  the 
 
commission of the offence in this context are that the individual in question is a public 
 
officer, acting as such; that the behaviour in question constitutes a wilful breach of his 
 
or  her  duties  as  such;  and  that  circumstances  surrounding  the  misconduct  are  such 
that, on assessment by the jury, it reaches the requisite degree of seriousness required 
 
as the third element of the offence.  Whether the misconduct meets the threshold of 
 
 
seriousness is not a fact or circumstance but an evaluative exercise by the jury.  As the 
judge noted, it involved the jury taking into account  matters Lucy Panton envisaged 
such  as  the  importance  to  the  public  of  Scott  Chapman’s  responsibilities,  his 
 
motivation and the nature of the information he was selling.  In our view, balancing 
 
such matters is far removed from a “fact on circumstance” and s.1(2) has no role.

The  jury  retired  on  3  November  2014.  They  continued  their  deliberations  on  4 
 
November.  That evening they were again sent home.  At about 5 p.m. that evening 
 
the judge received the following note from a juror: 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“The discussions within the jury room have become aggressive 
 
and the atmosphere is horrible. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
I went to speak and 2 other  jurors rolled their eyes and stated 
 
‘again’.  Another juror told them to stop being rude and voices 
 
were raised. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Additionally  a  particular  juror  keeps  insisting  we  go  with  a 
majority  vote,  despite  being  told  otherwise  repeatedly  by 
several jurors and our foreman.

whilst others were stating their points. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Please  be  aware  all  of  above  is  only  the  activity  of  2  jurors

you should elect a foreman to chair your discussions and act as 
 
your  spokesman  or  spokeswoman  when  you  come  back  to 
 
 
court.  Perhaps I should have added this in relation to the word 
  
discussions.  Discussion is not of course the same as argument. 
It is important to keep in mind that you are a jury of 12 and the 
 
 
collective  collaborative  nature  of  your  decision-making  is 
 
 
important.  This  involves  paying  collective  attention  to  the 
 
consideration  of  the  views  of  each  individual  member.  It  is 
also important  for your discussion to be focused and for them 
 
to keep them moving forward in relation to the issues you have 
 
 
to decide.  Finally this I also said to you just before you retired 
that your verdicts must each be unanimous and that remains the 
 
case unless I give your further direction.” 
 

   
 
 

 
   

 
 
 

   
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Immediately after he gave that direction, he received a note from another juror. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“I am being that. 
 

 

 

 
 
I am wasting oxygen!” 

 

 

That  note was not shown to counsel.  When the application for leave to appeal was 
 
 
made, an application was made for both notes to be disclosed. 
  

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After  considering  the  notes,  we  directed  they  should  be  disclosed.  After  hearing 
argument, we were satisfied, as the prosecution accepted, that they should have been 
 
 
disclosed as they showed that one juror was very concerned as to the way in which the 
deliberations  were  being  conducted.  The  non-disclosure  therefore  amounted  to  an 
 
irregularity. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  

However we are quite satisfied that the non-disclosure has no bearing on the safety of 
 
the conviction.  If the judge had provided the note to counsel, it  is possible that the 
 
judge might have refined his direction, but we are quite satisfied that the direction was 
 
 
more than sufficient a response to the note.

However, in the case of R v Chapman, each appellant contended on the first issue in

was a misdirection and considered very carefully whether it affected the safety of the 
 
 
conviction;  the  considerations  were  finely  balanced  given  the  great  care  the  judge

that the jury would necessarily have convicted these appellants had they been directed

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Spencer 

 

Central Criminal Court 

 

1st April 2015 

 

 

 

 

Viktoras  Bruzas,  I  have  to  sentence  you  for  two  brutal  murders  committed 

when you had broken into the home of your victims for the sole purpose, I am 

satisfied, of murdering one of them. For these grave offences there is only one 

sentence  prescribed  by  law:  life  imprisonment.  That  is  the  sentence  I  shall 

pass in due course. However, I am required to determine the minimum period 

you  should  serve  in  prison  before  you  are  even  eligible  to  be  considered  for 

release on parole.  

 

You  are  39  years  of  age.  You  have  no  previous  convictions.  You  are  a 

Lithuanian national. You came to this country in 1999, and you have proved 

yourself a skilled tradesman and builder, and made a good life for yourself and 

your family. 

 

Your victims were Patrick Kettyle, aged 55, and his wife Gillian Kettyle, aged 

54. They were a happily married couple. They lived with their 16 year old son 

at a house in Fetcham, in Surrey. It was a house you knew well because you 

had  worked  there  in  the  past.  You  had  also  previously  made  a  nuisance  of 

yourself there. Some years ago your ex-wife began working for Mr Kettyle as a 

freelance bookkeeper, assisting him in his business as a roofer and builder. It 

 

1
--------
was a perfectly innocent business relationship, although there was some light 

hearted  flirting  between  them.  But  you  got  it  into  your  head  that  they  were 

having  an  affair.  You  allowed  this  belief  to  fester  and  when  your  marriage 

ended  you  blamed  Patrick  Kettyle.  From  what  I  have  read  in  the  evidence 

before  me,  the  reality  is  probably  that  your  marriage  ended  because  of  your 

own violent and abusive conduct towards your ex-wife.  

 

 In September 2012 you visited  the Kettyles’ home at 6 o’clock one morning, 

the worse for drink, and made a scene, complaining that Mr Kettyle was trying 

to  take  your  wife  away  from  you.  It  seems  that  you  had  a  physical 

confrontation  with  Patrick  Kettyl  on  the  lawn.  The  incident  was  reported  to 

the police. Patrick Kettyle was sufficiently fearful of what you might do that in 

December 2012 he installed CCTV at his home and other security measures. In 

October  2013  you  sent  an  abusive  e-mail  to  Patrick  Kettyle  which  contained 

what can only be construed as a threat of violence. As a result you were visited 

by  the  police  in  January  2014  and  served  with  a  harassment  warning  letter. 

Such was the extent of your fixation with your wife’s infidelity that at that time 

you were complaining that your ex-wife had tried to poison you and had taken 

out  insurance  on  your  life  so  that  she and her new partner would be able to 

pay off their mortgage with the proceeds of the policy after your death. 

 

 It  is  plain  from  other  evidence  that  you  have  a  jealous,  controlling  and 

possessive nature when it comes to women. A later girlfriend whom you were 

dating  for  three  months  or  so  between  March  and  June  2014  says  in  her 

witness statement that you  even demanded a sick note  on one occasion when 

she  failed  to  show  up  for  a  date  with  you.  She  had  been  ill  with  suspected 

appendicitis.  You  became  convinced  that  she  was  seeing  other  men  and  she 

ended  the  relationship,  although  you  had  been  in  touch  with  her  on  the 

evening of the murders, wanting to see her again.  

 

That  night,  Wednesday  26th  November  2014,  you  drove  10  miles  to  the 

Kettyles’ home, broke into the house and murdered both your victims in cold 

blood. Their 16 year old son was in the house at the time. You even spoke to 

him. You had spent that night at home in Walton-on-Thames, in the company 

 

2
--------
of your flatmate and another friend. You had been talking about an argument 

you  had  had  the  previous  Sunday  with  your  ex-wife.  In  the  course  of  that 

Wednesday evening you drank two bottles of wine. Whether this was to give 

you  Dutch  courage  is  open  to  question.  It  seems  from  the  psychiatric  report 

that  this  had  become  your  normal  intake  for  an  evening.  But  whatever  the 

reason,  your  consumption  of  alcohol  that  night  affords  you  no  excuse  or 

mitigation whatsoever. Quite  the reverse. It is an aggravating factor. 

 

You went to the side gate of the house. You climbed onto some bins and then 

climbed  over  the  fence  into  the  rear  garden.  You  smashed  the  glass  in  the 

patio  doors,  entered  the  house  and  made  your  way  upstairs.  You  knew  the 

layout  of  the  house.  Patrick  and  Gillian  Kettyle  had  retired  to  bed  early,  at 

10.15pm  or  thereabouts.  Their  son  had  also  gone  to  bed,  in  the  adjoining 

bedroom.  He  was  awoken  by  the  sound  of  shouting  and  screaming  from  his 

parents’ bedroom. The time was now around 25 minutes past midnight. In all 

probability  your  victims  were  asleep  in  bed  when  you  began  to  attack  them. 

You were armed with a large kitchen knife. They were completely defenceless 

and in your power. You stabbed them both to death.  

 

It is impossible to say with certainty in what order any of the knife blows were 

struck.  What  is  clear  is  that  Patrick  Kettyle  put  up  a  spirited  defence  of 

himself,  and  no  doubt  of  his  wife  as  well.  The  deep  wounds  to  his  hand  and 

arms were defence injuries. The positioning of other stab wounds to his legs 

strongly suggests that he was curling himself into a ball for self-protection as 

he lay in bed, at least in the early stages of the attack. You stabbed him many 

times. There were stab wounds to the head, chest, back, both arms and both 

legs. The fatal wound entered the upper part of his chest below the collar bone 

and severed the jugular vein. There was another serious internal wound to the 

liver.  It  was  a  very  violent  and  sustained  assault.  One  of  the  stab  wounds 

fractured  a  rib.  The  force  you  used  was  so  great  that  the  blade  of  the  knife 

broke twice and the blade was recovered in separate locations in three pieces. 

The  bulk  of  the  blood  staining  on  the  knife  was  around  the  hilt,  a  further 

indication  of  how  deep  and  forceful  the  stabbings  were.  There  was  also    a 

 

3
--------
blunt  force  injury  to  his  head,  and  there  are  indications  that  you  may  have 

struck him over the head with a table lamp.  

 

You also stabbed Gillian Kettyle repeatedly, to the front and back of the body, 

to the back of the neck, to both arms and both legs. Again, some of the wounds 

to the arms appear to be defence wounds and the wounds to the legs may well 

have been because she too was curling herself into a ball in bed to avoid the 

attack.  A  stab  wound  through  her  right  breast  into  the  chest  penetrated  her 

right lung. A stab wound from the back through the chest penetrated the left 

lung,  diaphragm  and  liver.  These  were  the  fatal  injuries.  She  survived  long 

enough  to  shout,  bravely,  to  her  son  who  was  on  the  other  side  of  the  door, 

and to tell him to call the police.  

 

Having committed these dreadful murderous attacks you made your exit from 

the house. There was a trail of blood from an injury to your hand, caused when 

you  smashed  your  way  into  the  house.  Before  you  left  you  spoke  to  the 

Kettyles’ son through his bedroom door, telling him you had no issue with him 

or  with  his  mother,  but  that  his  father  had  ruined  your  life,  this  was  your 

revenge on him, and that you were not scared of prison. The boy was terrified. 

He  sat  behind  his  bedroom  door  holding  onto  the  door  handle  to  stop  you 

entering his room. You did not attempt to do so. 

 

From  the  sightings  on  the  CCTV  cameras  you  were  in  the  house  for  just  six 

minutes but in that short time you snuffed out two precious lives, and ruined 

the lives of many more people for ever. You climbed back over the fence at the 

front of the house and were caught leaving on the CCTV cameras. You made 

your escape, discarding the knife, which was recovered next day from a grass 

verge.  Within  three  minutes  of  receiving  the  999  call  the  police  were  at  the 

house. Everything that could have been done to save the lives of your victims 

was done, but to no avail. Their son suffered the additional trauma of seeing 

the bodies of his parents in their bedroom, where you had left them for dead.  

 

Words cannot begin to describe the depth of the distress and desolation that 

you have brought upon the many innocent victims of this tragedy who mourn 

 

4
--------
the loss of their loved ones. I entirely understand the reluctance of the family 

members  to  add  their  own  distress  by  making  a  victim  personal  statement 

recounting  those  feelings.  That  in  no  way  lessens  the  impact  of  your  crimes 

upon them and I take that impact fully into account. 

 

Patrick Kettyle was a skilled tradesman and successful builder who had built 

up  a  flourishing  business  through  his  own  hard  work  and  provided  a  good 

living for his family and for his workforce. He was a kindly man, always ready 

to  help  those  less  fortunate  than  himself.  He  was  a  devoted  family  man. 

Gillian Kettyle was a talented and accomplished professional woman, utterly 

devoted  to  her  family.  I  have  no  doubt  that  she  died  trying  to  protect  her 

husband from your merciless attack.  

 

 When you were arrested by the police some 18 hours later you were calm and 

compliant. When your home was searched you asked the police officers: “How 

long do you get for murder in this country?” You claimed falsely that the cut to 

your hand had been caused by broken glass in a fall on the beach. You made 

no  admission  during  the  course  of  your  lengthy  police  interviews,  even 

challenging  the  police  to  double  check  if  it  was  truly  your  blood  at  the 

property.  

 

 In fixing the minimum term you must serve I have to apply the provisions of 

schedule  21  to  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003.  The  first  issue  to  decide  is 

whether the starting point for your sentence should be a whole life order. Such 

an  order  is  appropriate  in  a  case  where,  reflecting  on  all  the  features  of 

aggravation  and  mitigation,  the  court  is  satisfied  that  the  element  of  just 

punishment  and  retribution  requires  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  order. 

Applying  the  words  of  the  statute,  such  an  order  would  be  appropriate  if  I 

were to conclude that the seriousness of these offences is “exceptionally high”, 

in  comparison  with  other  very  serious  cases.  Where  the  murder  is  of  two  or 

more persons the case will normally fall within the category of exceptionally 

high  seriousness 

if  each  murder 

involved  a  substantial  degree  of 

premeditation or planning.  

 

 

5
--------
I  have  considered  this  issue  anxiously  and  with  great  care,  reflecting  on  the 

aggravating  and  mitigating  features.  I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  the 

murder of Patrick Kettyle involved a very substantial degree of premeditation 

and planning. However, I cannot reach the same conclusion in respect of the 

murder of Gillian Kettyle. It seems to me far more likely that you attacked and 

killed her because she intervened to protect her husband. I do not believe that 

you  entered  that  house  intending  to  kill  her.  It  follows  that  in  my  judgment 

this  is  not  a  case  where  a  whole  life  order  is  required.  The  minimum  term 

must nevertheless be very long indeed. 

 

In  my  judgment  this  case  falls  squarely  into  the  category  one  step  below  a 

whole  life  order.  This  is  a  case  where  the  seriousness  of  the  offences  is 

“particularly high”, and where the starting point for the minimum term must 

be 30 years. That is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of 60 years. The 

statutory provisions specifically envisage any murder of two or more persons 

as meeting this threshold. It is worth observing that had you killed only one of 

your victims, the starting point under the schedule would have been 25 years, 

because you brought a knife to the scene. 

 

Next I must consider the aggravating and mitigating factors in order to decide 

what  adjustment  is  necessary  from  the  starting  point  to  arrive  at  the 

appropriate minimum term. 

 

The  first  and  most  serious  aggravating  factor  is  that  there  was  a  very 

substantial  degree  of  planning  and  premeditation  in  the  murder  of  Patrick 

Kettyle.  Paragraph  10(a)  of  the  schedule  speaks  of  a  “significant”  degree  of 

planning or premeditation as an aggravating factor. This case goes far beyond 

that. The whole history of your groundless obsession with the idea that Patrick 

Kettyle  had  ruined  your  life  demonstrates,  in  my  judgment,  that  you  were 

biding your time for an opportunity to kill him. 

 

The second aggravating factor is the mental and physical suffering inflicted on 

your  victims  before  death.  On  the  assumption  that  you  attacked  and  killed 

Patrick  Kettyle  first,  it  follows  that  his  wife  Gillian  endured  in  her  last 

 

6
--------
moments of life the agony of seeing and hearing her husband brutally stabbed 

and  killed.  Although  the  whole  ghastly  attack  lasted  no  more  than  a  few 

minutes,  both  your  victims  must  have  endured  severe  mental  and  physical 

suffering before they died. I have in mind in particular the very deep defence 

wounds to Patrick Kettyle’s hand and arms.  

 

The third aggravating factor is that, as you must have anticipated he would be, 

your victims’ son was present in the house and liable to witness the murder of 

his  father.  These  killings  took  place  within  his  hearing  if  not,  mercifully, 

within  his  sight.  You  had  sufficient  composure  to  speak  to  him  and  to  lie  to 

him in making out that you bore his mother no ill will even though you had 

just stabbed her to death.  

 

The  fourth  aggravating  factor,  which  must  not  be  overlooked,  is  that  your 

victims  were  murdered  after  you  broke  into  their  home  late  at  night.  That 

feature is in no way reflected in the bare fact of two murders, which is all that 

is required to meet the threshold of a 30 year starting point. 

 

The  fifth  aggravating  factor  is  the  ferocity  of  the  attacks,  with  multiple 

stabbings  of  both  victims,  the  attack  on  Patrick  Kettyle  being  particularly 

frenzied. 

 

These  are,  in  combination,  very  serious  aggravating  factors  which  would 

justify a substantial increase from the starting point of 30 years.  

 

Turning to mitigating factors, there is no suggestion you were suffering from 

any  mental  disorder  or  disability  which  lowered  your  degree  of  culpability. 

Nor is there any suggestion that you were in any way provoked. In truth the 

only  mitigating  factors  are,  first,  your  previous  good  character  and,  second, 

your  guilty  plea,  which  at  least  avoided  the  final  indignity  of  requiring  your 

victims’  son  to  give  evidence  before  a  jury.  You  have  expressed  no  remorse 

other  than  by  entering  your  guilty  pleas,  but  often  that  is  the  best  and  most 

tangible  indication  of  remorse.  As  your  counsel  rightly  acknowledges,  good 

character counts for little in a case of this seriousness. 

 

7
--------
I have considered the psychiatric report from Dr. Ian Cummings. That affords 

no  real mitigation. You were not suffering from any significant mental illness. 

You  claimed  to  the  psychiatrist  that  you  intended  only  to  frighten  Patrick 

Kettyle, and that you had the knife with you only to ward off the family dogs. I 

reject  that  entirely.  The  facts  speak  for  themselves.  You  claimed  that  having 

driven past the Kettyles’ home it was only on the spur of the moment that you 

took the knife from the tool box you carried in your car. I cannot accept that 

either. It is significant, for example, that the broken pieces of that knife, when 

recovered and fitted together, matched the knives you kept at your home. You 

claimed that there was a struggle with both your victims in the darkness of the 

bedroom, and that you did not really know what you were doing. I reject that 

as well. The indications are that the attack began when your victims were both 

in  bed,  and  probably  asleep.  As  Dr.  Cummings  points  out  in  his  report,  it  is 

not  uncommon  to  encounter  a  partial  or  complete  failure  of  recall  but  it  is 

equally possible that you are in a state of denial as to your true intent. 

 

The extent to which a defendant convicted of murder should receive credit for 

his  guilty  plea  is  dealt  with  in  the  relevant  Sentencing  Council  guideline.  A 

reduction  must  never  exceed  one-sixth  of  the  period  of  the  minimum  term 

which would otherwise be appropriate, and the reduction must never exceed 5 

years.  Credit  of  that  order  will  only  be  available,  however,  where  there  has 

been an indication at the first reasonable opportunity of a willingness to plead 

guilty. It was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in R v Peters [2005] 2 Cr App 

R  (S)  101  that  although  sometimes  the  first  reasonable  opportunity  will  not 

arise  until  a  defendant  has  had  the  benefit  of  advice  from  leading  counsel, 

particularly if there are psychiatric issues to be considered, full credit will only 

be appropriate for a defendant who accepts, and makes clear early on that he 

accepts, responsibility for the killing: see paragraph 19. 

 

That is not the position in this case. In interview you made no admission. At 

the  preliminary  hearing  on  19th  December  there  was  no  indication  of  any 

acceptance of the factual basis of the prosecution case. It was only at the plea 

and case management hearing on 20th February that your counsel indicated to 

 

8
--------
the  prosecution  that  there  would  be  no  challenge  to  the  fact  that  you  were 

responsible for the stabbings.  Had this been a charge of anything other than 

murder,  the  appropriate  credit  for  a  plea  tendered  at  the  PCMH  would  have 

been  25%.  Applying  this  to  a  case  of  murder,  that  figure  has  to  be  halved.  I 

also bear in mind, however, that this was, in truth a completely overwhelming 

case.  Balancing  those  factors,  in  my  judgment  the  appropriate  overall 

reduction for your guilty pleas is in the region of 10%.  

 

I  have  been  referred  by  counsel  to  a  number  of  decisions  of  the  Court  of 

Appeal which are said to give some idea of the appropriate level of sentence in 

this  case.  However,  each  case  turns  on  its  own  facts,  and  there  is  nothing 

directly  comparable  to  this  case.  I  have,  however,  considered  the  decisions 

highlighted in prosecuting counsel’s sentencing note. 

 

Taking account of all the aggravating factors, and of such limited mitigation as 

exists, in my judgment the appropriate minimum term, before any credit for 

your guilty pleas, would be 37 years. In addition to giving you credit of around 

10%  for  your  guilty  pleas,  I  also  have  to  deduct  from  the  minimum  term, 

which starts today, the time you have already served on remand which will not 

otherwise count towards sentence. This amounts to 125 days, approximately 4 

months. I shall therefore  make a global deduction of 4 years for time served 

on remand and credit for your guilty plea, so the minimum term you will serve 

from today is 33 years. 

 

Stand up:  

Viktoras Bruzas, for each of these murders there will be a concurrent sentence 

of life imprisonment. You will serve a minimum term of 33 years from today. 

Thereafter it will be for the Parole Board to decide when, if ever, you should be 

released.  If  you  are  ever  released,  you  will  remain  on  licence  for  the  rest  of 

your life.

2225096,R v Fred Talbot,"R v Fred Talbot 

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Mort 

 

Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court 

13th March 2015 

1.  Fred Talbot. You are 65 years of age with no previous convictions. After 

trial, you were convicted by a jury on clear evidence of indecently 
assaulting two pupils at Altrincham Grammar School (AGS) for boys 
whilst you were a teacher at that school.  

 
2.  The incidents occurred on two separate occasions in 1975/1976, namely 
two different school trips when the pupil concerned was one of a group 
of schoolboys on a canal trip which you were responsible for organising 
and supervising. 

 
3.  After qualifying as a teacher, you taught briefly at several schools 

before being appointed as a biology teacher at AGS in 1974. It is clear 
that this was (and still is) an excellent school academically teaching 
important values, discipline, and respect for others. It was evident from 
former pupils and teachers of the school, who were there when you 
were, that your approach was different to that of the majority of the 
teaching staff. You were less strict, less formal, and this approach 
brought you into much closer contact with the pupils than many other 
teachers. Many former pupils both Prosecution and Defence witnesses 
all confirmed that you were a very popular teacher who taught your 
subject well and made their classes interesting and informative.     

 
4.  You taught at the school for almost 10 years and during that time it is 
likely that you took pupils on as many as 38 trips, on narrow boats on 
the canals, on cruisers on the Caledonian Canal, camping in Scotland 
particularly, Grey Mare’s Tail, and trips abroad. It is fair to point out 
that on many of them the boys had a wonderful time and the trips 
passed off without any improper behaviour on your part and you 
behaved entirely responsibly.
--------
5.  However the jury were absolutely clear that in relation to the two 

counts in respect of which you were found guilty that you deliberately 
indecently assaulted the two pupils for your own gratification. 

6.  The first incident involved a pupil whom I shall refer to as F. He 

described going on a canal trip with the school when he was 14. There 
were two narrow boats and you were in charge of the one on which he 
slept. He recalls being on the boat when you returned from a nearby 
public house with some of the older boys. You had been consuming 
alcohol. The younger boys including F were given alcohol and were told 
by you that they should pretend that girls had been brought back from 
the Public house and that they would have an orgy. The boys were then 
expected to undress and lie on top of each other pretending that the 
one underneath was a girl. F recalled in his original account to the 
police that you having encouraged this behaviour proceeded to take 
photographs. If you did not, it is clear that you encouraged photographs 
to be taken. 

7.  At the conclusion of this activity you told F that he would have to share 
the area of the boat where a double bed arrangement was created from 
the dining table in the galley area. He did not challenge your 
instruction because the sleeping arrangements on the boat were 
crowded and so, affected by alcohol, he lay down naked whilst you, also 
naked, lay down beside him. You then proceeded to masturbate him 
and required him to masturbate you. It was clear that he was sexually 
inexperienced and you showed him what to do assuring him that what 
you were doing was quite natural and that this was how a man should 
touch other men. The following day you told him that what had 
occurred was “our secret” and that activities on the boat were a secret. 
A few days later you encouraged him to go round to your house to see 
the photos and to tell his parents a lie namely that he was visiting a 
friend. He went to the outside of the house but did not try to go in. He 
did not tell anyone what had occurred save to say to another boy on the 
trip who was on the other boat that there had been some fooling 
around. 

 
8.  The second incident involved a pupil whom I shall call E. He described 

two canal trips which you supervised. On the second trip when it is 
likely that he was 14, he, like F, was asked to share the double bed 
arrangement with you. You had been to a nearby public house 
consuming alcohol. E understood that because of the crowded sleeping 
arrangements on the boat that he would have to sleep next to you. He 
was naked and thinks that you were also naked. You lay down beside 
him and asked him whether he ever masturbated .You then started to 
masturbate him. He asked you to stop it saying that he did not like 
what you were doing and he tried to curl up and away from you. 
However, you continued to try and get hold of his genitals quite a few 
times and he kept removing your hands. Eventually you stopped and 
the next day you gave him a cigarette and nothing more was spoken of
--------
the previous night’s behaviour. He described himself as a naive child 
and felt unable to confide in his parents as to what had taken place. 

 
9.  Years passed until one night in May 1984 you invited a number of 

pupils round to your house. You were teaching astronomy as an O level 
and, unusually in those days there was course work which required the 
pupils to view the night sky as a project and they were to view it 
through your telescope. The boys with their parents’ permission were to 
stay over. During the evening you suggested to one 15 year old pupil 
that he should return alone on another occasion, the inference being 
that it would lead to sexual activity. You also offered to give another 14 
year old pupil oral sex which he declined. Both boys who were friends 
were very embarrassed by your approach and because one was due 
shortly to go to USA on a school trip supervised by you but with only a 
limited number of pupils, which he realised that he could not now go 
on, the boys told their parents what had happened. The headmaster 
was informed and you resigned from the school with immediate effect. 
The police were not informed. The parents were concerned that their 
sons’ welfare should not be affected by the possibility of court 
proceedings and that the boys would not want to go through the ordeal. 
Colleagues of yours on the teaching staff came to visit you to find out 
why you had resigned and they confirmed that you admitted to them 
that you had propositioned a pupil. Your diary entry for the night in 
question records that the boys had come round to use the telescope “as 
usual I had quite a bit to drink and as usual I tried. I must be mad”. 

 
10. After a lean year financially your broadcasting career which had just 

begun to develop took off and you then successfully forged your 
television career for which you have become so well known. 

 
11. In 1992, F who had been living and working abroad particularly in 

USA,became aware that  there was increasing concern about allegations 
of sexual abuse in schools and decided to report what you had done to 
him when he was on the school trip. The police took a statement from 
him in April 1992 which formed the basis for the evidence which he 
gave in the recent trial. You were interviewed about his allegation 
which you denied and told the police that you had left the school to 
further your television career and that nobody had previously made 
allegations of a sexual nature against you. As you conceded both of 
those assertions were untrue. Following this in June 1992, the police 
wrote to F inform him “that extensive enquiries had been made but 
insufficient evidence has been found to justify further investigation or 
to substantiate any criminal proceedings.” One has to bear I mind that 
as at 1992 it was the practice to look for corroboration of a sexual 
victim’s account and courts would habitually warn a jury about the 
risks of convicting without such corroborative evidence. That practice 
changed in 1994. Having said that it does seem somewhat strange that 
the reason for your sudden departure from the school was not followed 
up because both of the teachers to whom you had confessed to having
--------
propositioned a pupil in 1984 were still on the staff and if they had been 
spoken to then they and the pupils in the 1984 incident would have 
provided the corroboration and shown that you had lied to the police. 

 
12. F felt aggrieved about the police response and in 1996 again wrote, this 

time exaggerating the extent of the abuse but upon receiving a visit 
from the police immediately explaining that that part of his account 
was untrue but that the rest was true. Again no action was taken and he 
made several renewed complaints up to 2000 again to no avail. 

 
13. In 2012 a woman who had known E notified the police that E had once 
told her that he had been sexually abused by you. At the time she had 
become aware of a police investigation into alleged sexual abuse at 
another school in the Trafford area. Following this notification the 
police conducted a detailed and thorough investigation into allegations 
of sexual abuse by you which led to the recent trial. Apart from the 
witnesses, F and E, the jury also heard from other pupils on school trips 
or other activities supervised by you whose evidence confirmed that 
these were not isolated incidents but that you had on a number of 
occasions abused your position in order to offend. However I 
emphasise that you are to be sentenced only for the two counts of which 
you have been convicted and the other incidents will have no effect on 
the level of sentencing. 

 
14.  In sentencing you for these two counts, I have to have regard to the 
fact that they were offences contrary to the Sexual Offences Act 1956 
rather than the current 2003 Act. I have to have measured reference to 
any definitive guidelines relevant to the situation revealed by the 
established facts, in this instance the Sentencing Council Guidelines for 
Sexual Offences which applies to all offenders over 18 who are 
sentenced after 1st April 2014 and those factors now set out in Annexe 
B. The offence of sexual activity with a child under the new legislation 
carries a higher maximum sentence namely 14 years than the offences 
for which you have been convicted under the old legislation, namely 10 
years for indecent assault and therefore it seems to me that I should 
consider those Guidelines carefully in calculating my sentence whilst at 
the same time reflecting that difference in penalty. 

 
15. The key factors for consideration are “harm caused by you, your 

culpability and the risk for the future”. 

 
16. Harm  

17. I have seen victim personal statements from F and E. It is clear that in 

their different ways they were affected by your abuse of them. E 
describes how he felt unable to disclose his experience to his parents 
and this led to a pattern of him not being able to disclose and share 
issues with them. In due course he developed serious mental health 
issues although he is at pains to say that he does not seek to blame you
--------
directly for that. He found the whole ordeal of giving evidence stressful 
and needed a lot of support. 

18. F describes how the incident had a constant negative impact on his life 
emotionally and psychologically particularly as his complaints were not 
heeded .He says that it is only since the trial he has been able to move 
on with his life. 

 
19. Culpability. The Guidelines refer to “significant degree of planning, use 
of alcohol on victim to facilitate the offence, abuse of trust and disparity 
in age” as culpability factors to place your offending in Culpability 
category A” with an aggravating feature that the offences were 
committed whilst you were under the influence of alcohol ..In relation 
to each of your victims their parents had agreed for them to go on a 
canal trip in the expectation that you would take all necessary measures 
to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip and that neither was put at any risk 
of physical or sexual abuse from other pupils or staff. You abused that 
trust by a regular planned routine deliberately creating a situation 
whereby each pupil was offered alcohol and then made to sleep next to 
you so that you could sexually abuse them. You did this, each time 
having yourself consumed alcohol, for your own sexual gratification, 
and you did this calculating that the boys would be too confused, guilt 
ridden or embarrassed to disclose your behaviour for fear of adverse 
comment by their fellow pupils.  

 
20. I have to consider the passage of time as this has the potential to 

aggravate or mitigate the seriousness of your behaviour. After you left 
teaching in 1984, there is no evidence of reoffending. I note for example 
that when in 2012 your house was searched and your computer 
examined there was no evidence indicating a continuing interest in 
underage teenage children. In the circumstances, I conclude that there 
is a low risk of reoffending .Other factors by way of mitigation to which 
I should refer are the numerous references from family and friends 
showing an entirely different side to your character highlighting the 
positive features which were acknowledged by the staff and former 
pupils during the trial and commenting upon your health difficulties. I 
note also that this case having been conducted in the glare of publicity 
that it may be more difficult for you in a custodial setting. 

 
21. Having regard to the Guidelines each of these offences would fall into 
Category 2A involving touching of naked genitalia and with the serious 
culpability features to which I have referred with a starting point of 3 
years imprisonment where the maximum is now 14 years Since these 
offences were committed against different victims on different 
occasions, I am in no doubt but that an immediate sentence of 
imprisonment must be imposed with consecutive sentences on each 
count whilst taking care to ensure that the overall sentence is just and 
proportionate.
--------
22. In all the circumstances bearing mind that the maximum sentence for 

each of the offences was 10 years and not 14, the total sentence is one of 
5 years namely 2.5 years for the offence on F and 2.5 years consecutive 
for the offence on E.

Sentencing remarks of HHJ Pontius 

 

Central Criminal Court 

 

20th March 2015 

 
 

 
 
 
A realistic and sensible assessment of the whole of the relevant evidence that 
the jury and I heard leads inescapably to the conclusion that this defendant, 
had he not  -  by sheer good fortune  -  been spotted and stopped by the police 
in a street in East London during the afternoon  of Tuesday 19th. August last 
year, would have carried out the intention he had so graphically expressed to 
his ex-girlfriend only a few hours before. She was an impressive witness, 
truthful, articulate and confident, and her evidence was clear and convincing. 
If it required any support at all that support came in the equally compelling 
evidence of PAUL MORRIS, who spoke to the defendant on 28th. August at 
Wandsworth Prison and to whom the defendant made an admission, in 
equally graphic terms, in a manner described by Mr. MORRIS as “calm and 
matter-of-fact”. 
 
The evidence of those two  transparently honest and totally reliable witnesses 
established a formidable and unassailable prosecution case against this 
defendant but of course, in addition, the extensive body of downloaded 
material and the defendant’s Facebook postings and texts, much of that 
material of a vile and deeply disturbing nature, made plain the degree to 
which the defendant had adopted and totally absorbed the twisted 
interpretation of the Holy Quran that is the hallmark of  the fanatical Islamic 
terrorist. 
 
That perversion of the Prophet’s teachings of tolerance and mutual respect is a 
cruel insult to the overwhelming majority of devout Muslims throughout the 
world who espouse what is one of the three great Abrahamic faiths. 
All that material dispels any doubt there can be that, had the defendant not 
been arrested on 19th. August, then within hours  -  at most  -  he would have 
used the hammer and knife to carry out the intention he had so clearly 
expressed and for which he had so determinedly prepared, with the result that 
an act of horrifying savagery would again have been perpetrated on the streets
--------
of London, in imitation of MICHAEL ADEBOLAJO and MICHAEL 
ADEBOWALE, whose crime this defendant had so explicitly and repeatedly 
applauded.   
 
It is, therefore, an unavoidable and entirely justifiable conclusion that the 
defendant was looking for another Drummer Rigby but, if he couldn’t find a 
soldier, I have little doubt that a police officer or other figure of authority 
would have suited his purpose just as well.  
 
The Islamic flag also found in his rucksack would then, I am sure, have been 
held aloft in one hand after the defendant had carried out his intended 
atrocity, ideally a beheading, so that a picture could be taken of him holding 
his trophy in the other hand. 
 
He made all too plain, in the texts, Facebook postings and downloaded 
material, that his hatred was focussed not simply upon figures of authority but 
also, with equal vehemence, upon Shia muslims, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, 
Christians, Jews and, indeed, anyone who does not embrace his own perverted 
interpretation of Islam.  
 
The letters he wrote, which form Exhibit 1, perhaps better described as 
fanatical diatribes, made his views abundantly clear:  “You’s going to the hell-
fire, brothers pick up your swords, guns, bombs, take off their limbs, we 
should do a 9/11 and 7/7 and Woolwich all in one, every day for 8 years… 
shoot them all in the face and the chest, burn the pubs with the people in dere, 
do not fear them at all, be strong, do not mix with Christians and Jews and 
non-believers kill them all, no pity, but do not kill the women and children…I 
plan to die a martyr and leave this world and enter the next...” 
 
In approaching sentence I have had assistance from prosecuting and defence 
counsel and, in addition, from a reading of the judgments in the leading cases 
in the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, in particular those of DART & Ors., 
delivered on 31 October 2014, KHAN & Ors., on 16 April 2013, QURESHI on 
22 April 2008, PARVIS KHAN on 20 May 2009 and BAROT on 16 May 2007. 
Further, I have derived considerable help from the sentencing remarks of 
JEREMY BAKER, J. in the very recent case of KHAWAJA & ors., at Southwark 
Crown Court on  6 February this year.  
 
Thus I bear very much in mind that I must sentence the defendant not for a 
specific act of actual violence but, rather, for an inchoate offence, that of 
having made up his mind to commit a terrorist act, having completed his 
preparations to do so, then being caught in the act of searching out a victim.  
The starting point, therefore, must be the notional sentence that would have 
been imposed if the defendant had achieved his intention. 
 
I am also acutely aware of the danger of allowing myself, when considering the 
appropriate sentence, to be unduly influenced by the shocking events of recent 
weeks and months  -  not only in Woolwich in 2013 but also last year, and this, 
in Europe and beyond. Whilst giving due weight to the obvious need 
adequately to punish an offender with appropriate severity and effectively to
--------
deter others from acts of terrorism, no court can allow itself to become the 
vehicle for disproportionate and ill-considered over-reaction. 
Of course, I must also bear in mind the defendant’s age  -  18 at the time and 
still only 19  -  but that must be balanced with the facts of this case and the 
cold-blooded deliberation with which he planned and expressed his 
intentions. I have little doubt that, like ADEBOLAJO and ADEBOWALE 
before him, he fell under the malign influence of Al Muhajiroun fanatics who 
were considerably older, and had been immersed in extremist ideology far 
longer, than him but he was, nevertheless, a willing student and all too ready 
to absorb and adopt their teaching. 
 
To that extent, there is in this case a factor common to most, if not all, the 
cases which have been considered by the Court of Appeal in recent years, in 
that defendants have tended to be impressionable young men, normally in 
their teens or twenties, often intellectually immature and thus more likely to 
provide fertile ground for hardened extremists to sow their evil seed. 
That said, the jury and I had the opportunity to watch and to listen to this 
defendant at length when he gave evidence, from which advantage I formed 
the view that he is far from being a naïve adolescent.  Rather, albeit having no 
academic qualifications, he is an intelligent and articulate young man with an 
independence of mind, thought and opinion. 
 
So far as any other similarity with previous cases is concerned the facts of each 
are, unsurprisingly, distinct and usually unique to the specific offence. Hence 
the Court of Appeal, understandably, has not provided guidelines to be 
followed in Section 5 cases, given the enormous breadth of potential offences 
encompassed in that section of the Terrorism Act.   
 
It is, therefore, equally unsurprising that there is no other case which is 
factually on all fours with this, although the case of PARVIZ KHAN, as with 
this case, concerned an intention to behead a serving soldier on camera, albeit 
he had not advanced that intention to anything like the extent achieved by this 
defendant.  KHAN, unlike this defendant, however, pleaded guilty.  He was 
described by the prosecution as a leader, recruiting others to his cause. He 
received a sentence of Life Imprisonment with a specified minimum term of 
fourteen years. In upholding the sentence the Court of Appeal remarked that, 
had the intention been carried out, the offence of murder would have called 
for the imposition of a ‘whole life’ sentence. 
 
This defendant’s age, of course, would have precluded such a sentence had he 
committed the intended murder but in those circumstances a minimum term 
would inevitably have been determined from the starting point prescribed by 
paragraph 5 of Schedule 21 to the 2003 Criminal Justice Act. 
 
I have had, first, to make a careful determination of the extent to which the 
defendant presents a threat of serious harm to the public. Given the evidence 
in this case no one could doubt that he does present such a risk, to a high 
degree. I cannot, therefore, accept the view expressed by the author of the Pre-
Sentence Report that the defendant does not meet the ‘Dangerousness’ 
criteria.
--------
Further, it is impossible for me to judge when, if at all, that risk will no longer 
exist given, not least, that he told PAUL MORRIS at Wandsworth Prison on 
28th. August that his ideology wouldn’t be changed by anyone, rejecting Mr. 
MORRIS’s offer of mentoring by the ‘Prevent’ team and intervention by the 
two visiting imams attached to the prison.  
 
The previous month he had said to one of the ‘Prevent’ officers, P.C. GRANT 
BONES, “too late” when it was explained that the team’s purpose was to 
prevent radicalisation. 
 
For those reasons it is as inevitable as it is imperative that I impose a sentence 
which provides the degree of protection that the facts of the case and the 
welfare and safety of the public demand.  
 
In the light of the age of the defendant and his lack of any previous 
convictions, I am not of the view that a sentence of detention for life is 
required but, that being so, there can be no avoiding an extended sentence 
which, upon the defendant’s eventual release from custody, will provide a 
sufficiently lengthy licence period to ensure, as far as is possible, that his 
behaviour and activity do not present a danger to the public. 
 
As I have already said, I must consider what sentence would have been 
imposed if the defendant had achieved his clearly stated objective.  Balancing 
the shocking facts of the case with his age on 19th. August last year  -  perhaps 
the only mitigating factor of any real significance  -  and comparing this case 
with that of ADEBOLAJO and ADEBOWALE, both older men, I am sure that 
the court, in those circumstances, would have fixed the minimum period to be 
served of the mandatory life sentence for Murder at a figure above the 
statutory starting point of thirty years, perhaps thirty two or thirty three years.  
If an unsuccessful attempt to carry out his objective had been carried out, and 
if a discretionary life sentence had not been thought appropriate, the 
determinate sentence for the offence of Attempted Murder would have been a 
similar figure, with  -  undoubtedly  -  an extension to the licence period, thus 
requiring the defendant to serve more than twenty years before becoming 
eligible for release on the order of the Parole Board. 
 
I do not regard the absence of previous convictions as a mitigating factor of 
any real weight  -  first, because of the defendant’s own admission of 
involvement with others in offences of street robbery and credit card fraud, so 
he is plainly not ‘of previous good character’ and, secondly, because his radical 
views and continuing threat to public safety mean that I cannot treat this 
crime as representing an isolated offence which is unlikely to be repeated  -  
quite the reverse, in fact, as my findings have already made clear. 
 
BRUSTHOM ZIAMANI, in all the circumstances I am entirely satisfied that 
the gravity of this case demands an extended sentence with a custodial term of 
twenty two years, of which you are required to serve at least two thirds, that is 
fourteen years and eight months, before your case is considered by the Parole 
Board. It will be a matter for the Board alone, not for this court, to determine 
whether, at that stage, you still present a danger to the public or can safely be 
released.
--------
Following your release, whenever that takes place, you will remain subject to 
the terms of your licence not only for the balance then remaining of the 
custodial term but also for an additional period of five years.  
 
That means that, if released at the two thirds point of the custodial term, you 
will remain on licence for the following twelve years and four months. 
I have no doubt that an extended licence period of that length is imperative, 
for the reasons I have already set out. 
 
Formally expressed, therefore, I pass an extended sentence of twenty seven 
years, the custodial term of which is twenty two years, with a licence extension 
of five years. 
 
In addition, this plainly being an offence with a terrorist connection, for the 
purposes of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 the appropriate statutory 
Notification Requirement applies automatically. 
 
If a Victim Surcharge is appropriate in this case the relevant order will be 
drawn up and served on the defendant in due course.

Sir Brian Leveson P : 

R v Boardman 

1. 

It  is  beyond  argument  that  there  is  considerable  pressure  on  all  involved  in  the 
criminal justice system to maximise the use of limited resources and to ensure that 
cases  are  processed  as  efficiently  as  possible.    The  recent  Review  of  Efficiency  in 
Criminal Proceedings makes it clear (at para. 22); 

“It  is  ...  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  scarce  resources  are  not 
wasted or used inefficiently. Demands on public funds must be 
kept to a minimum while, at the same time, ensuring that the 
delivery of justice is effective and meets the highest standards 
that any democratic society is entitled to expect.” 

2. 

The Review goes on to deal with the critical importance of the Criminal Procedure 
Rules (CPR) and the role of the judges in effectively managing the work of the court.  
It emphasises (at para. 199):  

“Whatever we do, we must encourage a reduced tolerance for 
failure to comply with court directions along with a recognition 
of the role and responsibilities of the Judge in matters of case 
management.  It  cannot  be  right  that  a  ‘culture  of  failure’  has 
developed  in  the  courts,  fed  by  an  expectation  that  deadlines 
will not be met. If a deadline (e.g. for service of a document(s) 
or an application) is not met, there must be good reason for it 
and there must be an expectation that the party which failed to 
comply can provide that reason. A failure to tackle this culture 
leads to a general indifference to rule compliance. Whichever 
party  has  failed  to  comply  or  failed  to  meet  the  deadline,  the 
opponent perceives objection as a waste of time because it will 
be  largely  pointless:  there  is  no  sanction  that  can  be  applied. 
Perhaps  most  significantly,  it  allows  cases  to  ‘drift’,  and  for 
further hearings to take place unnecessarily.”  

This case is another example of the problems that arise when cases are not progressed 
properly or in accordance with the CPR or other directions of the court.  The upshot 
was  that,  on  15  October  2014,  in  the  Crown  Court  at  Chester  before  His  Honour 
Judge Dutton, when the respondent was due to face trial on an indictment alleging a 
number of counts of stalking contrary to s. 4A(1) of the Protection from Harassment 
Act 1997, the judge was faced with an application by the respondent to adjourn on the 
grounds that significant material had only been served a few days before and required 
expert analysis which would take three weeks.  The prosecution (in the form of the 
CPS) agreed that it was appropriate to adjourn the trial.   

In the event, Judge Dutton was not prepared to take that agreed course.  He ruled that 
due to delay on the part of the prosecution, evidence of telephone call data records 
and telephone cell site data would be excluded pursuant to the provisions of s. 78 of 
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (the 1984 Act).  This ruling effectively 
brought  the  prosecution  to  an  end  and,  as  a  result,  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service 
(CPS) apply for leave to appeal the terminating ruling pursuant to the provisions of s. 
58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (the 2003 Act).

The facts which formed basis of the indictment can be shortly summarised.  Thus, it is 
alleged that between 3 July 2013 and 22 August 2013 the respondent had sent a total 
of 112 text messages and made 5 telephone calls of a sexually explicit and abusive 
nature  to  8  women  and  to  have  made  2  indecent,  obscene  and  menacing  telephone 
calls to 2 other women.  CCTV footage was seized in relation to the purchase of a 
mobile phone top up for a phone from which offending texts and calls were made.  On 
24 September 2013, the respondent was arrested and interviewed; he admitted that he 
was the person on the CCTV (stating that he had bought the top up for a friend, Mr 
Black).  He denied sending the messages or making the obscene calls.   

The  respondent  admitted  that  he  knew  two  of  the  victims  (one  of  them  only 
professionally), had met a third and had previously attended the home of a fourth.  His 
mobile phone was seized at the time of his arrest and was found to have contacted 18 
numbers which were also called by the mobile phone for which the top up had been 
purchased, one of the numbers being the daughter of his partner.    

Following  charge,  on  25  November  2013,  the  respondent  appeared  before  the 
magistrates.    The  police  thereafter  provided  the  CPS  with  relevant  information 
(including statements).  These included a statement from Det. Con. Matthew Gagan 
who received information pursuant to a request under the Regulation of Investigatory 
Powers Act 2000 for communications data in the form of incoming and outgoing call 
data with cell site, IMEI and IMSI information in respect of the mobile phone used to 
send the relevant text messages (the 513 phone) and the respondent’s phone (the 291 
phone).  Having received the data from the communication service provider O2 via 
what he describes as the ABM Pegasus database, the results were contained in folders 
identified as exhibits EF/1 and MG/6 (apparently in pdf format).  He also exhibited as 
MG/3 a copy of the resultant data from both applications which he had burned to disc; 
this last was replaced by MG6 (or, according to the chronology) MG/7 which did not 
include all the information on MG/6) in a format (Excel) that the CPS could read.  In 
addition, an intelligence analyst produced a cell site analysis of the product in relation 
to  both  numbers:  hard  copies  were  exhibited  as  LD/03  and  LD/04;  a  CD  of  these 
documents was created and produced MG/8. 

On 14 March 2014, the case papers were served.  Included within the list of exhibits 
were MG/7 (described as a master CD of call data to incorporate MG/6 and EF/1) as 
well  as  the  CD  MG/8  and  hard  copies  LD/03  and  LD/04.    However,  although  the 
paper exhibits were copied with the file and attached, the CDs were not enclosed or 
sent to the respondent’s solicitors.  A letter dealing with disclosure of unused material 
(dated 6 March) was also served; further unused material was disclosed on 7 May. 

On 9 May, the CPS received an unsigned defence case statement dated 7 May served 
pursuant to s. 5 of the Criminal Procedure Investigations Act 1996  (the 1996 Act). 
The respondent identified 291 as his phone and denied that 513 either belonged to him 
or, to his knowledge, had ever been used by him.  He accepted that he had met four of 
those who complained about receiving texts or calls which he ascribed to coincidence.  
He said that emergency and other services had been sent to  his address when he had 
not requested them and that he had come home to find it in a different state to when 
he left.

range of documents, many of which do not fall properly within a request for unused 
material but effectively constituted a request of the police to undertake investigative 
work on behalf of the defence.  This is not the purpose of s. 8 of the 1996 Act which 
places  a  burden  on  the  prosecutor  to  disclose  material  held  or  inspected  by  the 
prosecutor or which the disclosure officer must supply to the prosecutor or allow to be 
inspected, if requested to do so.  The court will be assiduous to ensure that defence 
requests  are  limited  to  that  which  the  law  provides.    We  shall  return  to  this  point 
below. 

Having  said  that,  in  this  case,  the  defence  solicitor  also  made  requests  which  were 
entirely legitimate, not least because they were exhibits in the case and, to such extent 
as they had been summarised in other forms, also fell within the framework of the 
1996 Act.  Thus, the prosecution were asked to provide a full copy of MG/6, MG/3, 
MG/7  and  MG/8.    MG/6  included  all  the  calls  made  to  and  from  the  513  and  291 
phones.  Three days later, on 12 May 2014, the Plea and Case Management hearing 
(PCMH) took place: the respondent pleaded not guilty and an order for trial on 15 
October  (estimated  length  three  days)  was  made.    No  specific  order  was  made  (or 
sought)  in  respect  of  the  telephone  or  cell  site  data:  the  defence  had  asked  the 
prosecution and there was no reason to believe that the CPS would not comply with 
the  request  to  produce  copies  of  what  were,  after  all,  exhibits  in  the  case.    In  the 
absence of compliance, however, on 24 June 2014, a follow up letter was sent. 

On 18 August, the relevant CDs had not been sent and the respondent’s solicitors sent 
a  letter  repeating  the  contents  of  the  defence  case  statement  and  indicated  that 
consideration was being given to the instruction of a cell site expert (for which legal 
aid had been extended).  By letter dated 1 September (received 3 September), further 
evidence was served which included a copy of the CD MG/8 which consisted of a 
digital version of the analysis of the data previously served in hard copy. 

There was ongoing disclosure and, on 3 September, the defence case statement and 
letter of 18 August was forwarded by the CPS to the police who, on 4 September were 
unable to provide copies of MG/6 for what we believe were technical reasons.  On 12 
September,  a  copy  of  MG/7  was  served:  this  contained  all  the  data  specific  to 
complainants in relation to 513 along with the material which supported the analysis 
served in hard copy in March.  It did not include the data from 513 which did not 
relate to the complainants.  On 1 October, MG/6 (which included the additional data 
for 513) was sent by the CPS to the defence in pdf format: it was apparently received 
on 7 October.  The defence expert then required it in Excel format: we are told that 
this was because that was the format in which it would have been provided by the 
relevant service providers although Judge Dutton was told that it was because the data 
was not searchable in pdf format. 

It is not difficult to see why the prosecution and defence were interested in different 
aspects of this evidence.  The prosecution were interested in proving the suspect calls 
and  texts  from  513  which  formed  the  basis  of  the  allegations,  along  with  the 
coincident calls or texts made from 291 to numbers which featured on 513 call data: 
this  was  to  provide  evidence  of  similar  use  to  justify  the  inference  that  the  phones 
were being used by the same person.  A similar inference was to be argued based on 
the distribution map prepared by the analyst of the cell sites utilised by both phones to 
make these calls: this was on the basis that the same cell sites were being used by the 
two phones in roughly the same proportions.

R v Boardman 

The  defence  wanted  all  the  data  to  check  its  validity  and  to  seek  to  support  the 
argument  that  the  phones  were  in  different  hands.    Thus,  if  different  cell  sites  had 
been used to make phone calls from both phones at the same time, there would be 
clear  evidence  that  the  phones  were  with  different  people.    If  that  was  so  on  any 
occasion, it was arguable that the jury could not conclude that they were necessarily 
in the same hands when the relevant offensive calls were made or texts sent.  In that 
event,  it  would  support  the  argument  that  the  513  phone  was  sometimes  used  by 
someone other than the respondent and might therefore have been used by someone 
else to make and send the relevant calls and texts. 

Returning to the chronology, on 7 October, notwithstanding that the material which 
was  sought  had  not  been  provided,  the  defence  a  certificate  of  readiness  which 
identified  that  the  case  was  not  ready  for  trial.    With  only  one  week  to  go,  it  is  a 
matter of comment that no prior application had been made to the court.  Additionally, 
the request was for the case to be mentioned on 10 October which, given the nature of 
the material the defence was seeking, would itself have been too late to protect the 
trial date.   

There were telephone calls between the parties and on Sunday 12 October, there was 
a letter from the CPS to the defence confirming that the phone evidence and cell site 
evidence would be available on 13 October.  Further evidence was then also supplied 
on the basis that a formal notice would follow.  It being clear that the defence expert 
required 3 weeks to produce his report, on 13 October, an application was made to the 
Recorder of Chester to adjourn the case.   

Having had some of the history explained, Judge Elgan Edwards made it clear that he 
was not prepared to adjourn the trial not least because a case listed in May for a trial 
in October could not be subject to what would be a further six month delay (with the 
attendant consequences on court resources) on the basis that prosecution evidence had 
only  been  served  that  week.    He  adjourned  consideration  of  the  matter  until  the 
following day; on that day, he further postponed consideration of the application until 
15 October (the intended trial date) and said that the trial judge, Judge Dutton, would 
be able to decide whether the case justified adjournment for what would be a further 
eight months.   

Judge Dutton spent the time available on 15 October going through the history, not 
only in relation to the expert evidence but also concerning what prosecution counsel 
explained  was  a  cautionary  bad  character  application  (on  the  basis  of  his  primary 
contention  that  the  relevant  evidence  was  admissible  without  such  an  application 
being  made).    The  date  on  which  prosecution  counsel  was  instructed  was  also 
explored from which it was clear that little (if anything) had been done over a period 
of  some  months  before  he  was:  it  was,  for  example,  clear  that  there  had  been  no 
response to letters from the respondent’s solicitors.  

Not all the facts then explained to Judge Dutton were accurate; he understood that, 
when served, the information was incapable of use by the defence expert to check or 
draw data from it.   This court should, of course, proceed on the facts as the judge was 
told (or found on a reasonable basis) that they were but with fairness characteristic of 
her conduct of the case and this appeal, Miss Frances Willmott for the respondent has 
been entirely content that this court proceeds on the basis of the true position as we 
have sought to explain it.

R v Boardman 

21.  When  it  came  to  giving  a  judgment,  Judge  Dutton  described  the  situation  as 
“invidious and appalling”, referring to a number of complainants having made serious 
allegations  alleging  offences  committed  by  the  respondent  who  contended  that  the 
back-up material provided by technology was “a crucial aspect of the case”.  Having 
referred to other failings in the case (including the service of four notices of further 
evidence,  some  recently  and  none  foreshadowed  in  the  PCMH  along  with  a  bad 
character  application  served  in  October),  he  observed  that  counsel  had  only  been 
instructed  in  mid-August.    It  is  important  to  set  out  a  large  part  of  the  rest  of  his 
judgment extensively.  He said: 

“As  far  as  the  court’s  responsibilities  are  concerned,  case 
management and efficient and effective case management is an 
essential aspect of the conduct of criminal cases in these courts.  
Everybody  well  knows  that  the  culture  of  adjournments  is  a 
thing of the past.  There were days and times when cases would 
almost automatically be adjourned for one reason or another at 
the trial hearing because various things hadn’t been done.  But 
that  has  well  and  truly  gone  in  accordance  with  the  criminal 
rules.  Efficient case management in pursuit of the overriding 
objective as set out by the rules is vital.  The judge must deal 
efficiently and expeditiously with the case while dealing fairly, 
of course, to both sides, recognising the rights of the accused 
and of course respecting the interest of victims and witnesses 
and  therefore,  as  Rule  3  indicates,  adjournment  should  be 
refused unless absolutely necessary and justified.      

....  The reality is that the defence is entitled to have access to 
the call data and full cell site data to which the Crown have had 
access, and to have access to it before either the 3rd September, 
the  12th  September  or  the  7th  October,  which  is  when  that 
service  of  information  is  now  said  to  have  actually  been 
completed. 

...  I am extremely anxious that in a case of this kind there has 
been  a  lamentable  failure  on  the  part  of  the  prosecution, 
whether it be the police to provide the proper data, or whether 
the  CPS  to  manage  that  data  and  to  transfer  it  on  in  an 
acceptable  form  and  I  feel,  I  am  afraid,  that  those  who  are 
victims  will  feel  badly  let  down  by  the  rather  lackadaisical 
manner in which this serious case has been prosecuted.  I am 
the  first  to  acknowledge  that  all  agencies  within  the  criminal 
court  process  are  currently  under  pressure  of  time  and  of 
monetary  consideration  but  none  of  that,  I  am  afraid,  is  any 
excuse for lamentable inefficiency and inactivity.” 

The judge was not prepared to put the case off to June 2015 “if not beyond”, the trial 
date  having  been  set  five  months  previously.    In  the  circumstances,  he  determined, 
pursuant  to  s.  78  of  the  1984  Act  that  it  would  be  unfair  to  allow  the  telephone 
evidence “in its entirety” to be used by the prosecution “at this very late stage”.  Thus, 
as the judge appreciated, the ruling effectively brought the prosecution to an end.  He 
declined  to  expedite  the  hearing  of  this  application.    Although  documentation  in

support of this appeal was lodged in time, it was not lodged in the appropriate form 
under  Rule  67.4  CPR.    Without  objection  from  Miss  Willmott,  we  extend  time 
pursuant to Rule 67.4(e)(ii) CPR. 

In  this  court,  Mr  Ian  Unsworth  Q.C.  (who  did  not  appear  in  the  Crown  Court) 
recognised  that  the  513  phone  was  at  the  heart  of  the  prosecution  and  he  equally 
recognised that the respondent was from the outset entitled to copies of the material 
that had been exhibited.  In the grounds of appeal, he advanced three arguments.  The 
first  was  that  the  judge  took  into  account  matters  that  were  irrelevant  to  the 
consideration  of  the  evidential  issues  namely,  actual  or  perceived  failings  by  the 
prosecution in the service of material in this and other unrelated cases and the length 
of time that it would take for the matter to be heard again.  Secondly, he submitted 
that the judge failed to take into account the fact that an adjournment would cause no 
prejudice to the defendant.  Thirdly, as a consequence, he argued that the judge was 
wrong to exclude the whole of the telephone evidence. 

As to the first ground, Mr Unsworth modified the submission by recognising that the 
failings  of  the  prosecution  were  not  irrelevant  but  that  they  had  been  accorded  too 
much weight.  While recognising that the position had not been put to the judge with 
the clarity or accuracy to be expected, in fact, the respondent was not entitled to the 
513  calls  which  did  not  involve  complainants;  that  material  was  not  part  of  the 
evidence and did not undermine the prosecution or assist the defence.  Furthermore, 
the  judge  did  not  address  what  could  be  discerned  from  the  material  that  had  been 
served  as  long  ago  as  March  2013  and  failed  properly  to  consider  that  as  at  12 
September the defence team had extensive data, missing only the complete billing for 
513.   

Although the judge had been given information that was not accurate (about which 
Mr Unsworth recognised that the prosecution could not complain), he pointed to the 
absence  of  any  application  under  s.  8  of  the  1996  Act  or,  indeed,  any  earlier 
application to the court of any sort.  This was the first trial listing and the case had not 
previously  been  adjourned:  there  was  no  prejudice  to  the  respondent.      In  the 
circumstances, it was unreasonable (in a Wednesbury sense) for the judge to exercise 
his discretion under s. 78 as he had done and it would have been sufficient for him to 
mark  his  frustration  with  the  police  and/or  the  CPS  in  some  other  way  not  least 
because of the consequence of ‘punishing’ the CPS was that eight complainants were 
not afforded the opportunity to have their complaints aired in court.  The court should 
recognise  the  pressure  under  which  the  CPS  was  having  to  work  and  the  resulting 
caseload for each lawyer. 

26.  Miss  Willmott  responded  by  underlining  that  there  had  been  no  response  to 
correspondence  from  the  respondent’s  solicitors  explaining  the  position  so  as  to 
justify an application to the court.  In fact, the full call data and full cell site data were 
first  served  on  7  October  and  it  was  only  thereafter  that  the  expert  was  able  to 
recommend what work needed to be done.  It was not material to which the defence 
were not entitled: the relevant CDs were produced in statements and listed as exhibits 
served as part of the prosecution case.  Neither was this the only delay in the service 
of  evidence.    She  referred  to  the  skeleton  argument  prepared  for  the  hearing  in 
October which complained that 13 witness statements had been served on 12 October 
(including a statement of complaint from a new victim) and that whilst telephone data 
served on 13 October purported to be unused material, reliance had been placed on it

in the draft opening.  These were serious failings in the timeous preparation of the 
case. 

27. 

There were other complaints.  Thus, the response to the defence case statement had 
been dated 9 October 2014 and exhibits in relation to the topping up of the phone 513 
were also received that week.  The call data had been served in pdf format i.e. not that 
in which the providers had supplied it.  The paypoint card had not been analysed for 
fingerprints and nothing had been received in relation to the range of the cell sites or 
the number of telephones connected to them.   

28.  Without deciding the matter, on the face of it, these complaints are less impressive.  
We repeat that it is not the purpose of the 1996 Act to allow the defence to require the 
police to investigate matters or obtain evidence which is not in their possession but 
which may help the defence.  The Act is designed solely to require the prosecution to 
disclose  to  the  defence  material  already  in  its  possession  which  might  assist  the 
defence or undermine the prosecution.  The facility to request documents or material 
which  has  not  been  the  subject  of  primary  disclosure  is  specifically  to  put  the 
prosecution on notice that specific material which might not be thought to undermine 
its case or to assist the defence in fact does so and must be considered in this light.   

29. 

Further, whether it was necessary that this material be served in one specific format 
(i.e. Excel as opposed to pdf for even paper copy) is also a separate issue.  For our 
part, we do not accept that the defence could object if the material from the relevant 
service providers had been served by way of print out rather than searchable digital 
form.  It is not open to the defence to specify what is acceptable although, obviously, 
a  responsible  prosecutor  should  co-operate  with  the  defence  if  it  causes  no  greater 
difficulty to do so.  In particular, if the material had been provided in a form which 
fitted  with  the  defence  expert’s  requirements,  that  is  what  should  have  happened: 
reasonable  requests  should  always  be  entertained.  Failure  to  comply  which  such  a 
request,  however,  will  not  justify  an  adverse  ruling  as  to  service  if,  in  fact,  the 
information has been provided.   

30.  Moving on from the facts, Miss Willmott emphasised that her primary application had 
been for the trial to be adjourned not least because the expert had only had the call 
data  in  its  original  format  that  week  and  had  recommended  a  full  cell  site  survey.  
Further,  there  had  been  no  opportunity  to  take  the  respondent  through  the  recent 
material.    It  was  an  alternative  submission  that,  in  default  of  adjournment,  the 
telephone and cell site evidence should be excluded on the basis that the proceedings 
would otherwise be unfair as one side would be allowed to adduce relevant evidence 
which,  for  one  reason  or  another,  the  other  side  could  not  properly  meet:  see  R  v 
Quinn [1990] Crim LR 581.   

In that regard, it was submitted that Judge Dutton was entitled to find the facts that he 
did  and,  although  he  had  expressed  his  frustration  in  relation  to  other  cases  during 
argument, there was nothing in his ruling to justify the conclusion that he had made 
his decision other than as a consequence of the failings in the present case.  In relation 
to prejudice, on any showing, the respondent was prejudiced: a prosecution that had 
been hanging over his head since 2013 and which he had expected to be resolved that 
month would be postponed for what could be 8 or more months.  The judge had fully 
reflected  the  gravity  of  the  allegations  and  the  impact  on  the  victims  and  had 
specifically  referred  to  these  features  of  the  case.      In  short,  she  argued  that  the 

31.

R v Boardman 

conclusion reached by Judge Dutton was a case management decision well within the 
proper exercise of his discretion and, thus, a decision with which this court should not 
interfere. 

32. 

It is appropriate to go back to the terms of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 and to 
identify that the overriding objective to deal with criminal cases justly set out in CPR 
1.1. (1) is then explained in CPR 1.1 (2) in these terms: 

“Dealing with a criminal case justly includes―  

(a) acquitting the innocent and convicting the guilty;  

(b) dealing with the prosecution and the defence fairly;   

(c)  recognising  the  rights  of  a  defendant,  particularly  those 
under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights; 

(d) respecting the interests of witnesses, victims and jurors and 
keeping them informed of the progress of the case;  

(e) dealing with the case efficiently and expeditiously;  

(f)  ensuring  that  appropriate  information  is  available  to  the 
court when bail and sentence are considered; and  

(g) dealing with the case in ways that take into account― (i) 
the gravity of the offence alleged,  (ii) the complexity of what 
is  in  issue,    (iii)  the  severity  of  the  consequences  for  the 
defendant  and  others  affected,  and  (iv)  the  needs  of  other 
cases.”  

It is abundantly clear from his judgment that Judge Dutton had these factors in mind 
when  he  considered  how  to  manage  this  case.    He  referred  to  the  requirements  of 
efficient case management and expressed concern for the victims (who he said would 
feel  let  down)  but  equally  spoke  of  the  rights  of  the  accused  and  the  prosecution 
failures  which  he  rightly  described  (in  language  which  Mr  Unsworth  did  not 
challenge) as ‘lamentable’.   

Neither  do  the  arguments  which  Mr  Unsworth  valiantly  presented  advance  the 
prosecution  further.    The  suggestion  that  the  failings  of  the  prosecution  were 
irrelevant was rightly abandoned and the submission that the defence were not entitled 
to  material  that  had  been  exhibited  to  the  evidence  served  from  the  outset  clearly 
misplaced: in any event, given the nature of the defence, a request for the original call 
data and full cell site evidence was clearly justified.  It was accurate to say that the 
defence could have made an application under s. 8 of the 1996 Act and if a letter had 
been written denying entitlement to the material, doubtless that is what would have 
happened: in fact, there was no response to their legitimate request at all.   

Further, it is beyond argument that the respondent would have suffered prejudice: this 
complaint (dating back to 2013) had been hanging over his head for many months and 
he was being asked to wait a further 8 months before it would be resolved.  Finally, 
whereas we have no doubt that the judge fully recognised the pressure under which 

33.

R v Boardman 

36. 

the CPS was working, if effective case management is to mean anything, that could 
never  be  an  answer  for  it  would  effectively  be  to  abnegate  responsibility  for  trial 
progress and make it subject to the vagaries of CPS preparation.   

Neither is it just the CPS that is under pressure.  If repeated applications have to be 
made, defence lawyers on a fixed fee must attend more hearings than would otherwise 
be necessary thereby reducing the rate at which they are being remunerated.  Further, 
HMCTS loses sitting days which could have been used to try other cases: this did not 
occur in this case because it was known that the trial could not proceed so that another 
trial  could  be  listed  although  a  substantial  time  was  taken  up  arguing  both  the 
adjournment  and  the  effect  of  a  refusal  to  adjourn.  But  having  said  that,  court 
resources  were  expended  because  there  were  three  hearings  to  deal  with  this  issue 
and, had there not been a warned or floating list (which itself gives rise to issues of 
efficiency) the court would have been left empty.  

37. 

It is now ten years since the decision in R v Jisl [2004] EWCA Crim 464 in which 
Judge LJ (as he then was) emphasised that case management was “an essential part of 
the  judge’s  duty”.    Referring  to  the  issue  of  trial  preparation  and  the  objective  of 
“greater efficiency and better use of limited resources”, he went on (at para. 118):  

“When trial judges act in accordance with these principles, the 
directions they give ... in the exercise of their case management 
responsibilities,  will  be  supported  in  this  court.    Criticism  is 
more likely to be addressed to those who ignore them.” 

The directions at the Plea and Case Management hearing were plain; the CPS were 
not entitled to expect that no sanction would follow unless the case had been brought 
back to the court for a further order: the resources of the court cannot be expected 
necessarily to extend to what might be described as the provision of a ‘yellow card’.  
Obviously, every case will depend on its own facts but the willingness of this court to 
support  trial  judges  in  the  exercise  of  their  discretion  in  discharging  these 
responsibilities is equally clear in cases of this nature.   

It  is  not  in  the  slightest  surprising  that  the  Recorder  of  Chester  and  Judge  Dutton 
became exasperated with the conduct of the prosecution.  Whatever stringencies that 
the  CPS  face,  far  too  much  time  and  money  has  had  to  be  spent  dealing  with  the 
failures of the prosecution; this would have been much better spent processing this 
and  other  cases  to  ensure  that  they  receive  expeditious  and  efficient  treatment.  
Suffice to say that Judge Dutton was fully entitled to reach the conclusion that he did 
and equally entitled to support from this court. 

Before leaving this case, however, it is necessary to sound notes of warning.  First, 
although nothing was made of the point before the judge or before this court, the fact 
that the defence solicitors did not alert the court to the problems of non-disclosure at a 
time when something could have been done about it (but left the complaint so late that 
the trial date could not be met) meant that the court was deprived of the opportunity of 
an earlier listing to resolve the issues could be resolved and maintain the trial date.  It 
would be perfectly open to the judge to decide that the consequences of such a failure 
of  duty  on  the  part  of  the  defence  should  be  to  reject  a  complaint  of  prejudice 
consequent upon the need for an adjournment.  In each case, the impact of whatever

breaches are established will be for the judge to assess, bearing in mind the particular 
circumstances of the case and the overriding objective. 

Second,  the court will not support (and, to the contrary, will be extremely critical of) 
attempts  to  administer  interrogatories  of  the  type  that  this  defence  case  statement 
contained, going beyond a request for disclosure of unused material but, rather, on the 
face  of  it,  seeking  to  impose  a  burden  on  the  police  to  undertake  investigations  on 
their  behalf.    It  takes  time  and  effort  to  respond  to  these  requests  (even  if  only  to 
refuse them); the defence also have the responsibility of ensuring that their requests 
are addressed to no more than the law permits and to seek to go further is to abuse the 
process that the 1996 Act set up.  Similarly, merely to assert that an extension will be 
sought before notifying defence witnesses is insufficient to comply with the rules and 
is not acceptable. 

Finally, it should not be thought that this decision can be used to create a trap for the 
prosecution  generally  or  the  CPS  in  particular  by  the  over-zealous  pursuit  of 
inconsequential material which does not go to the issue all in the hope that the CPS 
will fall down and that an application can be made which has the effect of bringing 
the prosecution to an end.  Such conduct is itself an abuse of the process of the court 
and judges will be assiduous to identify it and impose sanctions on those who seek to 
manipulate the system.  

In the event, having considered the issues in this case in some detail, it is appropriate 
that we grant leave to appeal; the appeal itself, however, is dismissed.  For the sake of 
the victims, it is only right to emphasise that there has been no suggestion that they 
were not subjected to offensive texts and calls and we recognise that a full trial has 
not  been  undertaken  (for  which  they  each  deserve  an  apology  from  the  CPS).  
Nevertheless, pursuant to s. 61(3) of the 2003 Act, the respondent is acquitted of the 
offences which are the subject of the appeal.

Mr Justice Simon: 

Introduction 
 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

The  Claimant  is  the  assignee  of  claims  from  the  liquidator  of  a  firm  of  solicitors, 
Greene  Wood  and  McLean  LLP  (‘GWM’).  The  claims  concern  the  failure  of  an 
application for a Group Litigation Order (‘the GLO’) brought on behalf of a group of 
coal  miners.  The  object  of  the  GLO  was  the  recovery  of  sums  which  had  been 
deducted from compensation awards in their favour (or in favour of their dependents) 
from the Coal Health Compensation Schemes in respect of personal injuries suffered 
in the course of their employment with the British Coal Corporation. The Coal Health 
Compensation Schemes covered two types of disease or injury: Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary  Disease  (‘COPD’)  and  Vibration  White  Finger  (‘VWF’).  The  Judge  in 
charge  of  the  COPD  litigation  from  1995  was  Turner  J.  He  retired  from  the  High 
Court Bench in 2002 but continued to act as the Supervising Judge until 2006.  

The GLO was brought against a number of respondents and was vigorously opposed. 
In a judgment on 18 May 2006 Sir Michael dismissed the GLO application with costs, 
made  an  interim  costs  order  against  GWM’s  clients  in  the  sum  of  £600,000  and 
refused  permission  to  appeal.  He  also  invited  the  respondents  to  consider  an 
application for a wasted costs order against GWM.  

The  GLO  application  had  been  backed  by  an  After  the  Event  (‘ATE’)  insurance 
 
policy issued by an Isle of Man insurer, Templeton Insurance Limited (‘Templeton’), 
whose  managing-director  was  Ralph  Brunswick.  The  Templeton  policy  insured 
GWM’s clients against the risk of an order for adverse costs and liability for their own 
 
disbursements in connection with an action brought against the Union of Democratic 
Miners (‘the UDM’), its claims handling company, Vendside Ltd and five firms of 
 
solicitors who had acted for the claimant miners. These were the seven respondents to 
the GLO application. 

On 25 May 2006, a week after Sir Michael Turner’s judgment dismissing the GLO 
 
application,  Templeton  purported  to  avoid  the  ATE  insurance  policy.  It  is  the 
Claimant’s  case  that  the  combination  of  the  GLO  decision  and  the  subsequent 
avoidance of the ATE cover, effectively destroyed GWM’s business.  

In the present claim the Claimant seeks to recover a principal sum of the order of £71 
 
million as damages for conspiracy and other torts against the 1st Defendant, a firm of 
solicitors. There are also claims against various named present or former partners of 
the firm, the 2nd-9th Defendants and the 11th Defendant (whom I shall refer to as Lord 
Prescott, although he was a Member of the House of Commons at the material time). 
 
Templeton,  formerly  the  10th  Defendant,  was  released  from  the  proceedings  by  a 
Consent Order dated 29 February 2012. 

As  the  case  progressed  the  Claimant  dropped  allegations  against  some  of  the 
Defendant partners and focussed his case against the firm, one of its partners: Geoff 
 
Shears (the 6th Defendant) and Lawrence Lumsden (the 9th Defendant), a partner in 
 
the separate firm of Thompsons Scotland. The case against Lord Prescott also became 
considerably narrowed.

MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

In short summary, the Claimant’s case contained three central allegations occurring in 
three material periods.  

First, it is said that the 1st-9th Defendants (‘the Thompsons Defendants’) unlawfully 
interfered  with  the  operation  of  the  ATE  cover  provided  by  Templeton  to  GWM’s 
clients.  The  effect  of  this  included  causing  Templeton  temporarily  to  withdraw  its 
 
cover  in  November  2005,  thereby  giving  rise  to  doubts  about  its  sufficiency  and 
enforceability when it came to be considered at the hearing of the GLO application in 
April  2006.  Secondly,  it  is  alleged  that  Thompsons  took  steps  to  ensure  that  Sir 
Michael  Turner  would  hear  the  GLO  application  knowing  or  believing  that  he  was 
 
biased  against  the  application,  and  with  the  specific  intention  that  the  GLO 
application  would  be  dismissed.  Thirdly,  it  is  said  that  in  the  course  of  concerted 
efforts on behalf of their union clients, the Durham Miners Association (the ‘DMA’) 
and  the  Durham  Colliery  Mechanics’  Trust  (the  ‘DCMT’)  Thompsons  committed 
further  unlawful  acts  against  GWM  (actionable  breach  of  confidence  and  deceit); 
although  by  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  this  third  aspect  of  the  claim  was  relied  on 
more by way of background than as a separate and independent route to judgment.  

 

The first material period of enquiry is February and March 2005, when Sir Michael 
Turner sought and received a report from Mr Lumsden about the practice of solicitors 
making  deductions  from  miners’  compensation  in  favour  of  trade  unions.  It  is  the 
Claimant’s case that in private correspondence the Judge revealed a predisposition in 
favour of Thompsons’s position and adverse to what was to become GWM’s position. 
 
This predisposition remained unknown to GWM throughout the period when the GLO 
was being advanced and up until the time of the GLO judgment.  

The second period of enquiry is late October and early November 2005, when it is 
 
alleged that there was further private correspondence to and from Sir Michael Turner 
which excluded GWM, and during which some of the Thompsons Defendants took 
active steps to ensure that he would be the Judge hearing the GLO application. It was 
 
also during this period and, the Claimant says, not coincidentally that Templeton (in a 
letter dated 15 November 2005) withdrew its agreement to provide the ATE insurance 
cover for the GLO application, although it subsequently restored it on 23 November 
2005. 

 

The third material period is late February 2006, at a time when Thompsons became 
 
aware  that  Templeton  had  reinstated  the  ATE  cover  for  the  GLO  application.  The 
Claimant contends that illegitimate pressure was brought to bear on Templeton which 
was intended to stop its continued support of the GLO application. This pressure is 
said  to  have  been  applied  during  a  number  of  telephone  calls,  and  at  a  meeting  at 
Thompsons’s  offices  on  27  February  2006.  Among  those  calls  was  one  from  Lord 
 
Prescott to Mr Brunswick at about 18.30 on 27 February when Mr Brunswick was at 
London City Airport. 

The Defendants submit that, before one gets into the detail of the claim, there are a 
number of material matters which make the Claimant’s factual case improbable. First, 
although  there  were  five  solicitors  who  were  respondents  to  the  GLO  application, 
Thompsons was not one of them. They had no direct interest in the result. Secondly, 
Sir Michael Turner had taken a judicial oath which still bound him to ‘do right to all 
manner of people ... without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.’ Whatever the merits 
 
of the argument about appearances, the suggestion that he was actually biased against

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

GWM  and  their  clients  and  was  known  to  be,  is  inherently  unlikely.  Thirdly,  the 
suggestion made to Sir Michael Turner that he should hear the GLO application, came 
 
not from Thompsons, but in a letter from the Claimants’ Group (the ‘CG’), who acted 
(as their name suggests) in the interests of all BCRDL claimants and which included 
solicitors who had never made any deductions, had no direct interest in the result of 
 
the  GLO  application  although  they  had  a  clear  interest  in  avoiding  anything  which 
might cause delay to the just and efficient determination of BCRDL claims. 

Bias 

 
13.	 

It is convenient at this stage to consider what is meant by bias. 

 

14.	  While  the  law  on  what  constitutes  apparent  bias  is  well-settled  the  position  with 
regard to actual bias is less so. There are potentially two types of case. The first is 
 
where the decision-maker has a direct pecuniary, proprietary or personal interest in 
the outcome of the case. The second is where the decision-maker is shown to have 
been  directly  influenced  by  a  fixed  predisposition  or  predilection.  In  the  case  of  a 
fixed predisposition or predilection it will be for reasons unconnected with the merits 
of the case, and involves a closed mind, which is not susceptible to any reasonable 
persuasion,  see  for  example,  R  v.  Inner  West  London  Coroner,  ex  parte  Dallaglio 
[1994] 4 All ER 139, Simon Brown LJ at 151 and Flaherty v. National Greyhound 
Racing Club Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1117 at [28].  

 
15.	 

It is a human characteristic that people have predilections, beliefs and sympathies, and 
judges  and  tribunals  are  no  exception.  The  fact  that  a  Judge  or  Tribunal  may  hold 
certain pre-conceived views does not by itself constitute actual bias unless it is such as 
 
to  render  them  immune  to  contrary  argument.  The  crucial  distinction  is  between  a 
 
predisposition towards a particular outcome and a predetermination of the outcome. 

The  former  is  consistent  with  a  preparedness  to  consider  and 
weigh factors in reaching the final decision; the latter involved 
a  mind  that  is  closed  to  the  consideration  and  weighing  of 
relevant factors; 

see National Assembly for Wales v. Condron [2006] EWCA Civ 1573, Richards L.J at 
[43], (with whom Ward and Wall L.JJ agreed) and De Smith’s Judicial Review, 7th Ed 
 
(2013). §10-058. 

The courts have shown themselves reluctant to investigate allegations of actual bias 
 
and there is authority to the effect that submissions of actual bias should not be made, 
see for example R. v. Gough [1993] A.C. 646, see Lord Goff at 659D-H and Lord 
Woolf at 672G-673B. There are three reasons why the courts have seldom embarked 
on such inquiries. First, there are obvious difficulties in exploring the actual state of 
mind of a judge (for example, a judge is not compellable as a witness in relation to his 
own  decision).  Secondly,  bias  can  operate  in  an  insidious  way  so  that  the  person 
alleged  to  be  biased  may  be  unconscious  of  it.  Thirdly,  it  may  be  very  difficult  to 
establish.  For  an  interesting  discussion  of  the  reasons  for  judicial  diffidence  in 
investigating  actual  bias,  see  Civil  Justice  Quarterly  2008:  ‘Facing  Up  to  Actual 
Bias’,  by  James  Goudkamp.    Nevertheless,  and  despite  these  difficulties,  when  an 
allegation  of  actual  bias  is  made  the  court  cannot  avoid  adjudicating  on  it  and  is 
bound to undertake, what has been described  in a different context, as the ‘duty of

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

decision’,  see  R  v.  Derek  William  Bentley  (deceased)  [2001]  1  Cr  App  R  p.307  at 
[68]. 

 
17.	 

It  is  to  avoid  some  of  these  difficulties  that  the  Courts  have  developed  the  test  of 
apparent bias, which avoids the difficulties of proof, is easier to demonstrate and will 
usually be sufficient, see for example R v. Liverpool Justices, ex p. Topping [1993] 
(DC) 1 WLR 119 at 122G-123D. 

 

 

 

 

18.	  When  considering  the  question  of  apparent  bias  the  court’s  approach  is,  first,  to 
ascertain all the circumstances which have a bearing on the suggestion that the judge 
or tribunal was biased, and secondly, to ask itself whether in those circumstances a 
 
fair-minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility 
 
that the tribunal was biased, see for example Porter v.Magill [2002] 2 AC 357, Lord 
Hope at [103]. In Re Medicaments and Related Classes Goods (No.2) [2001] 1 WLR 
700 at [83] Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers described the principles. 

(1) If a judge is shown to have been influenced by actual bias, 
his decision must be set aside ... (2) Where actual bias has not 
been established the personal impartiality of the judge is to be 
presumed.  (3)  The  court  then  has  to  decide  whether,  on  an 
objective appraisal, the material facts give rise to a legitimate 
fear  that  the  judge  may  not  have  been  impartial.  (4)  The 
material facts are not limited to those which were apparent to 
 
the  applicant.  They  are  those  which  are  ascertained  on 
investigation  by  the  court.  (5)  An  important  consideration  in 
 
making an objective appraisal of the facts is the desirability that 
the  public  should  remain  confident  in  the  administration  of 
justice. 

It may be that a further stipulation needs to be added: although the material facts are 
not limited to those which were apparent at the time, if there are no new facts, the 
principles  associated  with  finality  of  judgments  are  likely  to  weigh  heavily,  if  not 
dispositively, against the grant of relief. 

In Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. [2000] Q.B. 451 (the judgment of 
 
the  Court  consisting  of  Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill  CJ,  Lord  Woolf  MR  and  Sir 
Richard Scott V-C) at p.480 F-G, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between (a) 
real grounds for doubting the ability of a judge to ignore extraneous considerations, 
prejudices and predilections so as to bring an objective judgment to bear on the issues 
before  him,  which  would  ground  an  argument  of  apparent  bias,  and  (b)  a  different 
situation: 
 

The  mere  fact  that  a  judge,  earlier  in  the  same  case  or  in  a 
previous case, had commented adversely on a party or witness, 
or found the evidence of a party or witness unreliable, would 
not without more found a sustainable objection. 

I would add that the significance of a judge previously expressing views about a case 
or an issue must be viewed in the light of the circumstances. For example, if the judge 
has  expressed  the  view  at  a  ‘without  notice’  hearing  that  a  claimant  has  a  good 
arguable case, it cannot preclude him from hearing the case or determining that issue

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

when  both  parties  attend.  Similarly,  where  a  judge  is  case  managing  complex  civil 
litigation,  the  expression  of  a  view  at  a  time  when  directions  are  being  discussed 
cannot  be  taken  as  a  predetermined  view  of  the  matter  or  an  inability  to  bring  an 
objective  judgment  to  bear  on  the  ultimate  issue.  Case  management  of  large  scale 
 
litigation would otherwise be impossible. As the Court went on to say in Locabail the 
 
question  of  apparent  bias  is  likely  to  depend  on  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the 
case. 

Bias: the Claimant’s case 

In the present case Mr Green QC advanced the Claimant’s case on actual bias on the 
basis that the Judge had lost his objectivity. In other words, he was so involved in the 
effective management of the BCRDL scheme that he was unable to view the GLO 
application other than as a threat to it and consequently failed to deal with it on the 
merits. It seems to me that this way of characterising the complaint is not significantly 
 
different to an allegation that the decision-maker had, for a particular reason, a closed 
mind which was not susceptible to persuasion.  

In support of his ‘lack of objectivity’ test, the Claimant relied on the decision of the 
Court of Appeal in Co-operative Group (CWS) Ltd. v. ICL [2003] EWCA Civ 1955 at 
[82-84]. These passages do not greatly assist. In [82] and [83] reference was made to 
the unusual conduct of the judge during the course of the trial in that case, and [84] 
sets out the statement of principle from the Locabail case (see above) that a Judge 
ought not to lose or give the appearance of losing the ability to try a claim with an 
objective judicial mind. The complaint which was upheld in the Co-operative Group 
case was not that the judge had come to the trial with any preconceived prejudice or 
predilection or bias: but that during the course of the trial he had shown ‘an inability 
to grapple objectively with the issues of fact and law present to him, so that in the end 
the trial was unfair’. It is to be noted in the present case that there is no criticism of Sir 
Michael Turner’s conduct of the hearing of the GLO application.  

Causes of action 

The Claimant makes an overarching submission that the facts of what occurred speak 
for  themselves  and  that  ‘the  law  will  not  stand  by  and  leave  the  Claimant  without 
remedy,’ particularly ‘in the light of the special weight which the common law (and 
Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) give to the citizen’s free and 
fair right of access to courts, to which the Defendant’s conduct is an affront.’ 

By the conclusion of the evidence the Claimant had narrowed the causes of action to: 
(1) an abuse of process tort, encompassing: (a) procuring a breach of Article 6 of the 
 
ECHR, (b) procuring a breach of the common law right to a fair trial, (c) interference 
with the administration of justice and (d) the tort of abuse of process; (2) causing loss 
 
by  unlawful  means  and  an  unlawful  means  conspiracy;  (3)  procuring  a  breach  of 
contract; (4) deceit; (5) actionable non-disclosure; and (6) harassment contrary to s.3 
of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.

25.	 

 
26.	 

Since there was little dispute as to the legal tests to be applied, I can summarise the 
 
law relatively briefly. 

The Abuse of Process tort
--------
Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

This  was  put  in  a  number  of  ways  but  each  would  depend  on  establishing  that  the 
judge was actually biased. Mr Green QC submitted that it involved the bringing about 
of the breach of a legal right. He referred to a passage in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
 
21st Ed. at 24-27. 

 

The civil liability bequeathed by Lumley v. Gye (1853) 2 E & B 
216 is not restricted to procuring a breach of contract. As Lord 
 
Nicholls recognised in OBG Ltd v. Allan [2008] 1 AC p.1, the 
majority  view  in  Lumley  v.  Gye  was  that  knowingly  and 
intentionally procuring the violation of a right was a cause of 
action  in  all  instances  where  the  violation  was  an  actionable 
wrong, as in violations of a right to property, whether personal 
or  real,  or  to  personal  security.  The  requirements  as  to 
knowledge  and  intention  are  parallel  to  those  determining 
liability for procuring breach of contract.  

His submission was that the law will allow a claim for damages where a defendant 
with  knowledge  of  the  issues  (or  likely  issues)  in  a  trial,  and  with  the  intention  to 
subvert the fair determination of those issues, deliberately does an act whose direct 
effect is to bring about a trial which is unfair. Although there may be difficulties with 
the precise formulation of the test, I am prepared to assume that where a defendant 
 
has deliberately and knowingly brought about the appointment of an actually biased 
tribunal or judge, so that in effect there is no real trial at all, the law may provide a 
remedy  which  goes  beyond  the  conventional  relief  of  setting  aside  an  award  or 
allowing an appeal. 

The  first  stage  of  Mr  Green  QC’s  argument  was  the  submission  that  a  party  to 
litigation should not communicate privately with a judge hearing a case. In general 
this  is  plainly  correct.  The  second  stage  is  that,  having  elicited  that  he  held  views 
 
favourable  to  their  position,  the  Thompsons  Defendants  arranged  for  Sir  Michael 
Turner  to  hear  the  GLO  application  and  then  implicitly  represented  to  GWM  that 
there was no reason why he should not hear the case. Each stage of the argument calls 
for a careful consideration of the facts. 

Causing loss by Unlawful Means and Unlawful Means Conspiracy 
 

The matters which a claimant must prove in order to establish the tort of causing loss 
 
by unlawful means are: (a) interference with the actions of a third party in which the 
 
claimant has an interest; (b) the use of unlawful means; (c) an intention to injure and 
 
(d)  consequential  loss  and  damage  to  the  claimant,  see  for  example  OBG  Ltd  and 
another v. Allan and others (above) at [45]-[47] 

 

The matters which the claimant needs to prove in order to establish liability for an 
unlawful means conspiracy are: (a) a combination or agreement between two or more 
persons;  (b)  either  to  take  actions  which  are  unlawful  or  use  means  which  are 
unlawful; (c) with the intention of injuring the claimant by the use of those unlawful 
actions or means; and (d) the use of those unlawful actions or means caused damage 
to the claimant which is more than incidental, see for example Kuwait Oil Tanker v. 
 
Al  Bader  [2000]  2  All  ER  (Comm)  271  at  311  and  Clerk  &  Lindsell  §24-93  and 
following. Where a defendant seeks to advance his own interests by pursuing a course

which he knows will necessarily injure the claimant, the intention is established, see 
OBG Ltd v. Allan (above) at [164]-[166]. 

Similar facts are relied on in relation to these causes of action as in relation to the 
abuse of process tort, although some further background is relied on to establish the 
necessary intent. 

Procuring a breach of contract 

In order to sustain this cause of action a claimant must prove: (a) the procurement or 
persuasion (advice is not sufficient) of a third party; (b) the defendant’s knowledge of 
the  existence  of  the  contract  and  that  it  is  procuring  a  breach  of  contract;  (c)  an 
intention to cause the breach of contract; (d) a breach of contract; and (e) damage as a 
result of the intended breach, see OBG Ltd v. Allan (above) at [39]-[44] and Clerk & 
 
Lindsell at 24-14 and following. 

The Claimant contends that Thompsons communicated with Templeton in November 
 
2005 and that it tortiously procured Templeton to withdraw the ATE insurance cover 
 
for the GLO application on 15 November 2005. He also relies on the communications 
in  February  2006  between  Thompsons  (and  Lord  Prescott)  and  Mr  Brunswick  of 
Templeton. Reliance is placed both as a free-standing cause of action and (particularly 
 
in  relation  to  the  February  2006  communications)  as  constituting  the  required 
 
unlawful means for the purposes of the conspiracies.  

 
35.	 

It will be necessary to consider these matters in the light of the facts as I find them to 
 
be. 

Deceit 
 

 
36.	 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

This  requires  proof  that:  (a)  the  defendant  made  a  representation  of  fact  to  the 
claimant; (b) the representation was false; (b) the defendant knew it was untrue or was 
 
reckless as to whether it was true or not; (c) the defendant intended that the claimant 
act in reliance on it; (d) the claimant did in fact rely on it and thereby suffered loss, 
see for example Clerk & Lindsell at 18-01 and following. 

As to requirement (a), the representation may be made once but nonetheless amount 
to a continuing representation, it may be made by silence or conduct and it may carry 
with it the implied representation that the defendant did not know of any matter which 
might  falsify  the  assurance,  see  for  example,  Mellor  and  others  v.  Partridge  and 
another [2013] EWCA Civ 477 at [17].  

The Claimant relies first on the written report made by Mr Lumsden to Sir Michael 
Turner  on  23  March  2005,  for  which  Thompsons  are  liable;  and  secondly  on  the 
procurement of Sir Michael Turner as the judge hearing the GLO application. Again, 
these matters are also relied on as constituting the required unlawful means for the 
purposes of the conspiracies. 

Actionable non-disclosure 

 
39.	 

This cause of action depends on there being a duty to disclose known material facts to 
the Court.
--------
Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

In this context it is necessary to distinguish two types of duty to disclose. First, where 
a  party  may  be  under  a  legal  duty  to  disclose  material  facts  to  a  contractual 
counterparty,  for  example,  an  assured’s  obligation  to  disclose  to  an  insurer  facts 
 
which are material to the risk. Secondly, the obligation of a party to litigation to make 
 
full  and  frank  disclosure  to  a  court  in  particular  circumstances,  for  example  on  a 
‘without  notice’  application.  The  Claimant’s  case  is  the  latter  type.  However,  no 
authority was cited in support of the proposition that a duty is owed by a non-party or 
that a breach of such an  obligation can give rise to a free-standing tort, rather than a 
potential obligation to compensate under the cross-undertaking in damages. While I 
 
do  not  rule  out  the  possibility  of  such  a  free-standing  tort,  it  is  unnecessary  to  say 
anything more about it, since, if the facts relied on do not give rise to a claim under 
the Abuse of Process torts or the Conspiracy claims, they are very unlikely to give rise 
to a claim for damages under this heading. 

Harassment contrary to s.3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 

This  requires:  (a)  conduct  which  occurs  on  at  least  two  occasions,  (b)  which  is 
 
calculated in an objective sense to cause alarm and distress; (c) which is objectively 
judged  to  be  oppressive  and  unacceptable;  and  (d)  which  causes  loss.  Two  further 
points  may  be  noted:  (1)  what  is  oppressive  and  unacceptable  may  depend  on  the 
social or working context in which the conduct occurs; and (2) a line is to be drawn 
between conduct which is unattractive and even unreasonable, and conduct which can 
be  described  as  a  ‘torment’  of  the  victim  ‘of  an  order  that  would  sustain  criminal 
liability’,  see  for  example  Clerk  &  Lindsell  at  15-21.  Mr  Green  QC  acknowledged 
that, since this claim relates to telephone calls made to Mr Brunswick on 27 February 
2006, only he could have brought this claim. For this reason he did not rely on it as a 
free-standing  cause  of  action,  but  as  constituting  the  unlawful  means  for  the 
conspiracies. 

 

The British Coal Respiratory Disease Litigation  

In  a  memorandum  prepared  for  the  Trade  and  Industry  Select  Committee  which 
reported in February 2005, the Department of Trade and Industry (‘DTI’) set out the 
background  and  history  of  the  British  Coal  Health  Compensation  Schemes 
 
(‘BCHCS’)  which  arose  from  claims  in  respect  of  lung  disease  (COPD)  and  hand 
injuries (VWF). British Coal, whose liabilities had been taken over by the DTI, had 
been found liable for both COPD and VWF. 

Following  these  judgments  the  DTI  set  up  compensation  schemes  to  deal  with  the 
anticipated claims. One of these was the British Coal Respiratory Disease Litigation 
 
(‘BCRDL’) scheme. 

 

The  DTI  entered  into  detailed  Claims  Handling  Agreements  (‘CHAs’)  with  the 
Claimants’  Solicitors  Group  (‘CSG’),  following  full  and  lengthy  negotiations.  Its 
purpose was that the BCRDL claims could be settled without recourse to the Court, 
save  where  issues  of  principle  arose.  The  CSG  was  itself  represented  by  a  much 
smaller  group  of  solicitors  known  as  the  Coordinating  Group  (‘CG’).  The  CHA 
provided  that  the  members  of  the  CG  were  six  firms  of  solicitors:  Irwin  Mitchell, 
 
Hugh  James,  Towells,  Nelson  and  Co,  Ross  &  Co  and  Thompsons,  Scotland.  In 
practice most of the work of the CG was carried out by five individuals from those 
firms: Andrew Tucker (Irwin Mitchell), Roger Maddocks (at the material time with

Irwin  Mitchell),  Lawrence  Lumsden  (Thompsons,  Scotland),  Gareth  Morgan  and 
Peter  Evans  (Hugh  James).  Membership  of  the  CG  was  individual  rather  than  as  a 
representative of the firm. 

 
45.	 

The DTI memorandum described the operation of the CHAs: 

The  courts  oversee  the  CHAs’  operation  aiming  to  avoid 
further court action. The Judges resolve points of law and the 
 
CG  reports  back  to  them  regularly  (3-4  times  a  year)  on 
progress in settling the claims. 

 
46.	 

 
47.	 

 
48.	 

Nearly  770,000  claims  were  registered  under  the  two  schemes,  with  costs  then 
estimated to be of the order of £7.5 billion. 

The terms of CHAs were approved by the High Court Judges who managed each of 
 
the schemes.  

The role of the supervising judges in relation to the CHAs was reviewed by the Court 
of Appeal in AB and others v. British Coal Corporation [2006] EWCA Civ 1357. The 
 
case concerned two issues which had arisen under the VWF scheme: a general issue 
as to the power of the Supervising Judge and a narrower issue on the power to award 
interest. In relation to the general issue, Pill LJ at [24] described some of the features 
of the scheme: including the necessary powers of the Supervising Judges to ensure 
that  individual  claims  were  processed  fairly  and  efficiently,  and  to  ensure  the  just 
disposal of those cases. Pill LJ noted the close involvement of the Supervising Judges, 
the  importance  of  cooperation  between  the  parties  and  the  need  for  active  case 
management  by  the  Judges,  including  the  making  of  substantive  and  procedural 
rulings. 

 

49.	  Members of the CG would meet regularly with representatives of the DTI to discuss 
and, where possible, resolve disputes in relation to the application of the CHAs. As 
 
the  Judge  in  charge  of  the  BCRDL,  Sir  Michael  Turner  held  three  or  four  review 
hearings  each  year,  in  the  course  of  which  the  operation  of  the  CHAs  would  be 
reviewed and points in issue would be determined. The CG would instruct counsel, 
draft reports for the Court and generally represent the interests of claimants under the 
 
scheme. Mr Tucker, as coordinator of the CG, would send and receive emails on its 
behalf. Generally, correspondence between the CG and Nabarro LLP (who acted for 
the DTI) was not copied to the Judge, but there were occasions when it was and there 
were occasions when the Judge corresponded with the parties, for example, when a 
question from a Member of Parliament called for a response.  

BCRDL costs 

Under the CHAs the fees of the solicitors in successful qualifying claims were met by 
the DTI on a scale set out in the CHAs; and there was a common understanding that 
solicitors would not recover costs in unsuccessful cases; it being understood that the 
costs of unsuccessful claims would be borne by the solicitors acting in those cases.  

The  work  undertaken  by  the  claimants’  solicitors  under  the  schemes  was  highly 
profitable; and the DTI came to be criticised for agreeing to pay rates that were too 
high.

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

An  issue  which  emerged  towards  the  end  of  2004  was  the  practice  of  making 
contractually agreed deductions from awards of damages payable to claimants. There 
 
were of two types of deduction.  The first were deductions for the use and benefit of 
solicitors  and  claims  companies,  in  circumstances  where  no  additional  service  was 
provided  beyond  those  covered  by  the  CHAs.  The  second  were  deductions  from 
compensation made under agreements between a claimant and the supporting trades 
union. Under this second type of agreement the client (either a miner or a dependent) 
agreed  that,  if  the  claim  were  successful,  a  sum  would  be  deducted  from  the 
 
compensation and paid over to the union. There was uncontroverted evidence that this 
way of funding union legal expenses by Members Return Contributions (‘MRCs’) by 
 
some unions as a way of meeting the collective cost of the union’s legal service had 
operated over many decades.  

It  was  also  clear  from  the  evidence  that  there  was  no  consensus  within  the  trades 
 
union movement that their deductions from the awards of damages was an appropriate 
way of funding trades union legal services. Some unions did not adopt the practice 
and  even  within  individual  unions  which  made  deductions,  some  officials  had 
principled objections to deductions from what was intended to be full compensation 
 
for injury or loss. 

 

The  National  Union  of  Mineworkers  (‘NUM’)  is  a  federated  association  of 
interdependent miners’ unions. Each of the NUM areas, South Wales, Yorkshire and 
(in  Durham)  the  DMA,  operated  independently,  with  local  officials  instructing 
solicitors on behalf of their members. In Yorkshire Messrs Raleys were the solicitors 
 
instructed  by  the  NUM;  and  in  the  Durham  area  Thompsons  was  instructed  by  the 
 
DMA and DCMT. Both the Yorkshire NUM and the DMA and DCMT adopted the 
practice of deducting MRCs.

54.	 

 

55.	  Mr  Shears  gave  evidence  that  after  the  end  of  the  miners’  strike  in  1985  and  the 
closure  of  coal  pits,  the  Durham  unions  suffered  from  reduced  membership  and 
income. By the time the last pits closed in the early 1990s, there were no longer any 
working members of the unions and virtually no income.   

 

the  members  and 

Yet  there  remained  a  vast  and  adverse  legacy  of  injury  and 
illness  amongst 
former  members, 
compounded  by  poverty,  social  problems  in  what  was  left  of 
the  mining  communities,  and  a  large  backlog  of  outstanding 
benefit claims. It was in this context that the union was forced 
to review its financial options in relation to the operation of its 
legal  service,  in  the  event  by  requiring  contributions  from 
damages in successful personal injury cases ...  

This  passage  highlights  a  potential  tension  which  Thompsons  and  its  individual 
partners  came  to  recognise.  On  the  one  hand,  the  social  cohesion  represented  by 
strong and financially viable unions, and the historical importance of the collectivist 
principle  by  which  members  of  unions  paid  out  during  their  working  lives  and 
received benefits into retirement; and, on the other hand, the rights of individual union 
members (and those with derivative claims) to receive full compensation for injury 
and loss. 

 
56.
--------
Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

As criticism of deductions from miners’ compensation increased during the course of 
2005,  Thompsons  and  other  union  law  firms  sought  to  highlight  the  distinction 
between  deductions  from  damages  for  the  benefit  of  unions  and  deductions  for  the 
personal benefit of solicitors and claims handling firms, such as Vendside Limited (a 
claims-handling  firm  set  up  by  the  Union  of  Democratic  Miners).  The  position  of 
Thompsons was also summarised in Mr Shears’s evidence. 

Our  position,  and  the  union  position,  was  that  there  was  a 
factual  and  qualitative  distinction  between 
trade  union 
arrangements  for  contributions  from  damages  in  successful 
cases and those of claims handling companies and some non­
union  law  firms  which  were  quite  properly  the  subject  of 
criticism because of the amounts they deducted, the results they 
 
achieved, and the poor quality of the service delivered. No real 
service  was  offered  by  those  companies  in  return  for  those 
deductions,  and  neither  was  there  any  commitment  to  the 
funding  of  test  cases  and  the  wider  extensive  legal  and  other 
services offered by trade unions. 

There were a number of potential difficulties with this approach.  

First, as already noted, the costs regime under the CHAs was generous and the scale 
of deductions that were being made from damages bore no relationship to the costs of 
 
providing union assistance for the claims.  

Secondly, the Law Society had begun to take an interest in deductions made by firms 
of  Solicitors  and,  particularly,  whether  appropriate  advice  had  been  given  before 
clients entered into MRC agreements. As set out below, one of its early enquiries was 
into the conduct and practices of Raleys. 

Thirdly,  union  solicitors  needed  to  make  good  their  case  that  the  deductions  were 
 
being used for beneficial purposes. It was for this reason that emphasis was placed on 
union support for claimants appearing before pension and disability pension tribunals, 
and union support for a test case in what was known as the Miners’ Knee Litigation.  

Fourthly, the deductions in the NUM areas were not uniform. The South Wales area 
of the NUM did not make MRC deductions. It charged a flat fee of £60. Mr Antoniw 
 
explained that, in retrospect, he thought this had been a mistake since it placed a very 
 
heavy burden on the volunteers who provided support for the compensation claims, 
and may even have had an adverse effect on the levels of recovery. In the Yorkshire 
area  Raleys  deducted  3%  from  damages,  capped  at  £750;  while  Thompsons  made 
deductions of 7.5% on behalf of the DMA and DCMT, capped at £1,000. 

Fifthly,  by  2004  the  way  that  individual  personal  injury  cases  were  funded  had 
changed. Unions no longer paid the legal costs on behalf of their members. Claims 
 
were now conducted by solicitors under Conditional Fee Agreements (‘CFAs’). Nor 
were unions at risk of paying the other side’s costs if the claims were unsuccessful, 
 
since these costs were insured under ATE policies. Additionally, neither Thompsons 
nor  their  union  clients  bore  the  cost  of  obtaining  medical  reports.  In  unsuccessful 
cases  these  costs  were  effectively  cross-subsidised  by  the  recovery  in  successful 
 
cases; and Thompsons had established a system for obtaining medical reports under

which  they  were  only  charged  for  the  provision  of  the  reports  if  the  claim  were 
successful, and then only at the conclusion of the case, at which point the cost could 
be recovered from the paying party as a disbursement. 

Finally, although in the period up to February 2005 the DTI accepted that there was a 
 
distinction to be drawn between deductions for the personal benefit of claims handlers 
and solicitors on the one hand, and MRCs for the benefit of unions on the other, there 
was a growing political consensus in Government and among Labour Party politicians 
in  Parliament  that  the  distinction  was  not  justified,  and  that  no  deduction  from 
 
damages  should  be  made  without  clear  advice  as  to  the  possibility  of  alternative 
 
means  of  bringing  claims  which  did  not  involve  MRCs.  These  views  were 
increasingly articulated in early 2005 and were particularly directed to deductions in 
favour  of  the  UDM  (a  union  which,  for  historical  reasons,  was  regarded  with 
disfavour by most Labour politicians and supporters), Vendside (its claims handler) 
and Beresfords (its solicitors).  

 
65.	 

The  presentational  issue  was  in  drawing  a  logical  and  legally  coherent  distinction 
 
between these two forms of deductions. 

Thompsons 

 
66.	 

 
67.	 

 
68.	 

Throughout its history Thompsons has based itself on support for and representation 
of trades unions and their members. The firm was started in 1921 by WH Thompson, 
split into two firms in 1974 (led by Robin and Brian Thompson), which merged (save 
for the Scottish partnership) to create the new firm of Thompsons in 1996.  

There has always been a strong political dimension to its work. Individual partners 
 
have  close  contact  with  different  trades  union  clients  and  the  firm  only  represents 
claimants, never defendants or insurers. It regards itself as a firm of union solicitors 
with  a  deep  and  historic  understanding  and  appreciation  of  the  social  and  political 
 
principles which trades unionism represents. 

Thompsons’s involvement in the political aspects of their work was primarily carried 
out by one of their partners, Tom Jones. He was active on the party political front, and 
particularly  in  lobbying  politicians  in  the  Labour  Party  which  Thompsons  publicly 
supported as the political party most likely to advance the cause of those they acted 
for.  Mr Jones’s work on the political and parliamentary front, as Thompsons’s Head 
of Policy and Public affairs, came under scrutiny during the course of the trial. On any 
view  of  the  matter,  the  firm’s  political  affiliations  and  its  contact  with  Labour 
politicians and senior union officials meant that it was inclined and able to respond to 
perceived political threats to the interests of its union clients on a broader front than 
most firms of solicitors would have been able to do. 

 

 
69.	 

In about 2000, Thompsons had established a new structure, with Mr Shears as the 
 
 
Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO),  Phil  Smith  as  Chief  Operating  Officer  (COO),  the 
2nd Defendant (Stephen Cavalier) as Client Director and Caoilionn Hurley, as Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO). 

 
70.	 

These four formed the Executive Board and were also (non-voting) members of the 
firm’s Supervisory Board, chaired by Lord (Tom) Sawyer.

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

At  the  material  time  the  other  Defendants  (apart  from  the  9th  Defendant  and  Lord 
Prescott) were all partners of Thompsons. The 3rd Defendant (Mick Antoniw) worked 
in the Cardiff Office and was responsible for the case-load from the NUM (South-
Wales  area).  The  4th  Defendant  (Phil  King)  was  Director  of  Client  Care.  The  5th 
Defendant  (Anthony  Patterson),  was  the  National  Coordinator  for  Coal  Litigation 
within  the  firm,  based  in  Newcastle.  The  7th  Defendant  (Rob  Wood)  was  Branch 
Manager at the firm’s North East branch, also based in Newcastle. The 8th Defendant 
(Doug Christie) had a number of trades union clients but these did not include any 
NUM area clients. So far as the present claim is concerned Mr Christie was involved 
in arrangements for litigation funding, which included insurance and self-insurance.   

The  9th  Defendant  (Lawrence  Lumsden)  was  a  partner  in  the  separate  firm  of 
Thompsons Scotland until 31 October 2005. While he was at Thompsons Scotland he 
was responsible for the firm’s case-load of work from the NUM (Scotland area). As 
already noted he was also a member of the CG. After his retirement from Thompsons 
Scotland he continued as a consultant for Thompsons Scotland for 3 days a week and 
was employed by Thompsons (the 1st Defendant) as a consultant for 2 days a week.  

One feature of the changing forensic landscape at the time was the potential rewards 
from ATE insurance business. Thompsons had secured ATE cover from Templeton 
for  a  significant  proportion  of  its  union  cases  and,  under  an  agreement  with 
Templeton,  the  unions  were  entitled  to  a  profit  share  on  premiums  earned  on 
insurance contracts placed with Templeton. This was payable to Thompsons’s union 
clients. Not all unions insured claims in this way but the DMA and DCMT did. The 
financial consequence was that at any given time Templeton might hold substantial 
funds which, if profits, were available to the order of Thompsons’s union clients.  

 
72.	 

 
73.	 

 
74.	 

The Claimant was entitled to characterise the position in 2004 as being one in which 
personal injury litigation had ceased to be a cost to some unions and had become a 
potential source of revenue. 

The investigation of Raleys by the Law Society 

 
75.	 

In  January  and  February  2004  the  Law  Society  had  issued  a  document  entitled 
‘Compliance Board - Policy Statement. Miners’ Compensation Claims.’ 

 
76.	 

Paragraph 3 of the document was in the following terms: 

The  Compliance  Board  considers  that  the  making  of  an 
additional charge to the client is likely to give rise to: 

(i) a finding of inadequate services, and 

(ii) if there is also evidence of taking unfair advantage of the 
client by overcharging, a finding of misconduct, 

unless full information was given to the client at the start of the 
 
matter,  and 
itself 
 
reasonable. 

the  additional  charge 

involved  was

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 
Paragraph  6  of  the  Policy  Statement  made  clear  that  the  Law  Society’s  complaints 
process had been changed so that complainants were no longer required to raise their 
complaint with their solicitors. 

 
78.	 

The  CG  circulated  the  Compliance  Board  Policy  Statement  with  its  Bulletin  of  2 
February 2004, making it clear that: 

The Co-ordinating Group have always been of the clear view 
that  in  the  current  costs  regime  the  tariff  offered  by  the  DTI 
should  be  sufficient  reimbursement  for  solicitors  and  there 
should  be  no  need  for  additional  charges  to  be  raised  for 
 
Claimants  even  though  the  DTI  (unreasonably)  refuse  to  pay 
success  fees  on  CFAs  and 
in 
 
unsuccessful  cases  are  written  off.    For  some  time  new  firms 
joining  the  solicitor’s  Group  have  been  asked  to  confirm  that 
they accept this costs model.  

therefore  costs

to  deductions  from  miners’  compensation.  Information  about 

At  some  point  in  2004,  the  Law  Society  had  begun  an  investigation  into  Raleys  in 
relation 
this 
investigation  is  sparse,  but  it  appears  that  there  was  a  finding  against  Raleys  of 
inadequate professional service in two Adjudicators’ decisions, in that they failed to 
advise clients that other firms did not make MRC deductions. Raleys were directed to 
pay compensation to various clients and costs to the Law Society. The firm appealed 
those decisions without success. 

 

80.	  Mr Smith followed these investigations and attended hearings in November 2004 on 
behalf of Thompsons. His evidence was that he immediately realised the significance 
of the adjudications: 

It seemed to me at that time that if you’d made deductions in 
breach  of  the  Solicitors’  Practice  Rules,  then  the  [Solicitors 
 
Regulatory Authority] would use their regulatory powers under 
the  Solicitors’  Practice  Rules  to  ensure  that  deductions  were 
repaid.

The financial implications were potentially serious for Thompsons not least because 
 
the  levels  of  deduction  in  favour  of  the  DMA  and  DCMT  were  larger  than  the 
deductions made by Raleys in favour of the Yorkshire NUM. 

The Sunday Times article of 16 January 2005 and Sir Michael Turner’s request 
for information 

On  16  January  2005  The  Sunday  Times  published  the  first  of  a  number  of  articles 
about  deductions  made  from  damages  awarded  to  claimants  under  the  BCRDL 
scheme. The article, headed ‘Scargill’s Union gets £10m cut of miners’ sick pay’ was 
directed at the NUM (and, in particular, the Yorkshire area of the NUM) and Raleys. 
The  article  drew  attention  to  the  substantial  fees  earned  by  solicitors  acting  for 
 
claimants  and  contrasted  the  position  of  Raleys  with  firms  which  did  not  make 
deductions.

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

Some of the issues raised in this article had been previously aired by Labour Members 
of Parliament of whom one of the most active and vocal was John Mann MP. 

 
84.	 

The key charge made by the newspaper against the solicitors can be seen from one 
 
short extract: 

The  NUM,  of  which  [Arthur]  Scargill  is  honorary  president, 
linked  with  Raleys,  the  union’s  lawyers  in  its  home  base  of 
Barnsley,  South  Yorkshire,  to  help  victims.  The  scheme  had 
provided the union with a steady income as former miners who 
took  cases  with  the  firm  paid  subscription  fees  to  the  NUM 
 
during the case and an ‘administration fee of up to £750. 

Many  had  left  the  union  and  so  were  asked  to  rejoin.  They 
claim, however, that they were not told other legal firms would 
take their case for free. 

 
85.	 

Among  other  points  picked  up  in  the  article  was  the  Law  Society’s  interest  in  the 
regulatory issues. 

The allegation has now been backed by the Law Society in two 
cases  where  it  ruled  that  Raleys  had  not  properly  advised  the 
miners of their ‘liability’ to the NUM. 

 
86.	 

Thompsons  was  quick  to  recognise  that  the  practice  of  deducting  MRCs  from 
damages would face a number of challenges: on the political front from Members of 
Parliament  representing  the  interests  of  individual  constituents,  from  the  DTI,  from 
the Press and from the Law Society. 
 

 
87.	 

On  19  January  a  draft  note  was  circulated  internally  within  Thompsons  which  was 
intended to be used by the DMA. 

It is a matter of record that we deduct 7.5% to a maximum of 
£1,000  from  compensation  paid  to  miners  and  their  families. 
 
You only need to look at all the things we do as an organisation 
to understand why this is done. Unlike the deductions made by 
some solicitors and compensation claim firms, the money goes 
entirely into funding the advice and other support services that 
we provide for our members and their families. These include a 
 
free  legal  advice  line  and  advice  sessions  in  miners  clubs, 
welfare  and  community  centres  and  GP  surgeries  across  the 
North East. 

... 

It is also important for any organisation with membership and 
duties that we have to build up assets for the future. If we were 
 
to rely on volunteers in a fragmenting community such as the 
former  mining  communities  of  the  NE  are  then  there  would 
come  a  point  when  we’d  simply  run  out  of  volunteers  and 
resources and that, frankly, is where our services would end ...

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

The  note  raised  the  issue  which  would  become  the  subject  of  debate  within 
Thompsons over the following months: how to demonstrate what the firm believed 
were the real advantages to the local community of MRC funding to the DMA and the 
DCMT. The debate focussed on the back-up provided by the Durham unions and what 
was said to be the consequently higher than average settlements secured for its clients. 
  

 
89.	 

On 21 January 2005, Mr Wood emailed a draft letter to Mr King stating: 

The NUM Durham have now agreed to the mail shot. I enclose 
a revised draft letter which I'd be grateful if you could consider. 
I believe this should satisfy Law Society requirements. 

 
90.	 

At a BCRDL hearing towards the end of January 2005 Sir Michael Turner expressed 
 
his concern about the contents of The Sunday Times article and the potential impact 
on the operation of the scheme. He asked counsel for the CG (Mr David Allan QC 
and Mr Ivan Bowley) to provide a response to the article. Although it seems that the 
request  was  not  made  in  open  court  and  there  is  no  recording  of  its  terms,  Gareth 
Watkins  of  Nabarros  (the  DTI  solicitor)  recalled  being  told  of  the  request  by  his 
counsel. 

 

91.	  Mr Lumsden’s evidence was that he was waiting outside court and was told that the 
 
Judge was concerned about the article, and wanted a report on the practice of union 
deductions which had been the subject of the press criticism. As far as he was aware, 
whatever the precise nature of the request, it had been communicated in the presence 
of counsel for the DTI, and the DTI was aware of it. In his evidence he said that he 
 
was told that a report should be prepared  that dealt with the charging practices in the 
NUM Yorkshire area. 

 
92.	 

Since Raleys had been named in the article, it was decided that they would take the 
lead  in  providing  the  response.  In  a  letter  of  4  February,  Ian  Firth  of  Raleys 
highlighted the points which would need to be made in order to justify the deductions: 
for  example,  free  representation  before  DSS  Tribunals,  free  second  medical  reports 
 
where  appropriate,  the  extension  of  the  retainer  to  other  scheme  claims,  providing 
indemnities  against  defence  costs  in  litigated  cases,  as  well  as  the  achievement  of 
higher  success  rates  and  better  than  average  level  of  damages  by  union  solicitors 
where deductions were made. 

 
93.	 

The report which eventually went to Sir Michael Turner was the subject of extensive 
consultation  with  the  NUM  area  clients,  discussion  among  the  lawyers  (including 
 
counsel), and went through a number of drafts.   

 
94.	 

On 3 February, Mr Lumsden wrote to members of the CG and others: 

I have spoken to Ian Firth at Raleys, who is preparing a draft 
response  to  the  judge.  This  will  go  to  him  from  the  CG  after 
[revision]. 

As the [Sunday Times] article relates to Raleys and the practice 
in Yorkshire, it is not necessary to refer in detail to the practice 
 
in other areas in order to give the judge the explanation sought.

On the next day, Mr Firth wrote to Mr Patterson:  

After  discussion  with  David  [Allan  QC]  and  Lawrence 
Lumsden we have preliminarily agreed that it will be unwise to 
 
provide  the  court  with  details  of  the  different  NUM  area 
funding arrangements. 

... 

The focus of the article was on the union’s receipts so we need 
to  concentrate  -  indeed  the  Judge  specifically  indicated  he 
wanted  information  about  ‘where  the  money  was  going’  i.e. 
what use will it be put to? 
 

 
96.	 

On 8 February, Mr Lumsden wrote to various solicitors instructed by the NUM (‘the 
NUM solicitors’), the CG, Mr Allan QC and Mr Bowley, and others attaching a (first) 
draft report which he had prepared. 

I  have  put  together  a  draft  report  to  the  court  concerning  the 
 
contents  of  the  Sunday  Times  piece  of  16th  January  for  your 
comments. David Allan is happy that we use this as a basis for 
our deliberations as to the response to be made. 

 
97.	 

 
98.	 

On  15  February,  Mr  Lumsden  circulated  a  further  (second)  draft  to  the  NUM 
solicitors  for  consideration  at  a  meeting  of  NUM  areas  and  the  national  union  in 
Barnsley on 17 February 2005. 

On  18  February,  Mr  Lumsden  circulated  a  (third)  draft  of  the  report  to  the  NUM 
solicitors  and  to  Mr  Allan  QC.  This  incorporated  various  points  discussed  at  the 
meeting in Barnsley the previous day: 

 

It would be helpful to have David Allan’s input into the final 
version and on the issues surrounding release (mostly timing) if 
it is acceptable to the Union.  

 
99.	 

On 21 February, Mr Lumsden emailed the NUM solicitors, the CG and David Allan 
QC: 

David  Allan  has  rung  to  discuss  the  third  draft  report  to  the 
judge.  There  are  a  few  changes  to  make  and  he  is  otherwise 
satisfied with it. We’d like to add a sentence to the effect that 
the  Union  is  no  longer  in  a  position  of  receiving  substantial 
sums in dues from its active membership, given the decline in 
 
numbers employed in the coalfield in recent years … The [DTI] 
may ask for sight of the report once it is given to the judge. It 
may not be possible then to avoid its release to the department 
and the Union should be aware of that. 

100.	  On  22  February,  Mr  Lumsden  circulated  a  (fourth)  draft  of  the  report  to  the  NUM 

 

solicitors and to David Allan QC.

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

In the meantime, at some time in early to mid-February, the DTI announced a change 
of approach in relation to union deductions. In a Departmental publication entitled, 
 
‘Compensation for Miners’ (Newsletter No.10), there was a highlighted message of 
advice. 

If your solicitor is making deductions from your compensation 
via an additional fee or a union fee and did not advise you that 
other representatives are processing claims without making any 
deductions,  you  should  contact  the  Law  Society  to  make  a 
complaint [a telephone contact was provided] or you may wish 
to speak to your MP. 

 

102.	  This  apparent  encouragement  of  claimants  to  get  in  touch  with  the  Law  Society  or 
 
their  local  MP  was  regarded  with  considerable  concern  by  some  of  those  within 
Thompsons.  In  their  view  a  failure  to  distinguish  between  (a)  solicitors  making 
deductions for the benefit of unions, and (b) claims firms who made deductions for 
their own benefit, was politically naive. This reaction is illustrated by a short extract 
of an email sent by Mr Lumsden to Mr Jones on 16 February. After referring to the 
DTI’s previous position which distinguished between levies made on behalf of trades 
unions and deductions made by others, Mr Lumsden added:  

The impression given that union schemes are effectively to be 
regarded in the same way as claims’ company schemes and that 
any deduction in any circumstances ... is to be attacked if the 
 
solicitor did not give his client notice that he might receive the 
same  service  for  nothing,  is  damaging  to  unions  and  their 
arrangement for assisting members and retired members to gain 
benefits and compensation across a wide range of matters. 

However, the email also recorded that the DTI advice had been agreed with the Law 
Society after the two complaints had been upheld against Raleys.  

 

103.	  During  the  course  of  2004-2005,  Thompsons  had  itself  been  the  subject  of  three 
 
complaints made to the Law Society by clients: Mr Bell, Mr Reay and Mrs Natrass. It 
was apparent that there was an issue about the adequacy of the information provided 
to their clients and this was appreciated, in particular, by Mr King.  

 
104.	 

In  relation  to  the  complaint  by  Mr  Bell,  the  Law  Society’s  Consumer  Complaint 
Service  made  a  finding  on  12  November  2004  that  Thompsons  had  provided 
insufficient  general  client  care  and  costs  information  in  accordance  with  the 
 
requirements of the Guide to the Professional Conduct of Solicitors, 7th edition. The 
recommendation (which Thompsons accepted) was that the deduction of £536 which 
had been paid to the DMA should be repaid with compensation of £250.  

 

105.	  This was the first of the three adverse findings against Thompsons and led the firm (at 
least by the beginning of 2006 and, in the case of many of the partners, earlier) to 
 
conclude that their practice of making contractual deductions in favour of their union 
clients was open to regulatory challenge on the basis of a failure to advise clients that 
they could be represented in their claims under the CHAs by solicitors who would not 
make deductions from damages recovered under the scheme.

In addition to dealing with Sir Michael Turner’s request, Thompsons were also active 
in  lobbying  for  support  in  the  House  of  Commons  and  in  Government,  and  Lord 
Prescott was identified as one of a number of potential political allies who might be 
 
approached by Mr Hopper of the DMA.

letter from Sir Michael Turner and the issue of private correspondence 

 

107.	  On 23 March, Mr Lumsden wrote to Sir Michael Turner enclosing the report on The 
Sunday  Times  article  which  Mr  Allan  QC  had  agreed  would  be  provided.  The 
covering  letter  appears  to  have  been  sent  on  the  headed  notepaper  of  Thompsons 
(Scotland);  and  Mr  Lumsden’s  evidence  was  that,  at  least  at  this  time,  he  was  not 
acting for the English firm of Thompsons. 

108.	  After  referring  to  the  Judge’s  concerns  which  had  been  raised  with  counsel  for  the 

 

CG, the letter concluded. 

The union [the NUM] has willingly responded to the requests 
made of it for information and understands that the report is for 
your consideration. It has not authorised us to copy it to other 
parties in the litigation and so we have not done so. If you are 
minded that copies should be made available to those parties, 
we  should  be  grateful 
to  make 
representations  to  you  if  that  is  thought  appropriate,  before

109.	  The Report set out the main features in the Article and then made a number of points.  

 

110.	  First, in relation to the deductions (§7): 

 

It  is  understood  that  the  financial  terms  of  the  legal  support 
extended to retired miners  for COPD and VWF compensation 
claims by Yorkshire NUM are as follows. Claimants subscribe 
to receive the Union’s assistance to pursue a claim on a no win, 
 
no pay basis. Former members are required to bring themselves 
into a form of membership called ‘limited membership’ for the 
 
period of the claim up to a maximum duration of three years. 
The  provision  of  assistance  to  non-members  is  prohibited. 
Limited members pay half the dues of full members, the dues 
being  collected  only  upon  successful  conclusion  of  the  claim 
and not otherwise. An administration fee is charged only in the 
event that the claim succeeds, amounting to 3% deduction from 
 
damages,  capped  at  a  maximum  of  £750.  The  total  sum 
 
deducted from damages including the amount of subscriptions 
and  administration  charge  shall  not  exceed  15%  of  the 
damages’ award. Deductions made by the solicitor are not used 
to augment the solicitor’s fee, but are mandated in accordance 
 
with the claimant’s authority to the union as a condition of its 
support for the claim.

111.	  The report cited a decision in the County Court which approved this form of authority 
(§8), while drawing attention to the two complaints upheld by the Law Society that 
claimants had not been properly advised about their liability to the union, which were 
being contested by Raleys (§6). It described the range of benefits offered by the union 
in  consideration  of  the  payment  of  the  deductions  (§§9-10,  12).  There  was  also 
reference  to  the  history  of  deductions  from  damages  over  many  years  (§13).  The 
report concluded with two final points. 

112.	  First,  it  contrasted  the  practice  of  the  Yorkshire  NUM  solicitors  with  that  of  other 

 

organisations which made deductions from damages (§15). 

In  offering  their  service  within  mining  communities,  unions 
have to contend with different organisations and in particular, 
claims’  handling  companies  whose  activities  have  previously 
 
been the subject of adverse comment both by the court and the 
community 
representatives.  Many  claimants  who  might 
otherwise  have  ended  up  with  such  companies  have  gone  to 
their union and so offered their support to a non-profit making 
representative body. 

113.	  Secondly, it made a broader point (§16). 

 

Large  numbers  of  miners  and  their  families  up  and  down  the 
country  authorise  deductions  from  damages  in  favour  of  their 
union  or  former  union  because  they  support  its  activities  and 
 
recognise  that  it  has  provided  and  continues  to  provide 
important  services  within  their  communities.  The  NUM  area 
 
unions  are  governed  by  rules  which  require  funds  raised  by 
subscription  and  deductions  from  damages  to  be  used  for  the 
benefit of members and not for the purpose of making a profit. 
A  wide  variety  of  benefits  and  services  are  extended  to 
members  and  former  members,  although  it  is  recognised  that 
the  latter  do  not  pay  dues  as  active  members  due.  The  ST 
article allows little credit for such service provision. 

 

114.	  On  24  March  Sir  Michael  Turner  replied  under  the  heading  ‘National  Union  of 

Mineworkers. Allegations in the ‘Sunday Times’ - 16 January 2005. Miners COPD.’ 

Thank you for your letter dated 23 March and the report which 
accompanied  it.  As  so  often  happens,  a  full  investigation  has 
 
shown a balanced picture which is, sadly, not always the case 
with a poorly researched article. Your report explains the well 
understood  relationship  of  any  trades  union  to  its  members 
where they may have suffered personal injury in the course of 
their employment. It would not appear that the (locally based) 
NUM and the individual claimant is any different in principle 
from that which obtains in other fields. There is nothing in the 
article  which,  in  the  light  of  your  thorough  report,  requires 
either to be considered by me or referred to the Law Society. If 
 
the Audit Office has decided to undertake its own investigation,
--------

it would be surprising if it came to conclusions other than your 
own. 

From my point of view, the issue having been raised, I can see 
no objection to the release of your report to other members of 
the CG. It might serve to allay doubts which may have arisen as 
 
regard to the conduct of the NUM, which as I have said, appear 
to be groundless. 

 

115.	  As noted above, the Claimant’s case is that the private correspondence ‘was enough to 
establish both apparent bias and ... actual bias (in the sense of loss of the necessary 
objectivity)’.  Mr  Green  QC  submitted  that,  by  responding  as  he  did,  Sir  Michael 
Turner acted improperly in (a) engaging in private correspondence with one party to 
litigation and (b) implicitly agreeing that information coming to him should not go to 
the other side (the DTI). 

 

116.	  On the face of it, the direct communication between the Judge and a member of the 
CG  appears  odd.  However,  it  seems  that  although  he  was  responsible  for  the 
management  of  highly  complex  litigation  he  did  not  have  any  clerical  assistance 
 
through whom he could pass on communications. 

 

117.	  The  failure  to  inform  the  DTI  about  the  contents  of  the  CG  report  was  (at  least  in 
retrospect)  a  mistake,  because  it  suggested  that  one  party  was  telling  the  Judge 
something that it did not want the other side in the litigation to know. Even private 
communications which are thought to be essential in the overall interests of justice 
have their dangers in terms of perception: a matter which is well understood in the 
criminal and public law fields.  

 

118.	  On the other hand, I am quite clear that the Claimant has overstated the complaint. Sir 
Michael Turner was in an unusual position. He depended on both the professionalism 
of the lawyers who appeared before him and their cooperation. It is clear that he was 
uneasy about the contents of the report not being made available at least to the CG (as 
 
in due course it was); and the exchange illustrates some of the dangers of unrecorded 
hearings in private. However, it is important to bear in mind that neither Mr Allan QC 
nor  his  junior,  Mr  Bowley,  regarded  either  the  request  or  the  response  as  being 
objectionable in the context of the scheme hearings. The Sunday Times report had not 
raised any issue which was relevant to be determined between the CG and the DTI. 

 

 

119.	  Furthermore, Mr Allan QC, who was closely involved in the drafting of the report, 
was aware of the sensitivities of disclosure. His evidence, that he was concerned to 
ensure that it was a clear and accurate response to the Judge’s expressed concerns, 
was not the subject of any criticism by the Claimant. In addition, it is quite clear that 
the DTI knew about the request and Mr Lumsden was aware that the response might 
have to be disclosed to it. In the event the DTI never showed any curiosity about its 
contents. 

 

120.	  The Claimant also criticises the report as being incomplete and lacking in candour. It 
was  said  to  be  incomplete  because  it  was  limited  to  the  practices  of  the  NUM 
Yorkshire area, and was said to be lacking in candour because it did not point out that 
Thompsons were themselves being investigated by the Law Society, believed that the 
investigation was in relation to deductions, did not disclose the Law Society’s view in

the Bell case and had sent out letters to clients whose cases had not yet concluded in 
order to ‘satisfy Law Society requirements.’  

 
121.	 

In  my  view  these  criticisms  are  ill-founded.  The  analogy  with  the  principles  of 
disclosure on a ‘without notice’ application is inapposite. The request and response 
were not concerned directly with issues which had arisen in the scheme litigation. The 
report was designed specifically to meet the Judge’s concerns about matters raised in 
 
the  16  January  article.  It  was  not  intended  nor  expected  to  provide  a  running 
commentary on other issues. 

 

122.	  Nevertheless, it is clear that there were those in Thompsons who were pleased by the 
Judge’s letter of response, and that the Judge had been presented with a picture which 
would become inaccurate. This is a matter to which I will return below. 

 
123.	 

In §136 of his closing submissions Mr Green QC advanced the case on bias on the 
following basis: 

The rule as to private communication (excluding another party 
to the proceedings) is so elementary that Sir Michael Turner’s 
 
conduct  calls  for  an  explanation,  an  explanation  found  in  his 
loss  of  objectivity,    such  that  he  was  no  longer  acting  in 
accordance  with 
impartiality  and 
objectivity.  In  short,  he  had  lost  his  judicial  compass,  or  its 
indications  were  distorted  by  his  sense  of  proprietorship  over 
the  Scheme,    such  that  he  strayed  from  well-established  and 
well-understood principle, and unwisely committed himself to 
 
the  above  views  in  private  correspondence  with  Mr  Lumsden 
(and, through him, the CG). 

the  norms  of 

judicial 

 
124.	 

In  my  view  these  submissions  are  extravagant  and  unrealistic.  The  original  request 
 
was not regarded as objectionable by any of the experienced lawyers present at the 
 
time  it  was  made,  including  those  representing  the  DTI.  All  that  the  Judge  was 
 
indicating  in  his  letter  of  24  March  was  that  the  report  confirmed  his  prior 
understanding that deductions in favour of unions were not objectionable: a view of 
the matter that was apparently shared by the DTI until shortly before his letter was 
written. In due course the Judge came to see that there was more to the issue than he 
had appreciated (particularly in relation to the regulatory implications), and changed 
 
his  mind  about  it.  This  correspondence  does  not  (at  least  by  itself)  advance  the 
Claimant’s case based on bias.  

 
125.	 

In §138 of the closing submissions the Claimant’s argument was developed further: 

This  private  correspondence  was  enough  to  establish  both 
apparent  bias  and  ...  actual  bias  (in  the  sense  of  loss  of  the 
necessary  objectivity).  It  was  not  appropriate  for  him  to  have 
the  GLO  transferred  to  him,  a  fortiori  without  disclosing  the 
fact and content of the correspondence to all relevant parties ... 

 

 

126.	  For the reasons already stated, I do not accept the first part of this submission. I will 
return to the second part later in this judgment, when dealing with the transfer of the 
GLO.

where he met Mr Edwards. He left Class Law to join St David’s as a partner in 2003, 
and subsequently became one of the three founding partners of GWM. He specialised 
 
in property related matters, and his role in GWM was to run the property practice and 
 
to assist in managing the firm.  

 

131.	  Mr Evans did not give evidence. At least in relation to the GLO application, he seems 
 
to  have  assisted  Mr  Edwards,  for  example  in  liaising  with  counsel  who  were 
instructed. 

 

132.	  Mr Edwards first became aware of a potential claim on behalf of the miners for the 
recovery of union deductions at a time when he was a partner of St. Davids, in the 
 
spring or early summer of 2004. In early 2005 he was asked by John Mann MP if he 
could assist the miners in their claim for the recovery of deductions. At this stage it 
was made clear to him that the claims could only be made on the basis that claimants 
should not be exposed to any cost or financial risk. 

 

133.	  By June 2005, GWM had approximately 19 employees in what was intended to be a 
broadly  based  commercial  practice  with  an  emphasis  on  class  actions.  Mr  Edwards 
envisaged  that  the  firm  would  scale  up  quickly  by  recruiting  temporary  staff  if  the 
firm thrived. As he explained in evidence. 

Our intention was that the firm should expand rapidly off the 
back  of  the  miners’  group  litigation  as  a  ‘once  in  a  career’ 
opportunity and we intended to exploit it to the maximum. 
 

134.	  This  vision  for  the  long-term  prosperity  of  the  firm  was  imperilled  by  the  short  to 

 

medium financial difficulties it faced for some time before May 2006.  

The summer of July 2005

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 

 
135.  By at least the beginning of May 2005 Thompsons was aware that they were being 
investigated  by  the  Law  Society,  although  the  precise  nature  of  the  investigations 
 
remained  unclear  until  February  2006.  A  letter  had  been  received  by  Mr  Shears  in 
April 2005, notifying him of the investigation; and it was following this that Mr Smith 
attended a conference with John Foy QC to discuss the regulatory issues in the light 
of the findings against Raleys. Although the Law Society had not indicated the nature 
of its investigations, it was assumed that it was a response to the deductions issue; and 
the firm began to marshal the material which could be used to answer the regulatory 
case. 

 

136.  On 28 June 2005 The Times published another article. This time the focus was on the 
 
UDM, its claims handling company, Vendside Limited, and what was said to be the 
preferential treatment of the UDM by the Government.  

137.  On the same day, Mr Jones circulated an internal document proposing the line to be 

 

adopted in relation to the Law Society investigation. This included: 

Thompsons want to: 

Reach a satisfactory conclusion with the Law Society 

Inform and protect our clients 

Reinforce  the  importance  of  union  legal  services  with 
relevant MPs 

Seek positive support from the Government for union legal 
 
services  (something  recently  supported  by 
the  Lord 
 
Chancellor). 
 

138.  Mr King replied: 

 

I have given some thought to some matters. 

If the Law Society take the view that we failed to advise our 
clients about alternative methods of funding, then: 

1 They could refer us to the SDT; 

2   Order  us  to  repay  the  amounts  our  clients  paid  to  the 
union; 

3  Order us to pay the costs of the Law Society investigation

139.  On 29 June Mr Smith wrote to Mr Patterson: 

 

We  need  to  put  some  detail  on  the  statements  we  have  made 
about the quality of our service and how it differentiates from 
that  provided  by,  in  particular,  the  UDM,  Vendside  and  its 
solicitors. Here we need actual, hard, raw data, preferably using

the DTI figures where possible, which show: a) that we have 
recovered  higher  average  damages  for  each  head  on  [COPD] 
and  VWF;  and  b)  the  reason  for  that  in  respect  of  the  work 
 
which we have done. 

 

140.	  On the same date a further article was published in The Times. This was critical of 
Beresfords, the solicitors instructed by the UDM, the profits made by that firm and the 
extravagant lifestyle of its partners. 

 

141.	  On  30  June,  in  response  to  these  articles  and  the  reports  that  there  was  a  police 
investigation  into  allegations  of  fraud  by  individuals  connected  with  the  UDM  and 
Vendside, Sir Michael Turner called an Extraordinary Review Hearing in the Royal 
Courts of Justice on 5 July 2005. His email sent to members of the CG made clear that 
the hearing would consider: 

...  the situation in the light of the events recently reported in 
 
the  press  concerning  the  actions  of  the  UDM,  Vendside  and 
Beresfords.  The objective is to enable the Court to be satisfied, 
so  far  as  it  can,  what  steps  have  been  and  are  being  taken  to 
safeguard the claims handling under the CHA generally and the 
security of claims which have been made under it. 

One of the issues to be considered will be what can and should 
be done to protect the cases being handled by UDM, Beresfords 
and  Vendside  in  the  event  that  the  investigations  now  being 
undertaken by the police make it impracticable for any of those 
organisations  to  continue  to  act  on  behalf  of  claimants.  The 
Law  Society  has  therefore  beeen  invited  to  attend  and  make 
representations. 

It is of the utmost importance that: 

1. no undue delay to the progress of the scheme is 
introduced; 

2. there is re-assurance forthcoming that the problems which 
currently exist are limited to the named organisations; 

3. if there are to be problems about representation, these 
should be overcome at the earliest possible moment 

4. the hearing is convened as soon as possible and that its 
purpose is made widely known. 

 
142.	 

It is clear from this email that the Judge’s concern at this stage was about the possible 
 
effect of the police investigation on the claims of individual claimants and the proper 
representation of those claimants. 

 

143.	  At the hearing on 5 July the Law Society was represented, as well as the CG, the DTI 
 
and other interested parties. Among those who attended were Messrs Patterson, Smith 
and Lumsden.

MR JUSTICE SIMON

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 
144.  Before the hearing began the Judge made a statement which included the following.  

 

There  is  another  area  of  potential  dispute  which  concerns 
claims which have been advanced through the auspices of the 
mining unions. From time immemorial it has been part of the 
 
contract  between  a  member  and  his  union  that  the  union  will 
 
support claims made by the member against his employer. It is 
 
common  place,  if  not  universal,  for  the  union  to  deduct  a 
percentage of the sum recovered in order to cover the costs of 
other  members  whose  claims  may  not  be  successful.  It  is 
undoubtedly the fact here that many claims are being brought 
under union auspices, although it should be said that there is no 
obvious  financial  benefit  to  the  member  to  bring  his  claim  in 
this  way.  All  claims,  with  the  possible  exception  of  some 
 
brought  on  behalf  of  UDM  members,  which  are  successful 
already enjoy the benefit of the costs revision written into the 
CHA.  I  understand  that  in  some  cases  quite  substantial 
proportions  of  awards  have  been  taken  in  this  way  for  the 
benefit of the union. It is a matter for the individual union to 
consider whether the arrangements intended for a risk situation 
are compatible with what exists in the present case, that is an 
exemption  from  liability  for  costs  in  the  unsuccessful  claim, 
and  a  guaranteed  sum  of  costs  in  the  event  that  the  claims 
 
succeed. 

 

145.	  Although  expressed  in  terms  of  being  a  matter  for  individual  unions,  this  passage 
shows  that  Sir  Michael  Turner  was  doubtful  as  to  whether  the  deductions  were 
justifiable in the light of the way in which the schemes operated. To this extent the 
views he had expressed on 24 March had changed. 

 
146.	 

In a position paper, the Law Society informed the Court that it had, 

...  either  carried  out  or  will  have  shortly  carried  out 
investigations into over 30 firms of solicitors involved in VWF 
and [COPD] cases. 

 

147.	  Mr  Dutton  QC,  for  the  Law  Society  told  the  Judge  that  the  Law  Society  had  been 
investigating solicitors in relation to the handling of VWF and COPD cases and that 
this  was  the  largest  group  investigation  that  it  had  carried  out.  Its  aims  were  the 
protection of the public interest and those affected by the scheme, and to protect the 
reputation of the profession. Since its sources were confidential the Law Society felt 
constrained  as  to  what  could  be  put  in  the  public  domain.  It  was  concerned  by  the 
damage done to the solicitors profession in relation to rule breaches and inadequate 
professional services but, in its view, the Schemes were capable of being continued. 
Some  solicitors  appeared  to  have  charged  or  permitted  charges  in  breach  of 
 
Regulations 1, 8 or 9 of the Solicitors Practice Rules and in breach of Introduction and 
 
Referral Codes. 

 

148.	  There was discussion at the hearing as to the ‘serious nature’ of the Law Society’s 
concerns; and this was addressed in an exchange between Sir Michael Turner and Mr 
 
Allan QC, on behalf of the CG.
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

Mr Allan: ... your Lordship has been the supervising judge in 
this litigation since 1995 and you have been able to observe the 
manner in which this litigation has been conducted.  And you 
will  recall  in  your  judgment  you  paid  tribute  to  the  way  in 
which  the  litigation  had  been  conducted  by  those  who 
represented the claimants involved in that litigation. 

Sir Michael Turner: Subject to the matters about which we are 
 
in discussion today, that remains my view. 

Mr Allan: And it has been made clear that the lead solicitors are 
not involved in those investigations. 

 

149.	  The Claimant makes the point, confirmed in his oral evidence, that Mr Allan QC was 
unaware of any alleged regulatory breaches by any CG firm on whose behalf he was 
appearing. In fact, as already outlined, Thompsons were aware that the Law Society 
were investigating them, although they did not know the nature of those enquiries.  

150.	  However,  to  the  extent  that  Mr  Allan  was  hoping  for  the  Judge’s  unconditional 

 

endorsement of the solicitors he represented, it is clear that he did not get it. 

 

151.	  Sir Michael Turner concluded the hearing by confirming that he saw no need to make 
any special order in light of the statements made and information provided to him, 
 
and noted that: 

It would in my judgment be in the highest degree mischievous 
for any interruption to the claims’ process to be inflicted unless 
 
the court could be satisfied that irreparable harm would be done 
to the interests of justice, the claimants and the public - please 
note the word ‘irreparable.’ 

 

152.	  The transcripts of the hearing demonstrate the Judge’s approach to the issues as they 
 
appeared to him at the time. He clearly felt a responsibility for the operation of the 
 
BCRDL  scheme  which  had  come  under  attack,  but  that  does  not  mean  he  was 
 
motivated by, what Mr Green QC characterised as, ‘proprietorship,’ to the extent that 
he  would  permit  the  operation  of  the  scheme  to  operate  contrary  to  the  overall 
interests  of  justice.  Rather  the  contrary.  As  I  read  his  remarks,  he  was  saying  that, 
although he considered the proper operation of the scheme was in the overall interests 
of justice, the interests of justice might nevertheless require its interruption. However, 
before reaching such a conclusion, the orderly implementation of the scheme (with all 
its benefits to the individual claimants) would weigh heavily in the balance. His view, 
which took into account both the potential importance of regulatory breaches and the 
public interest in the continuation of the Scheme, at least to some extent, replicated 
 
the  views  of  the  Law  Society.    Importantly  in  the  context  of  the  present  claim  the 
 
Judge did not exhibit a fixed predisposition. 

Templeton Insurance Limited. 
 

 

153.	  At some point Mr Edwards had been introduced to Mr Anthony Fresson (a business 
associate of Mr Ridgway). Mr Fresson was an insurance broker who, at this point in 
his  career,  acted  as  a  consultant  to  Templeton.  Although  he  acted  as  a  conduit
--------

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

between GWM and Templeton, Mr Fresson was not directly involved in the obtaining 
of the GLO ATE. 

 

154.	  Templeton was an insurance company incorporated and based in the Isle of Man. In 
addition to being the managing director Mr Brunswick was executive chairman, and 
Phil  Maule  was  the  underwriting  and  claims  manager.  Templeton  had  previously 
agreed  to  provide  ATE  insurance  to  clients  of  GWM  in  two  of  its  group  litigation 
cases  (the  British  Biotech  and  Claims  Direct  claims).  These  two  claims  were 
conducted by GWM on the basis of CFAs supported by ATE insurance. Neither were 
GLO claims.  

 
155.	 

In  a  telephone  conversation  between  Mr  Edwards  and  Mr  Brunswick,  which  took 
place shortly before the end of June 2005, Mr Brunswick agreed to instruct Mr Maule 
 
to provide ATE cover for the miners’ claims at an agreed level of cover of £1m. 
  

 

156.	  According to Mr Edwards’s witness statement: 

 

The  position  adopted  by  Templeton  was  very  different  to  the 
two  previous  cases  which  we  had  obtained  insurance  from 
them,  the  Claims  Direct  and  British  Biotech  cases.  In  those 
cases,  we  had  been  obliged  to  work  hard  to  persuade 
Templeton  of  the  merits  of  insuring  the  cases,  including 
 
obtaining  counsel’s  opinion.  For  the  miners’  GLO,  Mr 
Brunswick told me, ‘I know all about it, I have read all about it, 
it’s  a  good  case,  let’s  do  it’,  or  words  to  that  effect  and 
Templeton agreed to cover it immediately. 

 

157.	  Mr  Brunswick’s  agreement  to  underwrite  was  made  without  having  neither 
underwriting  information  or  counsel’s  advice.  Furthermore  he  had  plainly  not 
considered  the  broader  commercial  implications  of  insuring  the  claim.  As  matters 
 
turned  out  his  commitment  to  the  insurance  of  the  GLO  was  to  prove  highly 
unreliable. 

 

158.	  On 28 June Mr Edwards emailed a draft press release to Mr Maule describing how 
GWM  had  been  instructed  to  issue  legal  proceedings  against  solicitors  and  certain 
claims management companies. The draft included quotations from the February DTI 
newsletter (no.10) and referred to Templeton’s involvement as the insurer. In his reply 
Mr Maule suggested that Mr Edwards add the information that the premium (45%) 
was agreed to be deferred as well as insured and that Templeton was a specialist ATE 
insurer. 

 

 

159.	  As  already  noted,  a  problem  which  Mr  Brunswick  had  not  foreseen  was  how 
Templeton’s  support  for  the  miners’  deduction  claims  would  impact  on  its 
commercial relationship with Thompsons. This relationship went back to 2002, when 
 
Templeton had begun to provide ATE insurance for the claims of Thompsons’ clients. 
This  amounted  to  approximately  50%  of  the  ATE  business  placed  by  Thompsons. 
Although  Thompsons  decided  at  the  end  of  November  2005  that  there  would  be  a 
 
40%  reduction  in  this  business,  the  business  relationship  between  Thompsons  and 
Templeton continued throughout the material time.
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 

 
160.  This  relationship  between  Templeton  and  Thompsons  was  unusual,  but  consistent 
with the relationship between Thompsons and its union clients. Templeton received 
an advance premium of £50 when issuing a certificate of insurance. Thompsons was 
liable to top up the premium fund if it proved insufficient to pay claims. Any profit in 
the accounts of Templeton was treated as held on behalf of the unions.  

 

161.  Mr  Booth  had  been  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  Thompsons  between  2000  and 
2002, and thereafter was paid a retainer of £7,000 per month for consultancy work. 
From  31  July  2005  to  March  2006,  he  continued  to  be  paid  by  Thompsons  for 
consultancy services as and when requested. 

 

162.  Between  2002  and  2007  Mr  Booth  (either  in  a  personal  capacity  or  through  his 
company  VISP  Ltd)  assisted  Templeton  in  obtaining  ATE  legal  expense  insurance 
business  from  various  solicitors,  including  Thompsons.  For  each  case  placed  by 
Thompsons  with  Templeton  he  was  paid  a  commission  of  £20.  This  was  a  secret 
commission paid to Mr Booth, unknown to his principal, Thompsons. Significantly in 
the present context, it placed Mr Booth in a position of conflict between his interest 
and his duty (such as it was) to Thompsons.  

163.  The Claimant has characterised Mr Booth’s position as follows: 

 

[His]  relationship  with  Templeton  was  such  that  he  was 
 
uniquely  placed  to  act  on  Thompson’s  behalf  in  directing, 
persuading  or  pressurising  Templeton  with  regard  to  its 
 
provision of ATE insurance to GWM’s miner clients. 

 
164. 

If the suggestion is that Mr Booth acted on behalf of Thompsons to bring pressure on 
Templeton, I reject it. Mr Booth was acting at all material times in his own interest. If 
it happened also to be in Thompsons’s interest, it was not because he was acting on 
 
their behalf but because it was in Mr Booth’s concealed financial interest. 
  

 

 

165.  On  30  June  an  article  in  The  Times  referred  to  GWM’s  involvement  in  potential 
 
claims  on  behalf  of  miners  who  had  signed  agreements  consenting  to  deductions 
being made from damages. 

 

166.  On 29 June GWM wrote a letter to Vendside Ltd notifying the company of a claim 
and informing it that an application would be made to court for a GLO on 1 July. In 
its  reply  of  7  July,  Vendside  Ltd’s  solicitors,  Brooke  North,  commented  on  ‘the 
 
brevity and generality’ of the letter and drew attention to the Practice Direction to the 
 
Pre-Action  Protocol.  Inadequate  preparation  followed  by  inexplicable  delay  was  to 
prove characteristic of GWM’s conduct of the litigation. 

 

167.  At a meeting on 7 July in the Isle of Man, attended by Mr Edwards, Mr Fresson, Mr 
Brunswick and Mr Maule, the outline of the ATE cover was agreed. The broad terms 
would be the same as those agreed for the British Biotech and Claims Direct ATE 
insurance: cover of £1m at a premium of 45%, to be deferred but never to be paid by 
the  claimant  miners.  One  point  which  arose  was  the  position  of  Thompsons. 
Templeton indicated that it could not insure against Thompsons because they were ‘a 
big  client  of  Templeton.’  There  may  have  been  some  further  discussion  about  this 
because Mr Edwards also noted:
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

Offer Thompsons a solution - ADR - Mediation etc and if they 
 
refuse [Templeton] will insure. 

 
168.	 

It is striking that, although Templeton had agreed to provide ATE cover in the British 
Biotech and Claims Direct claim, it had still not issued any policies in respect of these 
risks  over  4  months  later.  This  casual  and  uncontractual  approach  to  its  legal 
obligations  was  a  feature  of  Templeton’s  and  Mr  Brunswick’s  way  of  conducting 
business. The GLO policy wording was not provided until April 2006 and the British 
Biotech and Claims Direct policies seem never to have been produced.  

 

169.	  Significantly  for  present  purposes,  it  was  agreed  by  Mr  Edwards  that  neither 
Thompsons nor its NUM client would be intended defendants under the terms (such 
as they were) of Templeton’s ATE insurance cover. 

 

170.	  Following this meeting, Mr Edwards drafted documentation to be used in connection 
with the miners’ deduction claim. The documents consisted of (1) a Conditional Fee 
Agreement between the client miner and GWM, (2) an insurance proposal form, (3) 
 
an insurance wording drafted by Mr Edwards on the basis of previous ATE insurance 
provided by Templeton, and (4) a document headed,  

Mineworkers’ Group Action. The GWM Guarantee to Clients. 
No win, no fee, no risk, no cost. 

 

171.	  On 4 August 2005 Mr Powles QC and Mr Oliver Campbell gave a written advice to 
GWM  about  the  impact  of  the  Law  Society  investigations  on  the  proposed  GLO 
application. 

 
172.	 

It was recognised that the GLO had the potential to disrupt the ongoing Law Society 
investigation, that there would be difficulties in pursuing the claim against the UDM 
and Vendside without joining the solicitors, and that a GLO would provide a means 
for appropriate case management of the claim. Additionally, and by reference to the 
transcript of the 5 July hearing, it was noted that the Law Society had suggested that 
the validity of the Vendside agreement might be resolved in civil litigation, and that 
the  proposed  proceedings  would  probably  lead  to  a  stay  of  the  Law  Society 
 
proceedings. 
  

 
173.	 

In a letter dated 4 August, GWM wrote to Sir Michael Turner, under the heading, DTI 
‘Coal Health Compensation Scheme,’ notifying him of their, 

...  intention  to  apply  in  the  very  near  future  for  a  [GLO]  on 
behalf of any miners who have been charged unnecessary fees 
 
their  unions,  and/or  solicitors  or  claims  handling 
by 
organisation ... 

In the light of the above our firm would consider itself to be an 
interested  party  in  respect  of  the  issues  which  we  understand 
were discussed at the Hearing before you at the High Court on 
5th July 2005. 

 

We also understand that at a Hearing the issue of the lawfulness 
or  otherwise  of  the  DTI’s  CHA  with  the  [UDM]  and  its
--------

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

subsidiary Vendside Ltd was debated. Clearly the lawfulness of 
this  Agreement  is  significant  to  our  clients  in  respect  of  their 
 
proposed claims. 

 
174.	 

It  is  striking  that,  having  considered  the  transcripts  of  the  5  July  hearing,  GWM 
considered that an appropriate forum for debating the issues which were likely to arise 
 
on the GLO application was a BCRDL scheme hearing before Sir Michael Turner. It 
is also striking that the Judge did not share that view. 

 

175.	  On 7 August, he replied. 

 

I have to acknowledge your letter dated 4 August in regard to 
the above compensation scheme. It is not immediately clear to 
me  why  you  should  be  writing  to  me,  except  perhaps  as  a 
matter of courtesy. The issue of the legality, or otherwise of the 
agreements  made  between  UDM,  Vendside  and  any  other 
claims handling organisation is not a matter which is of interest 
in the litigation of which I am the Managing Judge. If you were 
present  at  the  meeting  which  was  held  on  5  July,  you  would 
appreciate  that  the  enforceability  of  agreements  between  the 
named  organisations  and  the  individual  miners  is  something 
which the Law Society was to investigate, and possibly litigate, 
 
with interested solicitors. It was not the intention or expectation 
that the BCRDL would be concerned directly with that issue. 

 

I would be grateful to receive your assurance that you will send 
a copy of your letter to me to the Chief Executive of the Law 
Society. 

If you should wish to be present and make representations to, 
the Court in relation to any matters of true mutual interest, you 
should  notify  Nabarro  Nathanson  (DTI)  and  Irwin  Mitchell 
(CG)  of  your  intention  so  to  do  at  the  earliest  reasonable 
opportunity,  identifying  the  issue(s)  which  you  wish  to 
ventilate.  I  have  taken  the  liberty  of  copying  your  letter,  to 
them  so  that  they  will  already  be  aware  of  your  potential 
   
involvement. 

The autumn of 2005 

 

176.	  The legal case for recovery of MRC deductions proceeded in tandem with a political 
 
and  press  campaign  centred  on  an  organisation  named  Action  Group  for  Miners 
(AGM), under the chairmanship of a retired police officer and Labour politician with 
connections  to  the  North-East  of  England,  Lord  Mackenzie.  Although  the  legal 
 
proceedings conducted by GWM and the broader campaign conducted by AGM were 
intended  to  be  separate  their  activities  overlapped  in  a  way  which  was  to  cause 
difficulties to GWM.  

 
177.	 

It  is  convenient  to  pick  up  the  narrative  at  the  beginning  of  October  2005.  By  this 
stage Thompsons had discovered that Templeton was insuring the miners claim for 
wrongful deduction of MRCs. On 5 October Mr Shears challenged Mr Booth about
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

this  at  a  meeting  between  them.  Mr  Booth’s  note  to  Mr  Edwards  (copied  to 
Templeton) reads: 

As  agreed  I  am  reporting  back  on  my  meeting  with  Geoff 
Shears (CEO) yesterday. 

It is obvious that someone has let the cat out of the bag as his 
first  words  were  ‘I  understand  that  Templeton  are  insuring  a 
firm  looking  to  sue  lawyers  involved  in  scheme  cases’.  He 
 
appears  to  be  unsure  of  the  firm  involved  ...    This  opening 
gambit put me somewhat on the back foot & I had to reassess 
my tactics accordingly. 

Consequently  I  countered  by  saying  that  Ralph  [Brunswick] 
had approached me & said that, because of his long relationship 
with the firm, he was hopeful an agreement could be reached 
with Thompsons to, at best, take Thompsons out of the picture 
or, alternately, reach a mediated settlement which enabled them 
to restrict the cost to the firm & allow them to handle the spin 
 
on the settlement. 

 

178.	  On 11 October 2005 GWM sent claim letters to various prospective defendants in the 
group  litigation.  The  letters  were  in  similar  form.  Former  clients  of  the  proposed 
defendants who were now GWM clients were identified; the amount of the deduction 
was specified; the basis of the claim was set out, with references to breaches of the 
Solicitors’  Costs  Information,  Client  Care  Code  1999  and  alleged  fiduciary 
obligations;  demand  for  repayment  was  made;  information  about  other  clients  for 
whom the recipients of the letter acted was requested; and the intention to apply for a 
 
GLO forthwith was stated (subject to any reply). 

 

179.	  On Friday 21 October GWM sent a claim letter to Thompsons on behalf of its client, 
Barbara Hardy. It differed to the claim letters sent on 11 October. Mr Shears was the 
named addressee and the letter contained the following: 

We have been instructed to issue proceedings against your firm 
and  are  going  to  issue  an  application  for  a  Group  Litigation 
Order (‘GLO’) next week. If that application is granted and a 
 
GLO  is  made  all  miners  who  assert  a  claim  against  the 
defendants will be encouraged to participate in the action.

Respondent/Defendant in those proceedings because it appears 
to us that agreement is capable of being reached with your firm 
in relation to the reimbursement of clients that will obviate the 
 
need for your firm to be sued and we are prepared to engage in 
 
a  discussion  with  you  in  this  regard  to  attempt  to  resolve  the 
issue  and  reach  a  settlement  for  clients  who  are  entitled  to 
reimbursement.  If  we  and  our  clients  are  persuaded  that  your 
firm  has  no  liability  then  we  will  advise  our  clients  not  to 
pursue  claims  against  your  firm  but,  if  you  are  wrong,  we

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

would  expect  you  to  adopt  a  policy  whereby  clients  who  are 
entitled to reimbursement are paid. 

As GWM well knew, the real reason why it had ‘desisted’ from including Thompson 
as  a  defendant  was  that  Templeton  had  made  clear  that  it  would  not  insure  claims 
against Thompsons unless attempts at mediation failed. 

180.	  The letter continued, 

 

In relation to the basis for its claim against your firm we refer 
to the case of Mrs Barbara Hardy handled by your Newcastle 
firm ... 

 

181.	  The letter then set out in detail the union funding agreement under which a deduction 
of £845.47 had been made from the damages awarded to Mrs Hardy, and referred to 
the  regulatory  infractions  upon  which  the  claim  for  repayment  was  advanced:  rule 
9(1) of the Solicitors’ Practice Rules 1990, s.2(3) of the Solicitors Introduction and 
Referral Code 1990 and the Solicitors’ Costs Information and Client Care Code 1999. 
The letter made a number of requests for information, and continued. 

In our view the matters we have identified above amount, either 
individually or collectively, to a clear breach of your fiduciary 
 
duty to Mrs Hardy and also of your duty of care towards her. 
There are a considerable number of other prospective claimants 
in the same position as Mrs Hardy. 

… 

We suggest that we now agree that we will attempt to resolve 
the  issue  of  your  liability  to  reimburse  clients  by  Alternative 
Dispute  Resolution  and  that  a  structured  mediation  is  the 
appropriate form of ADR. 

 

Mediation  is  confidential,  is  not  costly,  is  quick  and  could 
result in an outcome that is positively reported and received.  

It is of course crucial for the interests of all your clients to be 
represented  at  any  mediation  and  we  would  suggest  agreeing 
the terms of a letter that you could write to each client who we 
 
believe would be entitled to participate in a GLO [if your firm 
were cited as a Defendant]. 

That  way  we  can  ensure  that  if  a  settlement  is  reached,  the 
settlement is inclusive and final. We would suggest too that the 
mediation be held under the terms of a set of Rules agreed by 
your firm and ours, and that the clients form a committee which 
 
will represent them at the mediation. 

We believe that we can avoid having to sue your firm and that 
by the process that we have suggested: -
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

-  all  of  those  clients  who  are  entitled  to  be  reimbursed  are 
reimbursed; and 

- those who are not entitled to be reimbursed are content that 
they  had  been  properly  charged  and  have  no  claim  against 
you. 

We hope that this letter will be well received in the spirit that it 
is written and look forward to your written and urgent response. 

 

182.	  There  are  a  number  of  strange  features  of  this  letter.  First,  although  GWM 
commended the confidentiality of mediation, it appeared to envisage the publication 
of the outcome. It is unclear in whose interest this would have been other than GWM, 
for the purpose of publicising its successful efforts. Secondly, it appeared to require 
that  Thompsons  give  all  its  clients  the  opportunity  to  instruct  GWM  in  respect  of 
deductions,  and  be  represented  by  GWM  in  the  mediation.  Thirdly,  for  no  stated 
reason it called for an urgent reply. 

 

183.	  The letter could not have been seriously intended to elicit a positive response. It was 
plainly written so as to satisfy what GWM understood to be a condition precedent to 
Templeton’s agreement to provide cover for any claim against Thompsons, and was 
framed to achieve more than could have been achieved under a GLO order.    

 

184.	  GWM’s letter was passed on to Mr Smith who dealt with the response.  

 

 

185.	  Also on 21 October 2005 a press release was released on behalf of AGM, confirming 
that the GLO application was to be issued at the High Court on 26 October by GWM. 
 
The press release stated that there were ‘estimated to be up to 500,000 miners’ who 
had not received the full compensation in respect of their scheme claims, and quoted 
Lord Mackenzie calling on miners with outstanding claims and miners who had been 
over-charged in concluded cases to seek assistance from AGM. 

Lord  Mackenzie,  President,  Action  Group 
for  Miners, 
commented,  ‘Miners  wishing  to  make  a  compensation  claim 
will be best off with AGM. AGM has been set up to ensure that 
miners  get  all  the  compensation  owing  to  them  so  we  have 
assembled  an  expert  team  to  represent  them.  Those  miners 
seeking  compensation  should  not  have  to  pay  any  third  party 
for  managing  their  claim.  The  DTI  has  put  in  place  a  direct 
payment  structure,  therefore  miners  should  not  have  to  stand 
any  legal  or  other  costs  of  bringing  their  claim.  Excessive 
charging  has  gone  on  in  the  past  and  is  unacceptable  and 
miners who want to report those who have acted improperly to 
the Law Society will be assisted by us in this regard. 

The press release was seen by Thompsons and by the CG. 

Monday 24 October 

186.	  On 24 October, Mr Smith spoke to John Foy QC by telephone and then began to draft 

 

a response to GWM’s letter of 21 October.

MR JUSTICE SIMON

187.	  On the same day Mr Lumsden wrote to Sir Michael Turner: 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

Earlier this year you asked the CG to prepare a report for you 
about allegations made in an article appearing in The Sunday 
Times  on  16th  January  2005,  concerning  deductions  from 
damages operated by the National Union of Mineworkers. 

I conferred with all of the main firms representing NUM Areas 
 
who are part of the BCRDL before reporting to you. 

At  the  Court  Hearing  in  July  this  year,  the  Law  Society 
reported  that  it  has  been  discussing  deductions  from  damages 
with a number of firms who do so under client authority. The 
Society will be meeting my colleagues in Thompsons England 
and Wales very soon. 

My colleagues are anxious that all of the material that might be 
relevant to a full and proper consideration of matters should be 
available  to  the  Society,  including  the  CG  Report  and  your 
letter of 24th March which responds to it. I have attached the 
letter to this e-mail for your convenience. 

Although your response was not designated a confidential item, 
you may recall that the report itself was submitted to you as a 
document  which 
remain 
confidential, unless you were minded that it should be available 
to  other  parties,  in  which  event  the  Union  asked  for  the 
opportunity to be heard by the Court. As it transpired, this was 
not necessary. 

the  NUM  proposed

Thompsons would now like to present the report and your letter 
of response to it as part of the paperwork that the Law Society 
will review and have asked me to write to you in case you have 
 
any  difficulty  with  that.  I  have  discussed  the  matter  with  Mr. 
Tucker and although neither of us believe that there should be a 
fundamental  difficulty,  we  both  think  it  right  to  seek  your 
approval. 

Thompsons are separately approaching the NUM to obtain their 
formal permission to disclose the report, which is unlikely to be 
withheld given the circumstances. 

 

188.	  The  Claimant  contends  that  the  purpose  of  this  letter  was  to  remind  Sir  Michael 
Turner of the views which he had expressed in March in favour of union deductions 
 
as part of the conspiracy to ensure that a biased Judge heard the GLO application. His 
pleaded case (at §90A of the Re-amended Particulars of Claim) is as follows: 

On  24  October  2005,  three  days  after  Thompsons’  receipt  of 
GWM’s  letter  before  action,  Mr  Lumsden  reminded  Sir 
Michael  Turner  of  his  considered  or  concluded  views,
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

formulated as a result of his receipt of the Report and set out in 
the letter of 24 March 2005. 

 

189.	  The  letter  may  have  had  the  effect  of  reminding  the  Judge  of  the  views  he  had 
expressed in the March letter. However, for the reasons already set out above, I am 
 
clear that the Judge did not have fixed and predetermined views, and that his mind 
was  not  closed  to  contrary  persuasion.  It  remains  to  consider  what  Mr  Lumsden’s 
purpose was in writing as he did. 

 
190.	 

In his witness statement at §6.23 he gave his explanation.  

At  this  point  I  understood  that  Thompsons  were  considering 
their response to matters raised during the investigation by the 
Law  Society  into  deductions.  Mr  Shears  ...  contacted  me  and 
asked me if Thompsons could present the report together with 
Sir  Michael's  letter  responding  to  it  to  the  Law  Society.  It 
seemed  to  me  that  this  shouldn't  be  done  without  the 
 
permission of the Judge and so I wrote to him. 
 

 
191.	 

In  cross-examination  Mr  Lumsden  responded  to  the  allegation  that  the  letter  to  the 
Judge was a response to GWM’s letter written on behalf of Mrs Hardy. 

There wasn’t any prompt, not made known to me. I received a 
 
request  from  Mr  Shears  …  to  send  the  Judge’s  letter  and  the 
report  as  part  of  the  Law  Society  paperwork  the  firm  wanted 
the  Law  Society  to  review,  and  there  wasn’t  any  connection 
between  that  and  the  Hardy  letter  or  other  things  that  were 
going on, not that I was aware of. 

192.	  Mr Shears’s witness statement also dealt with Mr Lumsden’s letter to Sir Michael. 

 

I cannot actually remember asking Lawrence Lumsden to write 
the letter of 24 October 2005 … but on reflection I believe it is 
probable  I  did  ask  him  to  do  so.  I  remember  discussing  and 
agreeing  with  Lawrence  Lumsden  that  it  was  a  good  thing  to 
get this correspondence with the Judge into an arena with the 
Law  Society  and  any  other  arena  that  would  help.  I  don't 
 
remember ever having seen the letter. 

193.	  He too was asked whether it was a coincidence that the letter of claim arrived on 21 

 

October and Mr Lumsden sent his letter on 24 October. He said that it was. 

 

194.	  Although  I  can  see  why  the  Claimant  views  the  sequence  of  correspondence  with 
suspicion,  having  heard  the  evidence  of  Mr  Lumsden  and  Mr  Shears,  I  have 
 
concluded that their evidence should be accepted. Although the letter on behalf of Mrs 
Hardy had been received by Thompsons, it did not raise the immediate prospect of 
litigation and was a matter that was being handled by Mr Smith. I see no sufficient 
reason not to treat Mr Lumsden’s letter of 24 October at face value: as a wish to put 
before the Law Society the views expressed by Sir Michael Turner in March 2005. 
Whether it would have carried very much weight in view of the regulatory issues the 
Law Society was considering is another matter.

Tuesday 25 October 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 

195.	  At 11.15 on 25 October Sir Michael Turner replied to Mr Lumsden’s request, saying 
  
that he was content that his letter of 24 March should be released to the Law Society. 

 
196.	 

In  an  internal  email  timed  at  16.50  Mr  Lumsden  forwarded  Sir  Michael  Turner’s 
email consent to Mr Shears and Mr Smith.   

Approval  for  disclosure  has  been  given  by  the  judge  -  see 
enclosed. 

I  have  read  the  fax  from  Phil  [Smith]  and  the  material  from 
 
[GWM]. 

I think the Rule 9 point was covered with Hugh James and the 
letter copied to Phil earlier this year. 
 

Phil's note of conference with Counsel does not I think cover 
Rule  9 - was this dealt with at an earlier meeting or by separate 
Note from Counsel? 
 

I  suggest  that  Counsel  should  be  appraised  of  the  recent 
[GWM] letter and its threat. 

The judge has indicated very recently, that he wants progress 
on  the  enforceability  point  (the  UDM  /  Vendside  contracts) 
which the Law Society agreed in July, could be determined by 
him but which has been forgotten since then. 

See also enclosed press release from Action for Miners, a front 
for [GWM] and perhaps others. 

Does anyone know who Lord Mackenzie is? 
 

…. 

PS Have received Phil [Smith]’s draft letter to [GWM]. 

 
197.	 

It is clear, at least at this point, that Mr Lumsden and Mr Shears were dealing with a 
number of different but overlapping issues: the GWM claim on behalf of Mrs Hardy, 
the  Law  Society  and  the  regulatory  issues,  the  involvement  of  AGM  and  Lord 
Mackenzie, and the ambit of future hearings before Sir Michael Turner, in particular, 
the possibility of a determination of the issues raised by the UDM/Vendside contracts.   

 

Wednesday 26 October 

 

198.	  On  26  October  2005  GWM  emailed  Irwin  Mitchell  with  a  copy  of  the  GLO 
application and supporting documents. These appear to have been either in draft or 
incomplete, because GWM wrote on the following day with a copy of the application 
 
and supporting documents which had been issued on 27 October.
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 

 
199.	  During  the  course  of  26  October,  Thompsons  sent  a  reply  to  GWM’s  letter  of  21 
October  in  which  it  responded  to  and  rejected  the  allegations  of  breach  of  the 
regulations which GWM had relied on. 

200.	  An earlier draft was in the following form:  

 

We are satisfied that the legal advice and assistance agreement 
is  lawful  as  between  our  client  and  the  union.  It  reflects  the 
well-understood  basis  of  union  legal  advice  and  assistance 
schemes  and  the  role  which  they  have  played  for  decades  in 
establishing  rights  to  compensation  for  personal  injuries 
suffered. 

 

This became: 

We are satisfied that the legal advice and assistance agreement 
is  lawful  as  between  our  client  and  the  union.  It  reflects  the 
basis well-understood by the courts, of union legal advice and 
assistance  schemes  and  the  role  which  they  have  played  for 
 
decades  in  establishing  rights  to  compensation  for  personal 
injuries suffered (emphasis added). 

 

 
201.	 

In my view the Claimant is right to identify the change as an allusion to the views 
which Sir Michael Turner had expressed in his letter of 24 March 2005. 

202.	  AGM’s 21 October press release was the subject of a letter from Mr Tucker to Sir 

 

Michael Turner on behalf of the CG. 

I write following consultation with my colleagues and Counsel 
to  provide  you  with  a  copy  of  a  press  release  issued  by  an 
organisation  called  [AGM].  It  seems  appropriate  to  draw  this 
press release to your attention because this organisation, by its 
 
press  release,  is  critical  of  the  operation  of  the  scheme  and 
invites Claimants to transfer their instructions to AGM who in 
turn  will  put  them  in  touch  with  ‘one  of  the  team  of  leading 
solicitors  firms’.  In  our  view,  the  claims  made  by  AGM,  are 
inaccurate  and  misleading.  Any  significant  transfer  of  claims 
 
from  existing  advisers  to  this  organisation  would  cause 
dislocation to the scheme. 

One  firm  of  solicitors  who  are  named  in  the  press  release, 
[GWM], have recently joined the CSG having informed us that 
they are acting for a number of former mine workers pursuing 
claims  following  the  transfer  of  instructions.  We  have  asked 
Greene  Wood  &  McLean  to  provide  us  with  a  copy  of  the 
Group Action application that it is said is being lodged with the 
 
High Court today. 

It  is,  in  our  view,  objectionable  that  Claimants  who  have  no 
complaint with regard to the service provided by their current 
legal  adviser  are  being 
instructions 

induced 

transfer

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

elsewhere. There is, of course, no objection if Claimants wish 
to transfer because they are dissatisfied with the service and/or 
because they may be concerned about charges that have been 
raised of them. 

It seems to us that the activities of AGM as framed in this press 
release  cross  the  line  between  the  regulatory  rules  that  affect 
solicitors that may be on their panel (there is no regulation of 
AGM) and potentially fall within the jurisdiction of the Court 
in view of the criticism made of the operation of the scheme. It 
is  for  this  reason  that  we  consider  it  appropriate  to  draw  the 
 
press  release  to  your  attention.  We  will  consider  the  position 
 
further  as  and  when  we  receive  a  response  from  [GWM]  and 
 
we  have  had  an  opportunity  to  consider  that  which  may  be 
published  in  the  media  as  a  consequence  of  the  press  release 
and the offer to provide interviews. 

I have copied this letter to the DTI. 

 

203.	  A number of points arise from this letter. First, it was written by Mr Tucker (who had 
never acted for union clients) on behalf of the CG and not on behalf of any of the 
solicitors who were facing claims in the GLO application. Secondly, it drew attention 
to  AGM’s  criticism  of  the  administration  of  the  BCRDL  scheme  and  the  potential 
dislocation  to  the  scheme  if  there  were  significant  transfers  from  current  legal 
advisors. Thirdly, there was a reference to GWM’s intention to apply for a GLO.  

 

204.	  Although  Mr  Lumsden  accepted  that  he  liaised  with  Mr  Tucker  in  relation  to  the 
 
drafting  of  the  letter,  it  was  plainly  written  on  behalf  of  the  CG  and  expressed  the 
concerns of CG and its Counsel about the activities of the AGM and the potential for 
wholesale disruption of scheme’s operation.  

205.	  At  19.09  Sir  Michael  Turner  responded  by  email  copied  to  the  DTI  and  the  Law 

 

Society. 

To all interested parties;  

Please  find  attached  my  letter  to  Andrew  Tucker  of  the  CG 
which is also of immediate interest to you. 

It was not sent to GWM. 

206.	  The attached letter was in the following terms: 

 

Your  letter  by  e-mail  came  as  no  surprise  to  me.  As  it 
happened, I heard an interview on radio 4 this morning in the 
course  of  which  the  purpose  and  activities  [AGM]  was  the 
subject of discussion. Again it comes as no surprise to me that 
[GWM] are involved, since they had threatened some months 
back that they were minded to seek a group litigation order for 
 
the very purpose which has been adopted by [AGM]. They had 
sought  my  permission  to  appear  at  the  review  hearings  as
--------

‘persons  interested’.  I  informed  them  that  if  they  wanted  to 
appear  at  the  Review  Hearings  they  would  need  to  make  the 
appropriate application. I heard nothing more from, or of, them 
until this morning. 

These are matters of great concern to me as the developments 
 
are calculated, if not intended, to destabilise the scheme as it is 
 
running at present for what appear to be spurious reasons. One 
possible view of [AGM] is that this is a thinly veiled attempt to 
 
circumvent  Solicitors'  Practice  Rules  through  the  front  of  a 
 
company which claims to be a charity. Of course, I am unable 
 
to say that this is the case, but it is a matter in which the Law 
Society  should  interest  itself  as  a  matter  of  extreme  urgency. 
 
You  will  be  aware  that  I  recently  wrote  to  that  organisation 
expressing  my  concern  about  the  lack  of  overt  action  to 
challenge the legality and enforceability of deductions made by 
UDM/Vendside from miners' awards. It is this area which the 
AGM seek to exploit. 

To  the  extent  that  [AGM]  claim  that  they  are  able  to  short 
circuit  ‘bureaucracy  and  excessive  charging’,  this  is  almost 
 
certainly both misleading and mischievous. 

What action the CG should take, is not at this stage for me to 
dictate.  Suffice  it  that  I  would  be  sympathetic  to  any 
application  to  reconvene  a  further  Extraordinary  Review 
 
Hearing  provided  that  a  substantive  basis  for  such  an 
 
application can be found. 

For  reasons  which  will  be  self-evident,  this  letter  is  being 
copied  to  Nabarro  Nathanson  and  the  Law  Society  (Russell 
Wallman). 

 

207.	  The Claimant submits that the contents of this letter illustrate Sir Michael Turner’s 
 
hostility to GWM and its clients. I disagree. GWM is mentioned in the first paragraph 
in terms which are neither hostile nor untrue. The second paragraph deals primarily 
with AGM and the claims it made in the press release. The Judge’s concern was that 
 
AGM were attempting to get around the Solicitors’ Practice Rules and that this was a 
matter  of  legitimate  concern  to  the  Law  Society.  The  Judge  also  referred  to  his 
concern,  first  expressed  at  the  5  July  hearing,  in  relation  to  the  legality  and 
enforcement of the UDM/Vendside deductions. His views about AGM’s claims to be 
able to short circuit bureaucracy were not unreasonable.  

 

208.	  Although  the  word  ‘calculated’  might  have  been  better  expressed  as  ‘have  the 
potential to’, I do not read the letter as constituting either a complaint about GWM nor 
a threat to report GWM to the Law Society. Nor do I consider that it demonstrates a 
fixed predisposition against GWM and its clients. It is important to note that the letter 
 
was sent to the DTI which did not consider that the letter gave rise to any reason for 
the Judge not to be involved in the GLO application, and to note that the GLO did not 
concern transfer cases, only deductions in settled cases.

209.	  At 10.55 on 27 October Mr Lumsden wrote to Messrs Shears, Smith and Thompson: 

 

The judge is now interested in the AGM move - not unhelpfully 
- there may be another extraordinary hearing. 

More to follow. 

210.	  This  was  clearly  a  reference  to  the  contents  of  Sir  Michael  Turner’s  letter  of  26 

 

October 2005. 

 

211.	  GWM’s GLO application was brought against (1) Ashton Morton Slack solicitors; (2) 
Moss  solicitors;  (3)  Beresfords  solicitors,  (4)  Wake  Smith  solicitors,  (5)  Raleys 
 
solicitors, (6) the UDM (Nottingham section) and (7) Vendside Limited. The 1st to 
4th  Respondents  were  on  the  UDM/Vendside  panel  of  solicitors.  Only  Raleys  was 
instructed by the NUM. 

 

212.	  At 12.32 Mr Lumsden forwarded GWM’s application and the supporting documents 
to Mr Shears and Mr Smith. Included as an ‘untitled attachment’ to the email was a 
 
message, which read as follows: 

See enclosed - a large bundle, I suggest you have someone print 
off one copy and take further copies for whoever needs them. 

I also suggest that you defer sending your response to Greene 
Wood McLean until you have considered their GLO.

Our thinking is to ask judge to convene special hearing, citing 
damage 
flush  out  opportunistic  approach 
masquerading as outrage over miners, get the judge to deal with 
Vendside  contract  issue  and  stay  GLO  or  refer  to  our  judge, 
pending Vendside issue being determined.  

Flush out too, what their case is supposed to be in law - other 
than failures of various professional kinds that are for the Law 
Society and not the courts to deal with - probably at bottom, an 
 
argument  that  union  services  being  extended  and  level  of 
deduction applied, under false pretences and solicitor complicit

213.	  This email, which the Claimant characterized as ‘the strategy email’, plainly covers a 
 
number of issues. Among these were: first, the response to GWM’s claim letter of 21 
October and to the GLO application; secondly, the broader political issues arising out 
of the involvement of AGM in the deduction claims; thirdly, how it might be a good 
idea to persuade Sir Michael Turner to deal with the Vendside issue and either stay 
 
the GLO or deal with it himself, pending the determination of the Vendside issue; and 
fourthly  the  importance  of  bringing  into  account,  as  the  justification  for  the 
 
deductions, support for miners knee litigation. 

 
214.	 

It will be necessary to consider the ‘strategy email’ in the context of the claim as a 
whole. However the suggestion that Sir Michael Turner should be invited to convene 
a  special  hearing  to  review  the  state  of  play  does  not  strike  me  as  inherently 
objectionable. It was in any event a request to him which came from the CG.

215.	  On 10 November 2005, Mr Tucker wrote to Sir Michael Turner on behalf of the CG.  

 

We  write  to  notify  the  Court  of  applications  the  Claimants 
propose to pursue arising as a consequence of events that have 
taken  place  since  June  of  this  year  culminating  recently  in  a 
press  release  issued  by  an  organisation  called  [AGM]  to 
 
coincide  with  the  lodging  of  an  application  for  a  Group 
Litigation  Order  by  [GWM]  on  behalf  of  a  number  of 
Claimants. 

The CG, on behalf of the CSG, plainly have responsibility for 
pursuing  the  best  interests  of  Claimants  who  seek  to  recover 
damages from British Coal Corporation/the DTI for respiratory 
diseases. However, we believe that our role extends further and 
 
that  we  have  a  responsibility  as  custodians  of  the  scheme 
 
(together with the Court and the DTI).  It is this feature of our 
 
role  that  gives  rise  to  the  applications  we  propose  to  bring 
before the Court which, in outline, are as follows:- 

1. That the Court should order that the GLO application is 
listed before you and stayed on terms that interested parties 
appear before the Court so that directions may be given for 
the  determination  of  the  validity  of  the  various  Vendside 
agreements  entered  into  between  individual  Claimants  and 
 
Vendside. 

2. That the Court gives directions as to the terms upon which 
Claimants may transfer instructions from one legal adviser to 
another.
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

The factors that we have taken into account in arriving at the 
decision that application should be made to the Court to make 
Orders in the above terms are as follows:- 

1.  The  question  of  the  legality  of  the  various  forms  of  the 
Vendside  agreement  is  a  running  issue  which  may  be  the 
cause  of  continuing  damage  to  the  integrity  of  the  scheme 
 
generally. Although there are regulatory and other enquiries 
underway  which  are  not  a  matter  for  the  Court  we  submit 
that the integrity of the scheme is a matter for the Court.  It 
 
seems  to  us  that  resolution  of  the  validity  of  the  said 
 
agreements  will  have  a  positive  effect  and,  as  the  Law 
 
Society  have  indicated,  may  speed  up  the  regulatory 
enquiries.  More  importantly  the  Claimants  concerned  will 
 
have  certainty  where  presently 
they  face  uncertainty. 
  
Further,  it  appears  to  us  from  consideration  of  the  GLO 
application that the outcome may determine whether or not 
the GLO is susceptible of proceeding further. The CG accept 
that a question may be raised as to locus in relation to this 
 
application.  We  seek  no  more  than  the  direction  indicated 
 
above.  If  the  Court  sees  fit  to  order  the  relevant  parties  to 
formulate an issue for determination the CG would expect to 
 
have no part to play in subsequent hearings. 

 

 

2. 
The AGM press release criticises the operation of the 
scheme  generally  and  appears  to  be  designed  to  encourage 
Claimants to transfer instructions to a panel of six firms of 
solicitors whom, it is alleged, will be able to handle claims 
 
more expeditiously than present advisers. We do not believe 
there is any foundation in fact for this assertion. Any transfer 
of claims from one solicitor to another, on a spurious basis, 
will achieve no more than delay for the individual Claimants 
concerned  and  dislocation  of 
the  scheme  generally. 
Claimants who have a genuine grievance with their solicitor 
 
should be entitled to transfer instructions but those who do 
not should be encouraged to remain with their legal adviser. 

We have copied this letter to the DTI and invite them to inform 
 
the Court as to whether or not, in their role as custodians of the 
scheme, they support the proposed applications.  We have also 
copied  this  letter  to  The  Law  Society,  to  GWM  and  to  the 
solicitors named in the GLO application. 

We should be grateful if you would confirm whether or not the 
Court  is  prepared  to  hear  the  proposed  applications  by 
reconvening the Extraordinary Review Hearing or otherwise on 
the hearing listed for 1 and 2 December 2005. 

 

216.	  The Claimant is critical of this letter. Mr Green QC points out that the criticism of 
‘transfers  …  on  a  spurious  basis’  mirrored  part  of  the  Judge’s  letter  of  26  October 
(which was not sent to GWM) in which he had referred to destabilizing of the scheme
--------

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

‘on what appear to be spurious reasons.’ However, in so far as it is a valid criticism, I 
do  not  accept  that  it  advances  the  claim  against  the  1st  to  9th  Defendants.  While  I 
accept that the letter reflected Mr Lumsden’s views and that he saw it in draft, it came 
 
from Mr Tucker on behalf of the CG and raised issues of justifiable concern to the 
 
CG.  There  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  Mr  Tucker  and  the  CG  were  simply  the 
 
mouthpiece of Thompsons and Mr Lumsden, and good reason to conclude that they 
were  not.  In  any  event  I  reject  as  entirely  artificial  the  assertion  that  the  letter 
 
constituted  a  misrepresentation  by  omission  by  Thompsons  and/or  Mr  Lumsden. 
There was no representation, no failure to disclose what should have been disclosed 
and no conspiracy. 

 

217.	  One  proposal  was  that  Sir  Michael  Turner  should  consider  the  validity  of  the 
‘Vendside  agreement’  and  the  terms  on  which  claimants  should  be  permitted  to 
transfer their instructions. This was plainly sensible. It had been the UDM/Vendside 
agreement  which  had  generated  much  of  the  adverse  publicity  since  it  appeared  to 
 
lead  to  the  enrichment  of  individuals.  The  issue  had  been  raised  as  a  suitable 
preliminary  issue  in  the  summer;  and  if  the  Court  was  in  a  position  to  determine 
 
issues  of  principle,  it  would  have  speeded  up  the  Law  Society  investigations  and 
lessened the potential disruption to the operation of the scheme from the transfer of 
instructions. 
 

 

218.	  On  the  following  day  11  November  2005,  Senior  Master  Turner  wrote  to  the 

 

respondents to the GLO application, to GWM and to Irwin Mitchell. 

Sir Michael Turner has now directed that this application for a 
 
GLO is to be made to him.  

The conversations which some of you may have had with my 
P.A ... concerning dates of availability and any correspondence 
you have sent in with dates to avoid are now non valid as this 
case is being dealt with by Sir Michael Turner. 

 
219.	 

It is unclear how the GLO application came to be transferred from the Senior Master 
(Master  Turner),  before  whom  such  applications  were  usually  made.  Although  a 
 
search  for  the  Court  File  was  carried  out  at  my  request,  it  seems  to  be  no  longer 
available. In the course of argument during the GLO application hearing on 4 April 
2006, Sir Michael Turner informed counsel for the GLO claimants. 

The  Senior  Master  consulted  me  and  he  agreed  to  refer  the 
application to me. 

It is apparent that at this point GWM was concerned about Sir Michael Turner hearing 
the GLO application, and a draft letter was prepared opposing the transfer. This was 
never sent. Among the points made in the draft was the argument that the lawfulness 
 
of the Vendside agreements was only one of the many issues that arose and that the 
 
claims were private law claims brought against parties most of whom were not parties 
to the BCRDL scheme. The draft letter resisted the making of a direction as to the 
terms on which transfers might be made and offered the firm’s reassurance that it had 
 
not encouraged (and would not encourage) clients to transfer instructions unless the 
clients  had  a  genuine  grievance  with  their  existing  solicitors  and  had  been 
 
independently advised that it was in their interest to do so.

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

I will deal later with my overall conclusions about the Claimant’s claims. At this stage 
it  is  sufficient  to  state  that,  although  it  is  clear  that  Mr  Lumsden  and  Thompsons 
 
played their part in supporting the CG request that Sir Michael Turner should hear the 
GLO  application  and,  like  the  CG  were  aware  of  his  earlier  views  about  union 
deductions, their actions were not tortious. 

 
222. 

In  his  unchallenged  evidence  at  trial  Mr  Allan  QC  expressed  his  own  view  of  the 
matter. 

Given his experience of dealing with the BCRDL since 1995, 
Sir  Michael  Turner  had  an  obvious  advantage  over  any  other 
judge in understanding the background to the application 

 

223.  The correspondence highlights a potential issue on which I should express my very 
clear view. Those involved in litigation should not seek to influence a decision as to 
the identity of the judge who will hear their case. Information about the case (which is 
agreed between the parties) may be helpful to Court Listing Officers. Suggestions by 
parties as to the identity of the judge who should hear their case should not be made, 
and are likely to be treated as unwelcome.

224.  On 2 November there was a meeting between Mr Booth and Mr Shears. Mr Shears 
plainly  did  not  know  (and  had  no  reason  to  believe)  that  what  he  said  would  be 
reported  by  Mr  Booth  to  Mr  Edwards.  Part  of  Mr  Shears’s  memorandum  (dated  4 
November) recording the meeting included: 

[Mr Booth] also wanted to discuss the possibility of settlement, 
 
which  issue  he  had  raised  with  me  before  we  received  the 
initial letter of claim ...  

He remained of the view that it may be possible to achieve a 
finite settlement which could be attractive in the context of any 
uncertainty. I said we did not accept that there was any risk to 
our  union  clients  on  any  of  these  likely  claims,  and  there 
seemed  to  me  to  be  little  vulnerability  on  the  part  of 
Thompsons save, perhaps, politically in relation to the next of 
 
kin cases, on which we remained confident as to the strength of 
the legal arguments. 

 

225.  Both  Mr  Shears’s  and  Mr  Booth’s  notes  record  Mr  Booth  suggesting  that  he  be 
 
authorised to approach GWM on the basis that, although confident that there was no 
liability,  Thompsons  were  interested  in  exploring  a  finite  settlement  on  satisfactory 
terms. Mr Shears’s note records that he refused to authorise Mr Booth to make such 
an approach to GWM.  

 

226.  On  14  November  GWM  replied  to  Thompsons’  26  October  letter  and  repeated  its 
offer  to  settle  the  dispute  by  a  structured  mediation  with  a  timetable  which  would 
 
result in a mediation on 23 December 2005. Neither the prescriptive proposal for an

unseasonal mediation nor the timetable were realistic. The proposal was bound, if not 
intended, to be rejected. The letter contained the implicit threat: 

Arrangements  are  currently  being  made  in  relation  to  the 
hearing of the application for a Group Litigation Order, and if 
there is to be any prospect of settling with your firm rather than 
joining it into the proceedings, urgent attention will have to be 
given to the matter. 

227.	  Although  this  was  the  second  time  GWM  had  insisted  on  a  speedy  response,  it 

 

continued to show very little urgency itself. 

228.	  Mr  Brunswick’s  evidence  was  that  he  came  under  pressure  from  Mr  Shears  of 

 

Thompsons. According to his witness statement: 

41.  Mr  Booth  telephoned  me  in  the  early  evening  of  14 
November.  He  explained 
reacted 
extremely badly to the letter from GWM, and that he felt that 
the letter also undermined the role of intermediary that he had 
agreed  to  undertake.  Mr  Booth  asked  me  to  cancel  the 
agreement to provide ATE cover for GWM. I refused to do so. 

that  Thompsons  had 

42.  Later  that  evening  I  was  telephoned  by  Geoff  Shears  of 
Thompsons.  He  was  very  angry  about  the  letter  from  GWM 
 
and  blamed  Templeton  for  allowing  the  situation  to  arise.  He 
explained that Thompsons did not want a mediation: an internal 
review  had  revealed  that  Thompsons  had  been  making 
deductions  from  compensation  awards  for  miners  from  the 
Durham  area  and  paying  those  to  the  Durham  Miners 
Association  branch  of 
the  NUM.  The  Durham  Miners 
 
Association  was  now  almost  broke,  so  he  was  worried  that 
Thompsons  might  end  up  having  to  foot  the  bill  for  the 
deductions that might have to be repaid to miners. 

… 

Mr  Shears  wanted  me  to  cancel  the  insurance  and  was  very 
persuasive in suggesting I should do so and how I might best 
proceed to manage the risk to Templeton. Eventually I agreed, 
under pressure and against my better judgment. 

43.  On  15  November  I  instructed  Mr  Maule  that  he  should 
write  to  GWM  revoking  the  insurance  cover.  The  grounds 
given were that Templeton was conflicted from providing cover 
because of its prior relationship with Thompsons. 

44. The same day Mr Booth called me. He did not know what 
had been agreed the previous evening so I told him that I had 
agreed to cancel the insurance cover. He asked if he could get 
confirmation and I told him he should speak to Mr Maule.

31.  I  understand  that  later  that  evening  Geoff  Shears  and/or 
Lawrence  Lumsden  telephoned  Ralph  Brunswick  who  agreed 
that he would cancel the GWM ATE cover. 

230.	  Mr Booth was cross-examined about this account and the more detailed account he 

 

had given in his witness statement for the trial (dated 26 February 2014). 

 
231.	 

In  his  evidence,  Mr  Shears  denied  speaking  to  either  Mr  Brunswick  or  Mr  Booth 
during  the  evening  of  14  November  2005,  and  denied  ever  having  spoken  to  Mr 
Brunswick. 

 

232.	  Mr Lumsden also emphatically denied speaking to Mr Brunswick and Mr Booth, and 
in  his  closing  speech  Mr  Green  drew  back  from  contending  that  Mr  Lumsden  had 
spoken to them notwithstanding Mr Booth’s evidence that he had.  

 

233.	  Having heard the witnesses give evidence, I have concluded that Mr Brunswick and 
Mr Booth were both mistaken in their evidence. It seems to me unlikely that either Mr 
 
Shears or Mr Lumsden would have engaged in anything as clumsy as a direct attempt 
to get Templeton to break its contract with GWM and withdraw the ATE cover. It is 
 
not just that as solicitors they would have been aware of the dangers of acting in such 
a way, nor that the suggestion must be that they conducted themselves in a singularly 
(and, in my view, uncharacteristically) unsubtle way, nor that similar accusations of 
interference and harassment would later be made by Mr Brunswick during telephone 
calls  on  27  and  28  February  2006,  nor  even  that  Mr  Brunswick  was  an  inherently 
unreliable witness (a matter which I will come to later in this judgment). It is that I 
was (subject to one point) persuaded by the evidence of Mr Shears and Mr Lumsden, 
and unpersuaded by the evidence of Mr Brunswick and Mr Booth.  

 

 

234.	  The most likely explanation for what occurred was that Mr Booth saw GWM’s letter 
to Thompsons which was sent to him under cover of an email (timed at 14.33)  in 
which Mr Edwards wrote:
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

For information 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

A mediation by the end of the year will be pushing it but we 
have to rush this otherwise the opportunity will pass. 

 

235.	  Having read the letter Mr Booth felt that GWM had broken a clear understanding and, 

at 17.28 on 14 November, he emailed Mr Edwards with a copy to Mr Brunswick. 

When we met last Tuesday it was agreed that you would write 
to  me  setting  out  the  mediation  methodology  &  how  you  felt 
this  would  address  the  concerns  of  Templeton.  Once  Ralph 
[Brunswick] & I had this information, & had ensured that we 
 
were happy with it, we would jointly decide how best to move 
it  forward  both  tactically  &  strategically.  I  discussed  this 
approach and he agreed. 
 

We now find that you have short-circuited this arrangement by 
going  straight  on  the  offensive  with  Thompsons  without  any 
discussion  with  either  Ralph  or  me.  Why  –  as  this  totally 
contradicts our agreement.  

 
236.	 

It  was  Mr  Booth  who  was  agitated  by  GWM’s  letter.  He  realised  that  the  careful 
arrangement by which Templeton would not have to insure against Thompsons had 
been jeopardised. Mr Brunswick would have been aware that Mr Booth had his own 
interests to protect and that he would not necessarily be making requests on behalf of 
Thompsons. 

 

237.	  There is one point on which I find that Mr Shears was mistaken in his recollection. I 
have concluded that it is likely he spoke to Mr Booth at some time on 14 November 
 
and  expressed  his  displeasure  at  receiving  the  GWM  letter.  However,  it  was  Mr 
Booth’s fear that his secret commission on the premium paid to Templeton in respect 
of the insurance provided to Thompsons’ union clients which generated his email to 
GWM, and led him to put pressure on Templeton to resile from its promise to insure 
 
GWM’s case.  

 
238.	 

In any event, on 15 November Mr Maule of Templeton wrote to GWM cancelling the 
ATE cover for the GLO. 

I  write  with  reference  to  your  e-mail  addressed  to  Ralph 
Brunswick  attaching  a  copy  of  your  letter  to  Thompsons,  the 
contents of which are duly noted. 

I regret to advise that Templeton’s position is compromised by 
virtue of a conflict of interest. Consequently, we can have no 
further  involvement  or  participation  in  this  risk.  It  does  not 
appear  from  my  records  that  insurance  cover  had  in  fact 
incepted,  although  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  I  confirm  no 
such legal expenses insurance is in place. 

 

239.	  Templeton’s decision was not maintained for long. As soon as he received the letter 
Mr Edwards got in touch with Mr Fresson, and on 23 November Mr Fresson was able
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

to reassure him that Mr Brunswick had told him that the 15 November letter ‘could be 
ignored as if it was not sent,’ so long as Thompsons were specifically excluded from 
the claim pursued by GWM. 

 

240.	  The Claimant’s case that the terms on which the cover was reinstated departed from 
 
the  prior  agreement  in  so  far  as  it  excluded  Thompsons  is  incorrect.  As  both  Mr 
 
Edwards  and  Mr  Fresson  accepted  in  evidence,  claims  against  Thompsons  were 
excluded in both the original and in the reinstated cover. It follows that when cover 
 
was reinstated on 23 November in terms which exclude Thompsons, it was not due to 
pressure from Thompsons, it was because the cover had always excluded Thompsons. 

 

241.	  Since the insurance was reinstated the main relevance of this part of the evidence is 
 
that the temporary suspension of the insurance was to emerge later as a feature at the 
 
GLO hearing before Sir Michael Turner. 

The press and political campaign in late 2005 and early 2006. 

 

242.	  The  issue  of  the  GLO  application  on  27  October  was  followed  by  a  considerable 
amount of publicity in the media which was generated by AGM, and to activity by 
Thompsons  (and  in  particular,  Mr  Jones)  about  which  Mr  Green  QC  was  highly 
critical.  Thompsons  was  concerned  to  answer  the  political  argument  on  deductions 
and draw the distinction between those which were made in favour of the unions and 
those which were diverted to solicitors or claims managers.  

 

243.	  One  of  the  difficulties  faced  by  Mr  Edwards,  which  he  fairly  acknowledged  in 
evidence,  was  the  confusion  about  the  objects  of  AGM  and,  in  particular,  its 
relationship with GWM. 

 

244.	  Some  of  AGM’s  publicity  fed  into  the  press.  On  18  January  2006,  The  Times 
published an article stating that John Prescott (the Deputy Prime Minister) had thrown 
 
his  ‘support’  behind  AGM’s  campaign.  Other  Members  of  Parliament  were  also 
mentioned as supporters of AGM. Each of these subsequently disavowed support for 
AGM, to some extent as a result of Mr Jones’s activities. Nevertheless it is clear that 
 
there was still significant support for AGM and its aims among certain Labour MPs. 
 
This political battle for support is relied on by the Claimant as the context for the later 
events in February 2006. 

 

245.	  As Thompsons’s Head of Policy and Public Affairs Mr Jones was engaged in liaising 
with Government and Members of Parliament. During the period with which this case 
is concerned it is clear that Thompsons considered that the deduction issue needed to 
be addressed on the political front. The firm plainly thought that the unions’ natural 
political allies were not giving their union clients the support that they should have 
given. 

 

246.	  Although much of the evidence was not of direct relevance to the present case, I was 
concerned  by  some  of  what  I  heard.  It  appeared  that  Mr  Jones  and  private 
investigators whom he employed to assist him engaged in activities which were open 
to  objection.  I  accept  that  most  of  the  information  acquired  by  questionable  means 
(for example about Lord McKenzie and AGM) was intended to be deployed on the 
political  front  and  in  associated  media  campaigns,  rather  than  in  the  litigation,  and 
that the deployment of such material is not the proper focus of this trial. On the other

hand,  Thompsons  also  showed  itself  closely  interested  in  Mr  Edwards’s  political 
background in South Africa and carried out research into it.  

247.	  On  16  February  2006  Mr  Jones  emailed  various  of  his  contacts,  directing  them  to 

 

GWM’s website. 

FYI. The website of the firm that he is part of. 

They  are  trying  to  screw  the  UK  NUM.  Any  dirt  gratefully 
received.  If  you  think  a  Private  Eye  would  get  more  on  the 
bloke  or  his/their  links  give  me  a  ring  and  it  may  be  worth 
some investment from us on our clients’ behalf. 

 
248.	 

I have little doubt that if they had found something to discredit Mr Edwards it would 
have been deployed in some way. In fact, they found nothing damaging about him, 
since the information which emerged was only to his credit.  One of the features of 
this  case  has  been  the  close  scrutiny  of  the  internal  email  correspondence  within 
Thompsons. This has revealed how the firm operated and how individuals within the 
firm reacted to information. The information was confidential and never intended to 
be seen by third parties, and was certainly not intended to be read out in open court. I 
bear this in mind. Nevertheless I find it surprising that it was thought either necessary 
or desirable to carry out this sort of research into a solicitor acting for the other side.  

 

249.	  Mr  Pooles  QC  sought  to  justify  this  as  being,  ‘unfamiliar  to  those  not  involved,  in 
 
much  the  same  way  that  marketing  would  seem  unfamiliar  to  legal  practitioners  of 
 
previous  generations.’  His  submission  seemed  to  be  that  the  Court  should  simply 
accept that this is the way in which litigation is conducted nowadays, and that to view 
this  approach  adversely  is  to  be  old-fashioned  and  out  of  touch.  I  reject  that 
submission. While it has only a marginal bearing on the issues in the case, I am not 
prepared simply to treat this with the forensic equivalent of a sigh of regret at the way 
in  which  things  have  changed.  While  I  accept  that  research  on  the  experience  of 
professional opponents is legitimate, trying to ‘dig up dirt’ on them, with the intention 
of  leaking  it  to  the  press  is  not.  To  the  extent  that  this  conduct  was  encouraged  or 
 
condoned within Thompsons it does not reflect credit on the firm. 

December 2005: further hearings before Sir M Turner and the Templeton ATE 
policy. 

 

250.	  There was a directions hearing in the GLO application on 7 and 8 December 2005. 
The  hearing  was  attended  by  the  legal  representatives  of  the  GLO  applicants 
 
(represented by GWM and counsel), the seven Respondents (four of which shared two 
counsel),  the  DTI,  the  Law  Society  and  the  CG.  Sir  Michael  Turner  expressed 
concerns about the cost to benefit return of a GLO in the light of GWM’s apparent 
concession that only 69 clients had signed up and only 398 potential applicants had 
contacted  GWM.  Given  the  potential  costs  and  the  number  of  potential  individual 
 
claims  Sir  Michael  Turner’s  warning  that  there  was  ‘a  hill  to  climb’  was  not 
surprising. The warning to GWM had already come from their counsel. 

 

251.	  The Judge’s order of 9 December (among other matters) directed disclosure by the 
respondents of relevant documents including details of deductions made. The Order 
also provided that (a) the applicants should state by 16 December whether they were

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

prepared to disclose the ATE insurance policy; (b) the applicants should serve generic 
Particulars  of  Claim  identifying  the  common  issues  of  law  and  fact;  (c)  both 
applicants and respondents should serve a summary of costs incurred to date and up to 
the  conclusion  of  the  GLO  hearing;  (d)  the  applicants  should  serve  a  summary  of 
costs up to the conclusion of the litigation, (i) on all the issues in the proposed group 
litigation  and  (ii)  on  issues  restricted  to  pursuing  the  non-solicitor  respondents  and 
 
their  appointed  agents;  (e)  the  respondents  should  set  out  in  writing  their  full 
objections to the GLO; (f) the applicants should state whether they intend to claim 
against any Trade Union other than the UDM and, if so, to amend the application; (g) 
the  applicants  should  state  any  basis  for  opposing  issues  affecting  non-solicitor 
questions being tried separately (h) the case to be listed for hearing before Sir Michael 
Turner in a 2-3 day period in April-May 2006. 

 
252.	 

I have set out the order in some detail because they indicate some of the issues which 
were  likely  to  arise,  the  way  in  which  the  Judge  dealt  with  the  parties  and  the 
likelihood that the application would be hard fought over a period measured in days 
 
and not hours. It is important to note that no objection has been, or could be, taken as 
to the form of the order and there is no criticism of how the Judge conducted himself 
at  the  hearing.  Nor  is  it  submitted  that  he  exhibited  a  closed  mind  or  any 
predisposition in relation to the application during the hearing. 

 

253.	  On 17 December Mr Shears met with his union clients. At this meeting Thompsons 
offered  to  underwrite  any  liability  of  the  unions  to  repay  deductions.  So  far  as  Mr 
Shears  was  concerned,  despite  the  financial  commitment,  it  removed  any  potential 
conflict of interest between the firm and its union clients. His evidence was: 

...  once  I’d  had  a  meeting  with  the  Durham  miners’  leader,  I 
was a very happy man, because I knew that we had a solution 
to the problem ... in our hands, and it could be delivered. 

As already noted, Mr King had already formed the view that the firm would be liable 
for deductions. 

 

254.	  A  decision  was  made  by  the  Executive  Board  of  Thompsons  to  provide  for  the 
liability  to  repay  union  deductions  in  the  firm’s  accounts  from  January  2006.  Ms 
Hurley’s  evidence  on  this  point  was  emphatic:  the  provision  made  in  Thompsons’s 
year-end accounts reflected a recognised liability of Thompsons to make refunds to 
clients and the motivation for making the provision and offering repayment was the 
regulatory  issue  raised  as  a  result  of  the  Law  Society  investigations.  Ms  Hurley’s 
evidence (which I accept) was that the GLO application (to which Thompsons was 
not a party) was not the primary concern of those managing Thompsons’s finances. 

 

255.	  Later, in 2007-8, Thompsons initiated a voluntary repayment of the deductions which 
had been made and then paid over to the unions, and contacted all former clients of 
the firm. All those who requested a refund of deductions were paid out in full. This 
involved payments totalling £3,640,443 in respect of 6,304 claims. 

 

256.	  Turning back to the position in December 2006, although Templeton had appeared to 
have insured GWM on terms which had been agreed in the summer, it had still failed 
 
to furnish a policy. This meant that, despite GWM’s wish to disclose the ATE policy 
as envisaged by the 9 December Order, it was unable to do so. Although Mr Fresson
--------

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 
made increasingly urgent enquiries, he received no satisfactory response. A summary 
of the cover was sent by Mr Maule on 22 December and was passed on to the GLO 
respondents on 23 December. 

 

257.	  On 16 January Brooke North (acting on behalf of the UDM and Vendside Ltd) wrote 
to  GWM  requesting  a  full  copy  of  the  ATE  policy  and,  on  30  January,  GWM 
informed  Templeton  that  it  was  coming  under  increasing  pressure  to  produce  the 
policy. 

 

258.	  On 6 February Mr Maule sent a draft ATE policy to GWM adding, ‘This should give 
 
you  the  general  gist!’  This  document  showed  track-change  amendments  and 
comprised mainly formatting changes. Mr Edwards’s evidence was that he considered 
the wording unacceptable, but he does not appear to have responded to Mr Maule’s 
email. 

 

259.	  On 23 February Weightmans (acting for the 3rd respondents, Beresfords) issued an 
application  for  disclosure  of  the  ATE  policy.  On  28  February  a  consent  order  was 
signed in which GWM agreed to disclose the policy by 10 March. It is clear that, as a 
result of Templeton’s delays the GLO respondents had now become interested in the 
existence and terms of any ATE cover. 

 

260.	  As  already  noted,  GWM’s  difficulties  in  obtaining  a  policy  from  Templeton  in 
 
relation to the GLO ATE cover was matched by Templeton’s inefficiency in issuing 
 
the  British  Biotech  and  Claims  Direct  policies.  These  had  been  outstanding  even 
 
longer by this stage. Mr Fresson described the reason for the delay in producing the 
GLO ATE policy as ‘sheer inefficiency.’ I agree. Mr Maule’s glib response to what 
 
had  become  an  urgent  issue  demonstrates  at  the  very  least  a  high  degree  of  casual 
indifference  to  GWM’s  position.  Mr  Brunswick  could  offer  no  explanation  for  the 
delay and said that, when made aware of it, he had gone to see Mr Maule whom he 
 
described  as  ‘dragging  his  feet.’  This  part  of  the  history  reinforces  the  general 
impression  of  a  thoroughly  discreditable  approach  by  Templeton  to  its  contractual 
obligations. It was an approach which was to cause some of the difficulties that GWM 
and its clients faced at the hearing in April.  

The events of 27 February 2006 

261.	  The  Claimant’s  case  has  changed  in  the  course  of  the  case  to  accord  with  Mr 
 

 

Brunswick’s altered recollection.  

 

262.	  The  pleaded  case  (at  §140  of  the  Re-Amended  Particulars  of  Claim)  was  that  Mr 
 
Brunswick  (1)  received  12-15  telephone  calls  from  various  Thompsons  partners 
 
and/or Stephen Booth on behalf (and at the request) of Thompsons; (2) was required 
to attend a meeting at Thompsons’ office in Congress House; (3) was informed that 
since Thompsons had become aware that Templeton was insuring the claims brought 
by GWM on behalf of miners, they had  been placing its business elsewhere; (4) was 
shown  that  over  £300,000  worth  of  business  which  would  have  been  placed  with 
 
Templeton had been diverted to other insurers since October 2005; (5) was told that if 
Templeton  issued  an  insurance  certificate  which  included  Thompsons  they  would 
remove their business from Templeton altogether; and (6) was concerned about the 
degree of pressure he was being put under.

263. 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

In  his  s.236  statement  to  the  Claimant  which  formed  the  basis  for  this  part  of  the 
claim, he described what happened after he informed Mr Booth that he was providing 
ATE cover for the GLO. 

53.  Mr  Booth  must  have  informed  Thompsons  immediately 
because  over  the  next  day  or  so  I  was  called  by  several 
Thompson partners, all very angry and calling me all the names 
under  the  sun.  They  were  clearly  not  content  that  the  ATE 
cover existed at all, notwithstanding that Thompsons was not a 
defendant  and  angry 
that 
Templeton had already withdrawn cover. 

they  had  understood 

in 

that 

54. On 28 February 2006 I attended a meeting with Thompsons 
at  their  office  at  Congress  House.  The  meeting  had  been 
arranged  to  discuss  several  routine  matters.  I  first  met  with  a 
 
number of partners to discuss PI LEI insurance; they all knew 
by  then  that  I  had  agreed  to  provide  ATE  insurance  for  the 
GWM GLO and I was extensively criticised. 

 

264.  The  statement  continues  [at  §55]  with  an  account  of  how  he  was  invited  into  Ms 
Hurley’s office to discuss GWM’s GLO where they were joined by Mr Shears, and 
where he was told about the political fall-out and asked to cancel the cover.  

The case against Thompsons 

 

265.  The case against Thompsons was based on the application of illegitimate pressure and 
 
harassment as part of the continuing conspiracy whose purpose was to get Templeton 
to withdraw its ATE cover for the GLO. 

 

266.  The  documents  show  that  Mr  Lumsden  emailed  Mr  Booth  on  23  February  asking 
whether there was any word on the insurance issue yet, and expressing his concern 
that  the  Court  should  not  be  misled  into  believing  that  there  was  cover  whilst 
 
Thompson’s  understanding  was  that  the  GLO  ATE  cover  had  been  cancelled  in 
November  2005.  On  Monday  27  February  2006  (at  15.16)  Mr  Booth  emailed  Mr 
Lumsden (with a copy to Mr Shears) informing him that Templeton had reinstated the 
GLO cover. Mr Lumsden acknowledged receipt of the information at 17.37.  

 
267. 

It follows that the telephone calls which are said to have been made to Mr Brunswick 
must have taken place after 15.16 on 27 February 2006 when Thompsons were first 
informed of the ‘reinstatement’ of the cover by Mr Booth.  

Who made the telephone calls to Mr Brunswick? 

 

268.  Having not previously identified the individuals whom he said made the calls on 27 
 
and/or 28 February, in his evidence at trial Mr Brunswick initially said that he spoke 
 
to Mr Christie, Mr Shears and a partner from Thompsons Newcastle office. Later, he 
corrected  himself  and  said  that  it  was  not  Mr  Shears  who  called  but  Mr  Lumsden, 
although he was not sure of this. In any event, his evidence was that he received the 
calls in his office in the Isle of Man. He described the calls in various ways: 

Multiple phone calls from at least several individuals.
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

Some phone calls from some partners of Thompsons.  

Multiple phone calls from multiple partners.  

They  might  have  been  people  impersonating  partners,  but  I 
believe they were partners. 

 

269.	  Mr Shears denied emphatically that he had ever spoken to or met Mr Brunswick. Mr 
Christie also denied speaking to Mr Brunswick about the ATE cover at this time. Mr 
 
Lumsden said that he was asked by Mr Booth to speak to Templeton and spoke to a 
man whom he later realised was Mr Brunswick on Monday 27 February at some time 
 
after 17.37 (when he had acknowledged receipt of Mr Booth’s email timed at 15.16). 
He told Mr Booth that there was an inherent conflict between insuring union-backed 
claims and insuring a claim which involved a challenge to union deductions.   

 
270.	 

I am satisfied that Mr Lumsden was the only one of the 2nd to 9th Defendants, and 
the  only  person  who  might  have  been  authorised  to  speak  on  Thompsons’s  behalf, 
who spoke to Mr Brunswick on 27 February. 

Where did Mr Brunswick receive the call? 

 
271.	 

It is now common ground that Mr Brunswick was in London on Monday 27 February 
2006. His evidence was that the calls he described were received in the Isle of Man at 
his office. This means that they were either received on the Sunday (which was before 
Thompsons knew of Templeton’s change of position) or on 28 February when he had 
returned to the Isle of Man. It is likely that Mr Lumsden called Mr Brunswick on his 
mobile phone on 27 February at some time after 17.37. 

What was said? 

 

272.	  Mr  Brunswick’s  evidence  at  trial  was  that  he  was  looking  for  guidance  from 
 
Thompsons  as  to  what  he  should  do  about  having  agreed  to  insure  the  GLO.  He 
 
wanted a way out and he wanted Thompsons to give him that way out. He agreed that 
the  pressure  came  from  his  having  placed  himself  in  an  awkward  commercial 
position. In his cross-examination Mr Pooles QC explored Mr Brunswick’s complaint. 

Q: There was no threat? 

A: No threat 

Q: No instruction? 
 

A: No. 

Q: No pressure? 
 

A:  Well,  no  threats,  no  instruction.  There  was  certainly 
pressure. 

Q:  The  pressure  is  on  you  because  you  are  acting  in 
circumstances  where  you  can  poison 
the  commercial 
relationship?
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

A:  And I’m asking for guidance and they won’t give it to me. 

 

273.	  Much  of  the  Claimant’s  case  at  trial  on  this  part  of  the  case  was  conducted  on  the 
basis  that  there  had  been  a  meeting  between  Ms  Hurley  and  Mr  Brunswick  at 
Thompson’s office on 28 February. An internal email from Ms Hurley timed at 19.25 
on 28 February recorded a conversation between them earlier on the same day (i.e. 28 
February). 

 

 

 

He said that yesterday was a difficult day and he had received a 
number of phonecalls telling him ‘he should not do this as you 
do  not  understand  the  consequences’  these  phone  calls  had 
been  from  [Mr  Booth].  He  said  he  did  not  know  the 
 
ramifications, it was good money for him and a good case and 
so he backed it. However, if it was going to cripple our friends 
he  would  listen.  Lawrence  [Lumsden]  was  explaining  the 
potential  fallout,  but  was  being  very  guarded  in  what  he  was 
 
saying ... He offered to kick them [GWM] in the teeth and void 
the policy if that was what we wanted, we just had to ask. [Mr 
Brunswick]  said  he  was  exasperated  yesterday,  he  was 
preparing for a trial, he was stressed out and [Mr Booth] was on 
the phone saying you cannot do this – do something now. He 
 
said if it was a big deal, let me know, I will try and arrange an 
elegant  exit  ...  He  said  he  had  started  a  minor  argument  with 
them to create the conditions to exit if we asked him to. They 
might find it strange but he would pull the cover, he had gone 
over the file at 10.20 pm last night given the pressure from [Mr 
Booth] and we would do whatever he asked. 

I  said  that  we  had  been  advised  by  him  that  he  had  removed 
cover when we last met, it would have been helpful if he had 
updated  us  when  he  issued  another  policy,  only  because  we 
may have acted on out of date information which might have 
been embarrassing for us. We also had received calls yesterday, 
and had been advised that he was keen to talk to us. As far as I 
 
was concerned we just wanted clarification of the position, we 
were happy to let matters stand. 

 
274.	 

I  accept  that  the  contents  of  the  email  gave  an  accurate  and  reliable  account  of  a 
telephone  conversation  between  Ms  Hurley  and  Mr  Brunswick  on  28  February  in 
relation to what Mr Brunswick said had happened on 27 February.  

 

275.	  Mr Christie’s evidence, which I accept, was that Templeton’s insurance of the GLO 
was ‘a small, peripheral issue’ for him. His reaction was that it was a bit stupid for 
Templeton to be insuring against the unions and putting at risk their own business. He 
was not angry, it was more ‘a raised eyebrow.’  

 

 
276.	 

In my judgement, five points are clear from the evidence.  

 

277.	  First, the telephone calls on 27 February which Mr Brunswick was saying had put him 
under pressure were from Mr Booth who was surprised to hear that Templeton was 
still insuring GWM and was concerned that Thompsons might withdraw its business
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

from  Templeton,  thereby  jeopardising  his  commission.  In  his  oral  evidence  Mr 
Brunswick  described  Mr  Booth  as  ‘angry’.    He  was,  however,  neither  conveying 
Thompsons’s views, nor acting on their behalf, nor to be regarded in law as acting on 
 
their behalf. 

 

278.	  Secondly, Mr Brunswick did not receive phone calls from Thompsons or its partners 
putting him under pressure or telling him what to do, and made no complaint to Ms 
Hurley that he had. 

 

279.	  Thirdly,  in  the  telephone  call  from  Mr  Lumsden  about  the  potential  fallout  from 
Templeton’s agreement to insure the GLO action, Mr Lumsden was ‘very guarded’. 
This is apparent from both Ms Hurley’s email note and Mr Lumsden’s evidence. This 
is  inconsistent  with  Mr  Lumsden  pressurising  Mr  Brunswick  to  break  Templeton’s 
contract with GWM.  

 

280.	  Fourthly,  Mr  Brunswick  said  he  was  more  than  willing  to  break  Templeton’s 
contractual  obligations  with  GWM  if  he  received  any  encouragement  from 
Thompsons. He did not receive any such encouragement, and did not avoid the policy 
until after the judgment of Sir Michael Turner in May.  

 

 

281.	  Fifthly, Ms Hurley expressed Thompsons’s reaction to the discovery of the continuing 
existence of Templeton’s ATE policy as embarrassment that the firm may have been 
acting  on  out  of  date  information.  The  content  of  Ms  Hurley’s  internal  email  is 
emphatically  not  the  language  of  interference  in  third  party  contractual  rights, 
harassment or the application of unlawful means.  

282.	  None of this was inconsistent with the evidence which Mr Brunswick gave at trial. 

 

Q:  Again,  there  was  no  suggestion  in  that  statement  on  your 
part that Thompsons were placing you under pressure ...? 
  

A: Previously - on a previous question, you have asked me if 
they threatened me, and I’ve said no. You’ve asked me if they 
told me what to do, and I said no. And you asked me if they’d 
put me under pressure and to that one I can’t answer it clearly. I 
was certainly under pressure. They knew it. They didn’t - they - 
were  fully  aware  of  their  commercial  position  vis-à-vis  me.  I 
was seeking guidance from them in the meeting with Carolyn, 
and she did not give it to me and she did not threaten me, but 
she certainly maintained the pressure on me. 

Q: How? 
 

A: By not - by not helping me. 

 

283.	  The  difficulty  Mr  Brunswick  faced  was  the  consequence  of  his  own  commercial 
decisions to insure GWM without considering the potential consequences for his other 
business. His complaint was not that he had been subjected to threats or instruction, 
but that Thompsons had not helped him find a way out of a difficulty which he had 
created for himself. He wanted someone else to make a decision for Templeton or to 
be able to say he had been forced into reneging on Templeton’s obligations to GWM.

MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 
 
284. 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

It is clear that the Claimant’s case against Thompsons and the Defendant partners on 
this part of the case is inconsistent with (1) such contemporary written accounts as 
there  are,  (2)  the  inherent  commercial  likelihood,  and  (3)  the  evidence  from  Mr 
 
Shears, Mr Lumsden, Mr Christie and Ms Hurley (all of whose evidence I accept). It 
is also fatally undermined by Mr Brunswick’s own oral evidence, inconsistent as it 
was  with  his  earlier  s.236  Statement.  I  have  concluded  that  Mr  Brunswick, 
encouraged by Mr Booth (for his own reasons) was looking for an excuse to repudiate 
his contractual obligations to GWM; and that Thompsons did nothing to help him out 
of his predicament. In any event, he continued to insure GWM. 
 

 
285. 

I have concluded that Mr Brunswick’s evidence on this part of the claim is untrue; 
and this informs my view of his credibility on other issues. 

The case against Lord Prescott 

 

286.  The pleaded claim against Lord Prescott was set out in §140.6-8 of the Re-amended 
Particulars  of  Claim:  (1)  Mr  Brunswick  was  told  that  Thompsons  had  arranged  for 
him to receive a phone call which ‘might encourage’ him not to be involved in the 
 
insurance  of  miner’s  claims;  (2)  thereafter  he  received  a  telephone  call  from  Lord 
 
Prescott  (acting  in  concert  or  combination  with  Thompsons  and/or  at  the  direct  or 
indirect request of Thompsons), in which he was told that if Templeton continued to 
support  the  claim  he  would  ensure  that  the  FSA  (the  Financial  Services  Authority) 
would  make  a  full  enquiry  into  Templeton;  and  (3)  Mr  Brunswick  was  concerned 
about the degree of pressure he was being put under by this call.  

 

287.  The  source  of  these  allegations  was  not  Mr  Brunswick,  but  Mr  Fresson  who,  in  a 
 
telephone  conversation  with  Mr  Edwards  on  1  March  2005,  reported  what  he  had 
been  told  by  Mr  Brunswick.  Mr  Fresson  added  that  the  purpose  of  a  FSA  enquiry 
appeared  to  be  to  make  sure  that  Templeton  could  not  do  business  in  the  UK,  and 
gave  his  own  endorsement  of  Mr  Brunswick’s  account  by  describing  him  as  ‘a 
straightforward man’. As will be apparent, this is not a view of Mr Brunswick which I 
 
share. Mr Edwards suggested telling Sir Michael Turner what had happened or going 
to the newspapers with the story, but was dissuaded by Mr Fresson, who said that Mr 
Brunswick would not agree to this since he had spoken to Mr Fresson about this in 
confidence. Following this conversation Mr Fresson got in touch with Mr Ridgway; 
and Mr Ridgway and Mr Barry Cavie (a business associate of Mr Ridgway) travelled 
to the Isle of Man to hear Mr Brunswick’s account of the reported conversation with 
Lord Prescott. Mr Fresson repeated to them what he had been told by Mr Brunswick, 
who agreed with what they were told.  

 

288.  Although the Particulars of Claim against the Thompsons Defendants were based on 
the statement made by Mr Brunswick to the Claimant on 16 November 2010 under 
s.236 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and his 1st witness statement dated 29 July 2013, 
neither of these statements made any reference to the involvement of Lord Prescott. 
At that stage the Claimant’s case against Lord Prescott was based on the evidence of 
 
what Mr Brunswick told Mr Fresson. 

 

289.  Mr Brunswick’s 16 November 2010 statement was expressly stated to represent ‘a full 
disclosure of [his] knowledge of and involvement in these matters.’ To the extent that 
he had been told by someone at Thompsons to expect a call which might discourage 
him from being involved in insuring the miners’ claims and to the extent that this was
--------

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

followed  by  a  call  from  Lord  Prescott,  that  statement  was  untrue  since  no  mention 
was made of these matters.  

 

290.	  After the trial began the Claimant was given leave to rely on an affidavit made by Mr 
Brunswick  on  3  October  2014.  In  this  affidavit  he  set  out  (for  the  first  time)  his 
account of the phone call from Lord Prescott. 

5. The context of the call was that I had been receiving phone 
calls around the time of the meeting with Thompsons around 28 
February  2006  from  Stephen  Booth  on  behalf  of  Thompsons 
and  several  Thompson  partners,  all  very  angry 
that 
Templeton’s  ATE  cover  for  the  miner’s  GLO  had  been 
reinstated. 

6.  I  received  the  call  from  John  Prescott  on  or  around  28 
February 2006 on my mobile phone ... after my meeting with 
Thompsons  at  Congress  House.  I  was  in  the  check-in  area  at 
London City Airport. The flight was leaving for the Isle of Man 
at  about  7  pm;  the  call  was  received  at  about  6.30  pm.  The 
caller said he was John Prescott. I understood him to be John 
Prescott MP, who was then Deputy Prime Minister. 

7. It was completely unexpected and out of the ordinary for me 
 
to  be  speaking  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  I  had  never 
spoken  to  him  previously,  nor  any  other  senior  politician. 
Nothing  like  it  has  occurred  in  my  life,  before  or  since. 
Nonetheless, I had no doubt at the time of the call - and have no 
 
doubt now - that the call was from John Prescott MP. The way 
he  spoke,  his  accent  and  the  tone  of  his  voice  were  all 
consistent  with  the  person  I  had  seen  and  heard  on  TV  and 
radio. 

8. Mr Prescott said that the GLO on behalf of the miners was of 
great  concern  to  the  trades  unions.  I  understood  this  to  be  a 
reference  to  the  practice  of  making  deductions  from  union 
members’  damages  and  paying  them  to  their  unions.  The 
miners’ GLO would have been an attack on that practice. I had 
not appreciated the wider implications of the case at the outset. 

9.  Mr  Prescott  said  to  me  that  Templeton  were  involved  in 
some very serious issues and asked me if I understood what I 
was involved with. He did not ask me to take any specific step, 
nor  can  I  recall  him  making  any  specific  threat,  but  I  can 
clearly remember the terror I felt during and after this call. The 
threat felt real, even though it was unspoken. 

10. It was clear to me from the coincidence of (a) Mr Prescott’s 
call,  (b)  my  earlier  meeting  with  Thompsons,  and  (c)  the 
 
numerous  angry  phone  calls  from  Stephen  Booth  and  the 
Thompson partners, that I was being pressurised by Mr Prescott

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

to  cancel  Templeton’s  insurance  so  that  the  miners’  GLO 
would be unable to continue. 

 

291.	  At  §9  his  affidavit  specifically  draws  back  from  the  allegation  of  a  threat  that,  if 
Templeton continued to support the claim, Lord Prescott would make sure that there 
would be a full FSA enquiry into Templeton. Furthermore, despite what he told Mr 
Fresson and (implicitly) others, his evidence in court was that there had been no overt 
threat during the course of the conversation with Lord Prescott. 

 

 

292.	  Having initially said that the conversation took place on 28 February, it emerged late 
in the trial, on the basis of the records of Mr Brunswick’s travel arrangements, that the 
call (if it occurred) must have been made on 27 February in the early evening, since 
that was when Mr Brunswick was at City Airport in the course of returning to the Isle 
 
of Man. 

 

 
293.	 

In view of this information, on Day 19 of the trial, Mr Green QC clarified that his 
 
client’s  case  was  now  that  the  call  to  Mr  Brunswick  was  made  by  Lord  Prescott 
between two votes in the House of Commons on the evening of 27 February, at a time 
when Mr Jones was in the bar of the House of Commons.  

 

294.	  Somewhat  surprisingly  (not  least  in  view  of  the  vigorous  cross-examination  of  Mr 
 
Jones) when it came to the cross-examination of Lord Prescott (on Day 20), it was not 
suggested that Mr Jones was involved in the telephone call. It was suggested instead 
that Lord Prescott had been passed Mr Brunswick’s mobile phone number between 
17:52 and 19:13 (the times of the two votes) in the Lobby of the House of Commons 
by one of his ‘parliamentary colleagues’. It will be recalled that Mr Brunswick said 
that he had been rung at 18.30 while at City Airport. 

 

295.	  While  I  recognise  that  the  Claimant  would  have  difficulty  in  identifying  what 
precisely  happened,  the  difficulties  are  largely  as  a  consequence  of  relying  on  Mr 
 
Brunswick’s account. 

 

296.	  The Claimant’s case focussed on three points: first, Thompsons’s anxiety about the 
deduction issue and the GLO application and Mr Jones’s political role; secondly, the 
 
unlikelihood of Mr Brunswick inventing such a call; and thirdly, that it would have 
been possible for Lord Prescott to have made a call at 18.30 between the two votes.  

 

297.	  The  first  point  assumes  (contrary  to  my  earlier  findings)  that  Mr  Brunswick  was 
correct in describing Thompsons as ‘very angry that Templeton’s ATE cover for the 
miner’s GLO had been reinstated’. If the insurance of the GLO was not a matter of 
such urgent critical concern to Thompsons they had no good or sufficient reason to 
call on such an important political favour as a personal intervention from the Deputy 
Prime Minister. Although I accept that, if he had been able to procure the political 
intervention  of  Lord  Prescott  in  favour  of  the  NUM  and  against  AGM,  Mr  Jones 
would have done so, I am very doubtful whether he was ever in such a position. He 
 
was (in political terms) a relatively peripheral figure and appears to have been at a 
reception in Portcullis House between 17.00 and 19.00. This may have been why the 
 
Claimant’s  case  was  put  (perhaps  ‘floated’  is  a  better  way  of  expressing  it)  on  the 
basis  that  Lord  Prescott  ‘may  well  have  discussed  the  issue  with  Dick  Caborn  and 
Alan  Meale,  and  possibly  Dennis  Skinner.’  There  is,  however,  very  little  basis  for
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

concluding that any of these MPs were sufficiently interested in the GLO application 
to have involved themselves in persuading Lord Prescott to make such a call. 

298.	  The second point depends on my view of Mr Brunswick. 

 

 

299.	  The Claimant’s strongest point is that the known timings mean that it was possible for 
Lord Prescott to have made a call from the House of Commons to Mr Brunswick at 
City Airport at about 18.30 on 27 February. 

 

300.	  There are, however, a number of difficulties with the Claimant’s case before one gets 
to the credibility of Mr Brunswick upon whom the entire case against Lord Prescott 
depends. 

301.	  First, Mr Fresson’s evidence was that he was not sure if he believed Mr Brunswick’s 

 

account of the telephone conversation. 

 

302.	  Secondly, Mr Lumsden was first notified that Templeton were still insuring the GLO 
in the conversation with Mr Booth after 15.16 and, according to Mr Brunswick, this 
was  followed  by  a  number  of  calls  from  Thompsons.  It  follows  that  Thompsons 
would  have  had  very  little  time  to  persuade  Lord  Prescott  to  make  a  call  at  18.30, 
 
even assuming that he would have been willing to do so. 

 

303.	  Thirdly,  although  Carolyn  Hurley’s  internal  email  note  of  28  February  records  Mr 
 
Brunswick’s complaints about telephone calls from Thompsons on 27 February, there 
 
was no mention of a phone call from Lord Prescott or even the slightest of hints that 
he had been put under pressure from such a powerful source. The whole tone of his 
recorded complaints to Ms Hurley is inconsistent with Lord Prescott’s intervention. 
 

 

304.	  Fourthly, it is part of the Claimant’s case that Mr Brunswick was told that Thompsons 
had arranged for him to receive a phone call which might encourage him not to be 
involved. In this context I accept Mr Shears’s evidence that as CEO if anyone had got 
in touch with Lord Prescott he would know about it, and he did not. 

 

305.	  Fifthly,  Thompsons  have  given  extensive  disclosure  of  internal  email  exchanges 
 
which the Claimant’s legal team has studied assiduously. As already noted, although 
these exchanges do not always show the firm in the best light, they demonstrate that 
Thompsons was not averse to noting its successes. Yet there is no reference to, nor the 
slightest intimation of, any call made by Lord Prescott at the firm’s request. 

 

306.	  Sixthly, although Lord Prescott’s oral evidence was not always clear, on the central 
 
part of the case against him he was emphatic: he had never met Mr Brunswick, had 
never  heard  of  Templeton  Insurance,    had  not  been  given  Mr  Brunswick’s  mobile 
 
phone number, had never made the call and had not spoken to him. His evidence was, 
and always has been, that no such conversation between them ever took place and that 
as a senior Minister he would never have become involved in such an issue.  

 
307.	 

It is implicit from the Claimant’s case against him that Lord Prescott misconducted 
himself  as  a  Minister  of  the  Crown  and  conspired  with  Thompsons  to  harass 
 
Templeton  into  withdrawing  its  insurance  of  the  GLO.  In  these  circumstances  is 
 
seems  to  me  that  Mr  Pooles  QC  is  correct  in  saying  that,  although  the  standard
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

remains the civil standard of a balance of proof, the Court is entitled to have regard to 
 
the inherent probabilities, see In Re B (Children) [2009] 1AC Lord Hoffmann at [15]. 

 

308.	  Finally, there are a number of Court findings where Mr Brunswick’s honesty has been 
in issue. He was found to have acted dishonestly in two cases: in Markel International 
Insurance Co. Ltd v. Surety Guarantee Consultants [2008] EWHC 1135 (Comm), by 
 
Teare J,  and in Templeton v. Brunswick [2012] EWHC 1522 (Ch), by HHJ Simon 
Barker QC. He has also been banned for life by the FCA and disqualified as a director 
by the FSC in the Isle of Man for 13 years, 6 months. This record of adverse findings 
does not mean that he is incapable of telling the truth, but would have led me to treat 
his evidence with considerable caution even if I had not been able to form my own 
view of his credibility. 

 

309.	  Taking all these matters into account (and one further matter to which I refer later in 
 
this  judgment),  I  have  concluded  that  the  Claimant  has  failed  to  prove  that  Lord 
Prescott made a call to Mr Brunswick in the terms that they now assert and has failed 
 
to make good the allegation of conspiracy or harassment against him. 
 

 

310.	  Although it is unnecessary to form a concluded view about the matter, I suspect that 
Mr Brunswick’s account of this phone call was another attempt to shift responsibility 
for making a decision about insuring the GLO. 

The GLO hearing before Sir Michael Turner 

 

311.	  The hearing took place over 3 days (3-5 April 2006); and it is a central plank of the 
Claimant’s  case  that  in  reaching  his  decision  to  dismiss  GWM’s  application  for  a 
GLO  Sir  Michael  Turner  was  actually  biased.  The  case  against  Thompsons,  Mr 
Shears  and  Mr  Lumsden  is  that  they  deliberately  procured  the  hearing  of  the  GLO 
application by a Judge whom they knew was biased.  

 
312.	 

In his Judgment on the GLO application given on 18 May 2006, Hobson and others v. 
Ashton  Morton  Slack,  solicitors  and  others  [2006]  EWHC  1134  (QB),  at  [71]  Sir 
Michael Turner summarised the seven reasons why the GLO application failed and 
 
would be dismissed. At the risk of abbreviating what was a summary, these were that: 
(1)  no  sufficient  thought  had  been  given  to  alternative  ways  of  adjudicating  the 
underlying  claims;  (2)  no  group  litigation  issue  had  been  sufficiently  or  precisely 
identified; (3) the claims against Raleys had no natural affinity with the claims against 
the  UDM  and  Vendside,  and  their  instructed  solicitors;  (4)  there  were  other  unions 
and independent sections of those unions who ought to have been joined; (5) there 
was a gross imbalance between the costs incurred and to be incurred and the sums to 
be recovered; (6) the validity and enforceability of the contract between the claimants 
 
and the UDM, and the recoverable damages were fact sensitive, and (7) there was a 
lack of certainty about the sufficiency and enforceability of the ATE cover.  

 

313.	  There are three broad strands to the Claimant’s case on actual bias. First, reliance is 
 
placed on the background to Sir Michael Turner’s involvement from March 2005, to 
 
which I have already referred, and which does not in my view demonstrate actual bias 
or, to the extent that it is material, either ‘a loss of objectivity’ or ‘a complete loss of 
objectivity.’
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 

 
314.  Secondly, the Claimant relies on an exchange which took place on 16 May 2006 at the 
start of a Review hearing which led Mr Watkins of Nabarro Nathanson (on behalf of 
 
the DTI) to be concerned that the material:  

...  might  give  rise  to  the  perception  that  Sir  Michael  had  a 
closed mind on the issue of the criticism of the CHA such as to 
 
make it difficult for him to take an even handed approach to the 
GLO application. 

 

315.  The  exchange  occurred  at  a  scheme  hearing  and  related  to  another  report  in  The 
Times to which the CG took objection and the DTI did not. Having read the exchange 
 
I am doubtful that it assists the Claimant beyond establishing that Sir Michael and the 
CG were sensitive to criticism that the CHAs were not being managed as effectively 
as they might. The DTI seems to have taken a more relaxed view, at least at this stage. 
 

 

316.  Thirdly, the reliance is placed on the conclusions of Cooke J in Greene Wood McLean 
LLP (in administration) v. Templeton Insurance Limited [2010] EWHC 2679 (Comm) 
 
at [165]-[193] and, in particular, [179] of the Judgment. 

 

It may be noted that Sir Michael appears there and elsewhere in 
the  course  of  the  proceedings  to  have  been  protective  of  the 
CHAs  schemes  and  those  involved,  optimistically  thinking, 
perhaps, that the Vendside fee was justifiable and that solicitors 
would  not  be  capable  of  the  actions  to  which  the  Solicitors 
 
Disciplinary Tribunals have referred. 

 

317.  Cooke  J’s  analysis  of  Sir  Michael  Turner’s  judgment  was  in  the  context  of  an 
argument  advanced  on  behalf  of  Templeton  that  GWM  (and  the  Counsel  they  had 
instructed) had been negligent in advising that a GLO application should be made. It 
was  therefore  necessary  to  consider  the  reasons  given  by  Sir  Michael  Turner  for 
dismissing  the  GLO  application,  since  they  were  relied  on  by  Templeton  to 
demonstrate that the lawyers had acted negligently. Cooke J decided that they had not 
been negligent, and it was therefore unnecessary for him to form a concluded view as 
to whether the Judge was right or wrong in his decision and, to the extent that he was 
critical of Sir Michael Turner’s reasoning, it is of limited assistance to the Claimant.  

 

318.  The  general  observation  that  Sir  Michael  Turner  was  sensitive  to  criticisms  of  the 
BCRDL scheme and the lawyers that had appeared before him seems to be justified. 
Doubtless  he  had  formed  the  view  that  without  their  expertise  and  cooperation  the 
 
schemes would have been unworkable. However, this does not significantly advance 
the Claimant’s case. The CHAs had been successful in resolving a multitude of claims 
 
and the many issues that had arisen; and applications whose effect was likely to cause 
 
disruption  to  the  operation  of  the  schemes  was  bound  to  be  looked  at  critically  by 
whoever heard it. 

 

319.  Like Cooke J, I am not directly concerned with whether Sir Michael Turner’s decision 
was  right  or  wrong.  Quite  apart  from  the  difficulties  of  one  court  deciding  such 
matters in relation to a court of equal jurisdiction, I have not listened to the arguments 
or  had  to  consider  the  very  large  amount  of  evidence  and  other  material  that  was 
deployed at the hearing.
--------
MR JUSTICE SIMON 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

Jackson v. Thompsons and others 
 

 
320.  At §482 of his closing written submissions the Claimant made the following point: 

 

The transcripts of this hearing speak for themselves, but include 
the judge adjourning the hearing of the GLO application to hold 
a CG meeting, inviting those involved in the GLO application 
to have a cup of tea.  Even by the standards of the events in this 
 
case, this was surprising. 
 

 

321.	  This  submission  demonstrates  the  lack  of  any  real  material  to  support  the  plea  of 
actual bias at the hearing. There was nothing surprising in adjourning the application 
which  was  overrunning  while  the  Judge  dealt  with  another  unrelated  case 
management hearing which had already been fixed. 

 

322.	  The suggestion that the transcripts speak for themselves is plainly correct; and I have 
accepted  the  Claimant’s  invitation  to  consider  them.  However,  it  is  striking  that, 
although the hearing took 3 days and GWM was closely involved throughout, not one 
single passage in the transcript has been relied on by the Claimant in support of the 
assertion of actual bias. 

 
323.	 

In a case where actual bias is alleged one would expect to see the bias demonstrated in 
the course of a 3 day hearing: either by the Judge exhibiting concluded views, or by 
his hostility to one side or favour to another. The transcript of the hearing shows a 
characteristically terse and even abrupt manner; but that is a matter of style and not 
substance.  More  importantly  the  transcripts  show  that  he  listened  attentively  to  the 
submissions and tested the arguments of both sides. He put points to Counsel for the 
respondents which had been made on behalf of the applicants (see for example day1. 
pp.83, 86 and 90; and day 2. pp.49, 52, 80), and other points which could properly be 
taken against them (see for example day 2. pp.3, 5, 23, 31, 33, 44, 50, 82, 87; and day 
3  pp.68,  75,  86,  87).  He  allowed  the  applicants  to  put  in  a  late  statement  from  Mr 
Edwards during the course of day 2, extended the time in which questions were to be 
answered  by  Mr  Edwards  in  the  applicants’  favour,  declined  to  accede  to  an 
application summarily to strike out the GLO application under Part 24 (day 3 p.23) 
and extended time to deal with further coverage issues which had not been adequately 
dealt  with  in  GWM’s  evidence  (day  3.  p.26).  The  Judge  also  emphasised  the 
importance of trying to produce a solution where justice could be achieved between 
all parties (day 2. p.56; and day 3. p.71). What is clear is that the application faced 
formidable difficulties due to the uncertainty of Templeton’s insurance policy (delay 
in  providing  the  terms  and  ambiguities  as  to  the  extent  of  the  cover).  These  were 
highlighted  by  the  respondents  and  were  recognised  by  Counsel  for  the  applicants 
(day 3. p.6). The application also faced extensively argued opposition from each of 
the respondents. 

324.	  Having considered the transcripts of the hearing I have found no support for the claim 

 

of actual bias in the place where one would most expect to find it. 

The judgment of 18 May 2006 and subsequent events 

325.	  Following the handing down of the adverse judgment on 18 May 2006, GWM wrote 

 

to Templeton on 22 May enclosing a copy of the order.

As you will see, regrettably, the application was dismissed with 
costs ordered against the Applicants on an indemnity basis. We 
 
have, however, been advised by Counsel that the prospects of 
success  on  an  appeal  are  good.  Accordingly  we  intend,  with 
your permission, to appeal to the Court of Appeal forthwith ... 

 

326.	  On 25 May Templeton wrote to Brooke North (who acted on behalf of the UDM and 
Vendside) purporting to give notice of an entitlement to avoid the GWM policy on a 
number  of  grounds.  It  was  characteristic  of  Templeton’s  failure  to  understand  the 
most  elementary  of  its  contractual  obligations  that  the  letter  was  not  sent  to  its 
assured,  GWM.  Templeton  relied  on  a  number  of  grounds  for  avoiding  the  policy 
deriving  from  its  interpretation  of  the  18  May  judgment,  including  reference  to 
[71(7)] and the lack of certainty as to the sufficiency and enforceability of the policy. 
 
It  is  unnecessary  to  spend  much  time  on  Templeton’s  grounds  for  repudiating  the 
 
policy, since it is clear that it was not entitled to do so. The relevant debate before 
Cooke J in Greene Wood McLean LLP (in administration) v. Templeton (see above) 
was about the ambit of the indemnity.  

 

327.	  Mr Edwards’s evidence was that the failure of the GLO application had very serious 
 
consequences  for  GWM.  Apart  from  the  adverse  order  for  costs  on  an  indemnity 
basis, an application for a wasted costs order was made by the respondents and, on the 
advice  of  GWM's  Professional  Indemnity  insurers,  was  conceded,  with  GWM 
becoming  potentially  liable  for  sums  said  to  be  over  £1  million.  There  was  also 
adverse publicity, not least as a result of UDM/Vendside pursuing a campaign against 
the  individual  applicant  miners,  which  included  obtaining  interim  charging  orders 
against the homes of 27 of the individual GLO applicants. The outcome of the GLO

MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE 
Approved Ruling 

 
MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE:  

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
Introduction  
 
1.  This case illustrates the importance of ‘cell site’, telephone and text evidence in modern 
prosecution of crime. It is also a paradigm example of why cell site, telephone and text 
evidence  served  by  the  Prosecution  in  digital  form  should  be  included  as  ‘Pages  of 
Prosecution Evidence’ (“PPE”) for Graduated Fee Scheme purposes. 

 
2.  Cell site, telephone and text evidence is now routinely served by the Prosecution on the 
Defence  in  major  criminal  trials.  In  the  past,  such  material  used  to  be  served  in  paper 
form. It is now, for obvious reasons of technical convenience and cost, invariably served 
electronically in digital form. This is part of the inexorable, and sensible, shift towards 
electronic service of documents in criminal cases.  

 
3.  The fact of electronic service is not a proper reason for Prosecution refusing to include 
such  material  in  the  PPE  and  to  make  payment  to  Defence  advocates  accordingly.  A 
refusal by prosecution to include such material in the PPE is a clear breach of the Legal 
Services  Commission’s  own  guidance  (see  below).    Further,  a  failure  to  ensure  that 
Defence  advocates  are  remunerated  for  examining  material  relied  upon  at  trial  by  the 
Prosecution may amount to a breach of Article 6 ECHR. 

 
4.  Remuneration should not be blind to the digital age. 
 
 
Background  
 
5.  In the early evening of Monday 11th November 2013, Nottinghamshire police discovered 
the  body  of  Andrew  Dosiuk  in  the  upstairs  bedroom  of  the  house  in  Arnold  where  he 
lived.  He was 33 years old. It was clear that he had been shot dead in his bed at close 
range.  There was no evidence of a struggle or resistance. 

 
6.  The Prosecution contend that this was a ‘contract’ killing linked to the drugs world and 
the  three  defendants  were  responsible  for  his  murder.    It  was  alleged  that  the  First 
Defendant was the hired gunman, the Second Defendant was the arranger and middleman 
and the Third Defendant ordered the killing and was the paymaster. 

 
7.  At the trial, which has lasted over 8 weeks, the Prosecution relied principally on cell site, 
telephone and text evidence, together with some CCTV evidence. The cell site, telephone 
and text evidence comprised: (i) telephone and text evidence of contact between all three 
defendants, (ii) telephone and text evidence of contact between the Third Defendant and 
the  deceased  Andrew  Dosiuk  (from  billing),  (iii)  cell  site  evidence  showing  the 
movement  and  position  of  the  three  defendants  (from  billing)  and  (d)  text  evidence 
showing the content of their contacts with each other (from text messages recovered from 
the  phone  downloads),  including  e.g.  evidence  of  what  is  said  to  be  an  interest  in  and 
access to firearms on the part of the Third Defendant.

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
 
Cell site/ telephone/ text messages schedules 
 
8.  The  backbone  of  the  Prosecution  case  was  a  cell  site/  telephone/  text  message/  CCTV 
schedule  (“the  Schedule”)  of  the  classic  sort  which  has  increasingly  becoming  an 
indispensible  tool  in  modern  criminal  trials  and  the  bedrock  of  many  prosecutions  of 
serious crime. The Schedule in this case runs to 163 pages and contains 774 entries over a 
period  from  17th  August  to  13th  November  2014.  It  comprises  a  meticulous, 
chronological, second-by-second, colour-coded tabulation of cell site, telephone and text 
message  contacts  and  CCTV  and  ANPR  sightings  relating  to  the  three  defendants  and 
their vehicles as well as the victim.   

  
9.  The Prosecution relied upon the Schedule in order to seek to prove (a) the Defendants 
links  to  each  other,  (b)  their  involvement  in  drug-dealing  and  the  hierarchy,  (c)  their 
connections to the victim, (d) the motive for the killing, (e) their movements relative to 
each other and relative to the scene of the shooting in the days and weeks leading to the 
shooting and (f) their precise movements and contacts on the day of murder itself. 

 
 
Telephone material served by the Prosecution 
 
10. The  substratum  of  the  Schedule,  i.e.  the  evidence  which  underpins  it,  comprises 
voluminous  cell  site,  telephone,  text  and  other  evidence  which  was  served  by  the 
Prosecution  upon  the  Defence  electronically.  The  material  is  listed  in  the  Schedule 
attached to the Order to this Ruling drawn up by Counsel. All of this electronic material 
has formed Crown ‘exhibits’ in the case. It was used by the Prosecution as the fulcrum of 
their case before the jury, both as the underlying basis for the evidence in the Schedule, 
but  also  in  the  form  of  selected  material  from  the  downloads.  The  major  part  of  the 
Prosecution evidence has comprised telephone records (mainly of the defendants or those 
closely linked to them) and telephone downloads from the defendants. Such downloads 
comprise numerous text messages and details of contacts and attribution. The Schedule 
has been central to the Prosecution case. During the course of cross-examination of the 
Defendants,  further  such  material  was  also  (properly)  introduced  for  the  first  time  into 
evidence by Prosecuting Counsel and placed before the jury.   

 
 
This material was not included in PPE  
 
11. The Prosecution has not paginated the material underpinning the Schedule, nor included it 
as part of the Page Count of served material, i.e. the PPE. The Prosecution’s Notice of 
Additional  Evidence  (“NAE”)  dated  the  3rd  November  2014  purported  to  cover  the 
service of only 3,446 pages of PPE, comprising 2,679 pages of exhibits and 767 pages of 
statement.  This  additional  material  amounted  to  a  further  24,407  of  served  pages  of 
evidence. I understand that the additional material itemised in the schedule to the Order 
attached to this Ruling includes only the most relevant material served by the Prosecution 
on the Defence and does not include material not covered by the Graduated Fee Scheme 
(see below), such as the numerous video exhibits in this case. I also understand that the 
page  count  of  24,407  has  been  done  on  a  conservative  basis,  i.e.  on  the  PDF  file 
pagination, which is more modest than the Word or Excel exhibits of the same material.

12.  It  is  clear,  in  my  judgment,  that  the  material  listed  in  the  schedule  to  the  Order  was 
integral  to  the  Prosecution  case  and  required  the  Defence  to  review  and  examine  it  in 
detail for the purposes of properly preparing the Defence cases. The crucial nature of this 
material to the trial was not in any dispute. 

 
Defence co-operation  
 
13. Defence Counsel are concerned that they will not be remunerated, properly or at all, for 
the considerable work which they have clearly carried out in relation to this electronic 
material. 

 
14. It would have been open to the Defence teams in this case to have refused to agree any 
schedules or charts or agreed facts, or indeed any sections of additional phone material 
used during the trial, until the Crown had properly served all material in accordance with 
the regulations, i.e. by printing them out and paginating them as part of the PPE. Defence 
lawyers in other cases have made such a stand and refused to accept such electronic un-
paginated  material  unless  and  until  included  in  the  PPE.    This  stance  can  lead  to 
considerable cost and delay in a trial. 

 
15. In  the  present  case,  however,  the  Defence  teams  have  not  stood  on  their  rights.  They 
have, to their credit, at all material times co-operated with the Prosecution to ensure the 
smooth-running of this trial. They have chosen not to object to the Prosecution serving 
material  electronically  and  to  accept  it  de  bene  esse,  no  doubt  in  the  belief  that  the 
Prosecution would reasonably accept in due course that such material should clearly part 
of the Prosecution Page calculation. Unfortunately, however, it appears that, so far, the 
Prosecution has refused to include this material in the PPE. The reasons for this refusal 
are not explained or pellucid. 

 
Agreement sought as to Schedule 
 
16. It should be emphasised that the Prosecution sought agreement from the Defence as to the 
accuracy  of  the  Schedule.  In  order  to  satisfy  themselves  as  to  the  accuracy  of  the 
Schedule and to be able to give their agreement, the Defence teams had to go through all 
of the records and downloads with care.  I understand that the Defence teams pointed out 
a  number  of  respects  in  which  the  Prosecution  Schedule  was  wrong,  inaccurate,  or 
incomplete. In addition, on a number of occasions during cross-examination, the Defence 
introduced further telephone evidence from the pool of Prosecution telephone material in 
order to supplement aspects of the Prosecution Schedule or to put telephone calls or texts 
or silences in proper context. None of this would have been possible had not the Defence 
advocates spent a considerable amount of time, and effort, reading and studying this base 
material served and exhibited by the Crown as part of their case.  

 
17. The Prosecution were, thus, able to produce and rely upon edited and selected parts of 
phone downloads during the course of the evidence and during cross-examination. This 
was only possible because of the agreement and co-operation of the Defence teams, who 
had worked hard to review, at short notice, the whole of the subject material (running to 
hundreds  of  pages  at  a  time)  and  correct  the  proposed  material  in  order  to  accurately 
reflect the actual evidence. Further, during the trial, Defence counsel were able to refer to 
and rely upon other various aspects of the served Prosecution cell site, telephone and text

material in order to rebut the Prosecution case and advance their own cases. This may 
have contributed to the eventual acquittal of the Second and Third Defendants. 

 
 
Order sought and granted 
 
18. All Defence counsel in this case sought an Order that the contents of the Prosecution’s 
electronically  served  exhibits  should  be  included  as  PPE  and  that  the  total  page  count 
should  therefore  be  27,853.  I  granted  such  an  order  in  my  Order  dated  3rd  December 
2014. This Ruling contains the reasons for my Order.  

 
Graduated Fee Scheme 
 
19. When the Graduated Fee Scheme (“GFS”) was introduced in 1997, payment for advocacy 
in the Crown Courts moved to a system of remuneration which was based on a set fee, 
traditionally referred to as a ‘Brief Fee’, which was dependant on the category of case and 
whether Counsel was a Q.C, led junior or leading junior. In addition, in the GFS there are 
two multipliers which are meant to ensure that the amount of work involved in preparing 
and  presenting  a  particular  case  is,  in  very  broad  terms,  reflected  in  the  remuneration. 
These multiplying factors are: (i) the number of Crown witnesses served by the Crown, 
and (ii) the number of pages of Prosecution Evidence served by the Crown, (i.e. PPE) up 
to the maximum covered by the GFS of 10,000 pages. 

20. The material covered by PPE are all matters of evidence in ‘document format’ (i.e. which 
could have been traditionally written/typed/printable evidence) which the Crown serve as 
part of their case in the form of the Committal Bundle: viz. statements and exhibits and 
NAE, normally including witness statements, interviews, photographs, charts etc. 

 
‘Unused material’ 
 
21. The Defence do not normally get remunerated for material which falls into the category 
of  “unused  material”.  This  is  despite  the  fact  that  it  might  run  to  many  hundreds  or 
thousands of pages and may require many hours to read and study it. “Unused Material” 
covers matters which the Crown do not rely on as part of their case or in support of their 
case, but which is served on the defence as “disclosable material” as it either supports the 
Defence  case  or  undermines  the  Prosecution  case,  examples  of  this  could  be  witness 
antecedent history, intelligence reports, custody records etc. 

 

 

 
 
 

‘Used’ material 
 
22. Matters which form part of the Crown’s case but are not in “document form”, i.e. written 
or printable form, are ‘used’ material but are not covered by the GFS.  If they are to be 
the subject of remuneration, a separate claim has to be made for “Special Preparation”, 
which will only cover work which is deemed to be ‘over and above’ the usual preparation 
undertaken for a case of a similar nature. It is a matter at the ‘discretion’ of the taxing 
officer as to whether the advocate will be remunerated for this work or not and if so the 
extent.
--------
MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE 
Approved Ruling 

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
23. In  the  present  case,  there  are  many  hundreds  of  hours  of  telephone  calls  and  texts, 
together  with  Police  Advisory  Service  (“PAS”)  evidence  from  Custody.  All  of  this 
evidence  has  had  to  be  viewed,  or  listened  to,  and  studied  by  the  advocates  and 
submissions  made  in  relation  to  them.  The  advocates  face  the  uncertain  prospect  of 
having to persuade the taxing officer, in due course, that this is all work for which it is 
‘reasonable’ for them to be remunerated. There is no guarantee, however, that a taxing 
officer (who has not had the benefit of sitting through the trial like the trial judge) will 
make  any,  or  any  sufficient,  allowance  for  it.  Experience  suggests  that  the  Legal  Aid 
Agency (“LAA”) will not usually agree to pay anywhere near the actual amount of time 
and work which was expended by the advocates in studying and marshalling this sort of 
evidence. 

 
Digital working 
 
24. Prosecuting authorities have, for quite understandable reasons of technical convenience 
and saving printing costs, taken to serving large tranches of material on disc which would 
have  previously  appeared  in  written/printed  form  by  way  of  un-paginated  electronic 
format.  In  the  past,  material  such  as  telephone  records,  telephone  downloads,  even 
photographs,  would  have  been  printed  off  in  paper  format  and  would,  therefore, 
automatically  have  formed  part  of  the  printed  PPE  material  served  by  the  Prosecution. 
Now such material is served electronically in digital format as explained above.  

 
25. Prosecuting  authorities  have  not  always  counted  such  telephone  material  as  part  of  the 
PPE. This has lead to an increasing number of appeals to Costs Judges against decisions 
of the Prosecution and LAA.  The Costs Judge’s rulings have all been to the effect that 
such materials should be included in the PPE since the material would previously have 
been served on paper (see below). Regrettably, the rulings of Cost Judges do not seem to 
have always been heeded by the Crown Prosecution Service or LAA. 

 
26. It  should  be  noted  that  there  have  been  a  number  of  large  and  complex  cases  piloted 
recently  where  the  entire  case  has  been  served  electronically  (including  Indictment, 
statements, exhibits etc). These cases have not caused a problem or conflicted with the 
GFS, since the Prosecution have very properly counted all such pages served in electronic 
format as ‘served’ material included in the PPE and evidenced this with an appropriate 
NAE cover sheet. Indeed, as noted above, the direction of travel is now more and more 
towards electronic service. This is to be welcomed in the digital age. 

 

The Law 
Funding Order (2012 amendment) 
27. Remuneration  for  the  Defence  is  provided  for  under  the  Funding  Order  2007  as 
amended. Following the first amendment of 2012 (SI 2012/750), material is now to be 
included in the Graduated Fee Page Count (PPE) if it would have existed originally in 
paper form but was served electronically. That was an amendment designed to herald 
digital working in the Criminal Justice System.  Importantly, however, the amendment 
went on to state that:  

“(2)   For the purposes of this Schedule, the number of pages of prosecution 
evidence  served  on  the  court  shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with 
paragraphs (2A) to (2C).
--------
MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE 
Approved Ruling 

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
(2A)  The number of pages of prosecution evidence includes all— 
 
   
   
   

(a)     witness statements; 
(b)     documentary and pictorial exhibits; 
(c)     records of interviews with the assisted person; and  
(d)  

records  of  interviews  with  other  defendants,  which  form  part  of 
the  committal  or  served  prosecution  documents  or  which  are 
included in any notice of additional evidence.  

 (2B) Subject  to  paragraph  (2C),  a  document  served  by  the  prosecution  in 
electronic  form  is  included  in  the  number  of  pages  of  prosecution 
evidence.  

 
(2C)  A documentary or pictorial exhibit which— 
 
 
 

(a)   has been served by the prosecution in electronic form; and 
(b)   has never existed in paper form, is not included within the number 
of  pages  of  prosecution  evidence  unless  the  appropriate  officer 
decides that it would be appropriate to include it in the pages of 
prosecution  evidence  taking  into  account  the  nature  of  the 
document and any other relevant circumstances.” 

 
 
28. That amendment applied to all cases where the Representation Order was granted on or 

after 1st April 2012. This case is, therefore, caught by the amendment.   

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

LSC Guidance (April 2012) 

 
29. Guidance was issued on the amendment by the then Legal Services Commission (“LSC”) 
in April 2012. It stated that, “if material that would previously have been served in paper 
form  is  served  electronically  instead,  it  should  be  included  in  the  PPE”.    Further 
paragraphs stated: 

“(5)  

In relation to documentary and pictorial exhibits, although it has not been 
possible to draft the wording of the Funding Order in such a way as to make 
this  explicit,  it  is  intended  that  where  the  prosecution  serve  a  digital 
document,  which  has  never  existed  in  paper  form,  the  appropriate  officer 
will assess whether this would previously have been served in digital form 
or printed out. 

(10)  Therefore,  the  only  difference  between  the  old  and  new  system  is  that 
whereas  previously  the  relevant  material  would  have  been  printed  and 
served in paper form, now it will remain in digital form, but will be paid as 
PPE  if  the  Determining  Officer  considers  that  it  would  previously  have 
been  printed.  Any  material  that  would  not  normally  have  been  printed 
(whether specifically relied on or not) will not be paid as PPE but as special 
preparation.”

Approved Ruling 

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
30. I understand from Counsel that it is within the memory of all who have defended in this 
case that, ten years or so ago and before the advent of digital working, such telephone 
billing data and telephone downloads and material of this nature would invariably have 
been served in paper form, as material that the prosecution intended to rely upon.   

 
31. It  is  clear  from  the  LSC  Guidance  that  the  Statutory  Instrument  was  not  aimed  at 
excluding  this  category  of  material  from  the  PPE  merely  because  it  was  increasingly 
served in a new digital form.  On the contrary, the intention was that it would continue to 
form part of the PPE and be remunerated on that basis. In my judgment, the failure or 
refusal of the Prosecution in this case to include the telephone material as part of the PPE 
is a clear breach of the LSC Guidance. 

 

 

Cases 
 
32. The plethora of recent cost cases on this subject have all been to the same effect: cell site, 
telephone  and  text  evidence  served  digitally  form  is  to  be  included  as  part  of  the  PPE 
because such material would previously have been served in a printed form.   
 
Nutting [2013]  

 
33. The case of Nutting [2013] 6 Costs LR 1037, involving a large-scale drugs conspiracy, is 
relevant to the present case. The Prosecution served telephone schedules and material on 
the  Defence  in  digital  form  but  refused  to  include  it  in  the  Graduated  Fee  page  count 
form. The trial judge, HHJ De Bertodano, ruled that this approach was not acceptable and 
ordered  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  to  effect  proper  service,  which  was  done. 
Following the conclusion of the case, however, the LSC still refused to make payment in 
respect  of  the  material.  The  Defence  appealed.  The  Costs  Judge  took  a  clear  and 
principled approach to the matter. He succinctly summarised the Defence objection to the 
manner of service of the material by the CPS as follows: 

 

 

 

“What  lay  behind  [the  defence]  concern  was  the  fact  that  unless  the 
background  telephone  material  was  either  served  on  paper  or  electronically 
attached  to  a  NAE,  the  defence  would  not  be  paid  for  considering  it.  The 
potential to be remunerated by way of ""special preparation"" gave no guarantee 
of payment, whereas service of the material with an NAE and updated page 
count, did. For that reason, the defence teams were not prepared to agree the 
Schedule which the Crown had intended to present to the jury.” 

 
 
34. The Costs Judge ruled in favour of the Defence, and held that the LSC should not have 
limited  the  PPE  to  1,235  pages  but  must  pay  the  full  claim  of  13,658  pages  because, 
following  HHJ  De  Bertodano’s  order,  the  telephone  evidence  had  been  served 
electronically  with  an  NAE  dated  8th  March  2012  fully  paginated.  Accordingly,  the 
telephone material must be remunerated as PPE and the LSC was wrong to require the 
Defence  to  submit  a  claim  for  “special  preparation”.  The  Costs  Judge  summarised  his 
reason for reaching this conclusion as follows: 
 

“Had the material which was served electronically in the present case instead 
been  relied  on  by  the  Crown  before  the  ""digital  age"",  it  would  have  been 
printed  out  on  paper.  Here,  following  the  judge's  direction,  the  material  in 
question was served under an NAE with each document sent electronically

having been given a page number. … The judge ruled against the Crown on 
that point and having done so, in my judgment the LSC cannot now contend 
that the material in question should not count as pages and must be excluded 
from the page count.” 

  

 
35. The  learned  Costs  Judge  added  the  following  pertinent  observations  at  the  end  of  his 

judgment which are worth quoting in full:  

That  in  itself  is  sufficient  to  decide  the  appeal  in  the  appellant's 

 
“30. 
favour. However, I would add the following:  
 
(1)  
The  amended  NAE  was  signed  off  by  the  court  as  being  ""for 
graduated fee purposes"", the updated page count. It is my view that that is the 
page count that the case worker should have accepted, as had been the case for 
counsel and other litigators.  
 
(2)  
The case worker's decision is contrary to the outcome which would 
have  resulted  had  the  determination  arisen  after  the  change  made  to  the 
Funding  Order  and  Guidance  for  representation  orders  made  on  or  after  3 
October 2011.  
 
(3)  
The reason why the defence teams would wish to be remunerated by 
way  of  PPE  is  plain.  The  agreed  page  count  should  (and  ought  to)  provide 
certainty. Special preparation does not. This court frequently hears appeals in 
which  the  advocate  or  litigator  contends  that  the  LSC  has  failed  to  allow 
sufficient  remuneration  for  work  reasonably  carried  out,  or  has  decided  that 
the material in question does not fall within the criteria for PPE, for example 
because it has not been served on the court, so the legal representative receives 
nothing. For a recent appeal involving such a dispute, see R v Dunne [2013] 6 
Costs LR 1031 (201/13) (Master Simons). That might have occurred here but 
for  the  judge  deciding  the  contest  against  the  LSC  and  directing  that  the 
material in question should count as pages.  
 
It follows that even if the LSC would wish to process the claim on the 
31.  
basis of special preparation in order for the burden on public funds to be less, 
on the facts of this case, the Funding Order does not permit it to do so. The 
appeal therefore succeeds.”   

 
 
36. I respectfully agree with both the ruling of HHJ De Bertodano (which resonates with my 
own ruling in the present case) and the decision of the Costs Judge in Nutting and his 
observations.  There  is  simply  no  proper  basis  upon  which  either  the  CPS  or  LAA  can 
refuse to include telephone material served in digital form in the PPE, or caseworkers can 
refuse to make payment according to that PPE page count. 

 
R v Renata Andrews (2013) and other cases 
 

37. In  R  v  Andrews  (19th  May  2013    Blackfriars  Crown  Court),  HHJ  Murphy  stayed 

proceedings when the Prosecution initially refused to serve the telephone billing data as 
part  of  the  PPE  page  count  and  made  the  following  robust  observations  with  which  I 
respectfully agree (emphasis added):
--------
MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE 
Approved Ruling 

 

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

“What  is  disturbing  about  this  is  that  I  was  told  very  candidly  that  the 
application by the Crown was being made primarily on financial grounds. If I 
am  understanding  that  correctly,  I  think  it  means  that  there  are  financial 
implications in serving a large number of pages of evidence that then have to 
be reviewed by defence counsel. Of course, once so many pages are explicitly 
identified, that obviously does have financial implications - and so it should. 
Why the CPS should concern itself with considerations of that kind was not 
explained, although it certainly calls for some explanation. But whether this or 
any other financial considerations are involved, it is in my view quite wrong 
for such considerations to stand in the way of the Crown properly complying 
with its disclosure obligations.”  

 
38. In Howden and Khan (16th May 2014, reference 34/14 and 35/14), a case of conspiracy 
to defraud, the Defence claimed a PPE page count of 10,000 pages whereas the Legal Aid 
Agency contended for a page count of 2,852 pages.  The difference was accounted for by 
telephone  evidence  that  was  served  on  disc  and  not  on  paper.    The  Legal  Aid  Agency 
caseworker refused to treat the telephone evidence as PPE on the basis that it had never 
existed in paper form.  The Costs Judge ruled that this was not a correct analysis of the 
position: the correct test was whether, before the advent of digital working, the evidence 
would have been served on paper – to which the answer was ‘yes’. 

 
39. In Nicholson (SCCO 197/14), a drugs conspiracy case, the Crown served telephone, text 
and  cell  site  data  on  disc  and  relied  on  schedules  based  on  that  raw  data.  The  judge 
ruled that such material was part of the served case:  
 
   

“Where  …  the  evidence  served  electronically  is  an  important  part  of  the 
prosecution case, it would be difficult to conclude that the pages should not be 
treated as part of the page count”. 

40. In  a  very  recent  ruling,  R  v  Douglas  (SCCO  130/14)  handed  down  on  27th  November 
2014, a senior Costs Judge upheld similar arguments to those outlined above and held 
that  telephone,  text  and  cell  site  evidence  served  electronically  was  central  to  the 
Prosecution case and must be included in the page count. 

 
POCA cases 
 
41. The  problems  encountered  in  the  current  case  appear  also  to  extend  to  POCA  cases. 
Documents exhibited to a financial statement pursuant to s.16 of the Proceeds of Crime 
Act 2002 (“POCA”) are increasingly served on disc rather than in hard copy. The disc 
is,  however,  often  not  treated  as  part  of  the  page  count,  but  only  selected  hard  copy 
extracts produced by the Prosecution are included in the PPE. This approach breaches 
the LSC Guidelines and is not correct. The entire disc is served by Prosecution under 
s.16. The entire disc is, therefore, deemed to be an exhibit in the case, duly served and 
relied upon by the Prosecution. Accordingly, the Defence are enjoined to examine the 
material  as  part  of  the  body  of  financial  documentation  served  by  the  prosecution  in 
order to meet the issues raised by the prosecution for the purposes of any s.17 POCA 
response. The entire disc must, therefore, be included in the PPE.

Case Management Powers 

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

42. The Court has the power and the duty to exercises its case management powers under the 
Criminal Procedure Rules. The CPR enshrines various overriding objectives under CPR 
R.1.1(1) and (2)(e), including ensuring cases are dealt with “justly” and “efficiently and 
expeditiously”. Under R3.2 the Court has a duty to “further the overriding objective by 
actively managing the case”. This includes under R3.2(c) “encouraging the participants to 
co-operate in the progression of the case”.  In my judgment, quite apart from the LSC 
Guidance and the substantive merits, the Court would have the power under its said CPR 
case management powers at any stage to order to the Prosecution to include the telephone 
material as part of the PPE to ensure the smooth-running of a trial.  
 
 

Article 6 ECHR 

43. Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) provides as follows: 

 

 

 

“1.    In  the  determination  of  his  civil  rights  and  obligations  or  of  any  criminal 
charge  against  him,  everyone  is  entitled  to  a  fair  and  public  hearing  within  a 
reasonable  time  by  an  independent  and  impartial  tribunal  established  by  law. 
Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded 
from  all  or  part  of  the  trial  in  the  interest  of  morals,  public  order  or  national 
security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection 
of the private life of the parties so require, or the extent strictly necessary in the 
opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the 
interests of justice.  

2.    Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until 
proved guilty according to law. 

3.    Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 

(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in 
detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;  
(b) to have adequate time and the facilities for the preparation of his 
defence;  
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own 
choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be 
given it free when the interests of justice so require;  
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the 
attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same 
conditions as witnesses against him;  
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or 
speak the language used in court.” 

 
44. Article  6(3)  sets  out  a  number  of  minimum  rights  to  which  everyone  charged  with  a 
criminal  offence  is  entitled.  This  specifically  includes  the  right  under  Article  6(3)(c), 
subject to means, to free legal assistance “when the interests of justice so require”. The

considerations to be taken into account when determining whether the interests of justice 
so require include the seriousness and complexity of the case and the importance of what 
is at stake for the accused. 

 
45. By virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, it is unlawful for a public authority 
to act in a way which is incompatible with a convention right. Section 8(1) of the Act 
further provides that: 

“In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court 
finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make 
such Order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.” 

 

Brownlee [2013]  

 
46. Inadequate remuneration within a legal aid scheme may breach a defendant’s right to a 

fair trial under Article 6 ECHR. 

 
47. In  Raymond  Brownlee  [2013]  NIQB  47,  a  defendant  was  convicted  of  various  serious 
offences including false imprisonment, making threats to kill and wounding with intent. 
In  the  course  of  his  trial,  his  Defence  team  withdrew  and  subsequently  new  solicitors 
were instructed prior to sentencing who decided that, in view of the complexity of the 
sentencing exercise, counsel should be instructed. The solicitors were, however, not able 
to secure the services of counsel to represent the defendant because the legal aid scheme 
only provided for fixed fees with no allowance for preparation, or exceptional fees, and 
no counsel was prepared to take the brief on this basis. In the course of his judgment, 
Treacy J observed (at para. 3):  
 

“The  right  of  everyone  charged  with  a  criminal  offence  to  be  effectively 
defended  by  a  lawyer  is  one  of  the  fundamental  features  of  a  fair  trial” 
(emphasis added). 

 

 

 

 

 
 

48. Treacy J went on to state (at para. 4): 
 

“[4] The person entitled to legal aid must be able to make his right to legal aid 
effective  as  the  Court  of  Appeal  recognised  in  the  Finucane  case  [Re  John 
Finucane [2012] NICA 12]. The nature of the preparatory work involved in 
this case for the deferred sentencing hearing in the circumstances which have 
arisen is likely to be substantial. As the court noted in its earlier judgment it is 
not in the public interest that the legal aid scheme as presently formulated or 
operated should lead to the rejection of instruction in this case by competent 
and  experienced  counsel  supported  by  the  Bar  Council  itself.  Part  of  the 
reason for this rejection appears to be because the rules do not allow payment 
for preparatory work and because, relatedly, the Scheme has no exceptionality 
provision. It is clear, as the court recorded earlier, that the inflexibility of the 
impugned  Scheme  is  preventing  the  applicant  from  being  able  to  make  his 
right to legal aid effective.

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
49. Treacy  J  granted  an  order  of  mandamus  requiring  the  Northern  Ireland  Legal  Services 
Commission  “to  take  all  necessary  steps  to  make  the  applicant’s  right  to  legal  aid 
effective” (para. 8). 

 
50. The Department of Justice appealed Treacy J’s order. The Court of Appeal ([2013] NIQB 
57)  allowed  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  defendant  was  the  author  of  his  own 
misfortune for having dismissed his legal team and relied on R(Kebilene) v. DPP [2002] 2 
AC  326.  However,  in  the  course  of  his  judgment,  Morgan  LCJ  acknowledged  the 
potential role of Article 6 in this arena: 

 

 
 
 

 

 
“An accused who loses his legal representation in the course of a trial through 
no  fault  of  his  own  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  obtain  alternative 
representation. Where he cannot do so because of the inadequacy of legal aid 
funding a breach of article 6 may well follow. The inflexibility of these Rules 
potentially raises the possibility of such an outcome.  In this case, however, 
the  material  before  us  suggests  that  the  accused  dismissed  his  counsel  and 
solicitors without any reasonable explanation at a late stage of his trial. …” 
(emphasis added) 

 
51. The Supreme Court ([2013] UKSC 4) reversed the Court of Appeal and, in effect restored 
Treacy J, on the basis that (i) the defendant had not dismissed his legal team or sought to 
manipulate the legal process and (ii) the legal aid rules were flawed and ultra vires in that 
they  failed  to  make  adequate  provision  for  a  self-evidently  material  consideration, 
namely, the possibility of one legal representative being replaced by another.  An order of 
mandamus was, however, no longer required because the legal aid authorities had already 
rectified the defect in the rules.  

 
52. In    the  course  of  his  leading  judgment,  Lord  Kerr  noted  without  demur  (at  [16])  the 

operation of the Article 6 and the principle touched on by Morgan LCJ: 

“Morgan  LCJ,  delivering  the  judgment  of  the  court,  acknowledged  that 
inadequate remuneration within a legal aid scheme can give rise to a breach of 
a defendant’s right to a fair trial under article 6 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, if an accused consequently finds it 
impossible to obtain the services of an appropriate lawyer to represent him.” 

 
53. As Treacy J said, the right to a fair trial under Article 6 includes the right to be effectively 
defended by a lawyer. In my judgment, the same principle applies to the situation where 
inadequate remuneration within a legal aid scheme means an accused cannot be assured 
that his lawyers will be properly paid, or incentivised, to read relevant material served and 
relied upon by the Prosecution at the trial, such as electronic material not included in the 
PPE.  Whilst,  as  Morgan  LCJ  observed  (at  [15]),  Article  6  does  not  guarantee  any 
particular  level  of  remuneration  to  lawyers,  nevertheless,  in  my  view,  it  is  axiomatic 
under  Article  6  that  Defence  lawyers  are  adequately  remunerated  so  that  they  can 
properly prepare an accused’s defence and effectively represent their client. A legal aid 
scheme which is operated arbitrarily in a way such that counsel are paid for reading only 
parts of the Prosecution material actually served and relied upon at trial but not others, is 
flawed and gives rise to a potential breach of Article 6 as elucidated in Brownlee (supra).

R v Michael Furniss & Others 

 
Conclusion 
 
54. In  my  judgment,  the  correct  approach  in  this  area  of  costs  is  clear  and  may  be 

encapsulated in the following proposition: 
 

Where ‘cell site’, telephone and similar material is served by the Prosecution 
upon the Defence in digital form, such material must be included as PPE for 
Graduated  Fees  Purposes,  and  payment  made  to  Defence  advocates  on  that 
basis. 

 

 

55. This proposition flows from the LSC Guidance and Article 6.  It is also consonant with 
the case law set out above, to which I would add with one small gloss: it is not necessary, 
in my view, to demonstrate that the digital material in question is ‘important’ or ‘central’ 
to the Prosecution Case.  The fact that such material is served by the Prosecution as part 
of  its  case  means  that,  ex  hypothesi,  it  is  ‘relevant’  and  required  to  be  read  by  the 
Defence.    

 
56. As was observed by the Costs Judge in Jalibaghodelehzi (SCCO (354/13), appeals to the 
Costs Court by Defence advocates regarding non-payment by Prosecution in respect of 
telephone evidence served digitally are becoming numerous.  There should be no need for 
such appeals. The position in law is clear: telephone, text and cell site evidence served by 
the Prosecution in digital form must now be included in the PPE page count and paid as 
such.  Defence advocates should not be put to the time, trouble and expense of bringing 
costs appeals or required to prove “special preparation” in lieu of the page count. If they 
are forced to do so, consideration should be given to awarding indemnity costs against the 
LSC or LAA in respect of the unnecessary appeal hearing in question. 

 
GFS ‘Maximum’ 10,000 page count  
57. As  noted  above,  the  GFS  currently  provides  a  PPE  ‘maximum’  page  count  of  10,000 
pages. The rationale for this apparently arbitrary ceiling is unclear.  Its effect is to impose 
an artificial cap on advocates’ remuneration irrespective of the work actually done. In my 
judgment, where the actual page count is not significantly above the maximum (say 20-
30% more), one can divine a pragmatic reason for a rough-and-ready cap on remuneration 
of this sort of order.  Where, however, the actual page count vastly exceeds the 10,000 
pages, such a restriction is manifestly disproportionate and cannot rationally have been 
intended to apply.  The present case is just such a case: the actual page count is 24,407 
pages, i.e. more than double the ‘maximum’.  Accordingly, the ‘maximum’ must yield 
and remuneration should be made on the actual PPE, namely 24,407 pages.   

Order of 3rd December 2014 
 
58. For all the above reasons, I made the attached Order dated 3rd December 2014 requiring 
the  Crown  properly  to  serve  the  telephone  evidence  material  listed  in  the  Schedule 
attached to the Order so that it was included in the PPE for Graduated Fee Purposes.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Jeremy Baker 

 

Woolwich Crown Court 

 

th 
 
6	 February 2015 

 

1.	  Imran Khawaja you were born and raised in this country and are now 27 years 

 

of  age.  You  attended  school  and,  after  leaving,  obtained  responsible 
 

employment.  Throughout  this  time  you  remained  living  at  home  with  your 
 
 
mother  and  sister  in  west  London  and  some  of  those  who  knew  you  during 

this  period  describe  you  as  being  both  kind  and  gentle.  However,  it  is  clear 
 

from  your  Facebook  account  that  over  the  last  few  years  you  have  been 
showing an increasing interest in Islamic jihadist material. By way of example, 

in 2011 you shared a video tribute to a Chechen mujahideen commander. In 
 

2012 you shared a video, glorifying Islamic martyrs, and in 2013 you shared a 
jihadist video showing battle scenes from the war in Syria. 

 

2.	  By  the  beginning  of  2014  you  had  become  sufficiently  radicalised  in  your 
views about Islam that you decided to leave your home and travel to Syria in 

order to train as a terrorist. Something, which you subsequently informed your 

sister, you had been planning for a long time. 

 

3.	  In preparation for that event, you had undergone some physical training, and 
 
between 6th and 17th January, withdrew £300.00 from your bank account. On 

1
--------
24th  January  your  close  friend,  Asim  Ali,  withdrew  £300.00  from  his  bank 
 

account and gave that sum to you for terrorist purposes. 

 

4.	  On  the  25th  January  you  booked  a  flight  to  Kurdistan  using  fraudulently 
obtained  details  from  a  credit  card  in  another  person’s  name,  and  embarked 

upon  your  journey  the  very  next  day,  leaving  from  Heathrow  airport  and 
 

flying  via  Turkey  to  Kurdistan,  where  you  arrived  on  the  27th  January.  You 

stayed  in  Kurdistan  for  a  period  of  about  5  weeks,  before  travelling  back  to 
Turkey on 2nd March, where you stayed for a couple of days, before entering 

Serbia  on  5th  March.  You  stayed  there  for  a  few  days,  before  re-entering 

Turkey on 10th March. Thereafter you travelled to Syria and by the 18th March 
 
were  in  contact  with  your  sister,  informing  her  that  you  were  now  in  Syria. 

You  stayed  in  Syria  for  a  period  of  about  2  ½  months  before  making 
 

arrangements to return to the UK on 3rd June. 

5.	  Whilst you were in Syria, not only did you receive terrorist training, but you 

 

 
also took part in the production of images and films designed to promote the 
 
Islamic State cause and to encourage UK Muslims to join them in jihad; these 

films  being  published  by  the  London  based  insurgent  group  called  Rayat  al-

Tawheed.  This  group  style  themselves  as  “muhajirun  (emigrants)  fighting  in 
Syria”  and  its  members  often  give  themselves  Kunyas  or  nicknames;  yours 

 

during this period being “Abu Daigham al-Baritani.” 

6.	  The first of these images was published on the group’s social media sites on 17th 
 

 

March and comprised a group of males, including yourself, in front of an anti­
aircraft  gun  mounted  on  a  camouflaged  truck  under  the  title,  “The  UK 

Brothers……One is only 16 and already a mujahid” On 2nd April an image was 

published in which you and another are seen masked and armed holding aloft 

an Islamic State banner. On the 9th April an image was published in which you 
and  others  are  shown  masked  and  armed,  over  a  caption  which  suggests  that 

 
you are about to embark upon an operation together that night. On the 10th 

2
--------
April the group published a film in which you are heard to praise one of your 


comrades who had been shot during the course of a recent terrorist operation. 


 

 
7.	  These  type  of  images  and  films  in  which  you  took  part,  continued  to  be 
 
published over the following 2 months. In some of these you are referred to by 

your  assumed  name  Abu  Daigham,  and  are  seen  handling  firearms  or  heavy 

weaponry,  glorifying  their  use,  whilst  pointing  towards  the  sky  in  order  to 

indicate your oneness with Allah. 

 

8.	  On 11th April the group published a particularly disturbing film in which you 
are seen to be holding up one and then another severed human head from a 

pile  of  others,  whilst  saying  in  a  contemptuous  manner,  “Heads,  Kuffars, 
 

disgusting.” This being followed on 20th April by the publication of a 7 minute 
 
long promotional video called “Five Star Jihad” in which you are seen sitting 
 

next  to  an  automatic  weapon  in  what  is  described  in  the  commentary  as  a 
 

mujahideen base camp. On the 15th May the group published an image of you 

masked  and  armed  standing  alongside  a  man  on  crutches,  over  the  rhetorical 
caption, “What’s your excuse?” 

9.	  Throughout  the  period  whilst  you  were  abroad,  your  sister  was  repeatedly 
 

 

requesting you to return to the UK. In response, you made it clear to her that 

you had no intention of doing so, that you were in Syria for jihad and wished 
 
to  die  a  martyr.  You  repeatedly  sent  her  images  of  yourself  and  others  with 

 

weaponry; on one occasion informing her that the person depicted with you 

was  one  of  your  “brothers”  who  had  only  recently  been  shot  and  was  still 
 
warm, on another you asked her to send you money because your “tools” cost 

$2 000.00. You were aware from an early stage of the need for security in your 

communications with those in the UK, and gave instructions for messages to 
 

be  sent  via  “Telegram.”  Later,  you  instructed  your  sister  to  delete  your 
 
communications in order to seek to frustrate any subsequent investigation into 

your activities.  

3
--------
10. You were also in contact with your cousin Tahir Bhatti, sending him similar 

 
imagery. At one stage you were asking him to send you a new mobile phone, 
 
 
whilst  at  another  stage  you  asked  him  to  send  you  some  money  in  order  to 

purchase  a  Kalashnikov  rifle;  informing  him  that  you  were  situated  in  a  war 
 

zone. It is fair to point out, in the case of Tahir Bhatti, that although he never 
refused to send either of these items to you, he never did so. Moreover, during 

your contact with Asim Ali in this period, he informed you that there was no 

point in contacting Tahir Bhatti, because your cousin wanted you to return to 

 
the UK; a sentiment which he had expressed in an earlier communication with 
your sister. 

11. There came a time towards the end of May of last year when a decision was 

 
 
made that you would return to the UK, and Tahir Bhatti agreed to facilitate 

part  of  that  journey.  Initially  contact  about  this  matter  was  made  directly 
between Tahir Bhatti and yourself. However by 30th May your mobile phone 

had been given to a third party called “Isaac” and at that stage the arrangements 

were made through him. 

12. Isaac  was  someone  who  had  previously  featured  in  the  communications 

 
between the various parties in this case. Asim Ali had been in contact with him 
and  another  individual  at  a  much  earlier  stage,  when  he  was  being  asked  to 

provide more money for you. Although Asim Ali suggested that this might be 
 

forthcoming,  it  is  fair  to  point  out,  in  the  case  of  Asim  Ali,  that  there  is  no 
evidence that any further sums were provided by him. 

13. On 31st May Isaac was in communication with Asim Ali and made it clear that 

 
your  return  to  the  UK  should  be  kept  secret  as  “We”  wanted  everyone  to 

believe  that  you  had  died.  A  few  days  later  it  became  clear  who  the  “We” 

 
referred  to  was,  because  following  your  return  to  the  UK  on  the  3rd  June, 
 
Rayat  al-Tawheed  published  an  article  on  their  social  media  sites  in  which 

4
--------
your image and that of another was shown above a caption which said that you 

had recently died in battle. 

 
14. In the meantime, however, on 30th May Tahir Bhatti had hired a VW Tiguan 
motor  vehicle  and  crossed  to  the  continent  by  ferry  in  order  to  drive  to 

Bulgaria to collect and drive you back to the UK. You had left Syria at about 

the same time, re-entering Turkey on 1st June, before travelling on to Bulgaria. 

On the 3rd June, you met up with Tahir Bhatti and were then driven back to 
the UK. It was later on 3rd June, whilst you and your cousin were seeking to 

pass through immigration control at Dover, that you were both arrested by the 

police. You and Tahir Bhatti had concocted a false account as to the nature of 
 
the  journey  which  had  brought  you  both  to  Dover;  one  which  Tahir  Bhatti 

persisted in until he was confronted with the images and messages from you on 

his phone, at which point he agreed that the account was a false one. 

15. In  the  course  of  the  subsequent  police  interviews  both  you  and  your  cousin 

 
declined to answer questions, as did Asim Ali after he was arrested by the police 
on 14th August 2014. 

16. In so far as the course of the criminal proceedings are concerned, you Imran 

 
Khawaja and Tahir Bhatti were both charged with offences arsing out of this 

matter on 13th June 2014, and you Asim Ali on 15th August 2014. By this latter 
 
date  there  had  already  been  a  number  of  court  appearances  by  the  first  two 

accused  and  on  31st  July  the  case  had  been  fixed  for  a  trial  to  take  place  in 

 
January  of  this  year.  Although  the  prosecution  had  finished  serving  all  of  the 
 
evidence upon which they relied by 11th September, it was not until the 12th 

December 2014, following slightly earlier discussions with the prosecution that 

you  Imran  Khawaja  entered  acceptable  pleas  of  guilty  to  the  indictment, 

 
namely to counts 1, 2, 3 and 4; the relevant date for you Asim Ali being 23rd 
 
December 2014, in respect of count 10, and for you Tahir Bhatti 20th January 

2015 in respect of count 8. 

5
--------
17. All of the offences to which each of you has pleaded guilty concern terrorism, 

 
either  directly  or  indirectly.  In  this  regard  a  number  of  sentencing  principles 

have emerged from cases which have previously been considered by the Court 
of Appeal Criminal Division. In R v F [2007] QB 960 it was made clear that it 
makes no difference to the seriousness of the offence whether the intended acts 

of terrorism were to take place in this country or abroad. In R v Khan [2013] 

EWCA 468, it was said that, for the purposes of s.143 of the Criminal Justice 
 
Act  2003,  in  most  cases  of  terrorism  the  element  of  culpability  will  be 

extremely  high,  that  the  purpose  of  sentence  for  the  most  serious  terrorist 
offences will be to punish, deter and incapacitate and, the starting point for an 

inchoate offence is the sentence that would have been imposed if the objective 

had been achieved. In R v Dart & others [2014] EWCA 2158 it was said that, in 
relation to an offence under s.5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, the factual nexus 
between an offender’s conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention 

and the future commission of the intended acts of terrorism will be a significant 

factor in determining the ultimate sentence. 

 
 
18. However,  I  also  bear  in  mind  the  need  for  caution  which  was  expressed  by 
Leveson LJ in R v Khan in these terms, “Although potentially highly relevant 
 
both to culpability and potential harm (and, thus of importance for the purpose 

of fixing the punitive part of any sentence) in our judgment, when assessing the 

future  risk  to  the  public,  too  much  weight  should  not  be  placed  on 
conversations for the purpose of ascribing comparative sophistication: it is not 

implausible  that  some  self-publicists  will  talk  “big”  and  other,  more  serious 

plotters,  may  be  more  careful  and  keep  their  own  counsel.”  Also  the 

observations of Lord Phillips CJ in R v Rahman & Mohammed [2009] 1 CAR 
(S) 70, “……It is true that terrorist acts are usually extremely serious and that 
 
sentences  for  terrorist  offences  should  reflect  the  need  to  deter  others.  Care 

 

must, however, be taken to ensure that the sentence is not disproportionate to 

the facts of the particular  offence…….If sentences are imposed that are more 

6
--------
severe than the particular circumstances of the case warrant this will be likely to 

inflame rather than deter extremism…..” 

19. There are relevant statutory provisions which must be considered in this case, 

 
over  and  above  the  general  principles  provided  by  the  Criminal  Justice  Act 
2003 and the maximum available sentences in respect of each offence. In your 

case Imran Khawaja, Counts 1, 3 and 4 are “specified violent offences” within 

Chapter 5 of Part 12 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, such that the court must 

determine  the  issue  of  “dangerousness”.  In  this  regard,  Count  1  having  a 
maximum  sentence  of  life  imprisonment,  s.225  has  to  be  considered  and, 

Counts  3  and  4  having  maximum  sentences  of  10  and  15  years  respectively, 

s.226A. In your case Asim Ali, Count 10 is an offence in respect of which a 
financial  reporting  order  may  be  made  pursuant  to  s.76  of  the  Serious 

Organised  Crime  and  Police  Act  2005.  In  addition  there  are  the  forfeiture 

provisions  under  s.23A  of  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  and  the  notification 
requirements under Part 4 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008.  

20. Imran Khawaja, a number of submissions have been made on your behalf, both 

 
in  writing  in  a  note  on  sentence  dated  30th  January  2015  and  orally  by  Mr 
Blaxland  QC.  It  is  suggested  that  your  interest  in  radicalised  Islamic  ideas  is 

 
only of recent origin, as evidenced by the paucity of jihadist material in your 

possession; that part of your motivation for going to Syria was due to genuine 
humanitarian concern for the local population; that the physical training which 

you  undertook  in  the  UK  should  not  be  considered  to  be  part  of  your 

preparation for terrorism, as it took place at a gym and pre-dated your interest 
in jihad; that although it is accepted that you received terrorist training in Syria, 

it is not accepted that you took part in any combat; it is suggested that you felt 

pressurised to take part in the images and films published by Rayat al-Tawheed, 
and; that your motivation for returning to the UK was because of concern for 

your  family  and  your  decision  to  abandon  jihad.  As  a  result  of  these  matters, 

and  bearing  in  mind  the  opinion  of  the  consultant  clinical  psychologist,  it  is 

submitted  that  the  court  should  not  conclude  that  you  satisfy  the  criteria  for 
being  a  dangerous  offender,  or,  if  it  does,  that  a  sentence  of  neither  life 

imprisonment nor an extended sentence is justified. Also that bearing in mind 

7
--------
the timing of your pleas of guilty you should receive a discount of between 25 

– 33%. 

 
21. In  the  course  of  the  sentencing  exercise  you  were  given  the  opportunity  to 
provide evidence in relation to the evidential matters which have been raised 

on your behalf and have declined to do so. In these circumstances they fall to 

be  determined  upon  the  evidence  otherwise  available  in  this  case.    In  this 

regard  I  have  considered  that  evidence  with  care  and  have  reminded  myself 
that  any  adverse  evidential  finding  requires  the  court  to  be  satisfied  to  the 
 

criminal standard of proof. 

22. Whilst I accept that compared to some cases there may be less material of an 
 

 
Islamic jihadist nature which was found to have been in your possession prior 
 
 
to your departure to Syria, I am afraid that I cannot accept that this necessarily 

implies  that  you  had  only  a  superficial  interest  in  such  material,  or  that  your 
 

interest  in  it  was  only  of  recent  origin.  On  the  contrary,  your  interest  was 

sufficiently profound for you to decide to travel to Syria in order to train for 
 
jihad,  and  it  is  clear  from  your  Facebook  account  that  you  were  showing  an 

interest in such material for a significant period of time prior to making your 
 

decision to travel to Syria; subsequently informing your sister that your plans 
for  what  was  to  take  place  in  Syria  had  been  of  long  gestation.  Moreover,  I 

have  seen  nothing  which  would  lead  me  to  believe  that  your  interest  in 

travelling to Syria was motivated by any genuine humanitarian concern for the 
local population, as opposed to support for jihad and the Islamic state. Not only 
 

did  you  not  make  any  mention  of  such  a  concern  in  any  of  your 
 

communications,  but  on  the  contrary,  as  you  informed  your  sister  in  one  of 
your first communications to her upon your arrival in Syria, you were there, 

“For  Allah…..first”;  subsequently  telling  her  that  you  were  there  for,  “Jihad 

for  wat  Imran  Shariah.”  In  relation  to  the  physical  training  which  you 

undertook prior to your departure to Syria, although I accept that at an earlier 
stage of your life you may have had an independent interest in such training, it 

is apparent that at some point prior to your departure for Syria this had become 
 

8
--------
linked in your own mind to the jihadist cause, as a laptop found at your home 
 

following your arrest contained a film glorifying jihad and showing images of 
you engaging with others in physical training in the UK. 

23. I accept that you may not have been personally involved in the publication of 

 
the various promotional images and films over the internet. However, it is clear 
 

that you were personally involved in their production from a very early point 

after your arrival in Syria, and there is nothing in their content which would 
lead  me  to  doubt  that  you  were  anything  but  a  willing  and  enthusiastic 

 
participant  in  their  production.  This  is  supported  by  the  content  of  the 

contemporaneous  communications  which  you  were  conducting  with  your 
sister  and  others,  which  on  occasions  mirrored  the  material  which  was  being 

published by Rayat al-Tawheed. Moreover, as a person who had viewed such 

material prior to your departure from the UK, the promotional purpose which 
lay  behind  the  production  and  publication  of  these  images  and  films  was  a 

matter of which you were fully aware, and I am satisfied fully supported. 

 

 
24. You  have  conceded  that  during  the  period  in  which  you  were  in  Syria,  you 
undertook terrorist training, and by your pleas to counts 3 and 4 acknowledge 

that  this  included  being  trained  in  the  use  of  the  firearms.  There  is  material 

available  in  this  case  which  suggests  that  thereafter  you  may  also  have  taken 
part in combat within Syria. However the majority of this material is found on 

the  captions  accompanying  the  images  and  films  produced  by  Rayat  al-

Tawheed,  and  where  the  imagery  and  words  used  personally  by  you  may 
 
suggest  this,  I  consider  it  equally  open  to  the  inference,  that  whilst  being  in 

extremely close proximity to one of the combat zones and assisting those who 

had returned from the front line, you did not actually take part in the fighting 
 
itself.  Moreover,  although  the  contemporaneous  communications  with  your 
 

sister suggest that you were extremely close to one of the combat zones, I am 

not satisfied that it safely establishes that you were necessarily involved in the 
 

fighting which was taking place. 

9
--------
25. However  although  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  evidence  safely  establishes  that 

 
 
you took part in the fighting in Syria, I am satisfied, as I have already observed, 
 
that you were extremely close to one of the combat zones in Syria and assisted 

those  who  had  recently  returned  from  fighting  on  the  front  line  to  the  base 

which you shared with them. Moreover, I am also satisfied that by the time the 
 
decision  was  made  for  you  to  return  to  the  UK  you  had  completed  your 

terrorist training. You were in Syria for a significant period of time, and do not 

suggest otherwise. It is certainly evident from the imagery that you were able 

to handle your firearms with safety. 

 
26. It is implicit from the care that was taken by Rayat al-Tawheed to provide you 

 
with  a  cover  story  relating  to  your  death  in  battle,  that  not  only  were  you 
considered to be an individual of significance within the organisation, but that 

it was anticipated that you would be enabled to remain an active member after 

your  return  to  the  UK.  There  is  evidence  from  your  communications  with 
 
others  that  the  reason  for  your  return  to  the  UK  was  to  enable  you  to  raise 

 
further  funds,  in  order  that  you,  and  potentially  others,  could  return  to  take 

part in the fighting in Syria. Whether or not this was the reason, I am satisfied 

that your return to the UK was not for the reason which you now suggest or 
 
any  other  innocent  reason,  namely  out  of  concern  for  your  family  and/or 

because  you  have  become  disenchanted  with  the  cause  of  the  Islamic  State. 
 

Throughout the period when you were in Syria, your sister’s entreaties for you 
to  return  were  met  with  refusals  by  you;  sometimes  couched  in  terms  of 

criticism  of  your  family’s  adherence  to  their  faith,  and  at  other  times  with 

quotations by you from religious and jihadi texts. At no stage did you suggest 
any diminution in your adherence to the jihadist cause. In these circumstances 

I  am  not  prepared  to  accept  the  sincerity  of  the  sentiments  which  you 
 

expressed in the letter which you have very recently provided for the purpose 
of  the  sentencing  exercise.  As  I  have  already  mentioned,  it  is  clear  that  the 
 

decision for you to return to the UK was one which at the very least had the 
 

blessing of Rayat al-Tawheed and others. Isaac was involved in its organisation, 

and the image posted by the group on their social media on the day of your 
 
return was clearly designed to facilitate your re-entry into the UK undetected. 

In  this  regard  I  do  not  consider  it  of  significance  that  once  your  cover  was 

10
--------
blown,  the  group  sought  a  damage  limitation  exercise  by  appearing  to 

denounce your actions. 

27. In determining whether you are to be considered to be a dangerous offender, I 

 
have,  amongst  other  matters,  taken  into  account  what  I  know  of  your 
character,  your  role  in  these  offences  and  the  assessment  of  your  cognitive 

 

abilities by the consultant clinical psychologist. I accept that you come from a 

close and loving family and, like many others, there is little in your past from 

 
which  the  present  events  could  have  been  anticipated.  You  may  not  have 
 
shone academically at school, but you are clearly able to function normally and 

hold down good employment. Indeed you planned, organised and executed an 

elaborate  journey  to  Syria  and  back  in  the  furtherance  of  these  offences.  In 
these circumstances although the opinion of the consultant clinical psychologist 

 
is of relevance to the assessment of your culpability, it does not seem to me that 

 
the restriction in your cognitive abilities is of such an order that it significantly 
diminishes your responsibility for these offences.  

28. On  the  evidence  before  me  I  have  reached  the  opinion  that  you  do  pose  a 

 
significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by you of 
further specified violent offences. You were involved in both the preparation 

for and return from a significant period of terrorist training in Syria, which was 

designed and carried out with a degree of sophistication. You undertook that 
training  in  close  proximity  to  a  combat  zone  in  which  you  voluntarily  lent 

assistance to those who were involved in the fighting, during which you took 

an active and enthusiastic part in producing jihadist promotional material, some 
 
of which was of a profoundly disturbing nature, knowing and intending that it 

would  be  used  to  seek  to  persuade  others  within  the  UK  to  join  the  jihadist 

cause  of  the  Islamic  State;  which  is  one  to  which  I  am  satisfied  you  remain 
adherent.  In  reality  with  such  a  mindset  and  having  completed  such  an 

extensive  period  of  terrorist  training,  you  are  now  an  individual  whose 

potential danger to the public, either in this country or abroad, is all too clear. 

11
--------
29. In determining the nature and length of the inevitable custodial sentence in this 

 
case I have, in accordance with authority, had regard to the notional sentence 
 
that  would  have  been  imposed  if  the  intended  acts  of  terrorism  had  actually 
 

been carried out. It is accepted on your behalf that your intention in going to 

Syria, once you had completed your training, was to take part in the fighting 
on behalf of the Islamic state. Although I accept that the worst aspects of what 

they have done may not have been evident to you prior to your departure to 

Syria, I am quite satisfied from the imagery that I have seen and the part you 

played  in  it,  that  during  the  time  when  you  were  in  Syria  not  only  did  you 
know  of  the  brutal  and  abhorrent  nature  of  the  activities  which  they  were 

undertaking at that time, but it is clear that you took an active and enthusiastic 

 
part in assisting those who were directly involved in those activities; glorifying 
their conduct. I have considered the factual nexus between the preparatory acts 

which you undertook and the intended terrorist acts which I have described. In 

my judgement it is a close one. You prepared for and travelled to Syria, where, 
having completed your terrorist training, you assisted those who were fighting 

in  the  front  line  and  were  fully  trained  to  take  part  in  that  or  other  terrorist 

activities. 

30. Ultimately I have reached the conclusion that although the offences for which 

 
you are to be sentenced are undoubtedly extremely serious, they are not ones 
which  in  my  judgement  justify  the  imposition  of  a  sentence  of  life 

imprisonment, as the risk can be adequately met by and justifies the imposition 
 

of  an  extended  sentence  under  s.226A  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003.  In 
reaching  this  decision  I  have  taken  into  account  the  absence  of  evidence  of 

your having actually taken part in the combat itself, as opposed to its assistance 
 

and  glorification.  However  in  my  judgement  these  latter  factors,  particularly 
the  active  and  enthusiastic  part  which  you  played  in  the  production  of  the 
 

Rayat  al-Tawheed  imagery,  which  you  knew  was  designed  and  intended  to 

encourage others in the UK to take up arms for the cause of the Islamic state, 
 

significantly  aggravate  these  offences.  In  that  regard,  although  I  accept  that 
there should be some measure of proportion between the sentence on Count 

1,  and  the  maxima  available  in  relation  to  the  remaining  Counts,  as  is 

12
--------
acknowledged on your behalf it is not a limitation, and the sentence is bound 

 
to reflect, inter alia, those aggravating factors. It must also of course reflect the 
mitigating features of your case, including your previous good character. 

31. You are of course entitled to be provided with an appropriate discount from 

 
the custodial term so as to reflect the pleas of guilty which you entered in this 

case. The guidelines provided by the then sentencing guideline council on this 

issue are familiar to all, and provide for a sliding scale of 33% when the plea is 
entered at the first reasonable opportunity and reducing to 10% when the plea 

is  entered  at  trial.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  relevant  chronology  in  this  case 

determines  that  whilst  you  did  not  enter  your  plea  of  guilty  at  the  first 
reasonable opportunity, you did so at a sufficiently early stage so as to attract a 

discount of 25%. 

 
32. Therefore  taking  into  account  all  of  these  matters,  and  bearing  in  mind  my 

 
statutory duty to pass upon you the shortest commensurate term, the sentences 

which I intend to impose upon you are as follows: on Counts 2, 3 and 4 there 
 
will be custodial sentences of 7 years, 7 years and 11 years respectively. These 

terms  will  be  ordered  to  run  concurrently  with  each  other  and  concurrently 

 
with the sentence on Count 1. The sentence on Count 1 will be an extended 
 
sentence of 17 years, comprising an appropriate custodial term of 12 years and 

an extension period of 5 years. The effect of this sentence will be that you will 

serve a minimum of 8 years and thereafter your release, prior to the expiration 
of  the  whole  term,  will  be  subject  to  a  decision  of  the  Parole  Board  as  to 

whether it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public for you to be 
 

detained. There will be a surcharge order in the sum of £120.00 and you will 
be subject to the notification requirements of part 4 of the Counter-Terrorism 

Act 2008 for a period of 30 years. 

33. Tahir Bhatti, I have already described your role in this matter which is reflected 

 
in your plea of guilty to Count 8 upon the indictment, the maximum sentence 
 

13
--------
for which is 5 years’ imprisonment. I accept that you did not approve of your 

younger cousin’s actions in travelling to Syria and were motivated by a desire 
to see him return to his family. However, it is clear that from a relatively early 
 

stage you were fully aware that the purpose of his trip to Syria was for purposes 

connected  with  terrorism,  namely  to  undertake  terrorist  training.  Indeed  you 
 
too were the recipient of images and films from him in which he was depicted 

glorifying  acts  of  terrorism  in  that  country.  Although  I  accept  that  you  did 

nothing to actively encourage your cousin in his endeavours, given the length 

of  time  during  which  you  were  in  communication  with  him,  there  are  in 
reality few examples of your active encouragement that he should return to the 

UK, and when he asked you to provide him with a mobile phone and money 

with  which  to  purchase  a  firearm,  instead  of  refusing  him  point  blank,  you 
 
prevaricated,  suggesting  that  given  time  you  may  accede  to  his  request. 

However  the  particularly  serious  aspect  of  your  conduct,  and  that  which 

establishes  your  guilt  of  this  offence,  is  that  you  took  an  active  part  in 
 
reasonably elaborate arrangements to seek to ensure that his return to the UK 
 

would pass undetected by the authorities, and thereby escape his apprehension 

and prosecution by them. 

 
34. In Att. Gen.’s Ref. No.16 of 2009 (James Yates) [2010] 2 CAR (S) 11 the Court 
of Appeal Criminal Division set out three factors which fall to be considered in 

relation  to  such  offences,  namely:  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  criminality  of 
the  offender  for  whom  the  assistance  was  being  provided;  the  nature  of  the 

assistance  actually  provided,  and  the  extent  to  which  the  efforts  to  assist  the 
 

offender damaged the interests of justice. Applying those factors to this case. It 
 
is clear that the nature and extent of the criminality of Imran Khawaja of which 

you were aware was particularly high, in that you knew that he was in Syria 

undertaking terrorist training in the circumstances which I have described. You 
provided  him  with  significant  assistance  and,  although  your  actions  were 

ultimately unsuccessful, they were intended, amongst other matters, to ensure 

that your cousin would escape his lawful detection and prosecution.  

14
--------
35. In relation to your plea of guilty it is apparent that it was not entered at the first 

 
reasonable opportunity, indeed it was entered at a time reasonably proximate to 
the date of the trial. Moreover I do not consider that the delay in your cousin’s 

 
plea justifies your own delay. In these circumstances although you are entitled 

to a discount to reflect your plea of guilty, it will be limited to one of 25%. 

36. In your case it is clear from the statements before me that hitherto you have 

 
 
been  a  man  of  positive  good  character;  helping  others  and  supporting  your 
 
family  from  your  taxi  business.  Moreover,  as  I  have  said,  I  accept  that 

ultimately  you  were  motivated  to  obtain  the  return  of  your  cousin  to  his 

family. However, in doing so you intended that he should be enabled to return 
 
without  detection  by  the  authorities.  In  my  judgement,  bearing  in  mind  the 

reasons  you  knew  that  the  authorities  would  rightly  be  interested  in  his 

 
detection, namely the prevention of terrorism in this and other countries, this 
 
offence is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified. 

 
I have taken all of the matters to which I have referred into account, and have 

concluded that the shortest commensurate sentence which is appropriate in this 

case is one of 21 months’ imprisonment. There will be a surcharge order in the 
 
sum of £100.00. The period which you spent on remand in custody will be 

automatically deducted from this period, and I will also order that you should 

be credited for half the number of days which you spent on bail subject to a 
qualifying curfew, pursuant to s.240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which 

is  I  understand  agreed  at  190  days.  Therefore  the  time  credited  under  this 

provision  is  95  days.  You  will  be  released  at  the  half  way  point  of  your 
sentence and thereafter remain on licence for the full term. 

37. Asim Ali, I have already described your role in this matter which is reflected in 

 
your plea of guilty to Count 10 on the indictment, the maximum sentence for 

which is 14 years’ imprisonment. The seriousness of your position lies in the 
 

knowledge, which you had from the outset of your dealings with your friend 
Imran  Khawaja,  that  he  intended  to  travel  to  Syria  in  order  to  participate  in 

terrorist  training.  You  were  therefore  aware  when  you  gave  him  the  sum  of 

15
--------
£300.00 that he intended to use it for that purpose. Furthermore, although I 
 

accept that there is no evidence that you supplied him with any further funds 
 
whilst  he  was  in  Syria,  you  did  nothing  to  discourage  him  from  remaining 

there.  Indeed  over  a  significant  period  of  time  you  gave  him  and  others  the 

 
impression  that  you  would  arrange  either  directly  or  indirectly  for  the 
provision of further funds and other items to him. 

38. You are a man of good character, having no previous convictions and hitherto 

 
have been in gainful employment. I have read much about you and take into 
account the positive assessment of your character which they portray.  

 
39. In relation to your plea of guilty it is apparent that it was not entered at the first 
reasonable  opportunity,  indeed  it  too  was  entered  at  a  time  reasonably 
 

proximate to the date of the trial. Moreover I do not consider that the delay in 

Imran Khawaja’s plea justifies your own delay. In these circumstances although 
 
you are entitled to a discount to reflect your plea of guilty, it will be limited to 

one of 25%. 

 
40. I have given consideration as to whether the risk of you committing another 
 
relevant offence is such that the court should make a financial reporting order. 

In my judgement no such order is required in this case given the sum involved. 
 

However,  although  the  sum  involved  was  limited,  I  consider  that  bearing  in 
mind the purpose for which you were aware these funds were to be provided, 

this  offence  is  so  serious  that  only  a  sentence  of  immediate  custody  can  be 
 

 

justified. In my judgement, taking account of all of the matters to which I have 
referred,  the  shortest  sentence  which  can  be  justified  is  one  of  21  months’ 
 

imprisonment. The time which you have already spent on remand in custody 
 

will be automatically credited to you and you will be released at the half way 
 
point;  thereafter  remaining  on  licence  for  the  full  term.  There  will  be  a 

surcharge  order  in  the  sum  of  £100.00  and  you  will  be  subject  to  the 
 

notification  requirements  of  part  4  of  the  Counter-Terrorism  Act  2008  for  a 

period of 10 years.

Martin Bell 


Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Peter Collier QC 


19th December 2014 


Martin Bell, I have to sentence you on your plea to the manslaughter of 

1. 
Gemma Simpson. 

 

2. 
 

3. 

That is a plea that has been properly accepted by the prosecution. 

 
The reasons for that are first that there is clear evidence that you have suffered 

for many years from a personality disorder and that on top of that in 1999 you had 

been admitted as an inpatient in hospital for a period of about 9 months under section 
2 of the Mental Health Act 1983. You had been admitted because you were suffering 

from a psychotic illness and had serious delusional beliefs. Secondly, when you were 

discharged some 6 weeks before you killed Gemma Simpson the discharging doctor 
recorded “the fact that you had little insight into your illness and that the delusions 

have not completely disappeared, are cause for some concern”. It was on the 5th May 

2000 you killed Gemma Simpson. The third factor is that the prosecution accept that 
there is no good reason to reject your account of the circumstances of the killing 

whilst accepting your account of the manner of the killing which has been 

corroborated by the evidence now discovered as a result of your admissions. For all 
those reasons and I agree with them they have concluded that there would be no 

 
proper basis for a jury to reject your account of the circumstances of the killing and  1
--------
therefore to reject the basis of your plea to manslaughter on the grounds of 

Diminished Responsibility. 
 

4. 

The killing of Gemma Simpson was brutal; your treatment of her body after 

death was dreadful; but your culpability was considerably diminished by your mental 
illness. 

 

5. 

You have described how when younger you took drugs, you got involved in 

occult practices and began to suffer what were clearly delusions. You had met and 
befriended Gemma Simpson. In your accounts given to various people since your 

arrest of how you came to kill her you tell of a conversation taking place at your flat 

and her deciding to leave. As she left, you had an argument and she asked where your 
children lived. In your paranoid state you interpreted that as a threat to your children, 

you picked up a hammer and attacked her, striking her head repeatedly. She was 

unconscious but you considered she might regain consciousness and you could see she 
was still alive. You knew you had crossed a line and must finish what you had started, 

so you then got a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her repeatedly in the back and 

the back of her head so that there would be no chance of her surviving. She was 

however clearly still alive and so you dragged her to the bath laid her face down, tied 
her hands behind her back and filled the bath with water. You left her there for several 

days and then you decided to bury her body. You cut off her legs so that you could 

transport the body away. You put her mortal remains into a sleeping bag and wrapping 
chains around it took the bag in your car to Brimham Rocks and there you buried it 

in a place where it was unlikely ever to be discovered. Over the next few years you 

went back from time to time to check that there had been no disturbance of the site. 
 

6. 

It was only after your mother had died that you were prepared to go to the 

police, which you did on 8th July 2014. There and then you confessed what you had 
done; you assisted the police to recover the remains of Gemma Simpson; you were 

charged with murder and at your first appearance at this court indicated that there 

would be no issue about the killing and that the only issue would be whether your 

responsibility for that killing was diminished in law or there was provocation. Either 
matter was to be dependent on psychiatric evidence. The prosecution and your 

 

2
--------
advisors instructed psychiatrists who have quickly agreed that this is a case of 

diminished responsibility. 
 
 

7. 

So, how do I approach the determination of the appropriate sentence? I have 

heard submissions from counsel for the prosecution and the defence. I am enormously 
grateful to them both for the assistance they have given me. 

 

8. 

As will become clear from these sentencing remarks it would appear that the 

position you are in is unique.  
 

9. 

The starting point is that you must be sentenced in accordance with the law 

that applied at the time when the offence was committed. There is no issue about that 
date, it was May 2000. That was before the coming into force of the CJA 2003. 

 

At that time sentences for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility 

10. 
had the same maximum penalty as now namely a penalty of life imprisonment. In 

many cases however the sentence was in fact a hospital order, often coupled with a 

restriction order. In this case although the doctors are agreed that at the time of the 

killing in 2000 you were suffering from a serious mental disorder, there is no 
suggestion by either doctor who has examined you that such an order would be 

necessary and therefore appropriate for you today. Dr Kent who has been instructed 

on your behalf specifically states that that is not an appropriate disposal of this case. 
 

11. 

There are no guidelines from the Sentencing Council in relation to sentences 

for this offence. 
 

12. 

I therefore in the first instance have to revert to how the court was accustomed 

to reaching decisions about sentence in these cases in 2000 and I have to follow that 
decision making pattern. 

 

13. 

Clearly the first question I have to consider given the nature of your 

underlying mental disorder and personality disorder is whether a sentence of life 
imprisonment is appropriate. 

 

 

3
--------
14. 

The Criminal Justice Act 2003 is not retrospective and so the court does not 

approach this case by looking at the issue of dangerousness within the meaning of that 
Act. 

 

It is agreed by the prosecution and defence that the seminal case for my 

15. 
consideration is Attorney General’s Reference (No. 32 of 1996) (R. v Whittaker) [1997] 1 
Cr.App.R.(S.) 261. 

 

16. 

In that case the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham said that there were 

“two conditions required before a life sentence could be imposed.  

 

 

“First, that the offender should have been convicted of a very serious offence” 
(obviously that is so here – you have pleaded guilty to an unlawful killing) 

“and, 

 

Second, that there should be good grounds for believing that the offender may 
remain a serious danger to the public for a period which cannot be reliably 

estimated at the date of sentence.” 

That second principle was well established by the time it was stated by Lord 

17. 
Bingham. He referred back to two cases 

 

18.  He referred first to Wilkinson & Others (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 105 in which 
Lord Lane CJ had said: 

 

 

“It seems to us that the sentence of life imprisonment, other than for an 

offence where the sentence is obligatory, is really appropriate and must only be 
passed in the most exceptional circumstances. With a few exceptions, of which 

this case is not one, it is reserved, broadly speaking, as Lawton L.J. pointed out, 

for offenders who for one reason or another cannot be dealt with under the 
provisions of the Mental Health Act, yet who are in a mental state which 

makes them dangerous to the life or limb of members of the public. It is 

 
sometimes impossible to say when that danger will subside, and therefore an 
indeterminate sentence is required, so that the prisoner's progress may be 

4
--------
monitored by those who have him under their supervision in prison, and so 

that he will be kept in custody only so long as public safety may be jeopardised 
by his being let loose at large.” 

 

19. 

Earlier in that case Lord Lane CJ had quoted what Lawton LJ said in Pither 
 

(1979) 1 Cr App R (S) 209 at 213, when Lawton LJ said 

 

 

“… this court has laid it down as a matter of principle that life sentences for 
offences other than homicide should not be imposed unless there are 

exceptional circumstances in the case. One of the most usual types of 

exceptional circumstances is that there is a marked degree of mental instability, 

which may or may not amount to a mental disorder within the Mental Health 
Act 1959. There is no evidence in this case of a marked degree of mental 

instability.” 

20.  Of course none of those cases to which I have just referred were cases of 
homicide and there was no suggestion of mental instability in any of those cases. 

 
21. 

The matter for me to decide in applying those principles is whether in this case 

where you have been affected by a mental disorder to such an extent that you have 

killed, you pose a danger to the “life or limb of members of the public” in the future. 

 
22.  Mr Greaney QC argues that firstly prior to killing Gemma Simpson although 

you had for some years been affected by delusional beliefs you had not harmed anyone 

and secondly that since the killing of Gemma Simpson you have not only not killed 
again, but with one minor exception you have committed no further offences of 

violence. 

 
23. 

Both those propositions are true and I must weigh those facts. I must also 

however weigh in the balance the judgment of Dr Kent an extremely experienced 

forensic psychiatrist and one for whom this court has the highest regard. 
 

24. 

In his report he deals with the issues of your illness and your personality 

disorder. He says: 

 

5
--------
“12.1  Mr Bell has a psychotic mental illness. The course of his illness has been 
fluctuated with relapse and remission, and for large parts of his life he has been 

able  to  lead  an  independent  life  managing  to  greater  or  lesser  degree  all  the 
 

opportunities available to him without the need for treatment. The more florid 
manifestations of his illness has been precipitated or worsened most probably by 

drug misuse. As he has an inherent illness he is also vulnerable to spontaneous 

relapse as well as deterioration in the face of stressful life events.  

 

12.2  He  has  a  highly  unusual  personality  structure  amounting  to  a 
personality disorder. He has antisocial traits, as well as schizotypal abnormalities 

which mark him out as somewhat of a loner and eccentric. 

12.3  His mental illness is not currently active and for this he does not require 
treatment in hospital, however the situation may change in the future. He will 

require monitoring by prison mental health services and in the event of relapse 

there are mechanisms to transfer to secure hospital care via section 47 Mental 
Health Act. His personality disorder is lifelong and probably not amenable to 

treatment nor does it require in patient management.” 

25.  His judgment is set out in the final paragraph of his report: 

 
“12.4  Risks.  This  is  difficult  to  judge.  He  has  committed  a  homicide  in 
 

unusual circumstances but over a decade ago without evidence of reoffending. 
 

However  given  that  in  my  view  mental  illness  and  personality  disorder  were 
significant  factors  he  must  still  be  regarded  as  presenting  substantial  risk  of 

serious  harm  to  the  public.  This  relates  to  the  view  that  he  has  a  lifelong 

personality  disorder  and  he  has  a  relapsing  mental  illness  which  has  been  an 
important contributory factor in this offence. In addition his illness has had as 

one characteristic homicidal ideas.” 

 
26. 

In my judgment adding to Dr Kent’s clinical assessment, the evidence that I 

have which indicates that, although you have not been prosecuted for any offences of 

violence, your relationship with your partner of recent years was controlling and was 

one in which you to some extent acted out your disorders. 

 

6
--------
Taking all these matters together and weighing them against the matters Mr 

27. 
Greaney QC urges to the contrary, I am satisfied that in this case of homicide there are 

exceptional circumstances which are that you have a history of mental disorder namely 

a psychotic illness which has had as one of its characteristics homicidal ideas and which 
is not predictable as to its future outworking. 

 

28. 

Further I am satisfied, to use the more modern language, which in fact poses a 

higher test than that used in 1997, that you pose a significant risk of serious harm to 
members of the public and that therefore for this very serious offence there is no 

alternative for me but to pass a sentence of life imprisonment. 

 
29. 

That of course is only the first of the decisions I have to reach about sentence. I 

now have to move to decide what is the minimum term you must serve before you 

will be entitled to be considered for release on life licence for the rest of your life. This 
is a much more difficult exercise. 

 

30. 

I would also add at this point that not only is there no guarantee that you will 

be released at that point which I am about to determine, but there is an assurance that 
you will not be released then or at any point unless and until the Parole Board is 

satisfied that you no longer pose such a risk to the public. 

 
31. 

I have heard submissions from the prosecution and the defence as to how I 

should approach that issue of determining the minimum term. They are diametrically 

opposed in relation to the fundamental question which is whether I am required to 
arrive at precisely the same figure I would have arrived at if passing this sentence in the 

year 2000 or whether that term should be significantly higher because I should take 

into account developments in the law in relation to sentences for manslaughter since 
2003. Mr Greaney QC says I must follow the ‘2000 and no more’ approach; Mr 

Myerson QC says I should apply the post 2003 regime and in particular I should have 

regard to the cases of R v Appleby and Others [2009] EWCA Crim 2693 for sentence in 

cases of manslaughter generally and R v Clive Wood [2009] EWCA Crim 651 for cases 
of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. 
 

 

7
--------
32.  Mr Greaney QC developed his argument as follows – Art 7.1 of the ECHR – 

provides that a penalty “should not be heavier than the one applicable at the time the 
 
offence was committed”. 

 

That , he says, is recognised in cases of murder not only by not applying 

33. 
Schedule 21 of the 2003 Act but by applying the tariffs that would have been applied 

prior to that and in accordance with the letter from the LCJ Lord Bingham in 1997. 

That principle was established in the case of Sullivan [2004] EWCA Crim 1762 and has 
been applied consistently since then in relation to cases of murder that predate the 
coming onto operation of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 

 

 

34.  Mr Greaney QC argues that that must apply also to discretionary sentences of 

life imprisonment as otherwise a situation could arise where someone might receive a 
lesser minimum sentence if he admitted murder than if he admitted manslaughter. He 

says that cannot be a right result. 

 
35.  On the other hand he accepts, following the case of Masefield [2013] 1 
Cr.App.R.(S.) 77, that if a determinate sentence is imposed then the court is required 

to have regard to the increased severity of sentences now compared with 14 years ago 

and to impose a determinate sentence in accordance with current practice. 
  

36.  He accepts that these two approaches are difficult to reconcile. 

 
37.  On the other hand Mr Myerson QC argues that as there is no clear authority 

to the effect that the Sullivan principle applies to manslaughter, he says it would be 
wrong to extend it to do so. 

 
38.  He says that the rationale of Sullivan is based fairly and squarely on the specific 
starting points which although not statutory, had legal force and were to be followed. 

He says that the determination of minimum tariffs in cases of murder went through a 

series of incremental increases beginning with the letter from Lord Bingham dated 19th 
 
February 1997, the Practice Direction issued by Lord Wolff CJ on 27th July 2000, the 

Practice Statement handed down by Lord Wolff CJ on 31st May 2002, Schedule 21 of 

 
the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Practice Direction on the transitional provisions 8
--------
dated 18th May 2004. He says that each of these directions dealt with specific starting 

points for murders with differing degrees of seriousness.  
 

39. 

In those circumstances Mr Myerson QC argues that Art 7.1 clearly bites as an 

offence which is classified as having a particular level of seriousness would be more 
severely dealt with in 2005 than in 1997; so if the offence was committed in 1997 but 

sentence was passed in 2005 it would be contrary to Art 7.1 to impose a sentence 

based on the higher starting point. 

 
40. 

The position in murder however he says is to be contrasted with manslaughter 

where there are no classifications of offences into different levels of seriousness, but the 

sentencer approaches the case like any other offence judging the seriousness by an 
assessment of the harm caused by the offence and the culpability of the offender and 

passes a sentence appropriate to that degree of seriousness. That is the approach 

adopted in sexual cases, as was decided in R. v H [2011] EWCA Crim 2753. He points 
out that that that is now codified in the Sentencing Council’s guidelines for sexual 
offences, and although it will lead to higher sentences than would have been passed 10 

 

or 20 years ago, it has been decided that that is not contrary to Art 7.1 

 
41.  He accepts that that may lead to a more severe sentence for manslaughter than 

for murder, but says that that is simply a consequence of different approaches required 

 

by the law for the different offences. 
 

 
42. 

In 2000 there were different approaches adopted in relation to mandatory and 

discretionary life sentences. The earlier history of those differences and the their 

development is of course rehearsed by Lord Mustill in R v Secretary of State for the Home 

Department ex parte Doody (1994) 1 AC 531. There were then further developments in 
the different regimes between 1993 and 2003 when the Criminal Justice Act 2003 

“judicialised” the setting of the tariff period for mandatory life sentences. By 2000 the 

setting of that tariff in a discretionary life case was already firmly in the hands of the 

judge who passed sentence. However, the release of an offender convicted of murder 
and subject to a mandatory life sentence was dealt with differently. It was not until 

2002, following R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex part Anderson (2003) 1 
AC 837 that the ultimate decision making about the tariff in a mandatory life case 

 

9
--------
moved from the Home Secretary to the sentencing judge. Prior to that there had been 
 

a very different view about what was taking place in the fixing of the tariff period. 
There was then no relationship, as there is now, between the tariff that might have 

been fixed if the partial defence of diminished responsibility did not apply and the case 

had been a murder, and the tariff to be fixed by making a reduction on that figure 
according to the degree of diminishment allowed for in a case of diminished 

responsibility manslaughter. The discretionary life tariff was assessed by the judge in 

relation to other similar cases. It bore no direct relationship to the murder tariff, if it 

can rightly be called a tariff, and it did not have any fixed starting points. 
 

43. 

It is against that historical background, which shows that there were two quite 

different approaches to tariff setting, that I have concluded that the principles which 
led to the decision in Sullivan do not apply in discretionary life cases and that I must 

follow the reasoning expressed in R v H. 
 

44. 

I must therefore have regard to the harm caused by your actions and to your 

culpability and I must have regard to the fact that Parliament has in recent years 
determined that sentences for offences where a death has resulted should be treated 

more seriously and punished more severely than before.  

 
45. 

The harm was the greatest possible – the loss of a human life. The impact of 

that harm on the family of the victim is very high as for 14 years they endured the 

agony of not knowing what had happened to Gemma. Throughout that time they 
have retained a glimmer of hope that she was alive but it was a false hope kept alive by 

your silence over those 14 years. I have read the Victim Personal Statements provided 

by her father and her sister which describe the 14 years agony of unknowing. Her 

father even puts it in days – “4980 days of pain, worrying and fear for Gemma and her 
wellbeing. It isn’t  something that a person thinks about once or twice a day, it 

 

becomes an integral part of their whole life, it is a constant shadow and a chill in the 

heart that never leaves and is with them from waking in the morning to closing the 
eyes at night”.  Her sister speaks about the effect on her mother. She describes how 

her mother couldn’t cope with not knowing what had happened, but adds “Now 

knowing is a lot worse”. 
 

 

10
--------
46. 

Further you not only killed her but you dismembered her body and you buried 

it where it would never have been discovered apart from your recent confession. Your 
decisions about what you did with her body and your continuing resolve not to reveal 

what you had done were deliberate acts which are also aggravating features for which 

you must bear some responsibility. 
 

47. 

Your culpability is however obviously lessened by reason of the court’s 

acceptance that your responsibility was diminished at the time both of the killing itself 

and also in the aftermath when you disposed of her body. In regard to that latter 
matter, there is evidence that you clearly believed there was a possibility that she might 

come back from the dead. 

 
48. 

That diminution of responsibility goes to the act of killing and has avoided a 

conviction for murder. I am satisfied that it continued for some time. However there 

came a stage at some point, and I am satisfied that it has been the case for a significant 
part of the 14 years that have passed since the killing, when you were not so affected 

but during which time you have consciously, deliberately and knowing that you were 

continuing to cause harm to her family, held back from disclosing what you had done 

and where Gemma Simpson’s remains could be found. 
 

49. 

I have to consider what mitigating factors there are. Your mental condition has 

reduced the offence to manslaughter and I should not double count that factor. 
Although you have some convictions and have previously served a prison sentence I 

accept that you had no previous convictions for violence at the time of this killing. 

Your assistance to the police has to be counterbalanced with the years of silence to 
which I have already referred, and any remorse has come very late in the day. 

However I do take those matters into account when arriving at my starting point. 

 
50. 

I have in mind that the expressed minimum term in 2000 would have been 

arrived at in a different way from the way it is done today. That way is stated in the 

Practice Direction (Crime Life Sentences) [1993] 1 WLR 223 and it would then have 

been necessary to decide on the notional determinate sentence and then to specify a 
period of between ½ and 2/3 which should be made plain. However my objective is 

 
today to fix a minimum term consistent with the approach to seriousness and severity 11
--------
that is applied today. Today if this had been a murder then the minimum term would 

have been in the upper 20s; that must be reduced because of your mental disorder to 
the mid teens but is raised again by your callous silence to a starting point of 18 years 

(equivalent today to a starting point of 27 years to serve in 2000). 

 
51. 

I then have to determine the credit you should be given to reflect not only 

your guilty plea but the fact that after 14 years silence you eventually decided to 

confess what you had done. Furthermore you assisted the police by directing them to 

the site where you had buried the body parts of Gemma Simpson. 
 

52. 
It is the habitual practice of this court to allow the maximum credit for such 
guilty pleas and assistance. The cases of Oakley [2010] EWCA Crim 2419 and Imtiaz 

Ahmed [2012] EWCA Crim 708 make it clear that the court is not limited to a 1/6 
maximum discount for a guilty plea but that full credit up to 1/3 where appropriate 

may be allowed. Again this in my judgment reflects the longstanding differences in 

approach between mandatory and discretionary life sentences. It is also a significantly 
higher figure than I consider you would have been likely to receive in any such 

calculation in 2000. 

 

53. 

That reduces the minimum term to 12 years. 

 

I also have to allow for the time you have spent on remand and deduct that 

54. 
from the total; that is agreed at 160 days. 

 

In the result the period you must serve before you will be able to be 

55. 
considered for release on licence is 11 years 205 days. 

 

56. 

The statutory surcharge does not apply in this case.

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Alistair McCreath 

 

Southwark Crown Court 

 

27th February 2015 

Approach 

The  offences  for  which  I  must  pass  sentence  today  took  place  many 
years  ago  at  a  time  when,  in  particular  in  respect  of  one  of  them,  the 
maximum  sentence  was  considerably  lower  than  that  which  is  now 
available  and  at  a  time  when  the  sentencing  climate  was  less  severe 
than it now is. 

There is clear guidance as to how I should approach this task, set out in 
Annex B to the Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline. 

I set them out, to the extent that they are relevant to your case. 

I  must  sentence  you  in  accordance  with  the  sentencing  regime 
applicable today, not at the date of the offence. But I am limited to the 
maximum sentence available at the time of the offence. 

I must assess the seriousness of the  offence and must be guided as to 
that  by  the  current  guideline  which  offers  assistance  to  me  in  the 
assessment of harm and culpability, as well as giving broad ranges into 
which sentences should appropriately fall. 

I  must  consider  the  relevance  of  the  passage  of  time  carefully  and 
decide  whether  that  is  an  aggravating,  mitigating  or  neutral  factor. 
There may be cases where a lack of offending in the meantime, coupled 
with evidence of positive good character, might offer some mitigation.  
Yours  is  not  such  a  case.  You  have  in  fact  committed  offences  since 
those  before  me  today  –  your  convictions  of  1998  for  downloading 
indecent  images  of  children.  Further  I  can  find  no  real  evidence  that 
you have done anything in the intervening 40 or so years to atone for 
these  crimes.  I  shall  say  a  little  more  about  this  later.  I  do,  however, 
accept that this is not a case where the sentence falls to be increased by 
reason  of  the  passage  of  time,  as  might  be  appropriate  where,  for 

 

 

1.

1.2 

1.3 

1.4 

1.5 

1.6
--------
example, an offender has put his victim in fear of the consequences of 
reporting what happened to her. 

 

 

2. 

Applying the Guideline 

2.1  Where  it  is  necessary  to  do  so,  I  must  consider  how  the  offences  you 
committed  would  be  characterised  under  modern  legislation  and 
modern guidelines. 

2.2  As to Count 1, given that the victim was 8 years old and you were in a 
position of trust towards her, the appropriate starting point under the 
current guidelines      would have been 13 years for a full offence of rape 
but  somewhat  less  given  that  this  was  an  attempt  at  rape.  There  are 
aspects of this offence (and all the other offences you committed) which 
make them particularly serious, justifying an increase from the starting 
point in each case. The maximum sentence available to me on Count 1, 
however,  is  one  of  7  years  imprisonment;  that  was  the  decision  of 
Parliament in 1956 when the relevant legislation was passed. 

2.3 

2.4 

2.5 

 

3. 

3.1 

 

 

As  to  Counts  3  and  4,  involving  digital  penetration  of  the  victim’s 
vagina and an act of oral sex upon her, the modern offence would have 
been  assault  of  a  child  under  13  by  penetration.  This  also  involved  a 
breach  of  trust.  Under  the  modern  guideline,  the  appropriate  starting 
point  would  have  been  6  years,  against  a  modern  maximum  of  life 
imprisonment.  The  maximum  sentence,  however,  for  this  offence  in 
1977 and therefore the maximum sentence available to me today is one 
of 5 years imprisonment. 

Count 6 is in a different category. This involved full sexual intercourse 
with a girl of 12. Under the modern law, this would have amounted to 
an  offence  of  rape  of  a  child  under  13.    Given  the  breach  of  trust 
involved  in  this  offence  and  the  fact  that  the  incident  lasted  for  an 
entire  night,  the  starting  point  would  have  been  13  years.  The 
maximum  sentence  for  the  historic  and  modern  offences  is  the  same, 
life  imprisonment.  The  prosecution  and  the  defence  are  both  agreed 
that the sentencing principles which apply in this case do not permit me 
to pass a life sentence. 

Counts  9  and  10,  charged  as  indecent  assaults,  have  as  their  modern 
equivalent the offences of sexual activity with a child. Here again there 
was  breach  of  trust  as  well  as  a  significant  disparity  in  age.  The 
maximum sentence available to me for this conduct is 2 years. This is a 
sufficient penalty, even under the modern guidelines. 

The harm caused by these offences  

The assessment of the harm caused by sexual offending is not easy in 
the  immediate,  or  near  immediate,  aftermath  of  it.  But  where  the 
offending took place many years ago, it is a great deal easier.
--------
3.2 

 

4. 

4.1 

4.2 

 

 

 
 

I have read the impact statements of all three victims. It is clear that in 
their different ways they were all profoundly affected by your abuse of 
them. You did all of them real and lasting damage. And you did so for 
no  other  reason  than  to  obtain  sexual  gratification  for  yourself  of  a 
wholly improper kind 

Totality 

Since  these  offences  were  committed  against  different  victims  on 
different  occasions,  there  can  be  no  doubt  but  the  sentences  for  each 
group of offences should be consecutive. 

I  recognise,  however,  that  I  must  take  care  to  ensure  that  the  overall 
sentence you must serve is just and proportionate. 

4.3  Accordingly,  as  I  hope  will  be  understood  by  those  who  were  your 
victims  and  by  the  wider  public  it  is  not  the  individual  sentences  that 
ultimately matter. What matters is the total overall sentence, designed 
to reflect the totality of all of your offending.

5.1 

 

6. 

6.1 

 

7. 

7.1 

 

 

Count 1 

This  was  on  any  view  a  truly  appalling  offence.  An  8  year  old  child,  a 
friend of your daughter, was an overnight guest in your home. You went 
to  the  room  in  which  these  two  little  girls  were  sleeping  together  in  a 
double  bed  and  you  made  a  determined,  although  ultimately 
unsuccessful, attempt to rape her. You did so in the presence, sight and 
hearing of your own daughter. You caused that child deep harm which 
has  persisted  throughout  her  life.  It  is  difficult  to  overstate  the 
depravity of this dreadful behaviour. 

Counts 3, 4 and 6 

The 12 year old victim came with her mother to one of your concerts. 
You  invited  them  both  to  your  hotel  and  created  a  situation  in  which 
her  mother  was  taken  out  of  your  suite  of  rooms  to  another  place, 
leaving you with this sexually inexperienced child. All of this happened 
because and only because of your fame. You kept her in your room all 
night. You penetrated her vagina with your finger and performed oral 
sex  on  her.  You  had  full  sexual  intercourse  with  her.  She  was  12.  You 
were in your 30’s.  She also has been greatly damaged by this. You gave 
no thought to the harm you were doing her. Your only thought was for 
yourself. 

 Counts 9 and 10 

The 13 year old victim of these offences visited your dressing room after 
a performance. She was left alone with you for a few minutes. You put
--------

8.1 

8.2 

8.3

her  on  your  lap,  you  kissed  her  in  a  manner  that  was  sexual  and 
touched  her  vagina,  albeit  over  her  clothing.    She  was  an  extremely 
vulnerable  child  for  reasons  of  which  I  accept  you  knew  nothing.  But 
I’m  quite  sure  that  even  if  you  had  known  it  would  have  made  no 
difference  to  you.  Whether  you  knew  of  her  vulnerability  or  not,  your 
abuse of her caused her particular harm. 

The mitigation 

It is urged on me that I should recognise and give credit for the fact that 
when  you  committed  the  present  offences,  you  were  then  of  good 
character. Whilst I recognise the fact, it cannot in the circumstances of 
this case carry any or any significant weight. 

I acknowledge that you are no longer young – you are soon to reach the 
age of 71. As your counsel recognises, this cuts both ways. You have had 
the benefit of living for nearly 40 years unconvicted of these offences. It 
cannot carry any weight. 

I note that in 2011 you sought out professional help to understand your 
sexual attitudes and behaviour. After two or three months of treatment, 
you  were  re-assessed  and  found  to  have  benefitted  from  it  and  to 
present a lower risk. 

Thereafter, you were permitted to travel abroad. You were now able to 
present yourself as having what is described as a “treated profile”. 

I am in no position to decide what your true motivation was in seeking 
this treatment, whether it was to come to terms with your past and to 
change  your  attitudes  and  behaviour  or  it  was  to  persuade  the 
authorities to allow you to travel abroad. 

8.6  But one thing is certain and important in the context of this sentencing 
exercise.  Whatever  changes  may  have  been  effected  in  you  by  this 
treatment, they did not include any admission at all on your part of the 
wrong that you had done, in particular of the offences of which you now 
stand convicted. 

8.7 

That  is  why  I  said  earlier  in  these  remarks  that  I  find  no  evidence  of 
atonement on your part. 

8.8  As to the other matters of mitigation advanced on your behalf, I have 

given them such weight as I can.

The sentences 

The offence of attempted rape was so serious as to justify under the old 
sentencing  regime  the  maximum  available  sentence.  It  hardly  needs 
stating  that  under  the  modern  regime,  7  years  would  be  a  lenient
--------
sentence. But it is all that is available to me. That is the sentence which 
I pass on Count 1. 

9.2  On Counts 3 and 4, the sentences are 4 years imprisonment. On Count 
6 the sentence is one of 8 years imprisonment. In passing that sentence, 
I  have  kept  in  mind  the  principle  of  totality.  These  sentences  will  run 
concurrently  with  each  other  but  consecutively  to  the  sentence  on 
Count 1. 

9.3  On Counts 9 and 10, the sentences are 12 months concurrently on each 

count but consecutive to the other sentences. 

The total sentence is, therefore, one of 16 years imprisonment.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Sweeney 

 

12 December 2014 

 

Colin Ash-Smith you are now aged 46. You have been convicted of the brutal murder 
of Claire Tiltman which you carried out in a dark alleyway just off the main London 
Road in Greenhithe in Kent in the early evening of 18 January 1993.  You stabbed 
her 9 times with a large knife, and she died from her injuries at the scene.  In the 
meanwhile you made good your escape back to the house in nearby Swanscombe 
where you were then living with your parents.  You were aged 24 at the time.  Claire, 
who you knew via the local British Legion Club, was the only and much loved child 
of Cliff and Linda Tiltman.  You murdered her just 4 days after her 16th birthday.  She 
had an engaging and lively personality, and was extremely popular – with a wide circle 
of loyal friends. 
 
I have no doubt that this was a premeditated murder that you carried out because of 
the feeling of power that it gave you.  In so doing you not only ended Claire’s young 
life, which was so full of promise, but you also caused unbearable grief and upset to 
her family and friends. 
 
Claire’s murder was not the only attack on a lone female that you carried in the small 
area of Greenhithe and Swanscombe.  In the period between 1988 and 1995, 
throughout the vast majority of which you lived in that area, you planned a number of 
other such attacks and carried out two in particular. 
 
In the early hours of 21 December 1988 (and so just over 4 years before Claire’s 
murder, and when you were aged 20) you kidnapped a 27 year old woman at gun and 
knife point from outside her home in Swanscombe.  You then forced her to walk to a 
quarry, where you attempted to rape her in various positions, and then attempted to 
murder her – first by strangling her and then by stabbing her in the back five times.  
You left her for dead and went home.  Fortunately she survived.  You were not 
caught at that stage.  The offences against this victim were later recorded by you, for 
your own private pleasure, in a document and in a diary.  In the document you 
described the attack upon her as “my masterpiece” and your plan to carry it out as 
having been “95% successful”.  In that same document you also wrote about 3 other
--------
assault plans that you had made and endeavoured, but failed, to carry out to 
completion in 1988. 
 

In the early evening of 17 October 1995 (and so 2 years after you murdered Claire, 
and by which time you were aged 27) you attacked a 21 year old woman called 
Charlotte Barnard as she was walking in the street in Greenhithe.  You carried out the 
attack only some 360 metres from the scene of your murder of Claire and, as with 
Claire, because of the feeling of power that it gave you.  You stabbed her eight times 
in the back and once to the right flank.  She also sustained 5 wounds to the right hand, 
which she had used to try to defend herself.  Leaving her for dead, you made good 
your escape in your car (which you had parked not far away) and went home to your 
then girlfriend. 

Fortunately, Charlotte Barnard survived and both you and your car had been seen in 
the vicinity by witnesses who reported their sightings to the police.  You were arrested 
that night.  The knife that you had used to attack Charlotte Barnard was found, and 
her blood was found on your jacket.  The document and diary recording your 
activities in 1988 were also found. 

In interview, you eventually admitted both the 1988 attack and the attack on 
Charlotte Barnard.  You also told a significant number of lies, including repeatedly 
asserting that you were not guilty of Claire’s murder. 

In the result, the decision was taken not to charge you with Claire’s murder. 

In 1996 you pleaded guilty at the Maidstone Crown Court to kidnap, attempted rape, 
and attempted murder in relation to the attack in 1988, and to causing grievous bodily 
harm with intent in relation to the attack on Charlotte.  In the result you were 
sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years – which you are still 
serving now, 19 years after your arrest. 

In the meanwhile, the efforts of Claire’s family and friends kept her murder in the 
public conscience, and thanks to the recent full re-activation of the enquiry into it by 
the Kent Police, further evidence came to light in consequence of which you have 
finally been brought to justice. 

There is only one sentence that I can pass upon you, namely life imprisonment.  
However, I must also impose a minimum term before you can even be considered for 
parole. 

Your offence was committed before the coming into force of the Criminal Justice Act 
2003 – hence I am required to approach sentencing in your case in two stages.  First, I 
must determine, in accordance with Schedule 21 to the Act, the minimum term you 
should serve.  Then, in accordance with Schedule 22 to the Act, I must ensure that I 
do not specify a minimum term which, in my opinion, is greater than that which you 
would have been directed to serve under the practice followed by the Secretary of 
State before 2002 and at the time at which this offence was committed. 

As to the facts – this was a premeditated murder, your intention was to kill, you took a 
knife to the scene for the purpose, and Claire was vulnerable by reason of her 
circumstances.  Your other convictions are a clear aggravating feature, but one that
--------
must be treated with care given that you have already served some 19 years in relation 
to them.  It is accepted that there are no mitigating features as such. 

As to the first stage it seems to me that, by the operation of paragraph 5A of Schedule 
21, the correct starting point for the minimum term is one of 25 years, and that when 
the further aggravating features are added in (with appropriate care taken not to double 
count) the minimum term is one of 30 years. 

As to the second stage I have considered the Criminal Practice Direction (Sentencing) 
N [2013] 1 W.L.R. 3164 and read the case of R v Sullivan & others [2004] EWCA 
Crim 1762. 

In my view, given that Claire was vulnerable by reason of her circumstances, and that 
multiple injuries were inflicted, the higher starting point of 15/16 years would have 
applied.  In addition to that there was planning, and you armed yourself with a knife in 
advance.  There is also the aggravating feature of your other convictions. 

That said, and whilst you only have yourself to blame for not admitting Claire’s 
murder in the mid 1990s, it seems to me that I must also have an eye to the total 
minimum term that would have been imposed had you been convicted of this offence 
and sentenced for it, along with the other offences, in 1996.  In that regard I agree 
with your counsel that the minimum term would not have exceeded 40 years.  In my 
opinion the appropriate minimum term by the operation of Schedule 22 is one of 21 
years. 

Colin Ash-Smith the sentence that I pass upon you is one of life imprisonment, with a 
minimum term of 21 years.",2014-12-12 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Sir Brian Leveson P: 

R v George 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

On 29th April 2002, in the Crown Court at Preston, before Penry-Davey J and a jury, 
this appellant (then aged 18, having been born on 23rd August 1983) was convicted of 
murder, attempted murder and possession of a firearm.  For murder, he was sentenced 
to be detained pending the determination of Her Majesty’s pleasure with the specified 
 
minimum term of 12 years, less time spent on remand.  Concurrent terms of 10 years 
and  7  years  detention  were  imposed  for  the  other  offences.    On  25th  May  2004,  a 
 
renewed  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  conviction  was  refused  by  the  full 
court (Clarke LJ, Jack J and Judge Fabian Evans): see [2004] EWCA Crim 1471.  The 
appellant has since been released on licence. 

In  February  2005,  an  application  was  made  to  the  Criminal  Cases  Review 
Commission  (“CCRC”)  who,  by  decision  dated  29th  January  2007,  determined  that 
there was no basis on which the conviction could be referred to the Court of Appeal. 
 
At  some  stage,  the  Innocence  Project  and  Pro  Bono  Unit  attached  to  Cardiff  Law 
School became involved in pursuing the matter on the appellant’s behalf and, in the 
light of new scientific evidence as to the significance of particles said to be gunshot 
residue  which  is  reflected  in  R  v  George  (Barry)  [2007]  EWCA  Crim  2722,  and  a 
recent  decision  in  relation  to  voice  recognition  evidence,  R  v  Flynn  and  St  John 
[2008] EWCA Crim 970, a further application to the CCRC was submitted.   

Having  obtained  its  own  scientific  evidence,  on  8th  November  2013,  the  CCRC 
referred  these  convictions  to  this  court  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  s.  9  of  the 
 
Criminal Appeal Act 1995 on the grounds that there is a real possibility of the court 
overturning the convictions, on the basis that the evidence of gunshot residue does not 
 
now  attract  the  value  attributed  to  it  at  trial,  and  therefore  does  not  support  the 
identification evidence.  The appellant seeks leave to pursue further grounds of appeal 
 
relating  to  the  admissibility  of  the  voice  identification  evidence  and  the  directions 
 
surrounding that evidence which followed. 

The Facts 

On  the  evening  of  25th  July  2001  at  Miles  Platting,  Manchester,  Daniel  Dale  was 
fatally injured and Darren Thomas was wounded in the hand by shots fired from the 
same gun.   

The  appellant  was  originally  arraigned  with  three  others:  Ryan  Brown,  his  brother 
Nathan Loftus, and Arron Cunningham. Before the trial, Cunningham pleaded guilty 
to possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition without 
a certificate, and assisting offenders. He went on to give evidence for the prosecution. 
  
Loftus changed his plea of not guilty to guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to 
 
endanger life. He was sentenced to 5 years in a young offender institution. 

Brown, whose defence was alibi, was acquitted of murder and attempted murder but 
convicted of wounding with intent (later quashed as inconsistent with the acquittals) 
and  possession  of  a  firearm  with  intent  (for  which  he  was  sentenced  to  8  years’ 
detention, reduced to 7 years on appeal). 

In short, the prosecution alleged that the appellant and Ryan Brown were responsible 
for the shooting, using a Walther PPK self-loading pistol which was recovered from

the house of Cunningham.  Cunningham said that he was minding the gun for Loftus, 
who  had  telephoned  to  say  that  the  appellant  would  collect  the  gun.  He  described 
how a car arrived with the appellant driving. Brown got out of the car and collected 
 
the gun from him at the door of his house.  The offence of possession of the firearm 
with intent to endanger life to which Loftus pleaded guilty was admitted pursuant to s. 
74 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The defence of the appellant was 
one of alibi. 

The Prosecution Case 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

 
10.	 

 
11.	 

 
12.	 

The evidence against the appellant at trial (which was entirely circumstantial) can be 
 
described as being based on four limbs or pillars, namely the factual background to 
 
the  relationships  between  the  various  participants  leading  up  to  the  shooting;  the 
evidence  of  Cunningham;  the  evidence  of  voice  identification;  and  the  presence  of 
gunshot residue on a coat found at the appellant’s home.  The appeal relates strictly to 
the last two limbs but it is necessary to provide the context. 

The background to the shooting was placed before the jury principally by way of a 
 
number  of  formal  admissions  by  all  three  defendants;  in  addition,  there  was  both 
CCTV  and  witness  evidence  all  leading  to  the  inference  that  the  shooting  was  the 
outcome of gang rivalry.  

In January 2001, Paul Ward was murdered. Between 23rd  and 25th  July 2001, a youth 
named  Sheldon  Keatings  was  tried  at  Manchester  Crown  Court  in  connection  with 
that murder. Keatings was subsequently acquitted. It was admitted that the appellant 
was  present  at  court  on  the  24th  and  25th  July  and  that  on  24th  July,  Keatings  was 
punched in the face by Leon Critchley, a friend of Ward.  

 

At about 4.30 pm on 25th July, the appellant, Keatings and others left the court and 
 
travelled  in  two  cars,  a  red  Mazda  and  a  silver  Honda  Prelude,  to  the  Powerhouse 
Gym in Collyhurst. It was also admitted that the appellant, Keatings and others left 
the gym in the same cars and followed Critchley, who was riding a moped, to the New 
Allen  Street  area.  The  occupants  of  the  cars  were  there  threatened  by  a  group  of 
youths  armed  with  various  weapons.  Critchley  broke  the  driver’s  window  of  the 
Mazda with his crash helmet.  Thereafter, both cars then left the New Allen Street 
area and were driven to Ruskington Drive, Harpurhey. The prosecution case was that 
the appellant and Brown then acted together with others as part of a joint enterprise in 
the shootings of Dale and Thomas.  

Turning  to  the  evidence  that  Cunningham  gave,  two  aspects  of  what  he  said  were 
capable of linking the appellant to the shooting: these were his report of two telephone 
calls and his visual identification of the appellant.  As to the first, it was admitted that 
at 7.26 pm and 7.27 pm on 25th July, two telephone calls were made to Cunningham’s 
 
mobile telephone. In evidence, Cunningham said that both calls were from Loftus. In 
the first call, Loftus said that he was coming to get the “thing,” by which he meant the 
gun that Cunningham was keeping for him. In the second call, Loftus said that he was 
not coming, but the appellant was: the conversation (including the identification by 
name of the appellant) was held to be admissible. 

 
13. 

In that context, the admission of the fact that Loftus had pleaded guilty was said to be 
relevant to this element of Cunningham’s evidence.  The prosecution submitted that
--------

R v George 

 
this was a necessary link in the evidential chain, which may be treated by the jury as 
confirming Cunningham’s evidence as to the involvement of Loftus. The appellant’s 
counsel submitted that it was irrelevant, or alternatively of only marginal relevance 
and  should  be  excluded  under  s.78  of  the  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Act  1984. 
Penry-Davey J allowed the prosecution to adduce the guilty plea. He ruled that it was 
relevant  to  Cunningham’s  account,  which  was  very  much  in  issue,  and  that  no 
 
unfairness was caused by its admission. 

Turning to Cunningham’s visual identification of the appellant, he said that 15 or 20 
minutes  after  the  second  telephone  call,  a  red  car  drew  up  outside  his  house. 
Cunningham  said  that  the  appellant  was  driving  the  car.  In  cross-examination,  he 
accepted that he had a momentary glimpse of the driver and could not be sure that it 
was the appellant. It had been a black man who resembled him. In re-examination, he 
said that he had presumed that it was the appellant who was driving the car.  

Brown came to the door and Cunningham handed the gun to him, wrapped in a plastic 
bag. Cunningham was certain about this identification. He had known Brown for a 
long  time  and  saw  him  face-to-face.  He  later  identified  Brown  at  an  identification 
parade. Brown got back into the front passenger seat of the car. As the car was driven 
away, Cunningham noticed two other black males sitting in the back of the car, but 
was unable to identify them. 

Turning  to  the  voice  recognition,  Stuart  Shaw  was  among  those  called  by  the 
prosecution as eyewitnesses to the shooting incident. He said that on 25th July he went 
towards New Allen Street.  A burgundy Honda Civic car came down Osbourne Street.  
The car turned towards its side and two people in black got out from the passenger 
 
side at the front and the rear. Their faces were covered and they wore black gloves. 
They ran towards the group and raised their hands.  Everybody ran.  He heard one 
shot  as  he  got  to  Keel  Close.  On  Farnborough  Road,  he  noticed  the  Honda  Civic 
 
coming around the corner.  He froze.  It sped towards them and he shouted “Run.” He 
ran through the alleyway.  He heard somebody shout loudly “You’re dead now.” He 
said  that  it  was  the  appellant’s  voice.    He  saw  an  arm  raised  and  heard  a  gunshot, 
followed  by  Thomas  shouting  “Oh  my  hand”.  He  carried  on  running  towards 
Nuneaton Drive and his aunt’s garden where he hid in the porch. He saw an arm and a 
gun,  and  then  heard  another  gunshot.  The  gunman  was  roughly  the  height  of  the 
fence.  He saw the shot hit Dale, who put his hand to his back. 

 

 
In  cross-examination,  Shaw  agreed  that  he  and  the  appellant  had  both  been  at  the 
same school together in May-June 1998. The appellant was not his friend. He had not 
mixed with the appellant since they left school and had never spoken to him.  He had 
 
seen him about twice in four years but had not spoken to him on those occasions.  He 
had once heard him talking outside a shop. He could not remember when that was and 
did not know what they were talking about.  He told the police soon after the incident 
 
of what he then described as a coloured person’s voice, because he told the officer he 
was not sure about it. He could not be sure that it was the appellant’s voice. He agreed 
 
that  in  his  statement  he  made  no  reference  to  the  two  men  who  got  out  of  the  car 
wearing  gloves,  but  had  referred  to  the  gunman,  whose  arm  he  saw  later,  wearing 
gloves.  He said that was more likely to be right.  The gunman was probably over six 
foot  in  height. 
In  re-examination,  he  said  that  he  thought  the  voice  was  the 
appellant’s but was not sure about that.

R v George 

 
18.	 

 
Against  that  background  the  evidence  of  gunshot  residue  falls  to  be  considered. 
When the appellant was arrested at his home on 21st August, the police found a coat 
 
stored  under  the  stairs.  It  was  a  black  Henri  Lloyd  hooded  jacket,  size  XL.  The 
appellant asserted that it did not belong to him. Subsequent analysis found that it bore 
gunshot  residue.  David  Collins  of  the  Forensic  Science  Service  (“FSS”)  gave 
evidence for the prosecution. A transcript of his testimony is not available; we rely on 
his report and the summary of his evidence provided in the summing up by Penry-
Davey J. 

 

19.	  Mr  Collins  said  that  on  the  discharge  of  a  firearm,  a  great  deal  of  gunshot  residue 
could  come  from  the  muzzle  or  the  breech,  depending  on  the  construction  of  the 
weapon. The residue was a fine dust that could settle on persons or objects close to 
 
the firing gun.  If it settled on clothing which was worn, it could disappear in a day or 
two, but if the clothing were left undisturbed the residue may be detectable for a long 
period.  In  his  reports  and  witness  statements,  Mr  Collins  referred  to  finding  two 
particles containing lead, barium, and antimony; one particle containing barium and 
aluminium on the front of the coat; and one particle containing barium and aluminium 
in the pocket. He found particles containing lead, barium, antimony and aluminium on 
the spent cartridges at the scene. He concluded that the coat had an association with a 
shooting incident, but it was not possible to establish a link with the shooting of Dale. 
The  prosecution  asserted  that  this  was  evidence  supportive  of  the  appellant  having 
been the gunman. 

 
20.	 

 
21.	 

The defence asserted that the particles could have arisen from sources other than the 
 
shooting.  They  had  the  benefit  of  expert  evidence  from  Dr  Renshaw  who  took  the 
 
view that it would be unsafe to link the gunshot residue on the coat to the shooting of 
Dale. Further, a dummy cartridge taken from the appellant’s mother’s car could have 
been  the  source  of  the  gunshot  residue  on  the  coat.  In  cross-examination,  these 
 
propositions  were  put  to  Mr  Collins  who  did  not  disagree  with  them:  in  the 
 
circumstances, they were not considered contentious and Dr Renshaw was not called 
to give oral evidence. 

At the close of the prosecution case, both defendants made a submission of no case to 
answer. Counsel for the appellant submitted that both limbs of the well known test in 
R  v  Galbraith  73  Cr  App  Rep  124  were  satisfied.  Alternatively,  the  evidence  was 
tenuous  and  inherently  weak;  none  of  the  evidence  individually  or  collectively 
amounted  to  a  case  which  should  be  left  to  the  jury.  Dismissing  the  submissions, 
Penry-Davey  J  held  that  the  state  of  the  evidence  was  such  that  a  jury  properly 
 
directed could convict on the matters charged, and allowed the case to proceed.  

The Defence Case 

 
22.	 

The defence case was alibi: the appellant had gone to eat at Keating’s home.  This 
was  evidenced  not  only  by  his  own  account  but  also  by  Keating’s  mother  and  her 
sister. Brown said that he went to McDonald’s restaurant before visiting friends; that 
 
evidence was corroborated by Jerome Barlow. In his closing speech, counsel for the 
appellant highlighted the weaknesses in the identification evidence, and asserted that 
the gunshot residue on the coat could be the product of secondary transfer. 

The Summing-up
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v George 

 
23.	 

 
24.	 

In summing-up, Penry-Davey J provided the jury with directions of law which are not 
 
criticised.  Although  a  circumstantial  case  which  might  have  benefited  from  some 
description of the way in which such evidence should be approached along with its 
limitations, he addressed the four pillars of the prosecution case and did highlight the 
interdependency of the evidence.  

In relation to the background, the judge both pointed to and summarised the relevant 
 
admissions  and  other  evidence.    Turning  to  Cunningham’s  report  of  the  telephone 
conversation, he said: 

 

“Ladies and gentlemen, normally what one person says in the 
 
absence of another person, as for example in interview by the 
police,  is  not  evidence  against  that  other  person.  You  will 
appreciate the reasons for that: the other person is no there to 
dispute  what  is  said.  The  situation  here  is  different.  If  you 
accept Cunningham’s evidence, that Nathan Loftus did say on 
 
the phone that Dwaine George was coming to collect the gun, 
that  is  evidence  that  you  can  consider  in  deciding  whether  or 
not Dwaine George was one of those who came to collect the 
gun. Of course, you would not conclude that he did so merely 
upon the say-so of Nathan Loftus, but it is evidence that you 
can take into account in Dwaine George’s case if you are sure 
that  the  remark  by  Nathan  Loftus,  on  the  telephone  to  Aaron 
[sic]  Cunningham,  was  made  as  part  of  a  joint  enterprise  to 
collect  and  possess  the  gun,  and  you  conclude  that  there  is 
evidence,  apart  from  Nathan  Loftus’  remark,  of  Dwaine 
 
George’s  participation  in  the  joint  plan.  The  remark  cannot 
 
itself  be  used  to  prove  the  link  between  George  and  the  joint 
plan, 
independent  evidence  which

in the case against George.”

25.	 

Penry-Davey J then dealt with the ‘other independent evidence’ and tied the various 
 
pillars of the prosecution case together.  He said: 

“There  is  evidence  in  the  case  that  you  can  consider  in  that 
context: first, the evidence that Dwaine George was with Ryan 
Loftus on Dillicar Walk; secondly, the evidence of Shaw that 
he recognised the gunman’s voice; and, thirdly, the evidence of 
the  gunshot  residue  on  the  jacket.  … 
[T]hat  is  the  way  in 
which you should approach that remark if you are sure that it 
was made. ” 

 
26.	 

The  judge  then  reviewed  Cunningham’s  evidence  in  detail  and  noted  various 
inconsistencies and the extent to which his account changed when cross examined. He 
went on: 

“Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron [sic] Cunningham’s evidence is 
central to the prosecution case. He has admitted lying on many 
occasions.  His  evidence  is  materially  different  from,  for 
example, the evidence of Garside or Turner. He may well, you

may  think,  have  purposes  of  his  own  to  serve.  You  should 
approach his evidence with great care and considerable caution, 
and you should look for evidence which supports his evidence.” 

 
27.	 

Passing  on  to  Cunningham’s  visual  identification,  Penry-Davey  J  gave  an  entirely 
appropriate  Turnbull  direction  and  drew  attention  to  the  particular  weaknesses  in 
Cunningham’s identification of the appellant.  The appellant was not well known to 
him; he did not get out of the car; he only had a momentary glimpse; he could not be 
sure that it was the appellant; and he could not say anything about the length of his 
hair. He noted that there had not been an identification parade for the appellant who 
 
had  consequently  lost  the  prospect  that,  at  such  a  parade  Cunningham  might  have 
 
identified someone else, identified no-one at all or positively exonerated him.  

 
28.	 

As to the evidence of voice identification, Penry-Davey J said: 

“Ladies and gentlemen, you must exercise even greater caution 
when  considering  the  identification  of  Dwaine  George  by 
voice,  and  I  should  remind  you  of  the  weaknesses  in  that 
evidence.  Stuart  Shaw  said  that  Dwaine  George  was  not  a 
friend of his, and that they had only been at the same school 
together for a short time in May/June ‘98; he had not spoken to 
Dwaine George since; had only seen him about twice; and had 
only heard him talking once. When first asked about it he had 
described what he heard as “a coloured person’s voice,” but did 
not suggest it was Dwaine George. He said that was because he 
 
told the officer he was not sure about it and the officer told him 
not to say if he was not sure. He said that he could not be sure 
if it was Dwaine George’s voice. 

told  you  of 

that  could  support 
I  have 
Cunningham’s  identification  of  Dwaine  George.  So  far  as 
support  for  Stuart  Shaw’s  identification  of  Dwaine  George  is 
concerned, the only evidence that, depending on the view you 
took of it, could support Shaw’s evidence is the evidence of the 
 
gunshot residue found on the coat, … from Dwaine George’s 
home.” 

the  evidence 

 

Thus,  once  again,  the  judge  looked  to  the  gunshot  residue  (described  as  such)  as 
potentially corroborative of the voice identification.  

Dealing  with  the  gunshot  residue,  Penry-Davey  J  gave  a  measured  account  of  the 
evidence  underlining  that  the  particles  containing  aluminium  could  have  been 
produced  from  any  cartridge  case  of  which  the  expert  had  samples  or  from  other 
 
ammunition that contains aluminium.  He did not differentiate between the different 
particles (with different chemical constitutions) but went on to remind the jury that 
 
Mr Collins had said that the residue might have arisen: 

“  ‘…because  of  someone  wearing  a  coat  close  to  somebody 
else firing a gun, or a coat in  physical contact with a gun, or 
fired  ammunition,  or  a  coat  in  contact  with  any  object  or

surface containing gunshot residue’.  He said ‘It suggests some 
sort of association with a shooting’.” 

 
31.	 

The jury was then reminded that, when cross examined, Mr Collins had said that it 
was not possible to establish any specific link with the shooting of Daniel Dale; other 
potential sources for such residue could be blank firing guns and industrial nail guns; 
the dummy cartridge could be a potential source.  The judge continued: 

“Somebody  handling  the  bullet  and  putting  his  hands  in  his 
pockets: the transfer could take place that way.  He said ‘It’s 
not  possible  to  say  whether  the  four  particles  were  from  the 
same  or  different  sources.’    He  said  ‘I  agree  that  I  cannot  be 
 
sure that the shooting incident on 25 July was the source of the 
 
residue  found  on  the  coat,  that  the  dummy  cartridge  could 
be’…. 

Well,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  that  again  is  evidence  for  you  to 
consider in the case.  And you will no doubt take into account 
 
the points that have been made, both on behalf of the Crown in 
respect of that evidence and on behalf of the defence, as to its 
significance, if any, in this case.” 

The words “if any” at the conclusion of that summary make it clear that the judge did 
not exclude the possibility that the jury would not find the particles of any value. 

The First Appeal 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

As mentioned above, the appellant’s renewed application for leave to appeal against 
conviction  came  before  the  full  court  on  25th  May  2004.  His  appeal  was  heard 
alongside  that  of  Brown,  who  was  given  leave  to  appeal  on  the  basis  of  the 
inconsistency of the jury’s verdicts. 

 
The  appellant’s  appeal  focused  on  the  nature  of  the  evidence  at  trial.  Counsel 
submitted that Penry-Davey J erred in admitting Mr Loftus’ conviction; in admitting 
the evidence of Cunningham that Loftus had said that the appellant was coming to 
pick up the gun; in leaving the evidence of Cunningham to the jury (because of the 
circumstances and the absence of an identification parade); in failing to exclude the 
evidence of Shaw of voice recognition; and in refusing to accede to the submission 
that there was no case to answer. In dismissing the appeal, the court found that Penry-
 
Davey J had correctly identified the legal principles and had decided each issue within 
the entirely legitimate bounds of his discretion. The evidence was such that the jury 
was able to consider it, subject to appropriate and robust direction. Such a direction 
had been given. 

 
The Present Proceedings 

The appellant’s first application to the CCRC was dated 16th February 2005 at which 
time no basis upon which to refer the conviction to this court could be discerned.  The 
current  application  (received  23rd  July  2010)  is  primarily  based  on  a  scientific  re-
evaluation of the significance of gunshot residue generally as a result of which, on 
19th  July  2006,  the  FSS  issued  guidelines  on  ‘the  assessment,  interpretation  and

R v George 

reporting of firearms chemistry cases’ (“2006 Guidelines”). This document deals with 
the prevalence of small numbers of particles of gunshot residue with the result, so it is 
 
argued, that the number and type of particles of residue found on the coat were so 
small so as to be at or near the level at which they could not be considered to have 
 
evidential  value.    Parallels  were  drawn  with  the  analysis  in  R  v  George  (Barry) 
(supra). Having obtained fresh evidence in the form of an expert report prepared by 
Miss Angela Shaw, the CCRC decided to refer the case back to the court on this basis, 
reflecting  that  this  court  could  conclude  that  the  weight  of  the  gunshot  residue 
 
evidence was not such as supported the identification evidence.   

This  ground  of  appeal  is  formulated  by  the  proposition  that  the  gunshot  residue 
evidence should not have been admitted before the jury.  Alternatively, it is argued 
that Penry-Davey J failed to give what would now be an appropriate warning relating 
to the limited significance that could be attached to such evidence. 

 

The CCRC declined to refer the convictions on the further ground that a re-analysis of 
the CCTV to demonstrate that the description of the witnesses was inconsistent with 
an assailant being the appellant.  Nevertheless, the case having been referred, on his 
behalf, Mr James Wood Q.C. seeks leave further to argue that the conviction is unsafe 
because the voice identification evidence of Stuart Shaw should not have been given 
 
in evidence or, alternatively, following R v Flynn and St John (supra), which post-
dated  the  appeal,  the  trial  judge  failed  to  give  a  warning  appropriate  to  the  voice 
 
identification evidence. 

 
35.	 

 
36.	 

 

37.	  Mr Richard Whittam Q.C. for the Crown recognises that there has been a change of 
 
approach  to  evidence  of  gunshot  residue  but  argues  that  this  change  does  not 
 
necessarily determine the appeal. It is not suggested that gunshot residue evidence is 
of no value at all and, furthermore, it was clear that from the evidence at the trial that 
the presence of the gunshot residue could be explained in a variety of ways.  As to 
 
voice  identification,  it  is  argued  that  the  trial  judge  gave  clear  warnings  as  to  its 
treatment.  He  emphasised  the  weakness  of  both  that  identification  and  the  visual 
 
identification.  It is submitted, therefore, that neither ground undermines the safety of 
 
these convictions. 

The Significance of Particles of Gunshot Residue 

 

38.	  Mr Whittam does not oppose the application to admit the evidence of Ms Shaw and 
there  is  no  doubt  that  the  2006  Guidelines  (updated  in  2009  but  with  no  material 
difference to this case) do provide new material as representing a change in scientific 
thinking on the significance of gunshot residue.  Although we are both mindful of and 
share the cautious approach to fresh expert evidence (see R v Jones [1997] 1 Cr App 
R 86), in the circumstances of this case, we admit it and turn to consider its impact in 
this case and, in particular, the extent (if at all) to which it affects the safety of the 
conviction. 

The  2006  Guidelines  identify  ammunition  types,  how  particles  are  formed  in  the 
 
discharge  of  a  firearm  (including  other  possible  sources  of  such  particles  such  as 
 
fireworks, nail guns and brake linings) and the possibilities of secondary transfer.  It 
classifies the number of gunshot residue primer particles into reporting levels of ‘low’ 
 
(1-3  particles),  ‘moderate’  (4-12  particles);  ‘high’  (13-50  particles)  and  ‘very  high’ 

 
39.

R v George 

(greater than 50 particles) and contains the following advice in relation to reporting 
single particles and low levels of residue (at para. 9.5): 

“Any positive finding must be declared in the statement and a 
comparison  of  the  composition  or  type  can  be  carried  out 
 
mostly  for  the  purposes  of  elimination.  Other  than  this,  very 
little  in  the  way  of  interpretation  can  be  applied  to  finding 
LOW  levels  of  residue  because  of  the  lack  of  relevant 
background data on residue in the external environment. Whilst 
the presence of residue in the environment is considered to be 
extremely  rare,  persons  who  associated  with  firearm  users 
might unknowingly and unwittingly pick up the odd particle of 
residue. This is the so called ""lifestyle"" issue ... 

 

Case work experience of searching through whole wardrobes of 
clothes  shows  that  single  particles  are  occasionally  detected. 
Single particles present a particular problem being the smallest 
detectable  amount  of  residue  it  is  possible  to  find.  A  single 
particle is defined as one particle found on an item or group of 
items  from  a  single  source,  e.g.  samples  and  clothing  from  a 
 
suspect all taken at the same time. 

Unfortunately,  it  is  not  possible  to  say  when  or  how  single 
particles were deposited. It cannot be determined if they are the 
last remains of some prior association with firearms, or whether 
they  have  been  deposited  quite  recently  from  some  likely 
contaminated source. 

... There is no sufficient data on the environmental occurrence 
of FDR to give a safe interpretation of finding a single particle 
of  residue.  Consequently  the  FSS  has  adopted  a  cautious 
 
approach to reporting LOW levels of residue and no evidential 
value can be offered. 

 

From an investigative point of view LOW levels of residue may 
nonetheless have some value; for example, finding a low levels 
on a discarded item such as a glove may give a significant lead 
to a police investigation. When an officer is given information 
on low levels in an investigative submission he must be made 
aware that in most cases it is unlikely any evidential weight can 
be attached to the findings.” 

 

Against this forensic background, Ms Shaw analysed the findings (and re-examined 
the coat).  She found that only the two particles on the coat containing lead, barium, 
and antimony could be said to be characteristic of gunshot residue.  The two particles 
 
containing barium and aluminium were indicative of gunshot residue, but could also 
have  originated  from  other  sources,  such  as  fireworks.  An  additional  indicative 
particle  containing  barium  and  aluminium  was  found  on  the  front  of  the  coat.  This 
 
also could not be said to be gunshot residue.

R v George 

 

Applying  the  2006  Guidelines,  Ms  Shaw  considered  that  very  little  by  way  of 
 
interpretation could be applied to finding such low levels of gunshot residue, not least 
 
because of the lack of background data on residue in the external environment. She 
concluded that the particles could be related to a shooting; or to the dummy cartridge; 
or picked up unknowingly from the environment. In that regard, she noted that there 
had been shooting incidents on 30th April 2001 (following which George was arrested 
but not charged) and at the Museum public house (in respect of which Ryan Brown 
and Kevin Faulkner were arrested but not charged).  If George had been arrested by 
armed police officers, they could have had residue on their hands and clothing which 
could have transferred to his clothing.  Suffice to say, it was not possible to conclude 
that the particles must be related to this particular shooting.  We add only that it is 
unclear (but we doubt) whether there was any evidence of these other incidents before 
the court. 

R v George (Barry) concerned the murder of Ms Jill Dando. A significant finding was 
 
the  presence  of  a  single  particle  of  firearms  discharge  residue  in  the  internal  right 
pocket of a coat found hanging on the kitchen door of that appellant. It was a particle 
that contained the same constituent elements as discharge residue in a cartridge case 
 
found  at  the  scene  of  the  shooting  and  on  the  victim’s  hair.  It  is  clear  that 
considerable significance was attached to this single particle.  As was underlined in 
this court (see [2007] EWCA Crim 2722 per Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers CJ at 
para. 51): 

the  Crown's 

scientists  considered 

“It is clear from these extracts [from] the summing up that the 
 
jury  were  directed  that  the  evidence  of  Mr  Keeley  and  Dr 
 
Renshaw provided significant support for the prosecution's case 
that the appellant had fired the gun that killed Miss Dando. The 
judge  did  not  consider  that  their  evidence  on  this  topic  was 
 
""neutral"".  In  this  he  was  correct  and  his  summary  is  a  model 
reflection of the evidence that had been called. In reality, when 
considered objectively, that evidence conveyed the impression 
innocent 
that 
contamination  was  unlikely  and 
in 
consequence, it was likely that the source of the single particle 
 
was  the  gun  which  killed  Miss  Dando.  In  that  respect  their 
evidence at the trial was in marked conflict with the evidence 
that they have given to this court with the result that the jury 
did not have the benefit of a direction that the possibility that 
the  [firearms  discharge  residue]  had  come  from  the  gun  that 
had  killed  Miss  Dando  was  equally  as  remote  as  all  other 
possibilities and thus, on its own, entirely inconclusive. In the 
light of the way in which Mr Keeley now puts the matter, we 
 
have no doubt that the jury were misled upon this issue.” 

that 

that,  effectively 

That case was considered in R v Joseph [2010] EWCA Crim 2580 which was another 
murder  which  depended  on  a  substantial  body  of  circumstantial  evidence:  without 
seeking  to  be  exhaustive,  this  included  the  recovery  of  the  murder  weapon  and 
gunshot  residue  in  a  car  which  could  be  linked  to  Gavin  Dean  Abdullah,  a  man  to 
whom that appellant could himself be linked through documents found at his home. 
 
Also in a bedroom at his home, there was found a single particle of what could be

R v George 

gunshot residue in a pocket of each of two motorcycle jackets and on a glove: they 
were of different types and concessions were made by the forensic scientist in that 
case as to secondary transfer such that the defence expert was not called.  The case 
was left to the jury on the basis that the prosecution argued that the particle from the 
left  glove  was  “capable  of  having  come  as  discharge  residue  from  the  murder 
weapon” but also that the defence case was that “particles can easily be transferred 
from one surface to another.  All it needs is a hand, a glove, a coat sleeve. Anything 
 
could transfer the particle”.   

 

 
44.	 

Although it was argued that the case was similar to George (Barry), this court rejected 
 
the notion that the jury had been misled.  Pitchford LJ put it (at para 28): 

“We entertain no doubt that the jury was perfectly well aware 
 
that the [gunshot residue] evidence was not capable of proving 
that the applicant had fired the murder weapon. However, any 
evidence  which  was  capable  of  linking  the  applicant  with  the 
gun  bag  was  an  important  part  of  the  circumstantial  case 
 
associating the applicant with Abdullah. The fact the bag itself 
belonged  to  the  applicant  was  plainly  relevant.  As  we  have 
 
observed,  the  applicant  eventually  gave  evidence  of  that 
association,  an  explanation  which  it  was  for  the  jury  to 
evaluate.” 
 

Turning  to  the  first  ground  of  appeal,  the  appellant  submits  that  this  case  is  on  all 
 
fours  with  R  v  George  (Barry),  where  excessive  weight  was  placed  on  a  single 
particle of gunshot residue. The Crown submit that the better parallel is R v Joseph, 
where  evidence  of  low  levels  of  gunshot  residue  was  admissible  being  specifically 
 
accorded  appropriate  (and  not  excessive)  weight.  As  the  appellant  submits,  there  is 
only one more characteristic particle than in R v George (Barry). However, it is clear 
from R v Joseph that the task for this court is not merely quantitatively to apply the 
 
2006 Guidelines, which have no force in law  but are indicative only of the current 
state of the science.  

 

 

In our judgment, there is no basis for challenging the decision of the trial judge to 
admit the evidence of gunshot residue and neither does the new evidence provided by 
Ms  Shaw  justify  such  a  view.    The  fact  that  scientists  have  adopted  a  cautious 
 
approach  to  reporting  low  levels  of  residue  (i.e.  1-3  particles)  such  that  for  that 
residue, on its own, no evidential significance can be attached to it does not mean that 
the evidence is necessarily inadmissible or irrelevant.  Still less is that the case when 
(as  here)  there  were  in  fact  a  total  of  four  recovered  particles,  albeit  that  two  are 
characteristic  of  gunshot  residue  and  two  indicative  only  (to  say  nothing  of  the 
 
additional  particle  found  by  Ms  Shaw).  The  jury  are  more  than  able  to  assimilate 
evidence  as  to  potential  significance  or  lack  of  significance  of  recovered  evidence, 
provided  that  there  is  an  appropriate  explanation  of  that  potential  significance,  for 
example, by reference to what might occur in the environment or might otherwise be 
 
the consequence of entirely innocent contamination. 

The importance of this point can be illustrated by reference to the forensic value of 
the absence of evidence.  Whereas it is correct to say that absence of evidence is not 
the  same  as  evidence  of  absence,  the  failure  to  recover  anything  that  could  even 
remotely  be  consistent  with  gunshot  residue  might  provide  a  forensic  argument

supporting the proposition that involvement in the discharge of a firearm is disproved 
by  the  absence  of  particles  that  could  be  gunshot  residue.  The  submission  that  the 
 
evidence  now  available  demonstrates  that  the  original  forensic  evidence  should  not 
have been placed before the jury is rejected. 

Turning  to  the  summing  up,  Penry-Davey  J  provided  what  appears  to  be  a  clear, 
balanced account of the evidence, underlining the various innocent explanations that 
Mr Collins had conceded during the course of his evidence for the presence of the 
particles on the coat found at the appellant’s home.  As we have explained, he had 
specifically  left  open  the  possibility  that  the  particles  had  no  significance.    On  the 
other  hand,  however,  he  did  not  differentiate  between  the  nature  of  or  value  to  be 
attached to the different particles (whatever Mr Collins might have said) and referred 
to  gunshot  residue  as  potentially  supportive  of  a  conclusion  of  joint  enterprise 
 
sufficient  to  justify  reliance  on  Cunningham’s  account  that  he  was  told  that  the 
appellant would collect the gun.  Similarly, he referred to this evidence as potentially 
independent  support  for  Shaw’s  evidence  to  that  effect  that  he  recognised  the 
appellant’s voice. 

 

49.	  While  we  endorse  Mr  Whittam’s  broad  proposition  that  the  change  of  approach  to 
evidence  of  gunshot  residue  does  not  necessarily  determine  the  appeal,  had  the 
 
present  scientific  concerns  explained  by  Ms  Shaw  been  available  to  the  judge,  we 
have no doubt that his directions would have been couched in terms of much greater 
circumspection and caution.  The particles of gunshot residue may well be consistent 
with the appellant’s participation in the murder but, at the very least, the extent (if it 
got  that  far)  to  which  they  could  provide  positive  corroboration  would  now  have 
 
required much more detailed analysis of the science and the evidence.  

 
50.	 

The approach to the impact of fresh evidence (such as Ms Shaw provides) is identified 
in a well-trodden line of authority, ranging from Stafford v DPP [1974] AC 878 to the 
recent decision in Lundy v The Queen [2013] UKPC 28.  Thus, in Dial and anor v 
State of Trinidad and Tobago [2005] UKPC 4; [2005] 1 WLR 1660, Lord Brown of 
Eaton-under-Heywood put the approach in this way (at para. 31): 

 

 

“Where fresh evidence is adduced on a criminal appeal it is for 
the  Court  of  Appeal,  assuming  always  that  it  accepts  it,  to 
evaluate its importance in the context of the remainder of the 
evidence in the case. … The primary question is for the court 
itself and is not what effect the fresh evidence would have had 
on the mind of the jury. That said, if the court regards the case 
as  a  difficult  one,  it  may  find  it  helpful  to  test  its  view  ‛by 
asking  whether  the  evidence,  if  given  at  the  trial,  might 
reasonably  have  affected  the  decision  of  the  trial  jury  to 
convict’:  R v Pendleton [2002] 1 All ER 524 at [19]. 

 
51.	 

The  essential  question  remains  whether,  in  the  light  of  the  fresh  evidence,  the 
convictions are unsafe or, as articulated in Lundy (supra) by Lord Kerr (at para. 150): 

 

“[T]he  proper  test  to  be  applied  by  an  appellate  court  in 
deciding whether a verdict is unsafe or a miscarriage of justice 
has  occurred,  where  new  evidence  has  been  presented,  is
--------

R v George 

whether  the  evidence  might  reasonably  have  led  to  an 
acquittal.” 
 

 
52.	 

In  the  context  of  this  case,  it  is  important  to  underline  that  Ryan  Brown  (whom 
Cunningham  had  also  identified  in  circumstances  more  favourable  to  those  which 
obtained in relation to the appellant) was acquitted and it is not fanciful to suggest that 
 
the  evidence  relating  to  what  was  called  gunshot  residue  was  seen  by  the  jury  as 
 
providing  important  independent  support  for  the  weak  visual  identification  by 
Cunningham and weak voice recognition by Shaw (to say nothing of playing a part in 
justifying  the  conclusion  of  joint  enterprise  sufficient  to  rely  on  the  evidence  of 
Cunningham that the appellant had been named as one who was collecting the gun). 
 
The  final  plank  of  the  prosecution  case,  namely  the  background  events,  provides 
 
critical context but is not probative of involvement in murder.  In the circumstances, 
in the light of the new material, we are not prepared to conclude that these verdicts 
remain  safe:  the  fresh  evidence  might  reasonably  have  affected  the  decision  of  the 
trial jury. 

 

53.	  Mr Wood also seeks leave to appeal on grounds relating to the admissibility of the 
evidence  of  voice  recognition  and  the  adequacy  of  the  direction  in  relation  to  that 
 
evidence.  As to admissibility, the issue was decided against the appellant in the first 
appeal  and  we  see  no  reason  to  depart  from  that  conclusion.    Dealing  with  the 
approach of Penry-Davey J, although we recognise that the approach to such material 
is  now  identified  in  R  v  Flynn  and  St  John  (supra),  we  are  satisfied  that,  in  the 
circumstances  of  this  case,  the  direction  was  sufficient:  he  indicated  that  increased 
caution  was  required  with  voice  identification,  and  highlighted  the  specific 
weaknesses. 
 

Conclusion 

 
54.	 

Having  admitted  the  evidence  of  Ms  Shaw,  we  have  concluded  that  it  might 
reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury so that these convictions are no 
longer safe; in the circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the convictions quashed. 
 
In addition to expressing our gratitude to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, we 
 
pay tribute to the work of the Innocence Project and Pro Bono Unit at Cardiff Law 
School, which took up the appellant’s case and pursued it so diligently.",2014-12-09 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Hawkesworth 

 

1 December 2014 

 

 

 
You have pleaded guilty, with the exception of 2 counts, to an indictment containing 
27 counts of offences Contrary to sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Sexual Offences Act 
2003, as well as an offence of voyeurism and 2 offences of possession of indecent 
images.  Those offences contrary to ss7, 9 and 10, that is of sexual activity with a child, 
causing a child to engage in sexual activity and sexual assault of a child under 13, 
involve a course of conduct by you over a period of about 3.5 years and the targeting 
of 18 young boys, the oldest being 15 and the youngest being 10, who at the material 
time were your patients and who were ostensibly, being examined by you, a 
consultant paediatric haematologist at Addenbrookes’ Hospital and who most 
importantly , were all vulnerable and gravely ill.  In addition you engaged in 
voyeurism by secretly filming your patients with a camera concealed in a pen whilst in 
the hospital, as well as having in your possession a disc which was found at your home, 
containing 16,000 indecent still images of children and 20 moving images, some, not 
the greater proportion, involving acts of penetration.  The children in these images 
were of roughly similar age to the patients you abused and mostly images of male 
children. 
 
In consequence of your pleas of guilt at an early stage in these proceedings you are 
entitled in law to receive a discount of 33% upon your sentence.  Some might observe, 
given the overwhelming nature of the evidence in this case that your pleas of guilt do 
not merit such a discount but I bear in mind, that by your pleas you have at least saved 
your victims, their families and your colleagues from the very real trauma of reliving 
their experiences and giving evidence.  Having said that your pleas of guilt are, in truth 
the only mitigation available to you. 
 
The offences contrary to ss7, 9 and 10 involved the manipulation by you of your 
patients, their parents and your colleagues.  In some cases you exaggerated the 
seriousness of the child’s illness to ensure further examinations took place than were 
strictly necessary in order to increase your opportunities to abuse.  You persuaded
--------
parents and colleagues to allow you to examine your patients in the absence of 
chaperones and then, in some cases, where the child must have seemed to you to be 
understanding of what you were doing, swore them to silence.  Having achieved the 
privacy and frequency of contact you desired, for your selfish sexual gratification, you 
caused them yourself to achieve erections or encouraged them to do so themselves and 
in some cases encouraged them to masturbate and touched their genitals on the pretext 
of medical examination. 
 
In many years experience on the bench, I have never come across a more culpable or 
grave course of sexual criminality which has involved such a gross and grotesque 
breach and betrayal of your Hippocratic Oath and trust reposed in you by your 
patients, their families and colleagues. 
 
There are almost too many aggravating features to enumerate in this prolonged, 
carefully planned, cruel and persistent campaign of abuse.  At the top of the list comes 
the breach of trust.  Your colleagues remain guilt ridden at having been unable to 
detect your offending earlier and having been successfully manipulated by you into 
ignorance.  Your actions have undermined public trust in an already overstretched 
health service and have caused enormous expense and upheaval in the internal 
enquiries that inevitably followed your suspension from practice.  All this almost pales 
into insignificance set against the trauma, fear and distress you have caused to your 
victims and their families – considerable psychological harm, I have no doubt – which 
I suspect will linger with them for the rest of their lives.  It is implicit in what you did 
for your own sexual gratification that you were targeting the most vulnerable - sick 
children and what you did required careful and significant planning.  You bought a 
camera pen so you could record things without your victims realising and when the 
balloon went up you disposed of the hard drive of your lap top, onto which, I infer, 
many images had been recorded.  Nobody will ever know the precise extent of your 
activities, thus increasing the agony of those you pretended to treat and their families 
particularly of deceased children in not knowing whether they too had been abused in 
this way. 
 
As I have said for a Doctor to attack gravely ill children in this way is one of the most 
serious forms of sexual offending imaginable even if it does not involve physical 
violence which goes beyond the abuse itself or penetrative activity. 
 
As a result of this combination of factors whilst I have paid careful regard to the 
guidelines in considering an appropriate sentence, in my judgement, the category 
ranges of sentences therein set out do not adequately reflect your culpability.  Bearing 
in mind, as I do that the range set out is relevant to a single offence – not a course of 
conduct, where many of the counts on the indictment are specimen counts. I bear in 
mind that the maximum sentence I could pass for any of the offences to which you 
have pleaded guilty is one of 14 years imprisonment and even if I thought it 
appropriate to do so I would be unable, as a matter of law to pass a sentence of life 
imprisonment.  In arriving at the sentence I have, I have first of all considered what 
the totality of your offending would have merited in a contested trial and then 
discounted that total by 33%.  In respect of each of the offences contrary to Ss7, 9 and 
10, I have made sentences concurrent but of a length to reflect your overall culpability 
in respect of each type of offence.  Considering as I do that your downloading of 
indecent images began before escalating into your campaign of abuse I will pass a short
--------
determinate sentence first in respect of those images concurrently with a sentence for 
voyeurism to which I shall add 3 consecutive sentences.   
 
I have considered long and hard whether extended sentences should be passed in your 
case.  Miss Rafferty submits that the legal test for “dangerousness” is not passed 
because, in effect whilst there is obviously a risk of your committing specified offences 
in the future towards boys in the 8-16 year old age range, this would not cause the 
serious harm which I must be satisfied would be caused by such future offending 
before I could conclude you were dangerous within the meaning of the Act.  She bases 
those assertions on the physical nature of the offences you have committed hitherto.  
However, as Dr Smith observes in his report you meet the diagnosis of paedophilia, 
and that there had been a long trajectory from private masturbatory fantasy to viewing 
indecent material and ultimately progressing to contact sexual offending which you 
yourself admitted to him was escalating.  Nor do I accept that penetration and violence 
is a necessary ingredient before serious harm could be perceived as a risk.  I have no 
doubt you have caused serious psychological harm to your victims and are at risk of 
doing so, in the future.  Having said that I accept you are a man who recognises your 
own deviancy and have some insight into this and thus are capable of responding 
positively not only to punishment but to the lowering of risk.  Whilst therefore, I find 
you dangerous, the period of licence available on the length of the determinate 
sentence which I propose to impose will be sufficient to protect the public with the 
close monitoring that will take place together with the SOPO I propose to impose 
upon you.

licence.  You can be recalled at any time during the licence period should you break 
any of its conditions.

Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh

You have been convicted by the jury of the murder of Christine Lee and Lucy 
Lee  on  23  February  2014  at  Keepers  Cottage  Stud  near  Farnham  in  Surrey. 
 
You have also been convicted of the possession of a firearm (a shotgun) with 
intent to endanger life. 

You  are  and  were  at  the  time  82  years  of  age  and  a  man  of  previous  good 
character.  You  lived  at  the  cottage  for  some  45  years  and  had  been  in  the 
business of breeding dogs and dealing in horses as well as other work.  Your 
partner  of  many  years  died  in  the  spring  of  last  year  and  this  clearly  had  a 
traumatic effect on you. 

You  had  known  Christine  Lee  (aged  66)  for  some  25  years  and  had  had  a 
relationship  with  her  on  and  off  during  that  time.    After  the  death  of  your 
partner, Christine Lee felt sorry for you and wanted to come to your cottage to 
look  after  you.  She  moved  to  the  cottage  in  September  last  year  and  was 
staying there in February this year.  Her daughter Lucy Lee (aged 41) was also 
staying from time to time at the cottage to help her mother and to help you 
look after the animals at your property. 

You are a man well used to handling and firing shotguns.  You had a licence to 
keep the shotgun in question. 

On the morning of Sunday 23 February you lost your temper and took your 
 
shotgun out of its locked cabinet and used it to kill Christine Lee.  She died of 

1
--------
a  single  shotgun  wound  to  the  chest  fired  at  close  range  at  an  angle  from 
above.  Lucy  Lee  was  able  to  use  her  mobile  phone  to  make  a  frantic  and 
desperate call to the emergency services on 999.  She said that you had shot 
 
her  mum  and  that  she  feared  that  you  were  going  to  shoot  her  as  well. 
Nevertheless in an act of extraordinary courage, she went back; no doubt to 
see if there was anything she could do to help her mother.  You then used the 
shotgun to shoot her twice, once to the back of the head and then fatally to the 
chest, again from an angle from above.  In the meantime you must have had to 
reload your weapon because it had two barrels. 

You then set about doing what you had planned to do all along, which was to 
put down four dogs at the premises.   

I have taken into account the personal impact statements from Christine Lee’s 
 
sister Julia and her daughter Stacey, in so far as they were read in court.  It is 
clear  that  the  murders  of  Christine  and  Lucy  Lee  have  had  a  terrible  and 
continuing impact on them and the other members of the family.

Count 3 
 
 
8.	 

I will deal first with Count 3, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger 
 
life.    The  maximum  sentence  for  this  offence  is  life  imprisonment.    In  the 
circumstances of this case I consider that the appropriate sentence is 10 years 
imprisonment  and  that  sentence  will  be  concurrent  to  the  minimum  terms 
which must be imposed for the two offences of murder in Counts 1 and 2. 

 

 
 
Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 

 

 
9.	 

 

 
Turning to Counts 1 and 2, there is only one sentence which the law permits 
me to pass upon you:  that is a sentence of life imprisonment.  I am required to 
specify the minimum term which you must serve before you can be considered 
for release on licence by the Parole Board.   

2
--------
10.	 

 

 
11.	 

 
 
12.	 

 
 
13.	 

 

 

In setting the minimum term I must have regard to the provisions of Schedule 
21  to  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003,  in  particular  paragraph  5.    Where  the 
court considers (as I do in the present case) that the seriousness of the offence 
(or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) 
is particularly high, the appropriate starting point in determining the minimum 
term is 30 years.  As paragraph 5(2) makes clear, cases that would normally 
fall within the category whose seriousness is particularly high include:  

(b) a murder involving the use of a firearm; and 
(f) the murder of two or more persons. 
 

I also have to have regard to any aggravating or mitigating factors to the extent 
I have not already allowed for them in the choice of the starting point. 

 

 

 
I make it clear for the avoidance of doubt that I do not regard paragraph 11(a) 
as being relevant in the present case as a potential mitigating factor.  It was 
accepted on your behalf that it was not relevant.  Having heard the evidence at 
your trial, I have come to the clear conclusion that you did have an intention to 
kill both Christine Lee and Lucy Lee rather than to cause them serious bodily 
harm.  I form that view because of the close range with which you used the 
 
shotgun  firing  at  their  chests.  I  also  form  that  view  because  in  statements 
which you made to the police after the incident you said that you had had to 
“put them down.” 

 
The  presence  of  an  intention  to  kill  is  not  in  itself  an  aggravating  factor. 
However,  in  my  view,  your  actions  went  beyond  that  in  this  case  and  had 
certain aggravating features.  On the evidence heard at the trial I have formed 
the view that, having killed Christine Lee, you then shot Lucy Lee in the back 
of  her  head  after  she  had  made  the  999  call,  then  reloaded  your  gun  and 
pursued  her  outside  the  cottage,  with  the  intention  of  making  sure  that  this 
time she died.

17.	 

 
 
18.	 

By virtue of paragraph 11 of Schedule 21, the mitigating factors which may be 
 
relevant in the present case include: 

(b) lack of pre-meditation; 
(d) the fact that the offender was provoked (for example by prolonged 

stress); and 

(g) the age of the offender. 

I  accept  that  there  was  no  pre-meditation  in  this  case  and  take  that  into 
account. 

I also accept that there were features in the background to the events in this 
case which need to be taken into account as tending to explain, but not justify, 
your  loss  of  temper  on  23  February.    There  was  evidence  at  the  trial, 
particularly from Mr Baddeley, whose statement was read, and the evidence of 
Mr  Richardson,  the  partner  of  Lucy  Lee  and  who  was  called  by  the 
 
Prosecution, to the effect that you felt that you were being controlled in what 
you could do, and that you felt frustrated and agitated as a consequence.  

I  turn  to  the  question  of  your  age.    In  this  context  I  have  been  referred  to 
 
several decisions of the Court of Appeal: R v Walker [2005] EWCA Crim 82; 
 
R  v  Archer  [2007]  EWCA  Crim  536;  R  v  Symmons  [2009]  EWCA  Crim 
1304; and R v Troughton [2012] EWCA Crim 1520.  I have also considered 
the recent decision in R v Sampford [2014] EWCA Crim 1560. 

It was common ground before me that the position was accurately summarised 
as follows at paragraph 15 of the judgment in Sampford: 

 
“…clearly age is a mitigating factor.  It is a statutory mitigating 
factor,  as  is  apparent  from  schedule  21  paragraph  11(g)  of  the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003.  Advanced age will be relevant in a 
 
sentencing  exercise  such  as  the  one  facing  [the  Judge].    The 
schedule establishes that, as does Troughton and the other cases 
cited  in  Troughton.   Neither  Troughton  nor  any  other  case,  nor 
the schedule, suggests that a court has to do what it can to ensure 
that a defendant does not die in prison.  If nothing else, no court 
  
would be in a position to conduct the necessary actuarial exercise. 
 
Even  if  it  were,  it  would  not  override  the  requirement  of  the 
sentencer to reflect the circumstances of the killing in setting the 

 

4
--------
minimum term.  If those circumstances require a minimum which 
may result in the offender dying in prison, then that will be the 
minimum term.” 

In my view the gravity of the offences committed by you in this case needs to 
be properly reflected in the minimum term imposed while taking into account 
your old age. 

I have taken into account everything else that has been said on your behalf in 
mitigation.  In particular it is clear that you have many health problems and 
that  you  had  experienced  personal  and  financial  difficulties  in  the  last  few 
years before these tragic events.  I have also read and considered the character 
 
references that have been placed before the court. 

 
I make it clear that I have not had regard to anything that was not in evidence 
at your trial or otherwise placed before me by either of the parties. 

 
 
19.	 

 
 
20.	 

 
 
21.	 

 
 
 
Time spent on remand 
 
22.	 

The  minimum  term  you  will  serve  will  have  the  number  of  days  you  have 
spent on remand deducted: on the information before me that is 248 days. 

 
 
 
Statutory surcharge 
 
23.	 

The legislation on surcharges applies to this case and an order will be drawn 
up accordingly. 

 
[The defendant should now stand] 
 
 
24.	 

John Lowe, the sentence of the court is 10 years imprisonment on Count 3, to 
be served concurrently with the other sentences.  The sentence of the court is 
 
life imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2, also concurrent.  The minimum term that 
you will serve is 25 years. 

 
[The defendant can now be taken down]

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Baker 


 

11 December 2014 


 
 

 

Over a period of about 15 years from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, when you 
were in your early 20s to your mid 30s, you were a well known DJ in the clubs 
around Salford and Manchester, and thereafter became a popular music presenter on 
Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, where you also ran a record shop. It is clear that 
throughout that period and in those capacities you exploited your celebrity status to 
sexually abuse young girls at a time when they were between 13 – 15 years of age.  
 
Anyone who considers that society was a better place then than now to be a child 
would do well to reflect upon the evidence that this trial disclosed about that period; 
when sex education, to the extent that it was taught, was rudimentary and sexual 
matters in general were little discussed within the home. That state of ignorance was 
one of the main facilitators of your ability to exploit these young girls; none of whom, 
with the exception of two whose vulnerability was enhanced by having previously 
been sexually abused by others, had any prior sexual experience.  
 
In the main you did not have to use force to abuse these girls, as the combination of 
their naivety and your celebrity was such that they willingly came with you to the 
various locations where you abused them. Those who were raped had little or no 
understanding of what was happening to them and felt that they could do little to 
prevent the abuse taking place, whilst those who consented to having sexual 
intercourse with you were awed by your status. Thereafter their wholly unwarranted 
feelings of guilt and shame prevented them in the main from disclosing what you had 
done to them, either to their parents or the authorities. 
 
Your well judged cynicism that your victims would in the main be too scared to 
complain about your conduct at that time, has only been matched by the ill judged 
cynicism which you displayed in the course of the trial that, after all these years, the 
jury would not believe the accounts of your victims.  
 
The immediate effect of your abuse of these girls ranged from feelings of disgust and 
degradation, so that they never wanted to have anything more to do with you, 
through to their being so corrupted that they became promiscuous both with yourself 

 

1
--------
and others. Whilst the lasting and corrosive effect of your abuse of these girls has been 
profound; some of them have self harmed or sought solace in alcohol, whilst others 
have required medical or psychiatric treatment. Many have had difficulties in forming 
and retaining emotional and physical relationships as adults both with their partners 
and sometimes even their own children, with whom they have either been distant or 
over protective; so that another generation has been adversely affected by your 
conduct. 
 
The catalyst which brought these events into the open was the media publicity which 
followed upon the death of Jimmy Savile in 2011, a person with whom you were 
known to have worked at an early stage of your career. Thereafter when a few of your 
victims disclosed to the police what you had done to them in their childhoods, others 
came forward who frankly told the police that, without the support of those other 
victims, they didn’t feel their own accounts would have been believed.  
 
It would, with one exception, be invidious for me to relate any one of your victim’s 
experiences, as being more worthy of inclusion than others.  However some common 
 
themes have emerged from some of these accounts. Including the selection by you of 
young girls who were both physically and emotionally immature, your initial 
approaches to them to make them feel really special, and the audacity of your 
suggestion to some of them that they should feel grateful that they had lost their 
virginity to you rather than to someone else. To use the modern idiom you 
“groomed” your victims, some of whom were plied with alcohol and allowed to 
smoke cigarettes, whilst others were impressed with the accoutrements of your relative 
wealth and fashion, as a beguiling contrast to the strictness and austerity of their own 
homes. You appeared to be kind and charming, and in relation to one of your victims, 
who was particularly vulnerable by reason of having already been sexually abused by 
another, you feigned sympathy and understanding before taking advantage of the 
situation and raping her.  
 
The jury convicted you of having sexually abused 11 different girls during this period 
of time, 6 of whom you raped and 5 of whom were, as I have said, so awed by your 
celebrity status that they consented to having sexual intercourse with you. Some of 
those you raped were forcibly penetrated by you, causing them acute pain and distress, 
whilst you ejaculated inside them. However it is clear that all of these girls were used 
by you for your own sexual gratification, which in some cases was enhanced by you 
encouraging them to masturbate you both manually and orally. In my judgement it is 
no mere coincidence that each of these girls was between 13 – 15 years of age when 
you abused them in this manner, as I am sure that, despite your protestations to the 
contrary, you have a sexual interest in girls of that age. 
 
As is apparent from a number of recent cases and the current sentencing guidelines 
themselves, the sentencing of those convicted of historic offences is not a 
straightforward task. In this regard I am satisfied that had you been convicted of these 
offences at a time more proximate to their commission, the danger which you then 
posed to young girls would have merited a sentence of life imprisonment. Indeed this 
is borne out by your conviction in 1999 for an offence of having sexual intercourse 
with a girl under the age of 16, namely 15 years of age; an offence which you continue 
to deny but of which I am satisfied, having heard the evidence, you were guilty.  
 

 

2
--------
However you are now 73 years of age. Therefore I have had to consider whether a 
sentence of either life imprisonment or an extended sentence is now the appropriate 
disposal in your case, or whether in reality given your age and the length of any 
determinate sentence of custody, the latter will suffice in order to satisfy the twin aims 
of punishment and the protection of the public. In my judgement in the present 
circumstances, the appropriate sentence is a determinate sentence of custody. Although 
I am of course duty bound and intend to pass upon you the least sentence which is 
commensurate with the seriousness of the offences of which you have been convicted, 
you can have no justifiable complaint that most if not all of your remaining life may be 
served in prison, as you have maintained your liberty in the intervening period since 
the commission of the offences for which you are to be punished.  
 
At the time of the commission of the offences of indecent assault the maximum 
sentence for such offences was 2 years’ custody. This court remains bound by that 
restriction. Thus on counts 1, 14, 25 31 and 35 there will be sentences of 18 months’ 
imprisonment, and on counts 6, 8, 18, 22, 23 and 24 there will be sentences of 12 
months’ imprisonment. However on each of the convictions for rape, namely counts 
5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 19, and 27 there will be sentences of 25 years’ imprisonment. All of 
those sentences will run concurrently with each other making a total custodial sentence 
of 25 years. 
 
As you know Parliament has decided that you will serve half of that period and then 
be released on licence for the remainder of it; such that if you were to commit any 
offence within that period or do not adhere to the conditions of your licence you will 
be liable to be returned to custody. Upon your release and for the remainder of your 
life you will be obliged to comply with the notification requirements provided by s.80 
of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and you will be barred from regulated activity with 
children under s.2 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.

TANIA CLARENCE 

SENTENCING REMARKS 
 

IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT 
 
 
 

 

Tania Clarence you are now aged 43, and are of previous good character. 
 
At the first reasonable opportunity to do so, you pleaded guilty (on the basis of 
diminished responsibility) to the manslaughter of three of your children – your twin 
sons Max and Ben who were aged 3 years 9 months, and your daughter Olivia who 
was aged 4 years 10 months.  You committed the offences in the early hours of Easter 
 
Tuesday this year when you were alone with the children at the family home in New 
Malden. Whilst they were asleep you asphyxiated each of them in turn, and then made 
a determined attempt to kill yourself. 
 
 
On 13 October this year, after long and careful consideration, the prosecution 
accepted your pleas.  In my view they were right to do so.  The evidence as to your 
diminished responsibility is clear and convincing.  It includes, in particular, reports 
from two distinguished psychiatrists Dr Joseph (for the defence) and Dr Chesterman 
(for the prosecution) who each make clear, in compelling detail, that you were 
mentally ill at the time – suffering from a major depressive episode (which is a 
recognised medical condition) which substantially impaired your ability to form a 
rational judgement at the time, and is the explanation for your carrying out the 
killings.  Indeed Dr Chesterman (the whole of whose evidence the prosecution accept) 
states in plain terms that if you had not been suffering from mental illness at the time 
you would not have killed your children. 
 
It is equally clear that you are still mentally ill now. Since being charged, and save for 
a short period, you have been receiving treatment in a secure ward at a psychiatric 
hospital.  You remain vulnerable to a significant deterioration in your mental health 
with the concomitant risk of a return to suicidal thoughts.  Indeed, on the evidence I 
have heard, further treatment involving both close psychiatric supervision and regular 
psychological therapy is going to be required for the foreseeable future. 
 
I must now decide what sentence to impose upon you. 
 
The first issue that I must determine is whether, in the terms of the relevant provisions 
of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, you are a dangerous offender.  The prosecution 
accept that you are not, and I agree.  Accordingly, your case does not call for 
consideration of an indeterminate sentence or an extended sentence. 
 

 

 

 

1
--------
Nor, as the prosecution also accept, do you qualify for the consideration of a 
restriction order under s.41 of the Mental Health Act 1983, or for the consideration of 
a hybrid sentence under s.45A of the same Act. 
 
Accordingly, the stark choice before me in respect of each offence is whether to 
impose a determinate prison sentence or a hospital order. 
 
On your behalf it is submitted that it is clear that your responsibility and culpability 
were low and that accordingly a hospital order under s.37 of the 1983 Act should be 
imposed in respect of each offence. 
 
The prosecution accept that if, on the evidence, I find as a fact that your responsibility 
and culpability were low, it would be appropriate for me to impose a hospital order.  
However the prosecution submit that your culpability is not completely extinguished 
by reason of your diminished responsibility and that your responsibility still remains 
considerable, such that a prison sentence ought to be imposed – albeit that the medical 
evidence shows that a prison sentence would lead to a deterioration of your mental 
illness.   
 
It is for the prosecution to make me sure, on the evidence, of the assertions that they 
make as to your responsibility and culpability. 
 
Both sides have invited me to consider the evidence on the papers and to make my 
findings accordingly.  In doing so I have borne in mind the approach also urged by 
both sides that none of those involved can provide an objective narrative of the history 
between you and your husband on the one hand and the many doctors and social 
workers with whom you dealt on the other hand.  This is equally not the forum to 
judge the conduct of the health professionals and social workers – save to the extent 
that the prosecution have made concessions in relation to it.  That said, the 
Prosecution accept that your perception and honestly held belief is an important 
 
feature in assessing the cumulative impact of what the doctors and social workers did 
on your state of mind and make two concessions to which I will return in due course. 
 
Against that background I find the following facts (of which I am, in fact, sure): 
 
You were born and brought up in South Africa and there is a history of psychiatric 
illness in your family – affecting your grandmother (who committed suicide) and your 
mother (who attempted suicide when your parents’ marriage ended). 
 
You had a lonely and unhappy childhood in consequence of which you learned to 
suppress your unhappy feelings and not to share them with others.  In consequence 
you developed a personality structure characterised by low self esteem, difficulty in 
forming close relationships and a feeling of being scarred emotionally by your 
childhood. 
 
Whilst you were at university in South Africa, and in an abusive relationship with a 
longstanding boyfriend, you suffered a depressive episode that lasted for about two 
years. 
 

 

2
--------
You met your now husband Gary in South Africa in 1994.  You married there in 1997 
and then came to this country - after which, in 1998, you suffered a second episode of 
depression that lasted for some months. 
 
In 2005, after some months of trying, you became pregnant and your daughter Taya 
was born on 21 April 2006. After suffering a number of miscarriages you became 
pregnant again in 2008 and your daughter Olivia was born on 15 June 2009.  Six 
months later you became pregnant again, this time with twin boys Max and Ben who 
were born prematurely at 26 weeks (and with other problems) on 19 July 2010 when 
you were on holiday with your husband and daughters in Portugal.  In the result, the 
twins remained in intensive care in Portugal until October 2010, and then in hospital 
in this country until November 2010. 
 
In the meanwhile, your husband’s parents had taken your daughters to South Africa 
where, in August 2010, it had been discovered that Olivia suffered from Spinal 
Muscular Atrophy (SMA) type 2 – which is the second most severe form of what is a 
genetic neurodegenerative disorder which leads to progressive muscle wasting, a high 
risk of fatal respiratory problems and considerably reduced life expectancy – albeit 
that, these days, people with type 2 can live into their teenage years or early 
adulthood.  By November 2010 it had been discovered that Ben and Max suffered 
from SMA type 2 as well.  
 
Thus when you all returned to your then small terraced house in Wandsworth that 
month you faced the enormous challenge of coping with four young children – three 
of whom had SMA and eventually needed wheelchairs. The prosecution accept that 
that you loved all four of your children – indeed there is a substantial body of 
evidence that they were happy and well looked after - and that you were grief stricken 
that Olivia Max and Ben were destined to die early and before you.  
 
The cycle soon began of hospital visits in relation to one or more of the children, and 
home visits by medics, health visitors, social workers and the like.  By May 2011, and 
despite help from excellent nannies, it was noted that you were seriously 
overstretched / under intolerable strain (due to the logistics of appointments, daily 
routine, emotional and practical difficulties etc – indeed that the practical as well as 
emotional difficulties that your family faced could not be underestimated). 
 
In July 2011 you and your husband spent all the money that you had, and all the 
money that you could borrow, on the purchase and adaptation of a house in New 
Malden to cater for all the needs of the children – in particular, there was wheelchair 
access and the ability to move around inside using a wheelchair.  You lived in rented 
accommodation until the adaptation of the house was completed in October 2012.  
You clearly and rightly appreciated the value and worth of the lives of the children, 
and wanted (for them) as normal a family life as could be achieved. You did not want 
either the house or the children to be institutionalised and later (once the children 
were of school age) you enjoyed a good relationship with their schools.  To that end 
your husband worked all hours to make the necessary money, and you devoted 
yourself entirely and ceaselessly to the care of the children. 
 

 

3
--------
In the meanwhile, you were noted as being depressed and concerns were raised about 
your psychiatric state.  In the spring of 2012 you described yourself as “struggling 
with life” but did not follow up the possibility of therapy. 
 
At the end of 2012 you were allocated an experienced social worker Suzie Holley 
who was a great help, and in January 2013 your GP noted that you were a caring and 
patient mother - albeit overwhelmed by the number of medical appointments that you 
had to attend and the number of medically related home visits 
 
In 2013 the relationship between you and your husband and many of the professionals 
who were involved with the children reached crisis point.  By that time there were 
something in the order of 60 professionals involved – who often descended in groups 
on your house, sometimes unannounced.  In the result you felt insecure and that your 
personal autonomy was compromised. 
 
In any event, you and your husband were intelligent people who did not always accept 
medical recommendations as you both believed in quality of life over longevity - 
which, the prosecution accept, was an entirely rational and tenable viewpoint. That 
said, both Dr Chesterman and Dr Joseph conclude that your approach could well have 
been influenced by your mental state.   On any view, it led to clashes with a number 
of the professionals. 
 
By way of example, in the spring of 2013 you and your husband had a short holiday, 
just the two of you, in Canada - which was the subject of controversy with some of 
the professionals.  On your return OIivia was ill and was hospitalised and (as the 
prosecution concede) you were wrongly accused of improper interference with the 
equipment being used to treat her.  You had, in fact, done nothing wrong at all. 
 
Thereafter a pattern emerged, if it did not exist already, of you and your husband 
needing to be persuaded of the worth of medical interventions; your husband 
representing the two of you at meetings with the professionals; and eventual 
agreement to most of the treatments that the professionals wished to conduct. 
 
In the year running up to the fatal events you spoke about killing yourself but not 
about harming the children.  A friend who saw you weekly thought that you looked 
worn out, but you never moaned.  You just got on with looking after the children. 
 
In February 2014 your experienced social worker Suzie Holley was replaced by an 
inexperienced colleague and resigned.  The prosecution concede that the decision to 
replace her was “perhaps ill conceived”.  In March 2014 you and your husband 
cancelled an intended short break in Budapest as Olivia was ill.  That same month you 
were visited twice by the new social worker.  On the second occasion, in particular, 
she sought (in the absence of your husband) to raise a number of difficult topics when, 
as the prosecution accept, it was “perhaps obvious” that just one of the topics would 
have been more than enough and “perhaps not surprising” that you were described as 
overwhelmed and tearful.  When asked you said that you always suffered from 
 
depression, but disagreed with medication as treatment. 
 
I accept Dr Chesterman’s opinion that your personality characteristics both made you 
more susceptible to develop a major depressive disorder and prevented the full extent 

 

4
--------
of the disorder being recognised by others; and that it is a feature of your depression 
that you have consistently minimised symptoms both before and since the fatal 
events.  As Dr Chesterman says, you devoted yourself to providing optimal care for 
your children – suppressing your feelings of distress and sadness by focussing on their 
needs.  However, your increasing distress when witnessing the various medical 
interventions that the children required, the prospect of the children requiring invasive 
procedures that you perceived would cause unnecessary suffering, and the constant 
demands placed upon you, in the absence of emotional support from others, 
eventually overwhelmed your psychological resources.  In the result you suffered the 
major depressive episode to which I have already referred - in consequence of which 
you perceived that the situation could only get progressively worse, and that there was 
little that you could do about it . 
 
As Dr Hopley, who has been responsible for your care in hospital put it, you were 
exposed to remarkably high chronic levels of physical and emotional stress arising 
from the complex needs of your family; you were effectively “exhausted and burnt-
out” in response to the extended period of caring for, and co-ordinating the care of, 
your children; for months prior to the fatal events you had not slept properly and your 
ability to make rational judgments became slowly but increasingly impaired. 
 
Your husband was away in America on a golf trip from 8 April this year.  He returned 
on Good Friday 18 April and departed that same day with your oldest daughter Taya 
for a short visit to South Africa.  Your long tern nanny Jade looked after the twins at 
her home from Good Friday to Easter Monday, whilst your mother and her partner 
visited you and Olivia. 
 
By the late evening of Easter Monday, which was Taya’s birthday, Jade had returned 
the twins to you – and thus you were alone with them and Olivia in the family home. 
 
I accept the sequence of events as described in detail by the prosecution during their 
opening – including the various things that you wrote both before and during the 
course of the fatal events, but I do not repeat it all given the evidence as to the effect 
upon you of doing so.  Dr Chesterman and Dr Joseph concur, and I accept, that what 
you wrote indicates the severity of your mental illness and that, in consequence of that 
mental illness, you perceived that you had no option but to commit suicide and to kill 
your children.  As Dr Chesterman puts it, the evidence indicates that you could not 
rationally consider alternative courses of action and formed the opinion that the only 
solution to your predicament was to kill your children and yourself.  
 
You did not reach a settled intention to do what you did until the fatal night.  To the 
extent that there was any planning it was clearly the product of your mental illness not 
of any culpable conduct over and above that illness. 
 
Nor, in my view, do your views as to the medical treatment of your children (whether 
formed rationally or resulting from your mental illness) add to you culpability. 
 
Nor was this a mercy killing in the sense in which that phrase is normally used.  The 
children did not ask to be killed, and you did not, and do not, seek to justify your 
actions as being justified in mercy.  What you did was the product of your mental 
illness. 

 

5
--------
I also reject the contention that your failure to obtain treatment for your depression 
adds to your culpability.  It was in part the product of your personality characteristics, 
in part the consequence of a laudable wish to battle on to give of your best for the 
sake of your children, and in part the consequence of your mental illness itself. 
 
Albeit that the various authorities to which I was referred are not on all fours with this 
 
case, I apply the principles that they set out.  In doing so I am conscious of the 
provisions of Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and of the likely sentence 
that you would have received if you had been found guilty of murder.  I am equally 
conscious that nothing that I can do can adequately reflect the worth of the lives of 
Olivia, Ben and Max - who were lovely children. 
 
As to the facts, I take into account that you have admitted killing three children 
(although the significance of that is, in my view, much minimised in the particular 
circumstances of this case); the fact that you intended to kill; the vulnerability of the 
victims, the objective abuse of your position of trust (albeit that it was a result of your 
mental illness), and that you have denied Taya a life with her siblings. 
 
On the other hand you were suffering from mental illness - a major depressive episode 
absent which you would not have harmed your children at all; you accepted 
responsibility at the scene and you are of previous good character. 
 
Weighing up all the various factors I have no hesitation in concluding that, in the very 
particular circumstances of this case, your responsibility and culpability were low.  As 
Dr Joseph put it, the link between the violence and your mental disorder was 
extremely strong.  
 
I am satisfied on the evidence of two registered medical practitioners that you are 
suffering from mental disorder which is of a nature or degree that makes it appropriate 
for you to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment and that appropriate medical 
treatment is available there.  Thus, having had regard to all the circumstances, and to 
the other available methods of dealing with you, I am of the opinion that the most 
suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of an order under s.37 of the 
1983 Act. 
 
Accordingly I propose to impose a Hospital Order on each count.  As I have already 
touched on you do not qualify for a Restriction Order.  However, you will not be 
released until you have recovered from your illness.

This  offender,  commonly  known  as  Max  Clifford,  was  convicted  after  a  trial  at 
Southwark Crown Court. He applies for leave to appeal against sentence, the matter 
having been referred by the Registrar to the full court. We grant leave.  

On 2nd May 2014 he was sentenced to a total of 8 years on eight counts of indecent 
assault contrary to s14(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. 

Those counts related to four victims. The anonymity provisions in relation to victims 
of sexual crime are in place, and we shall refer to the victims as B, C, D and E. The 
offences took place between 1977 and 1984.  

Counts 3-6 relate to B; these offences took place in 1977 and 1978. The appellant was 
 
sentenced to a total of 4 ½ years with 12 months for count 3, 18 months consecutive 
for count 4, 24  months consecutive for count 5, and 24 months concurrent for count 
6. 

Count 8 concerns victim C. A term of six months consecutive was imposed.  

Counts 9 and 10 concern the victim D. In all, 21 months consecutive was imposed, 
represented by 6 months on count 9, to run concurrently with 21 months on count 10.  

Count 11 concerns victim E. 15 months consecutive was imposed for this offence. 

In  addition  the  appellant  was  ordered  to  pay  £55,000  towards  the  costs  of  the 
prosecution. On counts 1, 2 and 7, relating to other alleged victims, the jury either 
disagreed or acquitted. 

Counts 3-6 

Counts 3-6 relate to victim B. She met the appellant whilst on holiday with her family 
 
in August 1977. The appellant told her and her family that she was pretty and that he 
could get her promotional work. Contact was maintained after their return to the UK. 
The appellant began grooming B telling her that she could be like Jodie Foster.  

On one occasion he pretended to be somebody else on the phone and made her repeat 
 
sexual words. He asked her to come to his office where he made her take off her bra 
 
and made derogatory comments about her breasts as she did so. He visited B’s home 
 
and gained the trust of her parents so that they agreed to let him take her out in his car. 
They believed that the appellant would take her to meet people who could help with 
her career, and he provided B with false stories about whom she had met to tell her 
 
parents. In all B went out in the car with him on about ten occasions.

The appellant would park in different places and abuse her in the car.  He showed her 
his erect penis and told her to masturbate him and indeed showed her how to do it. 
This conduct is reflected in count 3, it occurred on some seven occasions. 
  

Count  4  represents  an  occasion  when  the  appellant  penetrated  B’s  vagina  with  his 
fingers as she sat in the passenger seat of his car. There was also evidence that he had 
degraded her by taking her to buy a revealing bra and then taking her to visit the home 
of a friend, telling her to dress in bra and pants to seduce the friend whilst he watched.  

Count 5 and 6 represent the appellant making B perform oral sex on him. There were 
three  such  occasions,  and  counts  5  and  6  reflect  the  first  and  third.  The  appellant 
instructed B how to go about the task. On the second occasion the appellant told B 
that  a  photographer  had  been  in  some  bushes  and  taken  photographs  of  her 
performing oral sex. He said that the photographer wanted to publish the photographs 
but that he would be able to prevent that from happening. 

B was extremely distressed and thought her life was over. She said that she was going 
to kill herself. This was no idle threat. After she had said this the appellant stopped 
contacting and visiting B. 

The offences relating to B were the most serious on the indictment, she had only come 
forward after telling her sister and receiving protracted counselling. Her victim impact 
statement  showed  that  after  the  abuse  her  life  had  been  significantly  affected  in 
addition to the feelings of intimidation and fear which she had felt during the abuse. 

Count 8 

 
16.	 

C was aged 19 when she was contacted by the appellant in 1982 after being offered a 
part in a movie. He pretended she was suitable for a role in a Charles Bronson film 
 
and told her he would need to take some photographs of her in lingerie. He then took 
photographs of her in his office wearing lingerie and tried to persuade her to put her 
legs apart for the camera. He engineered a telephone conversation with C in which 
another person pretended to be Charles Bronson. He grabbed C around her shoulders 
and tried to kiss her upon the lips. She struggled and he pushed her onto a sofa and lay 
on  top  of  her  trying  to  kiss  her.  He  touched  her  legs  and  upper  body  during  the 
struggle. Eventually C escaped by kicking the appellant between the legs.  

Counts 9 and 10 

D was aged 16 or 17 when she was introduced to the appellant in 1982-3, after she 
was  told  that  he  could  assist  in  her  career.  He  arranged  to  meet  her  in  his  London 
office. When she came in, he locked the door behind her. He told her to take her dress 
off so that he could see her figure. She was reluctant to do so but after the appellant 
had spoken further to her, she ended up taking off her dress. He said he was turned on 
by her tights, and began to grope her. This conduct is reflected in count 9.  

As D was putting her dress back on, the appellant’s wife telephoned. As he spoke to 
his wife, he pulled his erect penis out in front of D and began masturbating. When the 
call was over, the appellant approached D and tried to force his penis into her mouth. 
He managed to get it part of the way in. The appellant ejaculated over D’s face and 
onto her shoulder.

The appellant then invited D to dinner with him and his wife and a third person, who 
he said would get her into a James Bond movie. The appellant told D that he wanted 
her to masturbate him under the table whilst he sat next to his wife. D left the office 
and  although  she  received  calls  regarding  the  dinner,  she  never  met  the  appellant 
again. Count 10 covers this conduct. 

 

Count 11 

 
20.	 

 
21.	 

E was 18 when she met the appellant in 1984; she was auditioning at a night club for a 
 
dancing job. The appellant approached her and asked if she was interested in acting. 
 
He told her he could get her a screen test for the new James Bond movie. He arranged 
for E to speak with the producer of the movie on the phone at the nightclub. Whoever 
she  spoke  to,  (certainly  not  the  producer),  said  that  she  could  have  the  part  on 
condition that she could establish whether the appellant was circumcised.  

The appellant then took E into the gentleman’s lavatory and locked the door. He put 
 
her hand on his penis and fondled her breasts whilst forcing her to masturbate him. 
Eventually he ejaculated and E made her escape and ran from the venue. As she was 
leaving  the  appellant  told  her  that  no  one  would  believe  her  in  a  way  which  made 
clear the she was not to tell anyone. 

The effect on the victims 

 

22.	  We have already described the effects of the offending against B. C, D and E also 
provided statements to the court. Each was young and vulnerable at the time. Each 
 
was affected in respect of confidence and relationships and was harmed by what had 
been done to her. We have considered each of the statements made by the four victims 
 
with  care.  As  s143(1)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  states,  in  considering  the 
seriousness of any offence the court must consider the offender’s culpability and any 
harm which the offence caused. Sexual offending will by its very nature cause harm at 
the  time  the  offence  is  committed,  but  it  is  well  recognised  that  for  many  victims 
significant harm persists for a considerable period afterwards. This is a case where it 
 
is clear that the effect of what was done to the victims was not something from which 
they recovered quickly. The appellant’s actions towards these victims had long term 
consequences  for  their  lives.  This  is  clearly  a  highly  material  circumstance  for  this 
court to consider. 

Aggravating features 

Looking  at  the  matter  in  the  round  we  identify  the  following  aggravating  features. 
There  were  four  girls  or  young  women  involved;  one  of  them  was  under  16.  The 
offending  took  place  over  a  period  of  several  years.  There  was  a  significant  age 
 
difference between the appellant and his victims. His offending involved an abuse of a 
powerful position coupled with deceit. In relation to B there was a clear abuse of trust 
and  grooming.  All  of  the  victims  were  affected  by  what  had  happened  to  them.  In 
relation to some counts there were findings of coercion.

The appellant’s character 

R V CLIFFORD 

 
24.	 

 
25.	 

 
26.	 

By the time of sentence the appellant was 71. When he offended he would have been 
in  his  mid  thirties  to  early  forties.  Thus,  there  was  a  significant  age  gap  between 
himself and his victims. The appellant had never been convicted of any other criminal 
offence and the trial did not reveal any other evidence of sexual offending after the 
period  with  which  the  counts  were  concerned.    Thus  there  was  a  period  of  nearly 
thirty  years  without  further  offending  before  these  matters  came  to  court  and  the 
 
appellant was convicted. 

Over  that  period  there  was  evidence  before  the  Judge  of  a  positive  nature  showing 
involvement in a variety of charitable works which the appellant had not publicised. 
The Judge also had a number of positive character references. 
  

It  is  clear,  however,  that  over  the  period  of  offending,  these  young  women  were 
 
targeted  by  the  appellant  who  actively  misled  them  and  exploited  their  desire  to 
succeed  in  their  careers  for  his  own  purposes.  The  appellant  was  a  dominant 
personality and in a powerful position within the world of entertainment and media. 
This  enabled  him  to  do  what  he  did  and  to  convince  the  victims  that  there  was  no 
point in complaining because no one would listen to them. He was thus able to lead a 
double life, progressing in his career, whilst his victims, affected by what he had done 
to them, felt powerless to complain.  

Mitigating Factors 

 
27.	 

The appellant lost potential credit by contesting the trial and in addition lost potential 
mitigation as he showed no remorse at any stage for what he had done. The fact that 
 
there had been a delay between his abuse of his victims and the matter coming to light 
is not a fact that avails him. His behaviour towards the victims coupled with his use of 
 
his  prominent  position  meant  that  the  delay  involved  was  substantially  of  his  own 
 
making. There is some mitigation available to the appellant based on the fact that he 
 
has not further offended since the mid 1980’s and that the judge accepted he had done 
considerable charitable work during that period. However, his claims to credit in this 
respect are much reduced by the fact that this was offending of a serious sort. It is a 
well established principle of sentencing that the mitigation of good character weighs 
 
less  in  the  scales  where  the  offending  is  serious.  The  appellant  is  71,  he  has  some 
 
health  difficulties  but  they  are  not  of  a  nature  significantly  to  affect  matters.  The 
appellant’s age is noted but does again, not carry significant weight in the context of 
this case. 

Grounds of Appeal 

The  overall  submission  made  by  Mr  Horwell  QC  is  that  the  sentence  of  8  years  is 
manifestly excessive. His arguments consist of a number of strands. It was pointed out 
 
that the maximum sentence available in this case for any count of indecent assault is 2 
years imprisonment. That was the case at the relevant time, although the maximum 
sentence  for  that  type  of  activity  was  subsequently  increased  by  Parliament.    It  is 
settled law that an offender is not to be sentenced on any count more severely than the 
maximum term available at the time of the commission of the offence. The increase in 
 
the  statutory  maximum  has  been  accompanied  by  the  development  of  sentencing

guidelines. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on sexual offences applies 
to the offences before the court. It came into effect on 1st April 2014. 

Against that background, Mr Horwell argues that for a number of reasons the judge’s 
 
approach to sentence resulted in an overall term which was too long. In particular, he 
submitted that the judge should not have  approached counts 5 and 6, involving the 
performing  of  oral  sex  as  being  the  equivalent  of  rape  offences  as  they  are  now 
understood.  Under  the  guidelines  they  carry  severe  sentences  with  a  maximum 
available of life imprisonment. A similar submission could have been made in relation 
to count 10.  The effect of this was unfair and disproportionate because of the very 
large  disparity  between  the  maximum  sentence  available  at  the  time  of  the 
commission of the offence and the maximum available for rape in modern times. 

30.	  Mr  Horwell  drew  attention  to  paragraph  3  of  Annex  B  of  the  definitive  guideline 

 

which states;  

“..the  court  should  have  regard  to  any  applicable  sentencing 
guidelines  for  equivalent  offences  under  the  Sexual  Offences 
Act 2003” 

 

His submission was that the reference to equivalent offences in the guidelines may have 
 
led the judge into error. Annex B of the guideline is very closely based on the principles 
enunciated by this court in R v H & Others (2012) 2 Cr App R (S) 21. It seems to us 
firstly that the words “should have regard to” are important in setting the reference to 
 
equivalent offences in context. Equally, paragraph 1 of Annex B which makes clear that 
the offender must be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing regime applicable at 
the  date  of  sentence,  and  paragraph  4  which  states  that  the  court  should  not  seek  to 
establish the likely sentence had the offender been convicted shortly after the date of 
the offence, provide additional context. Paragraph 4 goes on to state that the seriousness 
of the offence (having regard to the culpability of the offender and the harm done), is 
the  main  consideration.  The  guideline  is  not  seeking  to  impose  an  unthinking  and 
mechanistic search for equivalent offences under the 2003 Act. What is required is that 
sentencing  should  reflect  modern  attitudes,  (a  proposition  fully  accepted  by  Mr 
Horwell), in the course of which the court may take account of the modern guidelines. 
The way in which the matter is dealt with in R v H at paragraph 47 (a) pithily sums up 
the position. 

“Sentence will be imposed at the date of sentencing hearing, on 
the  basis  of  the  legislative  provisions  then  current,  and  by 
measured reference to any definitive guidelines relevant to the 
situation revealed by the established facts ” 

In our judgment Annex B of the guideline reflects that approach. 

In the circumstances of this case, the maximum sentence available on any individual 
count was markedly less than the maximum available for a number of offences under 
the 2003 Act, a fact of which the judge was perfectly aware. There was therefore, an 
inherent limitation on the count by count sentencing process which operated in favour 
of the appellant and operated as a counterbalance to higher figures in the guidelines.

In our view, the judge was entitled in the course of his sentencing remarks to observe 
 
that some of the offending would now be charged as offences as serious as rape or 
assault by penetration. 

The judge was entitled to draw attention in this way to the gravity of this offending by 
modern  standards,  which  are  to  be  reflected  if  old  offences  such  as  these  are 
sentenced in the present day. 

The  judge  might  more  profitably  have  drawn  attention  to  the  starting  points  for  a 
 
single offence of sexual assault or sexual activity with a child, which, on the facts of 
this  case,  would  under  the  guidelines  have  starting  points  of  4  and  5  years 
respectively, again substantially above the maximum available at the relevant time.  

It  must  be  recognised  in  any  event  that  the  judge  was  sentencing  in  relation  to  a 
 
multiplicity of incidents involving four different victims. Even with the limitations on 
the maximum sentence per count, the judge was entitled to structure his sentence by 
imposing consecutive sentences which would reflect the overall criminality involved 
according  to  modern  standards  and  attitudes.  Moreover,  the  use  of  consecutive 
sentences was consistent with the Sentencing Council’s guideline on totality (see page 
 
7). 

 

36.	  We are not persuaded that the reference to rape in regard to counts 5 and 6 distorted 
the sentencing process in the way asserted. The limited maximum sentences available 
coupled with the court’s ability to deal with a series of offences in the way described 
ensured this. 
 

A  further  submission  made  was  that  it  was  unfair  to  sentence  an  offender  more 
 
heavily  for  committing  an  offence  which  he  must  be  deemed  to  have  known  only 
carried  2  years  imprisonment  as  opposed  to  the  heavier  term  which  would  be 
 
available  for  a  comparable  offence  under  the  2003  Act.  The  court  should  have 
assessed the offender’s culpability by reference to the 2 year maximum. We find such 
a proposition unsustainable. Firstly, the judge could not pass a sentence greater than 2 
years  for  any  individual  offence;  secondly  the  suggestion  that  the  appellant  would 
have been prepared to commit this offence in the knowledge that the maximum was 2 
years  but  might  not  have  had  he  been  aware  of  a  higher  maximum  available  some 
 
years later is unreal. He deliberately committed these offences because he was sure he 
 
could get away with them, not because of some calculation as to the possible level of 
punishment. For a person like the appellant, the deterrent would be the possibility of 
exposure which he thought he had successfully guarded against, rather than the level 
 
of sentence available to the court. Moreover, it was no part of the appellant’s case that 
 
he would not have committed these offences, had he thought that a greater maximum 
level of penalty than 2 years would subsequently be enacted by Parliament. His case 
was a total denial of any misconduct. 

In written submissions it was tentatively suggested that there was a breach of Article 
7(1) ECHR. This was somewhat modified in oral submission to the argument that if 
the letter of Article 7 was not breached, its spirit was. There is no question of a breach 
of  Article  7  in  this  case  by  the  imposition  of  a  heavier  penalty  than  what  was 
applicable  at  the  time  the  offence  was  committed,  because  the  judge  in  no  case 
exceeded the maximum sentence available. See R (Uttley) v Secretary of State for the 
Home Department [2004] 1 WLR 2478, and R v H at paragraph 18. See also R v Bao

[2008]  2  Crim  App  R    (S)  10  in  relation  to  Article  7  and  the  use  of  sentencing 
 
guidelines which have become applicable by the date of sentence.  

 
39.	 

However, in an echo of his earlier submissions relating to the guidelines Mr Horwell 
invited  the  court  to  consider  that  if  an  offence  is  reclassified  by  statute  and  the 
maximum sentence is increased, then Article 7(1) is breached in fact or in spirit if the 
total sentence reflects a different offence and a higher maximum. 
  

 

40.	  We  do  not  accept  in  the  circumstances  there  is  a  breach  of  Article  7  or  anything 
approaching it. The court is entitled to reflect modern attitudes to historic offences, 
and  to  look  to  modern  sentencing  guidelines.  Where  the  court  looks  to  a  modern 
offence  containing  equivalent  elements  to  the  historic  offence  and  where  the 
maximum under the 2003 Act is significantly higher, then the task of the judge will be 
to  make  due  allowance  for  that.  That  is  why  the  phase  “have  regard  to”  is  used  in 
paragraph  3  of  Annex  B  to  the  guideline  and  why  in  R  v  H  the  court  spoke  of 
“measured  reference”  to  guidelines.  If  the  court  proceeds  in  this  way,  then  no 
complaint can be made. We find that there is no actual breach of Article 7(1), nor is 
there  any  breach  of  retrospectivity  principles.  The  matter  is  to  be  tested  by  a 
consideration  of  whether 
imposed  was  excessive  and 
disproportionate  for  the  offending  revealed  taking  into  account  modern  sentencing 
practice. 

the  overall  sentence 

 
41.	 

A further submission made was that in imposing terms of 2 years in relation to  counts 
5  and  6,  the  judge  imposed  the  maximum  available  in  circumstances  where  he 
 
acknowledged that neither offence was the gravest imaginable of their type. Thus it is 
 
said that the principle in Carroll [1995] 16 Crim App R (S) 488, that the maximum for 
 
any offence should be reserved for the most serious offences of its kind was breached.  

 

42.	  We  do  not  think  that  consideration  comes  into  play  in  this  case.  The  sentences 
imposed on counts 5 and 6 were in fact ordered to run concurrently with one another. 
Had the judge decided to impose consecutive sentences of 12 months on each count 
for the two offences that would have given the same overall sentence of 2 years but 
could  not  have  been  the  subject  of  any  legitimate  complaint  given  that  the  counts 
represented two distinct offences committed on separate occasions. We do not think 
there is any substance in this point, which merely reflects a choice as to the structure 
of the sentence legitimately open to the judge. 

 
43.	 

It is to be noted that with the exception of counts 5 and 6, the judge did not impose the 
maximum sentence on any count, and no criticism is made of the individual sentence 
on other counts. In relation to every count the judge respected the maximum available 
 
sentence  of  2  years  but  was  entitled  to  reflect  the  fact  that  different  victims  were 
involved  at  different  points  in  time  and  that  each  of  them  had  been  subjected  to 
significant sexual abuse. We are not persuaded that any of the grounds advanced by 
Mr Horwell concerning the approach to sentence are sustainable. 

 
44. 

That  however,  is  not  the  end  of  the  matter,  as  there  are  two  discrete  further  areas, 
which Mr Horwell says the judge fell into error during the sentencing process.

Bad Character evidence 

R V CLIFFORD 

 
45.	 

A  discrete  area  of  attack  by  Mr  Horwell  relates  to  the  judge’s  handling  of  bad 
character evidence which was admitted during the course of the trial. The evidence 
 
consisted of  a number of instances involving young women of a similar age to the 
victims in this case who gave evidence of sexual assaults of a similar type. The Crown 
had not included this bad character evidence in the indictment because it accepted it 
would  be  unable  to  prove  that  the  appellant  did  not  believe  that  any  of  the 
complainants  was  consenting  to  the  sexual  acts  that  took  place.  The  evidence  was 
admitted  to  rebut  his  defence  that  all  the  allegations  were  totally  untrue  and  to 
demonstrate a propensity on his part to commit the type of offences contained in the 
 
indictment.  In  addition,  the  judge  admitted  evidence  of  a  complaint  of  an  indecent 
assault on a 12 year old said to have taken place in Spain. That count would have been 
on the indictment, but for the fact that it could not be tried here until the coming into 
force of section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  

 

46.	  Mr Horwell complains that when the judge came to sentence the judge wrongly took 
this evidence into account in aggravation of the sentence. Page 9F of the transcript 
says 

“….so long as I am sure that the events took place, as I am, I 
can take them into account as far as the evidence informs me as 
to the offences for you are to be sentenced”. 

  

Later at page 15B he said: 

“I have already explained why I feel able to take into account 
as context to the offences which I am to sentence you for, the 
 
other matters about which the jury heard convincing evidence ” 

 

47.	  Mr Horwell relied on R v Canavan, Kidd and another [1998] 1 Cr App R (S) 243. In 
that  decision  the  court  held  that  where a  defendant  has  been  convicted  following  a 
 
trial  he  cannot  be  sentenced  for  conduct  which  has  not  formed,  expressly  or  by 
necessary implication, the subject of charges laid and proved against him. The only 
exception to this would be where a defendant has explicitly assented to counts on the 
indictment being treated as representative of a longer course of conduct. See R v BDG 
[2003] 1 Cr App R (S) 26. 

For the Crown Ms Cottage QC submitted that what the judge did was not improper; 
he  was  entitled  to  look  at  the  bad  character  material  as  context  and  background 
underlining the serious view to be taken of the predatory offences on the indictment. 
The judge was merely using the bad character evidence to underline the view he had 
taken of the indicted offences. He would still have passed the same sentence. 

A sentencing judge is of course entitled to take account of all the relevant aggravating 
and  mitigating  features  relating  to  the  offences  for  which  the  offender  is  to  be 
 
sentenced.  These  features  will  have  formed  part  of  the  evidence  in  the  case.  In 
 
addition, the judge is entitled to assess the offender as a person, taken together with 
other information such as material in psychiatric, pre-sentence or antecedents’ reports. 
Moreover, it seems to us that a judge would be entitled to draw on evidence given at 
 
the trial to reject unrealistic mitigation. See for example R v Twisse [2001] 2 Cr App

R V CLIFFORD 

R (S) 9; where an offender charged with a single count claims this was an isolated 
transaction, this may be rejected if the evidence establishes that this was not the case. 
The offender should be given the appropriate sentence for a single offence but without 
the credit he would receive if it were an isolated incident. That, however, is not the 
situation  here  since  no  unrealistic  mitigation  had  been  advanced  which  required 
rebuttal of this sort. The convictions on the counts on the indictment meant that the 
 
judge was well aware that there were multiple offences committed over a significant 
 
period of time by a predatory offender against a series of victims.  

The issue before us was considered in the case of Restivo which is reported as part of 
R v Oakes and Other [2013] 2 Cr App R (S) 22. In Restivo’s case, which involved a 
 
murder committed in 2002, similar fact evidence was admitted of a murder of another 
woman, which took place in Italy in 1993. Restivo was closely linked to that offence 
 
but by the time of the trial for the 2002 murder he had not been convicted of the 1993 
 
murder by an Italian court. Restivo was convicted of the 2002 murder, and in passing 
sentence the judge said that the evidence proved without doubt that Restivo was also 
guilty of the 1993 murder. Whilst he recognised that Restivo had not been convicted 
of that crime and would not sentence him in respect of it, he intended to approach 
sentence for the 2002 murder on the basis that Restivo had killed before. After taking 
into account the 1993 killing, he imposed a whole life order. 

The appeal raised the question as to whether in assessing the appropriate minimum 
term  the  judge  could  take  into  account  his  assessment  that  the  appellant  had 
committed a previous murder with which he had not been charged and of which he 
had not been convicted. At paragraph 79 Lord Judge CJ commented that a defendant 
 
cannot simply be sentenced for offences for which he has not been convicted, on the 
 
basis  that  he  has  in  fact  committed  them,  subject  to  certain  exceptions.  He  then 
continued: 

 
50.	 

 
51.	 

“…..the  ability  of  the  judge  to  make  findings  that  other 
offences  have  been  committed  does  not  extend  to  reaching  a 
non jury verdict about allegations put before the jury by way of 
similar  fact  evidence,  at  least  unless  the  jury  must  have  been 
satisfied  that  they  were  proved,  or  unless  the  defendant  has 
been convicted of them in the past.” 

 
52.	 

At paragraph 84 His Lordship continued 

“The  principle  is  clear.  Even  when  evidence  which  served  to 
 
establish  the  defendant’s  guilt  of  an  offence  charged  on  the 
indictment is deployed as similar fact evidence, the sentencing 
decision  cannot  proceed  on  the  basis  that  he  is  guilty  of  a 
 
distinct  and  separate  offence  of  which  he  has  not  been 
convicted and which he denies. Although we sympathise with 
the judge’s approach, it was inconsistent with what is now an 
axiomatic  principle  that,  subject  to  considerations  like  those 
 
identified  in  [79]  the  ambit  of  the  sentencing  decision  cannot 
extend  to  reflect  a  specific,  distinct  offence  of  which  the 
offender has not been convicted.""

53.	 

 
54.	 

In  the  present  case  the  judge  did  not  specifically  say  that  he  was  treating  the  bad 
character evidence as an aggravating feature; he said he would take it into account 
insofar  as  it  informed  him  as  to  the  offences  for  which  he  had  to  pass  sentence. 
However the judge had also said in terms that he rejected Mr Horwell’s submission 
that this behaviour should be ignored entirely in the sentencing exercise, and he did 
set  out  at  some  length  in  his  sentencing  remarks  the  details  of  the  bad  character 
 
evidence.  He  devoted  almost  as  much  time  to  that  as  he  did  to  the  counts  on  the 
indictment.  We  think  that  the  impression  given  must  have  been  that  the  judge 
regarded this evidence as aggravating the case to some extent, albeit he did not say so 
in terms. What he did not do was explain what place it had had in the case. If he had 
said that it confirmed that the appellant was a serial predatory offender who abused 
his position in order to offend, that could not have been criticised. However the judge 
did  not  say  that  or  anything  similar;  nor  did  he  make  clear  that  the  bad  character 
evidence would have no effect on the level of sentencing. 

 

 

In the circumstances we consider that the judge’s comments fell foul of the principle 
established in the case of Canavan and reiterated in subsequent decisions of this court 
including R v Hartley [2012] 1 Cr App R 7. However, it is clear to us that, working on 
the assumption that the judge did aggravate the sentence to some extent to reflect the 
 
bad character matters, he cannot have done so to any significant extent as the wording 
he used in passing sentence demonstrates. Having found that the judge was in error 
 
we have to approach the question of sentence afresh and consider whether it follows 
 
that the sentence passed was manifestly excessive. However before we do that, it is 
necessary to turn to another aspect of this appeal.  

The Appellant’s conduct surrounding the trial 

In passing sentence the judge referred to certain behaviour of the appellant. Some of it 
had been commented on in the victims’ impact statements. They had been upset by it. 
The  judge  said  that  the  “additional  element  of  trauma”  caused  by  the  applicant’s 
“contemptuous  attitude”  was  something  that  he  would  take  into  account  in  passing 
sentence. There were 3 specific matters identified by the judge. 

First, there was behaviour prior to the trial. This was identified by the Crown in the 
hearing  before  us  as  consisting  of  (i)  at  the  appellant’s  first  appearance  at  the 
Magistrates  Court  in  May  2013  the  appellant  informed  reporters  “this  has  been  a 
nightmare, I am totally innocent of these allegations … these allegations are without 
foundation”. (ii) Outside Southwark Crown Court on 4 October 2013 on the occasion 
of  the  PCMH  hearing  the  appellant  told  reporters  “I  am  totally  innocent  of  these 
charges from the seven anonymous women … I don’t think it is fair that they remain 
anonymous  because  their  accusations  are  so  damaging.  Just  the  accusations. 
Effectively, I have been punished since I was arrested last December in a very public 
fashion  while  they  remain  totally  anonymous”.  Both  these  statements  were  widely 
reported. 

The  Crown  said  that  these  can  only  have  been  intentional  statements  made  by 
 
someone skilled in using the media for his own purposes. Mr Horwell submits that 
there  was  nothing  objectionable  in  the  matters  relied  on.   In  Attorney  General’s 
Reference No. 38 of 2013 (Stuart Hall) 2014 1 Cr App R (S) 61, the Court recognised 
that public denunciations of allegations can amount to a seriously aggravating feature. 
In that case, Hall had publicly denounced his victims in particularly virulent terms. In

R V CLIFFORD 

the  present  case  we  do  not  regard  either  of  the  two  statements  made  as  being 
comparable. The first statement was a forceful claim of innocence reflected later in 
the defence advanced, but not directly referring to the victims. The second statement 
was a reiteration of innocence followed by a vehement complaint about the fact that 
the  victims  were  entitled  to  anonymity.  The  reiteration  of  innocence  again  did  not 
 
directly impugn the victims. The complaints about anonymity relate to a feature of the 
 
criminal process. They concern a topic which arouses public debate from time to time 
and  which  has  been  the  subject  of  different  views  in  Parliament  on  different 
 
occasions. 

 

58.	  Whilst we readily understand that victims who were eventually vindicated would find 
such comments upsetting, we think that great care needs to be  taken by sentencing 
courts  not  to  elevate  denials,  albeit  vehement,  into  something  deserving  of  further 
punishment in the absence of some more explicit traducing of the victim. The court, 
of  course,  is  perfectly  entitled  to  reflect  these  matters  in  withholding  available 
mitigation  since  the  offender  has  shown  no  sign  of  remorse.  Similarly,  an  offender 
who has contested the trial will lose what might be substantial credit for a guilty plea. 
We  think  that  these  remarks,  properly  considered,  would  of  course  justify  a 
withholding  of  mitigation,  but  they  should  not  have  been  used  by  way  of  positive 
aggravation. 

 

The second matter considered by the judge was what he described as “reports of your 
 
attitude during the trial, laughing and shaking your head in the dock at the accusations 
made  against  you”.  This  appears  to  derive  from  something  said  by  a  victim  in  her 
 
victim  impact  statement.  The  press  reports  themselves  were  never  put  before  the 
 
court; nor was there any verification of them. Neither counsel had any recollection of 
the judge commenting on the appellant’s conduct during the course of the trial. The 
 
only  occasion  that  either  could  recall  was  an  incident  whereby  a  witness  caused 
widespread laughter in court by derogatory comments about the appellant’s genitalia. 
We  note  that  the  judge  himself  made  no  finding  that  the  appellant  had  behaved  as 
 
alleged, he merely referred to the victim as being very upset by the press reports. In 
those  circumstances  we  think  there  is  justification  in  the  complaint  that  this  was  a 
matter which should not have been taken into account.  

The third matter related to an incident after verdict, but before sentencing, which the 
judge had himself witnessed on television. The appellant had apparently stood behind 
a TV reporter outside the court whilst the reporter was on camera, making gestures 
which mimicked the reporter’s actions. None of the victims had commented on this 
episode  in  their  witness  statements.  The  judge  had  regarded  this  behaviour  as 
 
something designed to trivialise the trial. Whilst many would describe such antics as 
ridiculous, there was no evidence that the victims were aware of this conduct and the 
matter had not been dealt with as a contempt of court.  

In the circumstances we do not think that this clowning should have been reflected in 
sentencing save in relation to withholding mitigation. 

Since the judge’s comments referred to an additional element of trauma caused by the 
matters we have analysed, it is clear that he must to some extent have regarded them 
as a factor increasing sentence. For the reasons given we do not think he was entitled 
 
to do so.

Conclusion 

R V CLIFFORD 

The findings above demonstrate that were two areas of the case in which the judge 
wrongly treated matters as impacting upon sentence. The question for us is whether, 
stripping  those  matters  out,  the  sentence  imposed  was  manifestly  excessive  as  Mr 
 
Horwell contends. 

These  were  offences  with  a  significant  number  of  aggravating  features  already 
identified, but including two victims abused to the extent of penetrative activity, and a 
gross abuse of power and influence. We have noted the ongoing and long term effects 
 
on all the victims.  

The  effects  on  B’s  life  have  been  particularly  serious.  The  offences  against  her 
involved breach of trust and penetrative activity on more than one occasion. She was 
 
only fifteen at the time. We do not consider that a sentence of 4 ½ years to reflect 
what was done to her and its effects is in any way open to criticism. 
  

As far as C is concerned, this was a unpleasant sexual assault on a different victim 
which was properly made the subject of a consecutive sentence of moderate length. 
As to D,  count 10 involved the partial forcing of the penis into the victim’s mouth 
followed by ejaculation. A further consecutive term was justified as it was in the case 
 
of E. 
 

It seems to us that, after consideration of the individual offences and the application 
of modern sentencing attitudes reflected in the guidelines, but tempered by the need to 
have regard to the statutory maximum available at the time, an overall sentence of 8 
years was justified and correct. We make this analysis without any reference to the 
factors  that  the  judge  wrongly  took  into  account.  Accordingly,  although  the  judge 
below  fell  into  error,  it  does  not  affect  what  was  in  fact  a  just  and  proportionate 
sentence;  taking  account  of  considerations  of  harm  and  culpability  together  with 
aggravating  factors  and  such  mitigation  as  was  available  to  the  appellant. 
Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.

Sentencing Remarks 

 

 
Mr Cornick, you may remain seated.   
 
 
Introduction 
These  sentencing  remarks  will  be  divided  into  seven 
 
sections.    The  first  three  sections  are  general.    They  will 
concern  the  victim,  Mrs  Ann  Maguire;  the  defendant, 
William  Cornick;  and  the  details  of  the  murder.    The 
remaining  four  sections  will  be  addressed  directly  to  the 
defendant  although  he  need  only  stand  for  the  last  one. 
 
They  concern  the  mechanics  of  the  sentence  that  I  am  to 
impose; the aggravating factors; the mitigating factors; and 
my conclusion as to the appropriate sentence.   
 
 
1. Mrs Ann Maguire 
Sometimes 
judge’s 
 
sentencing remarks in a murder case to focus on the victim. 
There  can  be  an  uncomfortable  tension  between  a  full 
explanation  of 
the 
defendant, and the court’s wish to describe the qualities of 
the  person  who  has  been  murdered,  in  order  to  give  a 
proper sense of the loss that the killing has caused.

--------
However,  no  such  difficulty  exists  here.  Ann  Maguire  was 
such  a  remarkable  person  that  it  is  only  right  that  I  start 
these observations by focussing on her personality and her 
achievements.  She  was  61  and  had  been  a  teacher  at 
Corpus  Christi  Catholic  College  in  Leeds  for  four  decades. 
 
She was genuinely loved by her pupils.  The court has seen 
today  some  of  the  interviews  with  those  children  who  had 
 
seen  her  murdered.    Notwithstanding  the  appalling  events 
 
that  they  had  recently  witnessed,  many  of  them  wanted  to 
say something about how wonderful Ann Maguire was, both 
as a teacher and as a person.   
 
 
Just by way of example, we heard one pupil describe her as 
“really  caring…she  sort  of  couldn’t  do  enough  for  people, 
she  was  just  really  lovely  to  everybody.”    Another  pupil 
described  her  as  “more  of  a  friend  than  a  teacher”.  And 
another,  when  asked  what  she  was  like,  said  “she  were 
wonderful.  She were just…she was so nice to everyone, she 
 
were  kind,  she’d  always  stay  back  late…her  main  goal  for 
everyone in that class, she just wanted them to come on top 
and  achieve  what  she  knew  they  could  achieve  and  you 
 
could tell she loved it.  You could tell that she loved doing 
what she were doing every day.” 
 
Similar  views  were  expressed  by  her  teaching  colleagues. 
Susan  Francis,  the  Head  of  Languages  at  the  school,  who 
 
bravely  intervened  during  the  attack  on  Ann  Maguire, 
described her as both “wonderful” and “fantastic”.  Another 

 

 

 

2
--------
teacher  at  the  school,  who  in  other  circumstances  might 
have  been  an  additional  victim  of  the  defendant,  described 
  
Ann  Maguire  as  “an  amazing  woman  and  teacher”. 
Numerous  people  have  spoken  about  how  much  she  loved 
her job and how much, in return, her pupils loved her. 
 
Her  family  have  given  moving  evidence  of  her  numerous 
qualities. 
 
Her brother in law Brian, described her as “a shining light. 
She  trod  her  own  path  and  lit  up  our  lives  in  so  many 
 
different ways.  She was a joy to be with.”  Another brother 
in law, Tom, described “her shining, fun, bright personality, 
which  drew  people  to  her  and  when  you  were  in  her 
company  you  always  felt  you  were  the  most  important 
person in her world.” 
 
Her sister Denise said that Ann was not just her big sister, 
but  was  “my  carer,  my  protector,  my  teacher,  my 
confidante, my role model, the person who inspired me most 
 
and in the last 20 years she became my best friend in life. 
 
Ann  was  genuinely  one  of 
life’s  beautiful,  selfless, 
extraordinary, kind people.  She radiated happiness, joy and 
 
positivity.  Her smile lit up the room and people wanted to 
be  around  her,  they  were  attracted  to  her  energy  and  zest 
for life.” 
 
And her daughter Emma said: 

 

3
--------
“She  was  a  wonderful  mother.    She  gave  us  so  much 
love.  I never felt alone in life…. She felt every up and 
down  with  me  and  perhaps  more  acutely.    She  was 
stronger  than  all  of  us  put  together  and  carried  us 
through  many  of  life’s  many  challenges.   She  was  an 
extraordinary person.” 

 
Given all of this, it is perhaps unsurprising that Leeds Town 
Hall  was  full  to  overflowing  for  Mrs  Maguire’s  memorial 
 
service on 29 September 2014. 
 
For those of us who never met Mrs Maguire or never had the 
good fortune to be taught by her, the devastation felt at her 
death is difficult to imagine.  But some sense at least of the 
pain and loss felt by her family can be found in their Victim 
Impact Statements.  It is impossible to do them full justice 
in  these  sentencing  remarks.  But  I  incorporate  into  them 
the following passages: 
 
Her sister Denise said: 

“I  am  overcome  with  an  overwhelming  sense  of  loss 
and injustice.  The fact [was] that Ann was at her place 
 
of  work  doing  her  job  in  order  to  improve  the  lives  of 
children,  stretching  them  to  achieve  the  best  results 
they  could  in  their  up  and  coming  exams,  and  she 
didn't come home, and never will again.  I’m haunted 
with thoughts that her life was taken in a place where 
 
she felt her safest, most comfortable, respected and in 
command.    I’m  angry  that  she  was  denied  the 
opportunity to enjoy the retirement she had worked so 
 
hard  for  and  was  so  deserved  of  after  41  years  of 
dedicated  service  as  a  public  servant.    I’m  angry  that 
she  will  never  meet  her  future  grandchildren  and  be 
able  to  nurture  and  guide  them the way she did with 

 

4
--------
all the other children that were an integral part of her 
life.” 

 
And her daughter, Emma, said: 

“There  are  many  milestones  she  will  miss  and  many 
that we will have to get through missing her.  We will 
no longer look forward to occasions, our loss shadows 
such  things.  No  birthday,  Christmas,  Mother’s  day, 
weekend  home  will  ever  be  the  same:  everything  is 
tainted now.  I just want to be able to talk to her.  She 
won’t see me get married or hold her first grandchild, 
this  part  of  her  life  was  all  still  to  come,  she  was  so 
looking forward to it.  She deserved to live.” 

 
 
Finally, there are the words of Ann’s husband, Don. 

“As  a  young  girl  Ann  visited  the  sick  and  helped  the 
 
elderly  in  her  local  community.    The  hundreds  or 
maybe  thousands  of  wonderful  tributes  paid  over  the 
 
months are testament to the person Ann Maguire.  The 
guidance  for  preparing  a  victim  impact  statement 
advises to avoid turning the victim of the crime into a 
kind of saint.  Such advice does not apply in this case. 
 
 
Ann was a beautiful vivacious, caring generous human 
being.  She was unique among peers and family.  We 
met and fell in love in the spring of 1972.  We were a 
very  quiet  private  couple  constantly  dreaming  of  a 
 
rural  backwater  but  the  world  seemed  to  shatter  our 
hopes at regular intervals.  Now all dreams have gone 
forever.  I am still a Dad but I cannot help my children 
understand; can’t help them come to terms; can’t help 
 
  Mummy  would  have  been  much 
lessen  the  pain.
I 
better.  I  can  no  longer  be  a  Dad.    I  fail  every  day.   
  
need Ann.  Parts of our lives have been brutally taken. 
The centre of our lives is missing.  Our very being has 
been  diminished.    Facing  the  world  is  very  difficult. 
Facing one’s self is very difficult.” 

 

5
--------
It  is  therefore  all  the  more  inexplicable  that  this  loved  and 
loving  woman  was  the  person  for  whom  William  Cornick 
conceived such an irrational and all-consuming hatred; the 
person that he planned to kill, and then killed – in a public 
 
place – in front of children – in such a brutal and cowardly 
way on 28th April 2014. 
 
 
2. William Cornick 
William  Cornick  was  born  on  26  June  1998,  so  he  was  in 
Year 11, and two months short of his 16th birthday when he 
 
killed  Ann  Maguire.  He  was  the  son  of  responsible  and 
caring  parents  and  his  family  life  was  marked  by  love  and 
support.  He was successful at school and was in his GCSE 
year,  having  already  taken  and  passed  five  exams  a  year 
 
early.  He  was  regarded  as  reserved,  but  amicable, 
 
enthusiastic,  and  a  conscientious  member  of  the  pupil 
 
group.  Although  he  was  diagnosed  with  diabetes  in  2010, 
 
which  meant  that  he  would  be  unable  to  pursue  an 
intended  career  in  the  army,  it  does  not  appear  that  this 
diagnosis had any other significant effect on his personality. 
 
However,  as  he  advanced  through  his  teenage  years,  it 
became apparent to some of his friends that his personality 
 
was  disturbed.    He  began  to  experience  increasing  feelings 
of  anger,  mainly  directed  at  Ann  Maguire,  and  all  of  them 
completely irrational.  He spoke to a number of his friends 
about  killing  her  and  at  least  one  other  teacher  at  the 
school.  He told them he had taken to carrying a knife and, 

 

    

 

6
--------
after  the  murder,  the  police  discovered  many  images  of 
knives  on  his  mobile  phone.    He  said  later  that  the  killing 
   
had been always on his mind for three years, since Year 8. 
 
By Christmas 2013 it was apparent to Mr Cornick’s mother 
that her son had a problem with Mrs Maguire, although she 
did not know that late on Christmas Eve, and into the early 
 
hours of Christmas Day, he was exchanging messages with 
a friend on Facebook in which he spoke of “brutally killing” 
Mrs  Maguire  and  then  spending  the  rest  of  his  life  in  jail. 
These  angry  feelings  led  to  a  confrontation  of  a  sort  with 
 
Mrs Maguire in February 2014 when the defendant’s hatred 
of his teacher was apparent to all those present at a meeting 
 
at  the  school.  He  was  placed  on  internal  exclusion  in 
consequence of his disrespect and rudeness.   
 
 
On  25  February  2014,  shortly  after  this  meeting  and  just 
two months before the killing, he sent a message to a friend 
on Facebook that said of Ann Maguire:  

 

 
“…the  one  absolute  fucking  bitch  that  deserves  more 
than  death  more  than  pain  torture  and  more  than 
anything that we can understand.” 

 
 
After  the  killing,  William  Cornick  was  the  subject  of 
extensive  psychiatric  and  psychological  examination.    The 
results  of  those  examinations  make  chilling  reading.    In 
particular: 
(a)	  Dr  Diggle  is  an  adolescent  clinical  psychologist.    He 
concluded  that  William  Cornick  generally  experiences 

 

 

7
--------
strong feelings of anger but there was little sign of that 
 
in  his  outward  presentation.  He  had  a  very  high 
to  experience  anger  without  specific 
disposition 
provocation  and  his  ability  to  manage  his  angry 
thoughts constructively was limited. 

 

(b)	  Dr Lengua, a consultant child and adolescent forensic 
 
psychiatrist,  described  William  Cornick’s  anger  as 
 
“premeditated  and  predatory”  and  that  one  of  the 
dangerous  aspects  of  his  personality  was  that  his 
outward  appearance  did  not  disclose  his  anger.    He 
 
concluded  that  the  defendant’s  actions  leading  up  to 
the  killing  of  Mrs  Maguire  were  “pre-planned,  goal 
   
directed, and in full knowledge that they were wrong.” 
He concluded that William Cornick posed an extremely 
high risk of serious violence and could not exclude the 
possibility that the defendant would kill again.   

 

(c)	  Dr  Kent  was  the  prosecution’s  leading  psychiatric 
 
expert.  He  concluded  that  William  Cornick  was  at 
 
least  of  average  intelligence  and  found  no  evidence  of 
any  thought  disorder,  psychotic  or  other  major 
 
psychiatric  illness.  Dr  Kent  said  that  the  defendant 
 
had an adjustment disorder (something with which Dr 
 
Lengua agreed) and that this affected the development 
 
of his personality at a time when he should have been 
developing and maturing into an independent person. 
He noted “a gross lack of empathy for his victim and a 
degree  of  callousness  rarely  seen  in  clinical  practice.” 
 
He  found  evidence  of  personality  disorder  with  some 

 

 

8
--------
marked psychopathic traits with a preoccupation with 
homicide.  He said he presented a risk of serious harm 
to  the  public  and  that  the  risk  was  immediate  and 
 
unpredictable,  and  could  cause  serious  and  lethal 
injury. 

 

 
There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  defendant  is  highly 
dangerous.  His  complete  lack  of  remorse,  which  is  a 
 
significant feature of all of the psychiatric and psychological 
 
evidence,  is  a  matter  to  which  I  will  return  later  in  these 
remarks.    For  completeness,  I  should  say  that  I  have  read 
all  the  reports  dealing  with  the  defendant,  including  the 
useful PSR from the Leeds Youth Offending Service. 
 
 
3. The Murder of Ann Maguire 
As I have already noted, the defendant had long planned to 
 
kill Ann Maguire.  To Dr Kent, he said that on Thursday, 24 
 
April, he had decided that he would kill her rather than kill 
himself.  He  said  he  knew  he was  going  to  kill  her  and  on 
 
the Sunday he decided that it was going to be with a knife, 
 
rather  than  the  other  options  that  he  had  considered, 
 
including a blunt object, a gun, and pushing her out of the 
window.    Despite  this  level  of  planning,  his  outward 
appearance  was  polite  and  happy  throughout  the  weekend 
of 26 and 27 April 2014. 
 
On the morning of Monday 28 April he went to school with 
two knives in his bag.  One was a large and heavy knife with 

 

9
--------
a cutting edge measuring 21cm in length and up to 4.5cm 
in width.  In addition to a smaller knife, he also had a bottle 
of  Jack  Daniels  with  which  he was going to celebrate after 
the killing. 
 
During that morning, he told a number of his fellow pupils 
that  he  intended  to  kill  Ann  Maguire  and  whilst  many  did 
not  take  him  seriously,  others  did,  and  at  one  point  he 
 
threatened  to  kill  anyone  who  revealed  his  plan.    It  was 
plain  that  he  was  excited  by  the  thought  of  what  he  was 
going  to  do.  He  told  at  least  one  other  pupil  that  he 
intended  to  kill  two  other  teachers  as  well,  including  a 
female teacher who was pregnant, and who he intended to 
stab in the stomach so as to kill her unborn child. 
 
The  attack  took  place  in  the  first  lesson  after  the  morning 
break,  just  after  11:30am.    William  Cornick  attended  Mrs 
 
Maguire’s  Spanish  lesson  in  classroom  T51.    Some  of  the 
class,  including  William  Cornick,  then  went  to  classroom 
T50 so they could work more productively.  There, William 
Cornick  showed  a  fellow  pupil  the  larger  of  the  two  knives 
and  experimented  with  where  to  conceal  it.    He  then  left 
that  classroom,  winking  at  his  classmate  as  he  left,  and 
   
went back to T51. 
 
 
Mrs  Maguire  was  at  her  desk  at  the  front  of  the  class, 
  She  was  leaning  away  from  William 
helping  a  pupil.
Cornick  when  he  entered  the  room.  William  Cornick 

 

10
--------
approached Mrs Maguire from behind and began to stab her 
in the neck and back from behind.  She was 5’2” and of slim 
build;  the  defendant  was  a  foot  taller  than  her  and  armed 
 
with  the  large  kitchen  knife  to  which  I  have  previously 
referred.  The  attack  was  relentless,  brutal  and  cowardly. 
Mrs Maguire fled but Cornick pursued her, stabbing her as 
   
she sought to escape him. 
 
Susan  Francis  came  out  of  an  adjacent  workroom  to  be 
confronted by a group of pupils running down the corridor, 
screaming in panic.  She saw Ann Maguire running towards 
her,  holding  the  back  of  her  neck  and  saying  “he  stabbed 
me in the neck”.  Susan Francis pushed Mrs Maguire into 
the workroom, and shut the door, courageously holding her 
foot  against  it  to  stop  the  defendant  coming  in.    Cornick 
then turned and walked away. 
 
 
He  went  back  to  the  classroom  he  had  left  and  sat  down 
next to his classmate as if nothing had happened.  He said 
he had stabbed Mrs Maguire, and added that it was a pity 
she was not dead.  He said out loud to the entire class “good 
times”,  and  spoke  of  an  adrenalin  rush.    The  evidence 
  
makes  clear  that  he  was  pleased  with  what  he  had  done. 
 
He  was  subsequently  taken  by  two  teachers  to  the  school 
 
foyer and they waited for the police to arrive.  Cornick talked 
to everyone as if nothing had happened and many of those 
 
involved were to speak later of his bizarre calmness and air 
of normality. 

 

11
--------
thereafter  regained  consciousness. 

 
Ann Maguire was still alive in the workroom. Susan Francis 
comforted her but was only too aware that she was probably 
 
dying, so she spoke to her about her children and the fact 
 
that  she  was  loved.  An  ambulance  was  called  but  on  the 
way  to  the  hospital  Mrs  Maguire  stopped  breathing  and 
never 
She  was 
pronounced  dead  at  Leeds  General  Infirmary  at  1:10in  the 
afternoon. 
 
The  subsequent  post  mortem  identified  that  she  had  been 
stabbed seven times to the upper back and neck.  One stab 
caused the knife to pass all the way through the lower neck 
and  another  severed  the  jugular  vein.    Two  other  stabs 
 
shattered  ribs  and  one  of  those  penetrated  her  right  lung. 
All  of  the  wounds  were  inflicted  from  behind  and  the 
pathologist  concluded  that  many  were  inflicted  with  severe 
force.  The  experienced  paramedic  who  attended  to  Mrs 
Maguire  described  the  stab  wounds  as  the  worst  she  had 
ever seen. 
 
 
4. The Mechanics of the Sentence 
 
William  Cornick,  you  may  remain  seated  but  the  following 
remarks are addressed directly to you. 
 
The sentence for murder is automatic: given your age, it is 
 
detention  during  Her  Majesty’s  pleasure.    That  is  an 

 

12
--------
indeterminate sentence; it is, to all intents and purposes, a 
life sentence. 
 
The  only  remaining  matter  for  me  is  to  fix  the  minimum 
term that you will serve.  I should make quite clear that this 
 
means what it says: it is the minimum period that you will 
 
serve  in  detention  before  you  are  even  considered  for 
release.  This minimum term cannot be reduced or changed 
 
or cut down in any way.  Moreover, after it has been served, 
there  is  no  guarantee  whatsoever  that  you  will  then  be 
 
released. You will only be released thereafter once the Parole 
Board  decides  that  you  no  longer  pose  a  danger  to  the 
public.  Given the psychiatric and psychological reports that 
I  have  read,  it  is  quite  possible  that  that  day  will  never 
come. 
 
 
Pursuant  to  paragraph  7  of  Schedule  21  of  the  Criminal 
Justice  Act  2003,  Parliament  has decided that the starting 
point for the minimum term for anyone under 18 convicted 
 
of murder, is 12 years.  Having adopted that as my starting 
 
point, as I am obliged to do, I then turn to the aggravating 
and mitigating factors. 
 
 
5. Aggravating Factors. 
In my view, there are seven significant aggravating factors. 
 
First,  there  is  your  extensive  premeditation  and  planning. 
You  decided  to  kill  Ann  Maguire  months  before  you  did  so 

 

 

13
--------
and you openly fantasised about it.  The plan to kill her was 
formulated  long  before  the  act  itself,  and  included  a 
consideration  of  possible  weapons  and  methods.  You 
eventually  decided  some  days  before  the  event  that  you 
would  stab  her  to  death  at  your  school.    You  took  two 
knives  with  you,  just  in  case.  In  every  respect,  this  was  a 
long way from a killing on the spur of the moment.   
 
Secondly, you took a knife to the classroom with the express 
purpose  of  killing  Mrs  Maguire.  If  you  were  over  18,  that 
would give rise to a starting point for the minimum term of 
25  years. 
I  do  not  agree  with  the  submission  that  a 
consideration  of  this  starting  point  is  wholly  irrelevant  to 
your sentencing exercise. Whilst, as I have said, it is not the 
 
applicable starting point in your case, its substantial length 
demonstrates  Parliament’s  intention  to  punish  severely 
those, like you, who take easily-available household knives 
to  the  scene  of  the  crime  in  order  to  carry  out  a  planned 
killing. 
 
 
Thirdly, Mrs Maguire plainly suffered before she died: death 
was not instantaneous and the severity of the stab wounds 
demonstrates the pain that she would have suffered before 
 
she  died.    Moreover,  it  is  plain  that  both  she  and  Susan 
Francis knew she was dying as she lay in the workroom.   
 
Fourthly,  Mrs  Maguire  was  a  teacher,  teaching  a  GCSE 
Spanish  class  at  a  well-known  and  well-respected  Leeds 

 

14
--------
school.  She was therefore fulfilling a public duty.  Teachers 
play  a  critical  role  in  our  society  and  are  in  an  important 
position of authority.  They are entitled to proper protection, 
and to expect that those who injure or kill their colleagues 
are dealt with severely by the courts.  
 
Fifthly,  this  was  a  killing  which  you  deliberately  chose  to 
commit  in  public.  You  killed  Mrs  Maguire  in  front  of  a 
 
classroom  of  horrified  15  and  16  year  olds.    The  damage 
done  to  them  is  incalculable.    Many  may  be  traumatised 
 
forever by what they saw. Your complete lack of empathy for 
them, your callous disregard for your classmates, is perhaps 
 
the  worst  single  element  in  this  catalogue  of  aggravating 
factors. 
 
 
Sixthly,  the  level  of  violence  was  savage  and  cowardly.  It 
was an attack on a petite woman in her 60’s by a strapping 
teenager  armed  with  a  large  knife.  It  was  carried  out  from 
behind.  It  was  a  sustained  attack  because  even  when  Mrs 
Maguire got away from you, you followed her and continued 
to stab her. 
 
  
Finally, you have shown a total and chilling lack of remorse. 
Your lack of remorse was made plain to both Dr Diggle and 
Dr Lengua.  And to Dr Kent, you said: 

I 
“I  knew  what  I  was  going  to  do;  it  was  what  I  did.   
said  I  was  going  to  do  other  stuff  but  I  never  got  the 
chance, other murders.  It was a triple homicide.  What 
I have done, I couldn’t give a shit…I wasn’t in shock, I 

 

15
--------
was happy.  I had a sense of pride.  I still do.  I know 
it’s  uncivilised  but  I  know  it’s  incredibly  instinctual 
and human.  Past generations of life, killing is a route 
of  survival. 
It’s  kill  or  be  killed.    I  did  not  have  a 
choice.  It was kill her or suicide.” 

 
When  asked  by  Dr  Kent  about  the  impact  of  the  killing  of 
Mrs Maguire’s family and on the wider community, you said 
“I  couldn’t  give  a  shit…I  know  the  victim’s  family  will  be 
upset but I don’t care.  In my eyes, everything I’ve done is 
fine and dandy.”  At one stage, you described Mrs Maguire 
as “barely human”.   
 
In my view, these remarks – your pride in what you did, and 
 
your complete lack of remorse – are truly grotesque, and a 
 
further significant aggravating factor which I must reflect in 
the sentence. 
 
In my view, these aggravating factors more than double the 
statutory  starting  point  of  12  years  and,  prior  to  any 
consideration  of  the  mitigating  factors,  would  lead  to  a 
minimum term of 25 years. 
 
 
6. Mitigating Factors 
In my view, there are three mitigating factors. 
 
First,  there  is  your  guilty  plea.    As  a  matter  of  law,  the 
 
maximum  credit  I  could  give  you  is  around  4  years  (one 
sixth of 25). However, whilst I agree that some credit is due 
  
for  your  plea,  I  do  not  think  that  it  can  be  the  maximum. 

 

16
--------
There were numerous witnesses to the murder itself, so you 
 
could not sensibly have denied the act of killing. And as to 
the mental element of the offence, the agreed position is that 
your  adjustment  disorder  cannot  affect  your  criminal 
 
culpability.  So  in  my  view  whilst  there  must  be  credit  for 
your  plea  –  which  on  any  view  was  early  –  should  be  no 
 
more than 2 years, thereby reducing the minimum term to 
23 years. 
 
 
Secondly, there is the adjustment disorder itself. Although, 
as I have said, it is properly accepted that this has no effect 
on your criminal culpability, it is not a condition for which 
you or your family can be blamed. I accept therefore that it 
is  a  mitigating  factor  and  should  have  some  effect  on  the 
minimum term. 
 
Thirdly,  I  accept  that,  because  you  were  15  years  and  10 
months  old  at  the  time  of  the  killing,  such  extreme  youth 
may not be fully accounted for in the 12 year starting point. 
That  applies  to  everyone  under  18,  and  so  could  therefore 
apply  to  somebody  two  years  older  than  you  were  at  the 
time of the killing.  In my view, these two further mitigating 
factors reduce the minimum term to one of 20 years.  
 
I should add that, having made a reduction for your youth, I 
consider that it is inappropriate to make a further reduction 
 
for  your  good  character,  which  is  principally  a  function  of 
your  youth.  And  whilst  I  have  considerable  sympathy  for 

 

17
--------
ignored  the  effect  of  your  crime  and 

your parents, who cannot be held responsible in any way for 
what  you  did,  and  whose  statements  demonstrate  the 
devastation  you  have  visited  on  them  too,  it  would  be 
inappropriate  to  reduce  the  term  further  because  of  the 
 
effect  a  lengthy  term  will  have  on  your  family.  That  was 
something  you  should  have  considered  before  you  decided 
to kill Mrs Maguire. Instead, just like your classmates, you 
completely 
its 
consequences  upon  them.  And  whilst  I  do  not  doubt  their 
ability  to  support  your  possible  reform  and  rehabilitation, 
 
ultimately  that  can  only  come  from  you.  Thus  far,  I  am 
 
bound  to  note  that  you  have  failed  to  show  any  signs  of 
either. 
 
 
The  three  mitigating  factors  which  I  accept,  when  taken 
together,  reduce  the  25  years  to  a  minimum  term  of  20 
years. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
William Cornick, stand up. 
 
 
For the murder of Ann Maguire, I sentence you to detention 
during Her Majesty’s pleasure.  The minimum term I impose 
is  one  of  20  years.    That  means  you  will  not  even  be 
 
considered  for  release  until  the  year  2034.  As  I  have  said, 
whether or not you are in fact released then will be a matter 
for  others.  The  time  that  you  have  spent  on  remand  will 

 

18
--------
count  towards  the  minimum  term.  The  Victim  surcharge 
applies. 
 
You must now go with the dock officer.

and 

JAMES MOSS 

 

SENTENCE 

 
1.

3. 

 
4. 

 

Philip  Spence:  you  have  been  convicted  by  a  jury  of  three  counts  of  attempted 
murder  which  you  carried  out  in  the  early  hours  of  6th  April  2014.    You  were 
responsible  for  a  sustained  attack  with  a  hammer  on  three  women  visiting  this 
country from the UAE who were staying at the Cumberland Hotel. 

The  ferocity  of  that  attack  was  such  that  you  left one  of  the  women,  Ahoud  Al-
Najjar so badly injured that she will never walk again unaided and it is unlikely that 
she  will  ever  get  back  more than  limited  movement  in  her  left  hand  sufficient to 
direct a motorised wheelchair.  She is blind in one eye; she will never have proper 
brain function and her power of expressive speech will be severely limited. 

Her sisters will also suffer long term consequences of your attack on them.  Fatima 
has  deafness  in  one  ear  and  suffers  from  severe  vertigo  and  dizziness,  facial  and 
skull pain, reduction in nerve and cognitive function, problems with her back and 
spine, and difficulties in sleeping.  Khuloud has a drooping right eyebrow and mid-
face droop, a deviation on opening her mouth, reduced power in one leg, weakness 
to one arm, dizziness, double-vision and loss of facial sensation. 

Whilst the evidence was not entirely clear, you seemed to suggest that it was Ahoud 
Al-Najjar who you attacked last.  It is clear from the evidence that she was lying 
down on the bed when you attacked her.  I can only assume, as the jury’s verdicts 
reflect, that you intended to kill her and her sisters so that there would be no adult 

1
--------
left to identify you as the burglar.  Further, it is a relevant factor that these attacks 
were  carried  out  in  the  presence  of  Khuloud’s  7,  10  and  12  year  old  children.  
Hardened  police  officers  and  paramedics  who  attended  the  scene  described  what 
they saw as horrendous and the worst they had come across in their careers.  The 
short term effects on the children who had to witness these attacks are set out in the 
victim impact statements which I have read; it is, however, impossible to say what 
long term effects this incident may have on the children.  

Both  you  and  Thomas  Efremi  have  been  convicted  of  conspiracy  to  commit 
aggravated burglary.  It became only too clear during the trial how the two of you 
relied on each other to get money to fund your shared drug habit.  Spence was the 
one who would go out and steal; you, Efremi, are not physically up to that due to 
your reduced mobility.   

As  you  admitted  to  the  police,  you  knew  that  Spence  was  a  “hotel  creeper”  a 
description of exactly the activity he was up to on 6th April – going from room to 
room at the hotel trying to find an open door and something to steal.  You also told 
the jury that you knew that Spence has stolen recently from the Cumberland Hotel 
and that he had a tendency to become aggressive. 

The  evidence  confirmed  that  in  the  past  you,  Spence,  had  gone  out  stealing  and 
brought things back to Efremi who would get a good price for them.  It seems that 
you  used  others  if  they  were  capable  of  giving  you  a  better  price  than  Efremi 
offered.  The evening of 5th to 6th April was just another example of the way you 
operated.  You, Efremi, provided Spence with the hammer knowing perfectly well 
that  he  would  use  it  if  the  need  arose  to  cause  injury  to,  or  to  incapacitate, 
anyone who got in the way of him stealing.  You also provided some of the 
clothes that he wore as well as an address at which to live. 

After  Spence had successfully carried out the burglary and was on his way 
back to your address, he telephoned you, Efremi, to tell you to get ready for 
his return.  Within minutes of his arrival you left with two of the stolen cards 
and the necessary PIN numbers.  Over the course of an hour you managed to 

2 

 
5. 

 
6. 

 
7. 

 
8.
--------
obtain  £5,000  in  cash.    You  both  realised  how  important  it  was  to  use  the 
cards before any block was put on them. 

Later  that  day  the  two  of  you  went  about  London  trying  to  find  the  right 
person to sell the jewellery and the electrical items to.  By 9.17am that same 
morning  you,  Spence,  had  taken  a  suitcase  of  stolen  items  to,  you,  James 
Moss.  There is evidence that shows that you, Moss, tested the stolen mobile 
phones that evening to see if they were in a condition to be sold on.  Clearly 
by then you knew that you were dealing in stolen property and at some time 
thereafter you realised that it came from the Cumberland Hotel burglary. 

On Tuesday 8th April you, Moss, received a text message from Spence which set out 
that he wanted his money because he was going to have to get out of the area.

11.  Handbags, some jewellery and Blackberry phones taken during the burglary 

together with the suitcase were subsequently found at your address, Moss.  

 
 
 
SENTENCE: PHILIP SPENCE 
12. 

I start from the position that it is nothing short of a miracle combined with the finest 
medical attention that has led to Ohoud Al-Najjar surviving the attack.  The attacks 
on Khuloud and Fatima Al-Najjar were equally  brutal but, fortunately, the effects 
were less traumatic.  Whatever sentence I impose cannot in the view of the family 
satisfactorily  compensate  for  or  reflect  sufficiently  the  injuries  you  inflicted  on 
those three women.  That said I have read the statements which have been made by 
Fatima and Khuloud Al-Najjar. 

 
13. 

 

Had any of them died, and had you been convicted of murder, then taking account 
of the fact that:- 
(a) 
(b) 

You took a hammer with you to the hotel to use as a weapon if needed, 
You used that weapon in committing the offences, 

3
--------
14. 

 
15. 

 

(c) 

To the extent that you planned the trip to the hotel to commit burglary and 
were ready to use the hammer if necessary, there was a significant degree of 
premeditation, 
There were three victims, and 
You committed these offences for financial gain 

(d) 
(e) 
 
Schedule  21  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003, on  convictions  for  murder,  would 
have led me to a starting point of 30 years and a minimum term above that starting 
point. 
 
I have to consider the guidelines on Attempted Murder.  It is accepted that you fall 
within  Level  1  of  the  guidelines  which  is  reserved  for  the  most  serious  offences 
including  those  which,  if  the  charge  had  been  murder,  would  come  within 
paragraphs 4 or 5 of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  Further you 
come into the top bracket within that range because your offending has caused long 
term  physical  and  psychological  harm  to  Ohoud  Al-Najjar.    For  a  first  time 
offender, which you are not, for a single offence, which this is not, the starting point 
would be 30 years’ imprisonment with a range between 27-35 years.   

The  guidelines  set  out  what  might  be  considered  as  matters  that  aggravate  the 
offending.  Many apply to you and are as follows:-  

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
(g) 

There were three victims of your attack 
The attack was witnessed by young children 
You  used  deliberate  and  gratuitous  violence,  over  and  above  what  was 
needed  to  carry  out  the  robbery.    Ohoud  was  hit  with  the  hammer  an 
absolute minimum of four times and more likely as many as seven whilst, 
according  to  the  evidence  of  the  experts,  she  was  lying  prone  on  the  bed 
with her head on her pillow.  The strong likelihood is that she was asleep or 
possibly just waking up when you attacked her and posed no threat to you. 
You did this for financial gain 
You were under the influence of drugs at the time you did it. 
The attack took place at night and in a hotel room. 
You have previous convictions for violence

--------
16. 

 
17. 

18. 

 
19. 

 
20. 

(h) 
(i) 

(j) 

You have failed to respond to previous sentences 
You got rid of the hammer at the hotel in an effort to conceal or dispose of 
the evidence 
You  sought  until  a  late  stage  to  blame  Efremi  for  the  attack  whilst  you 
watched him carry it out. 

I find there to be no mitigating features present.  Your late admission to carrying out 
the  attack only  came  about  because  you  were  faced  with  overwhelming  evidence 
which  showed that  Efremi  was  not there  and  that  you  alone  were  responsible  for 
carrying out the attack. 

I take into account the following personal mitigation:- 
(a) 

You have expressed through your advocate as best you can the remorse you 
feel for the injuries which you inflicted. 
The lack of support you had when you were a child and teenager. 

(b) 
 
Taking  the  facts  of  this  attack  on  three  women  together  with  your  previous 
convictions, I would be entitled to go outside the range set down in the guidelines.  
If I was to pass a determinate sentence the sentence would be one in excess of 35 
years. 

I have to consider the dangerousness provisions.  I have to decide whether there is a 
significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of  serious  harm  occasioned  by  the 
commission by you of further specified offences. 

I have no doubt that you had a difficult and disturbing childhood which you told the 
jury about and which is reflected in the psychiatric report I have read.  Whilst Dr 
Reid, the psychiatrist, finds that you suffer from a personality disorder, it is not of a 
nature  that  makes  you  liable  to  be  detained  in  hospital  for  medical  treatment.  
Looking at your background I find that:- 
(a) 

At the age of 8 you were permanently excluded from school for behavioural 
problems.  You attended a residential school in Northampton but left with no 
qualifications.  When you left there, your parents decided it was best if you 
lived in a hostel rather than with them.  

 

5
--------
(b) 

(c) 

 

You  began  using  cannabis  when  you  were  11  and  by  the  age  of  18  were 
addicted to crack cocaine and heroin.  You funded that habit by stealing.  In 
June 2005 you stopped using drugs and kept clear of them for 6 years but 
relapsed in 2011/12.   
You have 37 convictions  for 62 offences.  They  include  numerous violent 
offences.  Dr Reid is of the opinion that the acts of violence are not related 
to symptoms of psychotic illness but occurred impulsively.  He suggests that 
you  suffer  from  a  propensity  to  attribute  paranoid  explanations  on  other 
people’s behaviour.   The nature of those previous incidents are as follows:- 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

(h) 

In  2007  you  punched  a  woman  at  the  council  offices  because  she 
would not deal with your request. 
In November 2007 you chased your landlord with a hammer when he 
walked off without having repaired something which  you had been 
waiting for him to do. 
In  2010  you  threatened  to  kill  a  man  by  stabbing  him  when  you 
refused to meet him.   
In April 2011 you attacked a passer by, kicking a box at him, spitting 
at him, punching him and biting him on the shoulder. 
In  May  2011  you  threw  a  glass  across  the  room  and  told  a 
member of staff at the hostel not mess around with you. 

(i)  When  you  were  arrested  for  these  offences  you  made  several 

threats of violence towards the police. 

You accepted when you gave evidence that, lying behind those convictions, is the 
fact that you have a temper and tend to be over-explosive and react completely out 
of proportion to what has caused the loss of temper.  When you spoke to Dr Larsen 
and Dr Marriot in August 2014 you said that you had difficulty in controlling your 
anger. 

In  his  report  Dr  Reid  set  out  that,  when  you  described  these  incidents  to  him, 
although  you  recognized  that  you  were  wrong to  have  acted  as you  did  you  also 
expressed a sense that you felt your actions were justified.  

6 

 
21. 

 
22.
--------
23.  When  you  gave  evidence  in  the  trial  you  were  given  a  rolled  up  magazine  to 
represent  the  hammer  you  had  with  you  on  the  night  so that  you  might  use  it to 
show the jury what you did with it.  You then threw it towards prosecuting counsel 
acknowledging that you wanted, in effect, to throw a hammer at counsel. 

 
24. 

 
25. 

 
26. 

 
27. 

 
28. 
 

 

You  have  been  found  guilty  of  committing  specified  offences  under  the  Act.  
Having considered all that I know about you and all that I have seen of you during 
the trial, I am sure that you represent a significant risk to members of the public of 
serious  harm  occasioned  by  the  commission  by  you  of  further  specified  offences 
and it follows that the dangerousness provisions apply. 

The offences of attempted murder are punishable with life imprisonment and in my 
judgment the seriousness of the three offences of attempted murder taken together is 
such as to justify a sentence of life imprisonment, and that is the sentence I pass. 

Having  considered  recent  guidance  from  the  Court  of  Appeal  together  with  the 
relevant  Practice  Direction  and  having  regard  to  other  background  matters,  your 
offending  does  not  come  within  the  very  exceptional  class  of  cases  where  you 
should serve the rest of your life in custody.  

I  shall  pass  identical  sentences  for  each  count  of  attempted  murder,  each  one 
reflecting the totality of your conduct.  On the charges of attempted murder, Counts 
1-3 on the indictment, I sentence you to life imprisonment on each concurrently.  I 
have to set the minimum period which you should spend in custody before you are 
considered by the Parole Board which has to be half the length of any determinate 
sentence I would have imposed.  It does not mean that you will be released at that 
point,  only  that  you  will  be  eligible  for  release  subject  to  the  Parole  Board’s 
recommendations.  If I had not passed a sentence of life imprisonment I would have 
imposed a sentence of 36 years.  Half of that is 18 years, and that it the period which 
you will serve before being considered for parole. 

I impose no separate penalty on counts 4 and 5, and counts 8 to 10. 

7
--------
The  days  which  you  have  spent  on  remand  in  custody  will  automatically  count 
towards your sentence.   

The  surcharge  provisions  apply  to  this  case  and  the  order  will  be  drawn  up 
accordingly. 

I direct that a copy of Dr Reid’s report accompany Spence to prison where he will 
serve his sentence and that particular regard be had to the observations in §10 of his 
conclusions on the last page of the report.

SENTENCE: THOMAS EFREMI 
32. 

I have to consider the dangerousness provisions, the offence of aggravated burglary 
being  a  serious  specified  offence  for  the  purposes  of  the  legislation.    I  have  to 
decide whether there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm 
occasioned by the commission by you of further specified offences. 

 
33. 

 
34. 

 
35. 

 

You, Efremi, have 19 previous convictions for 27 offences for possession of drugs, 
handling stolen goods, theft and deception; the only offence involving any violence 
is  reflected  in  your  first  conviction,  when  you  were  aged  just  17  which  was  for 
assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  Leaving aside the responsibility you share 
for what happened on the night of 6th April 2014, there is nothing known about you 
which could lead me to conclude that you pose a significant risk and I will not apply 
the dangerousness provisions in your case. 

I turn  to the  Sentencing  Guidelines.    It  is  accepted  that  your  offending  falls  into 
Category 1 of the Guidelines, features implying greater harm and higher culpability 
being  present,  which  gives  me  a  starting  point  of  10  years’  imprisonment  and  a 
range of 9 to 13 years.   

I consider that the following factors increase seriousness 

8
--------
(a) 

(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 

Your previous convictions for offences of dishonesty which I must balance 
against  the  fact  that  you  have  no  previous  conviction  for  aggravated 
burglary, 
The presence of children when the offence was committed, 
It took place at night, 
You were under the influence of drugs, and 
The reputational effect on London as a centre for tourism 

Your counsel has suggested that I should not have regard to the presence of children 
or the effect on London as a tourist destination.  I reject that submission because I 
judge that you knew that Spence was going to a hotel that night and it follows that 
you took the risk that children would be present in any room he decided to burgle 
and that the victims of the attack would have come from abroad.   

I take as  factors which  indicate a  lower culpability that  you played a subordinate 
rôle in the offence and your determination to address your addiction. 

It  is  submitted  on  your  behalf  that  you  could  not  have  anticipated  the  level  of 
violence  that  was  in  fact  used  by  Spence  that  night.    I  judge  that  you  knew  that 
Spence was also under the influence of drugs when he left your address that night; 
you  knew  Spence  was  armed  with  a  hammer  and,  in  accordance  with  the  jury’s 
verdict, that he intended to use it to cause injury to, or to incapacitate, a person 
in those rooms if the need arose.  Serious injury must have been contemplated 
by  you  although  I  accept  that  you  may  not  have  contemplated  the  precise 
nature of the acts that were in fact committed by Spence.  That I will take into 
account. 

The maximum sentence for this offence is one of life imprisonment and I judge that 
the  serious  nature  of  this  offence  and  your  understanding  of  the  potential 
consequences  of  what  Spence  might  do  together  with  your  previous  convictions 
takes the sentence in your case above the range set out in the guidelines.

I must also sentence you for fraud to which you pleaded guilty on 3rd July 2014.  It 
is in reality part and parcel of the offence of aggravated burglary of which you have 
been  convicted.    Going  out  to  obtain  money  on  the  cards  stolen  during  the 
aggravated robbery just reflects your active involvement in turning the proceeds of 
the burglary into cash.  I take that into account in assessing the appropriate sentence 
for the conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and the sentence on count 6 will 
have  regard  to  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  but  will  run  concurrently  with  your 
sentence on Count 4. 

I take into account the following personal mitigation:- 
(a) 
(b) 

Your domestic background. 
You have  managed to tackle  your drug problem  whilst in prison and have 
expressed  a  desire  to  remain  off  drugs  for  ever.    That  is  a  substantial 
achievement. 
That you have been a model prisoner and have now obtained the status of a 
pier supporter. 
Your medical condition. 
The  horror  you  have  expressed  at  the  full  measure  of  the  injuries  which 
Spence caused that night. 

(c) 

(d) 
(e) 

 
The offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified and the least 
possible  sentence  I  can  impose  having  regard  to  the  aggravating  and  mitigating 
factors of the case which I have set out together with everything that your counsel 
has said on your behalf and everything I know about you, is as follows:- 

You will go to prison for 14 years on Count 4 and for 2 years 3 months on Count 6 
concurrently making a total of 14 years. 

You will serve up to one half of your sentence in custody before you are released on 
licence; you must abide by the terms of the licence and commit no further offence 
or  you  will  be  liable  to  be  recalled  and  you  will then  serve  the  remainder  of  the 
sentence in custody.

46. 

The  days  which  you  have  spent  on  remand  in  custody  will  automatically  count 
towards your sentence.   

The  surcharge  provisions  apply  to  this  case  and  the  order  will  be  drawn  up 
accordingly. 

 
 
SENTENCE: JAMES MOSS 
47. 

On  1st  October  you  pleaded  guilty  to  handling  stolen  goods.    Although  it  is 
suggested that you had indicated a plea at an earlier stage, no plea was entered and, 
it seems to me, was a conditional plea in any event.  The appropriate discount for 
your plea is one of 10%. 

 
48. 

 
49. 

 

 
 
50. 

 

You  have  19  convictions  for  22  offences  stretching  back  to  1993  for theft, other 
offences  of  dishonesty  including  robbery  and  burglary,  criminal  damage  and 
possession of a firearm without a certificate.  You have been out of trouble since 
2004.   That offence  was  one  of  burglary  which  you  committed  in  company  with 
Spence and for which you received a community rehabilitation order. 

There  are  no  Sentencing  Guidelines  in  respect  of  an  offence  of  handling  stolen 
goods but I have considered the guidance in R. v. Webbe [2002] 1 Cr. App. R.(S) 
22.   The following aggravating factors are present: 

(a) 
(b) 
(c) 

You received the goods within hours of the burglary. 
The particular seriousness of the primary offence of burglary. 
You  kept  them  after  you  knew  where  they  had  come  from  and  in  what 
circumstances they had been taken. 

I take into account the following personal mitigation:- 
(a) 

You  have  worked  hard  during  your  life  and  have  taken  opportunities  to 
improve  your  education  and, therefore, the  circumstances  for  your  family.  
That culminated in obtaining a B.A. in 2008 in Arts and Design. 
You remained out of trouble from 2004 until this matter  

(b) 

11
--------
(c) 

(d) 

You  have  a  son  who  was  born  in  2001  and  you  assist  in  his  care  and 
upbringing. 
The  character  references  which  I  have  read  which  set  out  your  skills  and 
abilities in particular with computer aided design. 

 
 
I accept that you have been unfortunate in the company you have kept and I accept 
that you have made significant efforts to keep away from Spence and to remain out 
of trouble.   

In my opinion, your offence is so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community 
sentence can be justified for it. 

I am therefore going to pass a sentence of imprisonment.  This will be the shortest 
which in my opinion matches the seriousness of your offence and takes into account 
the mitigating factors in your case which I have set out and all that your counsel has 
said on your behalf.  

51. 

 
52. 

 
53. 

 
54.  On Count 7 I sentence you to 21 months imprisonment  
 
55. 

The sentence of 21  months will  be suspended  for 2 years. This  is the operational 
period of the sentence and if in the next 2 years you commit any offence you will be 
brought back to court and you will be liable to serve the sentence.

57. 

 

In addition I attach a curfew requirement to the order.  For the next four months you 
will remain at 28A Hanley Road between the hours of 8pm and 6am.  This will be 
electronically monitored. 

The  surcharge  provisions  apply  to  this  case  and  the  order  will  be  drawn  up 
accordingly.

Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh
 

 

7 November 2014 
 

 
 
[The defendant may remain seated for the time being.] 
 
Introduction 
 
 
 
1.	 

On  2  October  2014  you  were  convicted  by  the  jury,  on  count  1  of  the 
indictment, of acquiring a biological toxin, namely Abrin, contrary to section 1 
of the Biological Weapons Act 1974.  The offence occurred in the early part of 
December 2013. 

 
 
2.	 

 
 
3.	 

You had previously pleaded guilty, on count 2, to attempting to obtain Abrin 
in relation to the same event.  It is common ground before me that that offence 
 
is  subsumed  within  the  substantive  offence  of  which  you  have  now  been 
convicted by the jury.  Accordingly, I direct that count 2 should lie on the file.  

On 15 September 2014, a week before the scheduled start of your trial, you 
changed your plea on count 4 and also pleaded guilty to a second offence of 
attempting to obtain Abrin in late December 2013 and January 2014.   

 
 
Factual background 
 
 
 
4.	 

In the autumn of 2013 you made contact with a dealer in the USA called Jesse 
 
Korff, who was operating on an illicit website called Black Market Reloaded. 
 
He was known on the website as Snowman and was prepared to sell highly 
dangerous  toxins  such  as  Ricin.    In  order  to  proceed  with  your  purchase  of 
Abrin you had to create a bitcoin account to pay Jesse Korff approximately 
 

 

1
--------
£950.  You  also  had  to  create  encrypted  accounts  in  order  to  communicate 
with him in a way which you hoped could not be detected by the authorities.   

You arranged for the package to be delivered from the USA to the address of a 
 
good  friend  of  yours  (Julie  Wong).    The  package  arrived  on  10  December 
2013.  Because Julie Wong was not at home the package was signed for by a 
neighbour of hers, who gave it to her later that day.  You collected the package 
from Julie Wong on the following day.  

You then took it home and opened the package using a plastic carrier bag to 
protect your hands.  You found what appeared to be a fragrance candle in a 
glass jar.  The candle contained a phial of Abrin.  That was the usual method 
which Jesse Korff used, as can be seen from other samples he sent at about the 
same time.  The glass in which the candle was set was broken.  You panicked 
and threw away the package in the wheelie bin outside your house. It was then 
removed in the ordinary way by refuse collectors.  It has never been recovered, 
so it is not known exactly what quantity and quality the Abrin was. 

Abrin is a highly toxic substance, which can prove lethal, in particular if it is 
inhaled or injected.  There is no known antidote to it. 

Although initially you were relieved to have rid yourself of the package, over 
the next few weeks you again began to want to acquire Abrin.  You accept that 
you attempted to acquire it for a second time in late December and January.   

 

In  fact  Jesse  Korff  was  arrested  by  the  American  authorities  on  18  January 
2014.  They proceeded to engage in communication with you pretending to be 
Jesse Korff for a few days.  You were still trying to obtain Abrin although it is 
clear that it would not have been sent to you by this time.   

The reason why you obtained Abrin on the first occasion and the reason why 
you attempted to obtain it for a second time was that you had descended into 
such a depressed state of mind that you were contemplating either suicide or 
killing your mother, Meena Patel.

Approach to sentence in cases of this type 
 
 
 
11.	 

The  maximum  sentence  for  each  of  the  offences  concerned  is  life 
imprisonment.

So far as counsel are aware, this is the first case in which a court has had to 
sentence  for  an  offence  under  the  Biological  Weapons  Act.    There  are  no 
 
guidelines  issued  by  the  Sentencing  Council  or  guidance  from  the  Court  of 
Appeal about such cases. 
 

As  is  well  known  the  Court  must  have  regard  to  the  following  purposes  of 
sentencing in accordance with section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003: 

a)  the punishment of offenders; 

b)  the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence); 

c)  the reform and rehabilitation of offenders; 

d)  the protection of the public; and 

e)  the making of reparation. 


 
 
 
 
 

As is also well known, in accordance with section 153 of the same Act, any 
 
custodial  sentence  must  be  for  the  shortest  term  that  in  the  opinion  of  the 
Court is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence or the combination 
of the offence and other offences associated with it. 

A number of cases have been brought to my attention but none deals directly 
with the present type of case.  Most were examples of sentences which have 
been  passed  at  first  instance.    Two  are  decisions  of  the  Court  of  Appeal.  It 
seems to me that all those cases turned on their own facts in their own context. 
 
In  particular  I  take  the  view  that  little  assistance  can  be  derived  from  cases 
which occurred in the context of terrorism or other offences with a political 
motivation. 

In the end, in my view, this sentencing exercise, perhaps even more than most, 
must  depend  on  the  specific  facts  of  the  individual  case  before  the  Court, 

3
--------
having regard both to the gravity of the offences and the mitigating factors in 
 
this particular case. 

 
 

 
Gravity of the offences 

 
 
17.	 

 

 
 
18.	 

 
 
19.	 

 

 

The  Prosecution  submitted  before  me  that  there  were  several  aggravating 
features  in  this  case.    On  your  behalf  it  was  submitted  that  there  were  no 
aggravating features and that there is a risk of “double counting”, since certain 
features  of  the  case  are  inherent  in  an  offence  of  this  type.    Taking  care  to 
avoid the risk of double counting, and however they are described, there were, 
in my view, the following features in this case which go to the gravity of the 
offences you committed: 

 
a)  There was a substantial degree of premeditation and research required 

 

over a period of time. 

 
b)  You committed two offences, which shows that you were prepared to 

 

persist in trying to obtain Abrin, having thrown it away the first time. 

 

 
c)  You used encryption online in order to conceal the commission of your 
offences.  You  also  lied  to  the  police  initially  about  this  in  order  to 
throw them off the track. 

d)  You deliberately involved an innocent third party (Julie Wong), who 

 

fell under suspicion. 

 

 
e)  There  was  obvious  risk  to  other  innocent  third  parties  who  had  to 
handle the package in its importation from the USA to this country and 
its delivery through the ordinary post. 

The fact is that Abrin is a highly dangerous substance which Parliament has 
 
prescribed  should  simply  not  be  in  general  circulation.    Acquiring  it  is 
inherently a serious offence. 

 
However  in  my  view  there  is  powerful  personal  mitigation  in  this  case,  to 
which I now turn. 

4
--------
Mitigating factors 
 
 
 
20.	 

You are aged 37 and of previous good character.  You have worked hard both 
in higher education and in your profession as a graphic designer throughout 
your adult life. 

 
 
21.	 

 
 
22.	 

 

In my view you had to endure a prolonged period of severe stress in the two 
years leading up to your offences.  The jury at your trial heard a great deal of 
evidence about that background and in particular your relationship with your 
mother.  It is clear that you were a devoted and obedient daughter.  It is also 
clear that your mother was a devoted and caring mother, who worked hard to 
 
raise you and your sister, having been separated from your father when you 
 
were very young.  On the other hand, in the two year period leading up to your 
 
offences, she subjected you to a barrage of abuse, often verbal and at times 
physical, for example slapping you.  She would send you emails and texts of 
the most vile kind, abusing not only you but also your friends and in particular 
the man you wished to marry.  You found yourself in the autumn of 2013 torn 
between your devotion to your mother and family as a dutiful daughter, and 
your  desire  to  find  happiness  for  yourself  with  the  man  that  you  wanted  to 
spend  a  lifetime  with.    Ultimately  you  could  see  no  way  out  and  became 
increasingly  depressed  and  isolated,  contemplating  killing  your  mother  and 
yourself. 

I have taken into account everything else that has been said on your behalf in 
mitigation, including positive references as to your kind and helpful character, 
and the fact that you and your mother have now become reconciled. 

 
 
 
Guilty plea 
 
 
23.	 

As  I  have  mentioned,  you  pleaded  guilty  to  count  4  and  will  be  given 
appropriate  credit  for  that.  This  count  was  added  to  the  indictment  the  day 
 
before the plea and case management hearing (PCMH) on 2 May 2014.  I am 
informed  that  there  were  difficulties  obtaining  instructions  and  that  you 

 

5
--------
changed your plea as soon as reasonably practicable.  I am therefore invited to 
treat  that  plea  in  the  same  way  as  if  you  had  pleaded  guilty  at  the  PCMH, 
which would normally attract a reduction of 25%.  I accept that submission. 

 
 
 
The principle of totality 
 
 
24.	 

I bear in mind that I have to sentence you for two offences.  However, in my 
 
view,  the  appropriate  course  in  this  case  would  be  to  make  your  sentences 
concurrent  with  each  other,  having  regard  to  the  totality  of  your  offending 
behaviour. 

 
 
 
Statutory surcharge 
 
 
25.	 

The legislation on surcharges applies in this case and an order will be drawn 
up accordingly. 

 

6
--------
The sentence of the Court in relation to count 1 is 3 years imprisonment. 

The sentence of the Court in relation to count 4 is 18 months imprisonment. 

Both sentences are concurrent, so the total sentence is 3 years. 

 
[The defendant should now stand.] 
 
Sentence of the court 
 
 
 
26.	 
 
 
27.	 
 
 
28.	 
 
 
29.	 

The  number  of  days  you  have  spent  on  remand  will  be  deducted  from  that 
sentence. 

 
 
30.	 

 
 
 

 

You will serve up to one half of the sentence.  You will then be released on 
licence and must comply with the terms of that licence and if you do not do so 
will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State until the end of your sentence.

Introduction 

On 15 March 2013, at a Plea and Case Management Hearing before Simon J in the 
Central Criminal Court, Richard Dart (aged 31) and his then co-defendants Jehangir 
Alom (now aged 28) and Imran Mahmood (now in his mid 20s) each pleaded guilty, 
with a Basis of Plea, to an offence of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of 
terrorism, contrary to section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”).  Dart’s 
 
Basis of Plea was not agreed by the prosecution, nor was Mahmood’s, but it was not 
considered to be necessary to determine the points at issue by the calling of evidence.   

 

 

On 25 April 2013 Dart was sentenced by Simon J to an extended sentence of 11 years 
 
with  a  custodial  term  of  6  years  and  an  extension  period  of  5  years;  Alom  was 
sentenced  to  4  years  6  months’  imprisonment;  and  Mahmood  was  sentenced  to  an 
extended sentence of 14 years 9 months with a custodial term of 9 years 9 months and 
an  extension  period  of  5  years.  Dart  and  Mahmood  were  each  subject  to  terrorist 
notification periods imposed pursuant to the provisions of Part 4 of the 2008 Act for 
 
15 years, and Alom for 10 years.  A deprivation order in respect of specified property 
was made pursuant to s.143 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 200 
(“the 2000 Act”), and a forfeiture order in relation to £4,800 in cash was made against 
Dart under the provisions of section 23A of the 2008 Act.   

Dart  now  renews  his  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  sentence,  and  for  a 
representation order, following refusal by the Single Judge. 

On 1 March 2013, at a Plea and Case Management Hearing before Wilkie J in the 
Crown  Court  at  Woolwich,  Zahid  Iqbal  (now  aged  33),  Mohammed  Ahmed  (now 
aged 27), Umar Arshad (now aged 26) and Syad Hussain (now aged 23) each pleaded 
 
guilty,  with  (in  their  cases)  a  Basis  of  Plea  which  was  not  contested  by  the 
prosecution, to an offence of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, 
contrary to section 5(1) of the 2006 Act. 

On  18  April  2013  Iqbal  was  sentenced  by  Wilkie  J  to  an  extended  sentence  of  16 
years 3 months with a custodial term of 11 years 3 months and an extension period of 
5  years;  Ahmed  was  also  sentenced  to  an  extended  sentence  of  16  years  3  months 
 
with a custodial term of 11 years 3 months and an extension period of 5 years; Arshad 
was sentenced to 6 years 9 months’ imprisonment; and Hussain was sentenced to 5 
 
years  3  months’  imprisonment;.    Each  was  subject  to  terrorist  notification  periods 
 
imposed pursuant to the provisions of Part 4 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (“the 
 
2008 Act”) – Iqbal and Ahmed for 30 years and Arshad and Hussain for 15 years.  A 
deprivation order in respect of specified items of property was made pursuant to s.143 
of the 2000 Act. 

Each  now  renews  his  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  sentence,  and  for  a 
representation order, following refusal by the Single Judge. 

There is no factual link between the two cases.  However, it was convenient to hear 
them together - given that all the sentences were imposed for an offence contrary to 
section 5(1) of the 2006 Act (the maximum penalty for which is life imprisonment),

and  that  it  was  suggested  in  each,  whether  explicitly  or  implicitly,  that  we  should 
endeavour to give some (further) general guidance as to sentencing in s.5 cases. 

The relevant legislation and authorities 

8.	

 

 Section 5 of the 2006 Act provides that: 

“(1)  A person commits an offence if, with the intention of – 

(a)  committing acts of terrorism, or 

 

(b)  assisting another to commit such acts, 


he engages in any conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention. 


(2)    It  is  irrelevant  for  the  purposes  of  subsection  (1)  whether  the  intention  and 
preparations relate to one or more particular acts of terrorism, acts of terrorism of a 
particular description, or acts of terrorism generally…….”. 

 
9.	 

Section 20 of the 2006 Act provides that: 

“(1)    Expressions  used  in  this  Part  and  in  the  Terrorism  Act  2000  (c.11)  have  the 

same meanings in this Part as in that Act. 

(2) 

In this Part – 

 

‘act of terrorism’ includes anything constituting an action taken for the purpose 
of terrorism, within the meaning of the Terrorism Act 2000 (see section 1(5) of 
 
that Act)……….” 

 
10.	 

Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”), as amended, defines terrorism 
as follows: 

“(1)  In this Act “terrorism” means the use or threat of action where— 

(a) the action falls within subsection (2), 
  
(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or an international 
governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, 
and 
(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, 
racial or ideological cause. 

(2)    Action falls within this subsection if it—  

(a) involves serious violence against a person,  
(b) involves serious damage to property,  
(c) endangers a person’s life, other than that of the person committing the 
action, 
(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the 
public, or
--------

(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic 
system. 

(4)	

(3)	    The use or threat of action falling within subsection (2) which involves the use of 
 
firearms or explosives is terrorism whether or not subsection (1)(b) is satisfied.  
 In this section— 
(a) “action” includes action outside the United Kingdom,  
(b) a reference to any person or to property is a reference to any person, or to 
property, wherever situated,  
(c) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other 
than the United Kingdom, and 
(d) “the government” means the government of the United Kingdom, of a Part 
of the United Kingdom or of a country other than the United Kingdom.  
(5) In this Act a reference to action taken for the purposes of terrorism includes 
a reference to action taken for the benefit of a proscribed organisation.”  

 
11.	 

At  para.27  of  the  judgment  in  R  v  Gul  [2014]  1  Cr.App.R.14  the  Supreme  Court 
summarised the effect of s.1(1), as follows: 

“The  effect  of  s.1(1)  of  the  2000  Act  is  to  identify  terrorism  as  consisting  of  three 
 
components.  The first is the ‘use or threat of action’, inside or outside the United 
Kingdom, where that action consists of, inter alia, ‘serious violence’, ‘serious damage 
to property’, or creating a serious risk to public safety or health – s.1(1)(a), (2) and 
(4).  The second component is that the use or threat must be ‘designed to influence the 
government  [of  the  United  Kingdom  or  any  other  country]  or  an  [IGO]  or  to 
intimidate  the  public’  –  s.1(1)(b)  and  (4).    The  third  component  is  that  the  use  or 
 
threat  is  ‘made  for  the  purpose  of  advancing  a  political,  religious,  racial  or 
ideological cause’ – s.1(1)(c).” 

It  follows  that  s.5  of  the  2006  Act  requires  proof  that  an  individual  had  a  specific 
 
intent  (albeit  that  it  may  have  been  general  in  nature)  to  commit  an  act  or  acts  of 
 
terrorism (as defined) in this country or abroad, or to assist another to do so, and that 
 
he or she engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect to that intention. 

As is clear from the definition of terrorism, it makes no difference to the seriousness 
of the offence whether the intended act or acts were to take place in this country or 
 
abroad – see e.g. Regina v F [2007] QB 960. 

In  Tabbakh  [2009]  EWCA  Crim  664,  on  an  application  for  leave  to  appeal  against 
sentence, this Court was not prepared to lay down any general range for s.5 offences. 
 
More  recently  in  Khan  &  Others  [2013]  EWCA  Crim  468,  which  was  an  appeal 
 
against sentences imposed principally for s.5 offences, this Court declined to set out 
guidelines or indicative sentences.  In giving the judgment, Leveson LJ (as he then 
was) said: 

“73.	 
 

Although potentially highly relevant both to culpability and potential harm 
(and, thus, of importance for the purpose of fixing the punitive part of any 
sentence) in our judgment, when assessing the future risk to the public, too 
much  weight  should  not  be  placed  on  conversations  for  the  purpose  of

ascribing comparative sophistication: it is not implausible that some self-
publicists  will  talk  ‘big’  and  other,  more  serious  plotters,  may  be  more 
careful and keep their own counsel…………….. 
 

 
It  is  not  the  purpose  of  this  judgment  to  seek  to  set  out  guidelines  or 
indicative  sentences  for  terrorism  which  comes  in  many  different  forms. 
 
Offences range from murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to murder, 
through causing explosions likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to 
property  (s.2  of  the  Explosive  Substances  Act  1883),  conspiracy  or 
possession with intent to cause explosions likely to endanger life or cause 
serious injury to property (s.3 of the 1883 Act) to engaging in conduct in 
preparation for or assisting in committing acts of terrorism contrary to s.5 
of the Terrorism Act 2006.  This last offence is particularly wide covering 
acts just short of an attempt to conduct that only just crosses the line into 
criminality. 
 

A  number  of  principles,  however,  can  be  properly  emphasised.  First,  as 
 
with any criminal offence, s.143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 directs the 
sentence(r)  to  consider  culpability  and  harm:  in  most  terrorist  cases  the 
former will be extremely high.  Second, the purpose of sentence for the most 
serious terrorist offences is to punish deter and incapacitate. Rehabilitation 
will play little, if any part: see Martin [1999] 1 Cr App R (S) 477. Third, the 
starting  point  for  sentence  for  an  inchoate  offence  is  the  sentence  that 
would  have  been  imposed  if  the  objective  had  been  achieved  with  an 
attempt  to  commit  the  offence  being  more  serious  than  a  conspiracy;  see 
Barot [2008] 1 Cr App R (S) 31. Fourth, sentences that can be derived from 
Martin  –  or,  indeed,  any  cases  before  the  impact  of  Schedule  21  of  the 
 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 identifying minimum terms for murder – are of 
historical  interest  only  and  do  not  provide  any  assistance  as  to  the 
approach which should now be adopted: for the impact of Schedule 21 in 
uplifting  determinate  sentences,  see  AG’s  Reference  Nos  85-87  of  2007 
[2008] 2 Cr App R (S) 45 and, in relation to terrorism, Jalil [2009] 2 Cr 
 
App R (s) 40 at paras. 22 and 24. 

Finally,  because  of  the  enormous  breadth  of  potential  offences  (and, 
 
consequently,  the  differing  potential  assessment  of  culpability  and  harm 
depending on the precise facts), we do not consider it appropriate to seek to 
provide guidelines based on these cases alone (or a combination of these 
cases and those in Jalil). If guidelines are needed, a better course would be 
for  the  offences  to  be  considered  by  the  Sentencing  Council  for  England 
and  Wales  although  we  readily  accept  that  (the)  breadth  of  s.5  of  the 
 
Terrorism Act 2006 would make the task of providing guidelines extremely 
difficult.” 
 

Having  started  with  the  notional  sentence  that  would  have  been  imposed  if  the 
intended act(s) of terrorism had actually been carried out, the factual nexus between 
the offender’s conduct in preparation for giving effect to that intention and the future 
commission  of  the  intended  act(s)  of  terrorism  will  be  a  significant  factor  in 
determining  the  ultimate  sentence  for  a  s.5  offence  –  see  e.g.  Attorney  General’s 
Reference (No.7 of 2008) [2008] EWCA Crim 1054.

16.	  Whilst  the  purpose  of  sentence  for  the  most  serious  terrorist  offences  is  to  punish 
 
deter and incapacitate, what was said by Lord Phillips CJ (albeit in a case concerned 
with an offence of dissemination of a terrorist publication, contrary to s.2 of the 2006 
Act)  in  giving  the  judgment  of  the  Court  in  Rahman  and  Mohammed  [2009]  1 
Cr.App.R. (S.) 70 at para.8 must also be borne in mind, namely: 

“…..It is true that terrorist acts are usually extremely serious and that sentences for 
 
terrorist offences should reflect the need to deter others.  Care must, however, be taken 
to  ensure  that  the  sentence  is  not  disproportionate  to  the  facts  of  the  particular 
offence……..If  sentences  are  imposed  that  are  more  severe  than  the  particular 
 
circumstances  of  the  case  warrant  this  will  be  likely  to  inflame  rather  than  deter 
extremism…” 

 
17.	 

A  small  number  of  other  offences  under  the  2000  and  2006  Acts  also  carry  a 
 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  An offence contrary to s.57 of the 2000 Act 
 
(possession of articles for terrorist purposes) carries a maximum sentence of 15 years’ 
imprisonment.  A number of offences, including those contrary to s.6 of the 2006 Act 
(providing  or  receiving  terrorist  training  -  which  was  relied  on  in  argument  in  the 
instant cases) carry a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.  Two offences, 
 
including  those  contrary  to  s.2  of  the  2006  Act  (see  immediately  above)  carry  a 
maximum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment. Others carry a maximum sentence of 5 
years’ imprisonment. 

 
18.	 

As  the  then  Vice-President  (Hughes  LJ)  said  at  para.9  of  the  judgment  in  Roddis 
 
[2009] EWCA Crim 585: 

“…..It  seems  to  us  that  some  caution  needs  to  be  exercised  in  the  welter  of  anti-
terrorist  legislation  that  now  exists  in  making  any  assumption  as  to  the  exact 
Parliamentary  intent.  Some  overlap  between  offences,  even  in  the  same  statute, 
undoubtedly exists…” 

 
19.	 

Section  6(1)  of  the  2006  Act  makes  it  an  offence  to  provide  certain  types  of 
instruction or training.  Section 6(2) makes it an offence to receive certain types of 
instruction or training. 

 
20.	 

Section 6(2) provides that: 

“A person commits an offence if – 

(a)  he receives instruction or training in any of the skills mentioned in subsection (3); 
 

and 

(b)  at the time of the instruction or training, he intends to use the skills in which he is 

being instructed or trained – 

(i) 	

(ii) 

for or in connection with the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism 
 
or Convention offences; or 

for  assisting  the  commission  or  preparation  by  others  of  such  acts  of 
terrorism.”

It  is  therefore  clear  that,  whilst  there  is  an  overlap,  the  intention  required  for  the 
commission of an offence contrary to s.6(2) is wider than the intention required for 
the commission of a s.5 offence – in that intentions to use the relevant skills for or in 
connection with the preparation, or in assisting the preparation by others, of acts of 
terrorism (or Convention offences) are also caught.   

In Iqbal &  Iqbal [2010] EWCA Crim 3215 the first applicant sought to argue that 
there was no logical reason that Parliament should have intended to cover training in 
both  sections  5  and  6,  not  least  given  the  different  penalties,  and  that  where  the 
alleged activity fell quintessentially under s.6, as was said to be the position in that 
case, a s.5 offence should not be charged.  At para.10 of the judgment the Court said: 

 

“In our view, there is nothing illogical in a degree of overlap in the offences created 
by the different sections of the Act.  It was a point that the Vice-President commented 
 
 
It  is  an 
upon  in  Roddis  at  [9]………[above]………Section  5  casts  the  net  wide. 
offence which was intended to add to the existing common law offences of conspiracy 
 
to carry out terrorist acts and attempting to carry out such acts.  Conspiracy demands 
that  there  be  an  agreement,  and the law of attempts requires  something  more  than 
acts which are merely preparatory.  The offence created by this section goes further 
 
and  catches  acts  of  preparation,  when  coupled  with  the  relevant  intention.  In  our 
view, there was no reason for the behaviour of the first applicant in this regard not to 
be charged under section 5.” 

Our  attention  was  drawn  to  the  sentences  imposed,  on  their  particular  facts,  in  the 
various cases to which we have made reference above, and to a number of other cases 
in which, again, the sentence imposed was dependant on the particular facts.  Overall, 
the sentences imposed for s.5 offences ranged from life imprisonment to four-and-a­
half  years’  imprisonment.    Given  the  very  limited  assistance  which  that  exercise 
provided, we do not propose to cite all the cases. We simply observe that the lowest of 
those sentences was imposed in Attorney General’s Reference (No.7 of 2008) (above) 
following a plea of guilty which attracted a discount of 25%.  The defendant, who it 
was accepted might be a Walter Mitty type, was stopped leaving this country with kit 
 
and money. He intended to make himself useful to the cause in one way or another. 
The Court concluded that the sentence was lenient but not unduly so.  

Our approach 

 
24.	 

Given  the  relatively  limited  number  of  cases  in  this  Court  to  date  in  relation  to 
sentences imposed for s.5 offences (which cases were, in any event, decided on their 
own  facts);  the  breadth  of  the  offence;  the  consequent  difficulty  in  giving  general 
guidance beyond the identification of the principles  identified in Khan and Others 
and  in  the  other  cases  also  cited  above;  and  our  agreement  with  the  view  that,  if 
guidelines  are  needed,  it  would  be  better  for  the  offence  to  be  considered  by  the 
Sentencing Council, we decline the invitation to give any further general guidance. 
These  renewed  applications,  and  any  consequent  appeal(s),  must  be  decided  by 
reference to established principles and on their own facts. 

Dart: The Facts 
 

 
25.	 

Dart and Alom had no previous convictions, whereas Mahmood had a number and 
was in admitted breach of a suspended sentence – albeit that, in the end, no order was

made  in  relation  to  that.    Dart  lived  with  his  wife  in  Ealing.  Alom  lived  in  East 
London  and  had,  in  the  past,  been  a  Community  Support  Officer  with  the 
 
Metropolitan Police and a member of the Territorial Army. 

 
26.	 

The Indictment contained a single Count to which, as we have already indicated, all 
three pleaded guilty with a Basis of Plea.  The Particulars of Offence asserted that the 
defendants: 

“…between the 25th day of July 2010 and the 6th day of July 2012, with the intention 
of committing acts of terrorism or assisting another to commit such acts, engaged in 
conduct for giving effect to their intention, namely: 

 

 
27.	 

i. 	

ii. 	

iii.	 
 

travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, 

travelling abroad to commit acts of terrorism, 

advising  and  counselling  the  commission  of  terrorist  acts  by  providing 
 
information about travel to Pakistan and terrorism training, and operational 
security whilst there.” 

All  three  defendants  held  radical  Islamist  beliefs.    Alom  had  an  associate  named 
 
Mohammed  Tariq  Nasar.    In  July  2010  Mahmood  (then  aged  around  20)  travelled 
from  this  country  to  Pakistan  where  he  received  terrorist  training  –  including 
rudimentary  training  in  explosives.    Thereafter,  however,  he  was  arrested  by  the 
authorities in Pakistan and held in custody. In July 2011 (whilst Mahmood was still in 
custody in Pakistan and preceded by Nasar who had helped them to procure visas) 
Alom and Dart travelled separately from this country to Pakistan with the intention of 
 
obtaining terrorist training in order thereafter to fight coalition forces in Afghanistan. 
 
Alom’s  flight  to  Karachi  was  on  13  July  2011.    When  questioned  by  the  police  at 
 
Heathrow  before  his  departure  he  said  that  he  was  going  to  a  wedding  and  that 
thereafter he was to be introduced to a cousin of the bride with a view to marriage. 
 
The  following  day  Alom  was  in  telephone  contact  with  Dart  (in  this  country)  and 
Nasar  (in  Pakistan).  Telephone  contact  between  Alom  and  Dart  continued  on  an 
almost daily basis until Dart also left this country for Pakistan on 29 July 2011.  There 
was a clear inference (via the subsequent lack of telephone contact between them) that 
thereafter he and Alom were together in Pakistan until Alom returned to this country – 
arriving at Heathrow on 10 August 2011.    On his return  Alom was stopped and 
interviewed  by  the  police  –  during  which  he  admitted  that  he  had  been  in  Quetta 
(close to the border between Kandahar Province and Afghanistan). He said that he had 
attended the wedding of his friend Tariq (though he could not give Tariq’s surname). 
He said that, as part of the celebrations for the wedding, he had fired a handgun and a 
rifle, and that he had taken the opportunity to become engaged to a local girl.   

 
28.	 

Dart returned to this country on 19 August.  He too was interviewed on arrival and 
 
said that he had been to visit his friend Tariq Khan in Quetta, and that he had left 
early for a number of reasons. 

 

29.	  Mahmood was deported from Pakistan and arrived back in this country on 24 August 
2011.  He had two rucksacks with him, which were seized by the police. In interview 
he  said  that  he  had  been  travelling  about  in  Pakistan  and  had  been  detained  near 
Quetta after he had been unable to produce evidence of his identity. Later examination

32.	 

of the rucksacks revealed, between them, the presence of traces of a number of high 
explosives at levels consistent with Mahmood having handled explosives during his 
training  (as  it  was  eventually  admitted  that  he  had).  Mahmood’s  passport  was 
retained by the police. 

After  their  return  Dart  and  Alom  continued  to  be  in  regular  telephone  contact  and 
began to plan their return to Pakistan – again in order to obtain terrorist training with a 
view to going on to fight coalition forces in Afghanistan.  Preparations were put in 
 
train  to  obtain  visas.  On  27  October  2011  Alom  booked  flights  to  Karachi  on  11 
November 2011 for both of them.  Dart paid for his own ticket. 

In  the  afternoon  of  4  November  2011  Dart  and  Mahmood  met  up  at  Dart’s  flat  in 
Ealing.  Being security conscious, they then sought to conduct a “silent conversation” 
by typing entries into a Word document on Dart’s computer, not saving the entries 
and  then  deleting  them.    They  were  clearly  under  the  misapprehension  that,  once 
deleted, the text could never be recovered.  In the event, much of the text was later 
able to be reconstructed by the prosecution expert Professor Sams and interpreted by 
one of the investigating officers DS Rye. 

During  the  sentencing  process  there  was,  as  Simon  J  put  it,  “little  enthusiasm”  to 
cross-examine DS Rye about her interpretation of the words used, nor did Dart and 
Mahmood offer to explain their intended meaning.  Hence Simon J proceeded upon 
the basis that unless he was sure of the meaning of material exchanges he would not 
draw  any  adverse  inference  from  them.    In  particular,  Simon  J  made  clear  that 
although  it  was  likely  that  Dart  was  speaking  with  Mahmood  on  behalf  of  both 
himself  and  Alom  he  would  not,  in  view  of  Alom’s  accepted  Basis  of  Plea  (which 
denied any connection with the conversation), treat what was said as affecting Alom’s 
sentence.  . 

 

33.	  We  therefore  confine  our  summary  of  the  silent  conversation  between  Dart  and 
Mahmood to the matters of which Simon J was sure. They discussed the fact that the 
people to be contacted in Pakistan were the TTP (a Taliban movement in the tribal 
 
areas), with Mahmood saying that he knew the people to approach, where they were 
to be found, that they were a mixture of the TTP and Al Qaeda, and that he would be 
able  to  effect  an  introduction  to  those  who  had  carried  out  the  “Abu  Dujani  Op” 
 
(which was a suicide attack on a US forward operating camp called Camp Chapman 
in Afghanistan).  Dart made clear that he wanted “to be active with the right people”. 
 
Mahmood  indicated  that,  due  to  the  number  of  people  wanting  to  take  part,  there 
would  be  a  limit  to  the  number  of  operations  that  might  be  carried  out.  Mahmood 
 
asked  Dart  to  get  his  (Mahmood’s)  book  whilst  he  was  in  Pakistan  as  in  it  he  had 
noted the necessary quantities of easily obtained chemicals from which a bomb could 
be made. There then followed a discussion about what would constitute a legitimate 
 
target. Dart then talked about the perceived advantages and disadvantages of attacking 
 
civilians rather than soldiers.  He was equivocal about attacking civilian targets in this 
 
country, since it might be treated as justifying war. In any event, he later distanced 
himself from a terrorist attack in this country.  Mahmood then talked about testing an 
improvised  device  and  detonator  in  this  country  without  the  need  to  travel  into  the 
countryside to do so. He also mentioned various commonly available chemicals used 
for explosive devices.  They then discussed how to make contact with the right people 
 
in  Pakistan  in  order  to  get  training  -  with  Dart  saying  that  he  was  not  definitely 
planning to come back to this country, but that he would try to get information back to

Mahmood. Mahmood then advised Dart as to how to make contact with the TTP, how 
to set up a webmail account in a way that would make covert communications easier, 
and also gave operational security advice. 

On 7 November 2011 Alom sent an email to Dart with instructions as to how to avoid 
the two of them being associated together whilst at the airport on 11 November.   

On 8 & 9 November 2011, using the same silent method that he and Mahmood had 
used on 4 November, Dart had conversations with his wife at their flat.  These were 
concerned in the main with the ways in which they would communicate after Dart had 
arrived in Pakistan without alerting the authorities to his whereabouts and the purpose 
of his travel, together with what could be done to protect his wife from prosecution. 
  
Dart made it clear that he intended to remain in Pakistan for some time.  He said that, 
 
even if the plane crashed on the way out, Allah would accept him as a martyr because 
 
of  his  intention  in  going  to  Pakistan.  Dart  also  referred  to  Mahmood’s  visit  on  4 
November - saying that although the authorities had been unable to prove anything 
against Mahmood they were still monitoring him. 

On the morning of 11 November 2011 Mahmood travelled from West Yorkshire to 
Ealing where, that afternoon, he met Dart and they had another silent conversation – 
this  time  exchanging  messages  on  their  iPhones.    Thereafter  Alom  received  a  call 
from Nasar, who was still in Pakistan. 

Dart and Alom then travelled separately to Heathrow, but were stopped by the police 
 
from boarding the flight to Karachi. 

Dart  was  found  to  be  in  possession  of  a  visa  sponsorship  letter  asking  that  he  be 
permitted to attend a wedding on 15 November 2011, and stating that he would also 
 
be introduced to potential marriage candidates.  The telephone number given in the 
letter was Nasar’s Pakistani number.  Dart also had a USB stick the content of which 
included his Islamic will – which listed Anjem Choudary (the leader of al-Muhajiroun 
who  had  presided  over  Dart’s  conversion  /  reversion  to  Islam)  and  Alom  as  his 
executors.  Also recovered from Dart were £4,800 in cash, two SIM cards and two 
mobile phones (in one of which was stored Nasar’s Pakistani number under the name 
 
‘Tariq, Pakistan’.  When questioned Dart said that he was travelling with Alom who 
was intending to get married, and that he (Dart) was also going to hike and horse ride 
in the region.  He said that £3,500 of the money was his, and that the remainder had 
been collected by others and was intended for charity. 

Alom  was  found  to  be  in  possession  a  black  ski  jacket,  gloves,  a  telephone  which 
contained  Nasar’s  details,  and  a  SIM  card.  When  questioned  he  said  that  he  was 
travelling to Pakistan in order to attend the wedding of a man called Zaid Uddin, and 
to be introduced to potential brides. 

Dart’s  home  in  Ealing  was  searched.    The  laptop  that  had  been  used  for  the  silent 
conversations was recovered, along with an external hard drive containing a video file 
 
relating to the proscribed group ‘Muslims against Crusaders’ – with Dart reading the 
 
script  of  what  was  called  ‘Message  to  the  EDL’  (English  Defence  League).    Also 
found was a Pakistani visa sponsorship letter purporting to be signed by Imran Adil, 
and notes relating to the visa application process and the cover story to be used.

Alom’s  home  was  also  searched.    The  property  recovered  there  included  a  sponsor 
 
letter,  dated  May  2011,  also  purportedly  from  Imran  Adil,  which  bore  the  same 
contact telephone number and Pakistani ID card number as the letter found at Dart’s 
address. 

Dart and Alom were not arrested at that stage.  On 12 November 2011 (the day after 
they had been due to leave) the telephone normally used by Alom’s sister was used on 
several occasions to try to contact Nasir’s number in Pakistan. 

In the following months the authorities continued to keep a careful watch on all three 
 
men.  Dart and Alom were in frequent telephone contact and were seen to meet in 
November 2011, December 2011, late March 2012 and June 2012.   

Dart and Mahmood kept their distance from each other until 16 February 2012 when 
they  were  observed,  in  particular,  in  a  restaurant  in  Ealing.    Surveillance  officers 
 
overheard aspects of their conversation during which Dart was variously heard to say 
words to the effect of: 

“Things have to be done.  It doesn’t matter if you are in this country or abroad, things 
have  to  be  done.  That’s  the  thing  with  this  country,  even  though  I’m  going  to  be 
watched, innit.  A lot of brothers are scared for going inside but I’m not.  I don’t need 
brothers around me to study Jihad…..I’ll do it on my own…..Where’s the fighting at 
the moment……(after talk about beheading, specific areas of fighting and mention of 
the north west)….No one can do it full-time, it’s too much to do it full time…” 

Dart  and  Mahmood  were  observed  meeting  again  on  23  February  2012,  on  four 
occasions in March 2012, twice in April 2012 and finally on 25 May 2012.  In the 
meanwhile Nasar had returned from Pakistan on 17 March 2012 and Alom met him 
on 18 April and 7 May 2012. 

There was a coordinated arrest operation on 5 July 2012, during the course of which 
Dart, Alom and Mahmood were arrested.  Alom’s by then wife was found to be in 
possession  of  an  SD  card  on  which  there  were  two  copies  of  ‘Inspire’.  (which 
included  material  intended  to  inspire  fundamentalist  Islamists  to  undertake  terrorist 
activities  in  their  own  countries  and  provided  practical  instruction  and  guidance). 
 
Nothing of significance was found in relation to Dart and Mahmood. 

Alom and Dart made no comment in their interviews.  Mahmood spoke but said little 
of any significance - other than denying that he knew that Dart held extremist views. 

Dart was charged on 18 July 2012, and was sent for trial shortly thereafter.  The trial 
was  fixed  for  10  April  2013.  The  prosecution  served  its  evidence  in  or  around 
November/December 2012.  Dart was permitted to change his solicitor and counsel in 
December  2012.    In  February  2013  Dart  put  forward  a  Basis  of  Plea  which  was 
rejected by the prosecution.  Thereafter the PCMH was postponed more than once in 
order to allow further discussion between the parties as to an acceptable basis of plea. 
It finally took place on 15 March 2013 (less than a month before the trial date).  

 
49. 

Dart’s Basis of Plea (which included a number of footnotes) stated that:

“1.  The  defendant’s  conduct  in  the  UK  in  preparation  for  the  intended  act  of 

terrorism was: 

a. 	

To make arrangements to travel to Pakistan on 29 July 2011 with a view to 
exploring possibilities in relation to undertaking combat training (however, 
the  defendant  did  not  undertake  any  training  during  the  3-week  trip  to 
Pakistan in July/August 2011); 
 

 

 

b. 	

To make arrangements to travel to Pakistan on 11 November 1991 in order 
to  undertake  combat  training,  with  a  view  to  engaging  in  combat  in 
Afghanistan against such sections of NATO controlled armed forces as he 
 
might encounter; and 

 

c.  	

In  October  and  November  2011  to  seek  and  obtain  advice  about  training 
and  contacts  in  Pakistan  (this  includes  discussing  where  to  go,  who  to 
contact, how to contact them, who would be ‘active’ and about opportunities 
to engage in combat operations). 
 

2.  	 The  defendant  did  not  intend  to  commit  an  act  of  terrorism  (a)  involving  the 

targeting of civilians or loss of civilian life or (b) in the UK. 

3. 	 Between the authorities refusal to permit him to fly to Pakistan on 11 November 
2011 and his arrest on 5 July 2012, the defendant did not engage in conduct in 
preparation to commit an intended act of terrorism.” 

It  was,  however,  accepted  that  on  4  November  2011  Dart  had  spoken  about  the 
possibility of the commission of acts of terrorism in the UK, and it was noted that the 
prosecution observed that the overheard conversation with Mahmood on 16 February 
2012 demonstrated an ongoing fervour for extremist activity. 

As we have already touched on above, Dart’s Basis of Plea was not accepted by the 
prosecution  and  nor  was  Mahmood’s,  but  it  was  not  considered  necessary  to 
determine the points in issue by the calling of evidence.  Sentence therefore had to be 
 
passed on a factual basis consistent with the Basis of Plea. 

There was a Pre-Sentence Report in respect of each defendant.  The authors of those 
in  respect  of  Dart  and  Mahmood  reached  the  clear  conclusion  that  they  were 
dangerous offenders. 

During the course of mitigation defence counsel drew the judge’s attention to s.6(2) of 
the  2006  Act  which,  as  already  touched  on  above,  makes  it  an  offence  (with  a 
maximum  sentence  of  10  years’  imprisonment)  to  receive  terrorist  training.    All 
 
submitted that if the facts relied upon in an indictment charging offences under s.5 of 
the 2006 Act went no further than alleging attempts to obtain training, any sentence of 
imprisonment should be set at less than ten years. 

The broader mitigation advanced on Dart’s behalf included reliance upon his previous 
 
good character; the fact that he never got near his goal of training for terrorism, and 
thus did not get near to his further goal of carrying out terrorist attacks abroad; and his 
plea  of  guilty.  It  was,  however,  accepted  that  although  he  did  not  intend  to  kill 
 
civilians,  his  intended  actions  might  have  resulted  in  civilian  losses.    Reliance  was

also placed on sentences imposed in a small number of other s.5 cases including Khan 
and others (above). 

Alom’s Basis of Plea, which was accepted by the prosecution, was to the effect that 
part of his purpose in travelling to Pakistan in July 2011 was to seek out groups from 
whom to obtain instruction/training to be used by him thereafter to engage in combat 
 
with allied forces in Afghanistan.  He had not, however, succeeded in locating any 
such group, and accordingly did not receive any training. He had sought to travel to 
Pakistan again on 11 November 2011 for the same purpose.  The silent conversation 
between  Dart  and  Mahmood  on  4  November  2011  was  no  reflection  of  his  own 
intentions – indeed there was no evidence emanating from him of any wider intention 
beyond his admitted purpose of travel. 

In  his  long,  detailed  and  clearly  expressed  sentencing  remarks  Simon  J  set  out  the 
facts including, as we have already touched on in para.33 above, the aspects of the 
silent  conversation  between  Dart  and  Mahmood  on  4  November  2011  of  which  he 
was  sure.  He  also  observed  that  the  commitment  of  Dart  and  Mahmood  to  Jihad 
activities  seemed  not  to  have  been  moderated  by  what  had  happened  in  November 
2011 - given what had happened afterwards. 

As to the argument advanced in relation to s.6(2) of the 2006 Act, Simon J accepted 
that some s.5 offences were very much more serious than others, and that it followed 
 
when  looking  at  a  particular  s.5  offence,  and  where  the  offences  were  of  broadly 
similar  culpability,  the  court  should  have  a  broad  regard  to  the  maximum  sentence 
under s.6. 

Having referred to the matters relied upon in mitigation, Simon J observed that it was 
clear that the defendants were all fundamentalists (although they would be sentenced 
for  their  criminal  actions  rather  than  their  beliefs),  and  that  they  all  intended  that 
training  in  Pakistan  would  be  followed  by  acts  of  terrorism  -  which  meant  killing 
people to the extent that it was possible to do so.  He accepted that, to some extent, 
Dart and Alom had been the subject of suspicion from their fellow radicals, and may 
have felt the need to prove themselves.   

Simon J then went on to conclude that Mahmood was the most dangerous of the three 
defendants – indicating that the fact that Mahmood had asked Dart to get hold of the 
 
book that he believed held the means to make a viable explosive device was highly 
relevant to the question of dangerousness. 

Simon J observed that Dart had wanted to be “active with the right people” – i.e. those 
most committed to Jihad and most effective in promoting it.  He had intended to use 
the £4,800 in cash found upon him on 11 November 2011 for the contacts provided by 
Mahmood.  Simon J then underlined that he did not sentence Dart on the basis that he 
had intended to carry out terrorist activities in this country, but rather upon the basis 
 
that his immediate objective had been to go out to Pakistan for training, with a view to 
carrying out subsequent (albeit as yet not crystallised) terrorist operations there. The 
ways  in  which  he  had  communicated  with  others  showed  that  he  was  surveillance 
conscious  and  belied  the  argument  that  his  offence  was  unsophisticated.    His 
conversations  with  Mahmood  were  relevant  to  both  his  culpability  and  the  risk  of 
serious harm to members of the public.  The fact that he had acted in concert with 
Alom was an aggravating feature.

In Alom’s case, Simon J observed, there was no more than his thwarted intention to 
 
obtain training in Pakistan, and the persistence of it – together with the aggravating 
feature of his having acted in concert with Dart. 

As to dangerousness, Simon J accepted that neither Dart nor Mahmood had identified 
a target, whether at home or abroad, but was sure that neither had ruled out an attack 
of  some  sort  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  that  Mahmood  was  looking  for  ways  of 
arming  himself  with  a  rudimentary  bomb.    Having  considered  the  consequences  of 
imposing an extended sentence, Simon J concluded that Mahmood’s commitment to 
terrorist activity over a significant period, and the determined steps taken by Dart to 
obtain information and assistance for the purpose of obtaining terrorist training abroad 
marked  each  out  as  being  particularly  dangerous.    He  therefore  exercised  his 
discretion to impose the extended sentences to which we have already made reference 
 
upon  them  –  giving,  in  the  process,  a  discount  for  plea  of  25%,  and  taking  into 
account the need to focus on the nexus between the preparatory acts and the ultimate 
intended terrorist act(s), and that purpose of sentence in cases of this type is to punish, 
deter and incapacitate.  It follows that the notional custodial term after trial that Simon 
J had in mind in Dart’s case was one of 8 years. 

 
63.	 

Simon J also concluded that Alom was dangerous, but was persuaded that it was not a 
 
risk  that  could  only  be  managed  by  means  of  an  extended  sentence.  He  therefore 
 
exercised  his  discretion  not  to  pass  such  a  sentence  in  Alom’s  case.  Instead  he 
 
imposed the determinate sentence to which we have already made reference – again 
giving a discount for plea of 25%, and particularly taking into account the impact of 
sentence for an offence under s.6.  It follows that the notional sentence after trial in 
 
Alom’s case was one of 6 years’ imprisonment. 

Dart: Grounds & Submissions 

 
64.	 

The imposition of an extended sentence is not disputed. The Ground of Appeal asserts 
 
that: 

“The  applicant’s  sentence  of  6  years’  imprisonment  is  manifestly  excessive,  in 
 
particular: 

a. 	 The learned judge took too high a starting point of 8 years’ imprisonment; 

b.  	 There  is  an  objectionable  disparity  with  Alom’s  sentence  of  4  years  6  months’ 

imprisonment; and 

c. 	

Insufficient credit of 25% was given for the applicant’s guilty plea. 

65.	  Mr  Bajwa  QC,  on  Dart’s  behalf,  concentrated  his  oral  submissions  on  the  notional 

 

custodial term after trial and the alleged unfair disparity with Alom’s sentence. 

As to the notional custodial term after trial, Mr Bajwa asserted that there was a risk in 
s.5 cases, where it was less than certain what the basis of fact was, of an excessive 
 
sentence being imposed. Hence, he submitted, there was a need to be clear as to the 
intended  act  of  terrorism  and  the  preparatory  conduct  of  which  a  defendant  was 
 
convicted  or  admitted;  for  consistency  with  other  s.5  cases  and  amongst  co­
defendants; for the sentence to be no more than the maximum for the intended offence

being prepared for; and for care to be taken to ensure that non preparatory matters 
were not given disproportionate weight. 

 

67.	  Mr Bajwa submitted that, in accordance with his Basis of Plea, Dart’s intention was to 
receive terrorist training with a view to fighting coalition forces in Afghanistan, and 
that therefore his intended offence amounted to no more than an aggravated form of 
 
receipt  of  training  for  terrorism,  contrary  to  s.6(2)  of  the  2006  Act,  but  one  which 
came nowhere near the sort of completed offence which would attract the maximum 
sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment – which, Mr Bajwa postulated, would be a case in 
which the defendant managed to receive training, had a bad record, and was intent on 
mass murder.  Here, Mr Bajwa submitted, the judge ought to have had in mind more 
 
clearly  where  the  admitted  intended  offence  fitted  in  the  scale  of  s.6(2)  cases,  the 
 
limitations of the admitted conduct in preparation, Dart’s previous good character and 
 
the fact that, as between his attempt to fly to Pakistan on 11 November 2011 and his 
arrest on 5 July 2012 he had gone no further. All of which, Mr Bajwa asserted, should 
have resulted in a notional custodial term after trial of less than 8 years. 

 
68.	 

 
69.	 

 
70.	 

As to disparity, Mr Bajwa submitted that Alom was, in reality, an equal partner with 
Dart.  The  only  difference  between  them  was  that  it  was  Dart  who  had  met  with 
Mahmood on 4 November 2011 and had the silent conversation with him.  The reality 
of that conversation was that Dart had been speaking on behalf of both himself and 
Alom  and,  notwithstanding  the  prosecution’s  acceptance  of  Alom’s  Basis  of  Plea 
 
(distancing him from that conversation), the Judge could have honoured Alom’s Basis 
and  still  found  no  difference  between  them. 
In  particular,  the  parties  had  been 
prepared to have a Newton hearing as to the content of that conversation; what was 
accepted by Dart as to the content (which thus should have been the basis of sentence) 
did not justify an inference of difference with Alom; and the judge wrongly took the 
view  that  it  added  to  Dart’s  dangerousness  even  though  it  was  not  conduct  in 
preparation as such. 

In his written submissions, having set out the chronology of events post charge (see 
 
para.48 above), Mr Bajwa asserted that it was arguable that, in those circumstances, 
Dart ought to have been given full discount for his plea. 

On behalf of the Respondent, Miss Hummerstone submitted that it was clear that the 
 
principal  acts  of  terrorism  that  Dart  intended  to  carry  out  involved  him  killing 
coalition  forces  in  Afghanistan,  with  the  accepted  reality  that  his  intended  actions 
 
might  have  resulted  in  civilian  losses  as  well.    As  he  had  made  plain  in  his  silent 
conversation with his wife, he did not intend to return until the coalition forces were 
out of Afghanistan.  In addition his acts in preparation, both travelling to Pakistan in 
July/August 2011, and trying to travel there again in November 2011, combined with 
the evidence of what he had said in the various conversations, showed a considerable 
determination to succeed in his ultimate intention. 
 

 

71.	  Miss  Hummerstone  further  submitted  that,  given  the  conversations  to  which  Alom 
was not a party, and for the reasons given by the judge, there was clearly no unfair 
disparity with the sentence imposed on Alom.  Nor, she submitted, was this a case for 
the  award  of  full  credit  for  plea  –  given  that  an  unacceptable  Basis  had  first  been 
forwarded  only  in  mid-February  2013,  and  that  the  PCMH  had  been  postponed  on 
several occasions at the behest of the defendants, and had eventually taken place less 
than a month before the trial date.

Dart: Conclusion 

Double-click to enter the short title  

 
72.	 

 

There is, rightly in our view, no criticism of the Judge’s finding of dangerousness, nor 
of the exercise of his discretion to impose an extended sentence.  As to the length of 
the custodial term, the prosecution were clearly entitled in accordance with Iqbal & 
Iqbal (above) to charge a s.5 offence, which thus carried a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment.  Dart  pleaded  guilty  to  that  offence.    There  was  no  dispute  that  the 
ultimate acts of terrorism that Dart intended to commit involved the killing by him of 
coalition forces in Afghanistan, with the acceptance that his intended acts might have 
resulted  in  civilian  losses  as  well.    It  made  no  difference  to  the  seriousness  of  the 
offence  that  the  intention  was  to  be  achieved  abroad.    This  was  therefore  a  very 
serious case, in which (in accordance with established principles) the starting point 
was the notional sentence which would have been imposed if that intention had been 
achieved. Hence, in this case, the relevant starting point was one of life imprisonment. 
It was then incumbent on the judge to consider, as he did, the factual nexus between 
Dart’s admitted conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention and the act(s) 
of terrorism ultimately intended, and to have in mind (as he also did) the purpose of 
sentence in cases of this type, and (we would add) the need to ensure that nevertheless 
the sentence was not disproportionate to the facts.  As to the nexus, Dart, who on the 
evidence  was  a  committed  extremist,  had  travelled  to  Pakistan  once,  and  had 
determinedly tried to travel there again to get training in order to go straight on to 
carry out his ultimate intention of killing coalition forces in Afghanistan (with the risk 
 
of killing civilians as well). He had also tried to take a significant sum in cash, part of 
which  was  to  be  given  to  terrorist  to  assist  them.  He  had  only  failed  because  the 
authorities  had  intervened  –  albeit  that  he  did  not  try  again.  The  nexus  was  thus 
 
relatively close.  We reject the argument that the judge was bound by the maximum 
sentence for a s.6 offence and that a comparison with the worst type of s.6 case that 
 
can be envisaged shows that the notional custodial term after trial of 8 years was too 
 
long.  Indeed, in the circumstances of the hypothetical worst case postulated by Mr 
Bajwa, it would obviously be wholly inadequate to charge a s.6 offence.  That is not 
to  say  that  there  will  not  be  s.5  cases  in  which  it  would  be  appropriate,  on  the 
particular facts, to give weight to the maximum sentence for a s.6 offence.  On the 
particular  facts  of  this  case,  however,  it  is  simply  not  arguable  that  a  notional 
custodial  term  after  trial  of  8  years  was  manifestly  excessive.    Indeed,  there  could 
have been no realistic complaint if a significantly longer notional custodial term had 
been identified. 

 
73.	 

For  the  reasons  which  the  judge  gave,  there  was  clearly  an  appropriate  basis  in 
relation to Alom upon which to exercise his discretion against the imposition of an 
extended sentence, and also to identify a shorter notional custodial term after trial.  No 
 
arguably unfair disparity arose.  The argument that, in the particular circumstances of 
 
this case, the judge erred in confining the discount for plea to 25% is, in our view, 
equally unmeritorious. 

 
74.	 

 
In all those circumstances, Dart’s renewed application is refused 

Iqbal, Ahmed, Arshad & Hussain: The Facts 

 
75.	 

The  applicants,  each  of  whom  was  of  previous  good  character,  pleaded  guilty  to 
Count 1 of a 14 count indictment. The Particulars of Offence were as follows:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Double-click to enter the short title  

“On divers days between 1 January 2011 and 25 April 2012 (each of the applicants) 
with the intention of committing acts of terrorism or assisting others to commit such 
acts, engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect to that intention, namely 

 

 

 

(i) 

facilitating, planning and encouraging travel overseas 

(ii)  organising, encouraging and participating in physical training 

(iii)  purchasing survival equipment 

 

 

(iv)  downloading,  researching  and  discussing  electronic  files  containing 

 

practical instruction for a terrorist attack 

(v)  	 discussing  methods  materials  and  targets  for  a  terrorist  attack  including 

firearms and improvised explosive devices 

(vi)  collecting and supplying funds for terrorist purposes overseas.”  

 

The remaining 13 counts on the indictment variously charged Iqbal (Counts 2 & 3), 
Ahmed  (Counts  4-6),  Arshad  (Counts  7-10)  and  Hussain  (Counts  11-14)  with  the 
 
possession of information, contrary to section 58(1)(b) of the 2000 Act (which carries 
a maximum sentence of ten years’ imprisonment). In each case the material was found 
when their home was searched on 2 September 2011. Those counts were eventually 
ordered  to  lie  on  the  file.  However,  and  without  objection,  the  undisputed  facts 
 
underlying them were taken into account when sentence was imposed. 

Each of the applicants lived in Luton at the material time.  The prosecution case was 
that Iqbal had a contact in Pakistan who was thought to have access to insurgents on 
the border with Afghanistan.  The contact was used for the purpose of assisting Iqbal 
in placing Ahmed for terrorist training in Pakistan.  To that end, Iqbal and Ahmed 
 
discussed, in particular, how to ensure success without drawing the attention of the 
security services, or even Ahmed’s own family, to what he was doing.  Discussions 
included what Ahmed should wear and pack for his trip, and what telephone numbers 
 
would be used whilst he was in Pakistan.  Iqbal also provided Ahmed with £850 to be 
passed  on  for  use  for  terrorist  purposes.  He  also  discussed  with  his  contact  the 
arrangements for Ahmed’s travel and for his reception in Pakistan for the purposes of 
terrorist training.  Arshad also provided assistance to Ahmed during the course of the 
preparations for the trip – including providing him with Pakistani SIM cards (one of 
which Ahmed later used, whilst in Pakistan, to keep in touch with Iqbal and Arshad), 
 
encouraging him, giving him £100 for the purposes of terrorism and coaching him as 
to a cover story. 

 

On  numerous  occasions  Ahmed  attended  a  gym  for  training  and  went  on  trips  to 
mountainous areas (in particular Snowdonia) – all with a view to becoming physically 
fit for purposes connected with terrorism. He was also instrumental in encouraging 
and transporting others to take part in outdoor military style physical training. 

 

In February 2011 Iqbal discussed (in veiled terms on the phone) acquiring firearms 
 
and ammunition.  On 21 February 2011 he met a third party and they discussed more 
explicitly the procurement of a firearm and ammunition as well as referring to the Al 
Qaeda magazine ‘Inspire’  (as to which see para. 46 above).

Ahmed duly travelled to Pakistan on 9 March 2011 but returned (ten days earlier than 
expected) on 15 March 2011.  The foreshortening of the trip was said by Ahmed to be 
due  to  his  lack  of  facility  in  Pashtu  and  Arabic,  and  to  enhanced  security  in  the 
 
relevant part of Pakistan. 

Iqbal claimed to have joined a gym in March 2011.  After his return from Pakistan, 
Ahmed went on a number of further physical training trips to Snowdonia in April and 
July 2011 – accompanied by Arshad on a number of occasions and by Hussain on one 
 
occasion.  Iqbal and Ahmed discussed training for military purposes, as did Ahmed 
 
and Hussain. 

In the meanwhile, in April 2011, Ahmed had a conversation in his car with two other 
people about the acquisition of firearms and ammunition. In May 2011 Ahmed and 
Hussain discussed the possibility of obtaining firearms. Ahmed indicated that he was 
minded to buy a gun and Hussain advised him as to potential sources. Thereafter, on 
25  May  2011,  Ahmed  had  a  conversation  in  his  car  with  two  other  males  -  during 
which the purchase of a firearm was discussed.  There was no evidence that any of the 
 
expressed intentions about firearms and ammunition ever got beyond the discussion 
stage, but they were serious discussions. 

Also in April 2011, and again in May 2011, Iqbal and Ahmed had a discussion based 
around  the  magazine  ‘Inspire’  which  they  recognised  enabled  people  such  as 
themselves  to  take  terrorist  action  in  their  home  country  without  the  need  to  travel 
abroad and to attend training camps there.  They also discussed an article in ‘Inspire’ 
about assembling an IED from readily available items and ingredients.  Further, they 
spoke  of  modifying  the  device  that  was  described  in  the  article  with  a  view  to 
attacking a Territorial Army Centre in Luton.  The evidence showed that, as described 
in  the  article,  the  device  was  viable,  but  that,  if  modified  in  the  way  discussed,  it 
would not have been.  Nevertheless these were detailed and serious discussions, even 
though they did not get beyond that stage. 

Arrangements  were  made  for  Iqbal  to  travel  to  Pakistan  on  4  September  2011  for 
terrorist purposes (including, once there, giving up to £10,000 to the insurgents).  He 
 
discussed the plan with Ahmed – including the logistics of travelling with his family, 
 
the physical and weapons training that he would hope to receive in the mountains, and 
how best he might assist the terrorist cause with those in Pakistan. 

Iqbal and Ahmed also discussed the possibility of Hussain travelling in the cause of 
 
Jihad. On several occasions Ahmed discussed with Hussain the desirability of Hussain 
travelling abroad for terrorist training and, thereafter, taking part in fighting.  Indeed, 
Ahmed encouraged Hussain to do so. Nevertheless, the discussions never got beyond 
the  aspirational  stage  –  albeit  that  in  June  2011  Iqbal  and  Ahmed  discussed 
facilitating  Hussain’s  travel  overseas,  and  thereafter  discussed  Hussain  going  to 
Pakistan  or  the  Yemen  for  training  purposes.    Hussain  was  believed  to  have  some 
£15,000 available to contribute to the terrorist cause overseas and to be awaiting a call 
to  leave  home.    Arshad  was  engaged  in  sending  money  to  Pakistan  for  terrorist 
purposes.

However,  starting  in  January  2011  (which  was  the  opening  date  alleged  in  the 
indictment)  aspects  of  their  activities  and  conversations  had  been  the  subject  of 
surveillance and covert recording by the authorities.  In consequence, on 2 September 
2011  (two  days  before  Iqbal  was  due  to  travel  to  Pakistan)  each  of  the  applicants’ 
 
homes was raided and searched.  The various items the subject of Counts 2-14 were 
recovered – they had, for the most part, been downloaded onto computers.  The nature 
of  the  publications,  particularly  the  electronic  versions  of  ‘Inspire’  magazines, 
illustrated  the  extent  to  which  each  had  exposed  himself  to  fundamentalist  beliefs, 
including  the  desirability  of  advancing  those  beliefs  by  terrorist  activities  –  both 
abroad and at home (as advocated in ‘Inspire’).  Iqbal also had Cyberscrub software 
which could be used to delete data from a computer. In addition, £13,400 in cash was 
 
found at Iqbal’s home address, and £2,500 in cash was found in Ahmed’s bedroom. 
 
The prosecution alleged that the £2,500 was money which Ahmed had collected for 
terrorist purposes. He, however, disputed that.  Many phones in different names were 
 
also  found,  the  examination  of  which  showed  significant  contact  between  each  of 
them.  One of the phones had been used by Iqbal to communicate with his contact in 
Pakistan, and to contact Ahmed whilst Ahmed was in Pakistan. Another was the one 
 
used by Ahmed in Pakistan – with the SIM card provided by Arshad. 

There were no arrests on 2 September 2011.  The applicants were eventually arrested 
 
on  24  April  2012  (which  was  the  day  before  the  closing  date  alleged  in  the 
indictment)  when  their  homes  were  again  searched.  The  property  found  at  Iqbal’s 
home  included  “39  ways  to  support  Jihad”  (which  had  been  downloaded  since  the 
previous search), concealed press cuttings relating to drone attacks, additional mobile 
phones (the number for one of which was stored in a phone belonging to Ahmed), a 
DVD for an Arab language course and a rucksack the content of which included a 
 
GPS  Navigator,  torches  and  a  compass.    The  property  found  at  Ahmed’s  home 
 
included, on his computer, a complete set of ‘Inspire’ magazines (all of which had 
been  downloaded  since  the  previous  search  and  included  the  latest  edition  which 
commemorated  the  9/11  attacks).  In  addition,  survival  equipment,  including  a  head 
torch and maps of Snowdonia, was recovered from a car connected with Ahmed that 
had  not  been  searched  before.  Nothing  of  significance  was  found  at  the  homes  of 
Arshad and Hussain. 

Iqbal, Ahmed and Arshad made no comment in their subsequent interviews. Hussain 
replied to some questions - otherwise he too made no comment.   

There was a preliminary hearing before Fulford J (as he then was) on 11 May 2012. 
On 31 May 2012 Fulford J allowed Ahmed to change his solicitors.  The trial was 
fixed  for  10  April  2013.    In  December  2012  (after  an  earlier  refusal  by  Fulford  J) 
Wilkie  J  allowed  Arshad  and  Hussain  to  change  their  solicitor  to  the  solicitor 
representing Ahmed.  A Plea and Case Management Hearing was fixed for 1 March 
2013. In the last week of February 2013, following discussions between the parties 
that had begun at the end of January 2013, the Bases of Plea were put forward.  At the 
 
PCMH  on  1  March  2013,  and  supported  by  the  prosecution,  each  of  the  four 
applicants sought a Goodyear indication. Wilkie J declined to give a full Goodyear 
 
indication, but did indicate the approach that he would take, as a matter of principle, 
to the sentence of each applicant and the areas in relation to which he would require 
further  information  and  upon  which  he  required  to  be  addressed  by  both  sides  in 
relation to sentence.  Thereafter each applicant pleaded guilty with a written Basis of

Plea  which,  as  we  have  already  touched  on,  was  not  contested  by  the  prosecution. 
There were Pre-Sentence Reports on Iqbal and Ahmed; neither Arshad nor Hussain 
requested such a report. 

 
91.	 

Combining  each  applicant’s  Application  for  a  Goodyear  indication,  Basis  of  Plea, 
Pre-Sentence Report (where appropriate) and mitigation: 

 

(1)  Iqbal accepted that he was an Islamist who sympathised with the insurgency in 
Afghanistan.  His  own  terrorist  intent  was  generalised,  ill  formed  and  never 
settled.  His  discussions  were  embryonic.    Although  he  contemplated  the 
possibility of committing an act of terrorism in the UK, he did not form a specific 
 
intent to do so.  Of all the matters discussed, he was most likely to have travelled 
abroad himself. He had intended to travel to Pakistan in September 2011, taking 
some  £10,000  in  cash  (which  he  had  saved  and  collected)  with  him  –  some  of 
which was to be used for terrorist purposes [Particulars (i) & (vi)]. He accepted 
that prior to that he had assisted Ahmed to travel to Pakistan in March 2011 by 
discussing with him methods to avoid detection, by putting him in touch with his 
contact  and  by  arranging  for  them  to  meet.  He  did  not  know  his  contact  in 
Pakistan  well,  but  believed  him  to  have  contacts  with  insurgents  in  the  border 
area of Pakistan and Afghanistan.  He had also given Ahmed £850 to pass on to 
his (Iqbal’s) contact for use for terrorist purposes overseas [Particulars (i) & (vi)]. 
However, he had thought that it was unlikely that his contact would be able to use 
Ahmed and that Ahmed would be sent home.  He had lost touch with his contact 
 
after Ahmed had returned. He accepted downloading, researching and discussing 
 
electronic  files  containing  practical  instructions  for  terrorist  attacks  [Particular 
(iv)].  He  also  accepted  discussing  methods,  materials  and  targets  for  a  terrorist 
attack (including exploring the possibility of constructing an IED by the method 
described in ‘Inspire’ – though he did not pursue that idea beyond the reflection 
and consideration stage). He further accepted that he had made enquiries with a 
friend from London about the feasibility of purchasing a firearm (though he had 
no specific plan as to what to do if he had acquired one and had last discussed it 
 
in February 2011) [Particular (v)].  In addition to Iqbal’s previous good character 
and employment record, reliance was placed in mitigation upon the fact that he 
 
was married with two young children, had been in custody since 24 April 2012; 
the fact that the prosecution accepted that there was no evidence of contemplation 
 
by him of further terrorist action in the UK or abroad after September 2011; that 
the prosecution also accepted that the evidence did not demonstrate that he posed 
an  imminent  threat  in  the  months  leading  to  his  eventual  arrest;  that  the  great 
majority of the items recovered from his address on 24 April 2012 were in his 
 
possession for innocent purposes; and that the Pre-Sentence Report indicated that 
he had been naïve and susceptible to the views and influence of others and posed 
a  low  risk  of  re-offending  (albeit  posing  a  high  risk  of  harm).    It  was  further 
submitted that there was no distinction to be drawn between his role and that of 
 
Ahmed; that he had never met Hussain; that he had only briefly met Arshad on 
one or two occasions; and that, in reality, his was a case about limited actions and 
about conversations which had never remotely come to fruition. 

 

(2)  Ahmed  accepted  that  between  1  January  2011  and  2  September  2011  he  had 
 
sought  to  travel  to  Pakistan  for  terrorist  training,  and  had  sought  to  achieve 
physical  fitness  and  to  acquire  outdoor  survival  equipment  to  take  with  him  to

Pakistan.  That had been his focus.  He had travelled to Pakistan in March 2011 
and  had  provided  less  than  £1,000  to  those  purporting  to  offer  training  (which 
money he understood was to be deployed for a terrorist purpose overseas), but 
had  been  rejected  and  had  returned  within  a  few  days  [Particulars  (i)  &  (vi)]. 
  
After his return he had maintained an aspiration to return to Pakistan for training, 
but  had  been  unsuccessful.  He  had  also  sought  to  travel  to  other  countries  to 
learn Arabic, but had again been unsuccessful.  In addition to his own travel, he 
had  sought  in  general  terms  to  encourage  Hussain  to  travel  to  Pakistan  for 
training [Particular (i)]. He had also been involved in the organisation of, and had 
participated  in,  mountain  walks  and  physical  exercise  with  others  –  one  of  the 
 
purposes of which had been to prepare himself for the rigours of a training camp 
[Particular (ii)]. He had purchased survival equipment for use in Pakistan, as well 
 
as  for  exercising  in  the  UK  [Particular  (iii)].    He  had  downloaded  and  read 
copies of ‘Inspire’ (some of the editions of which contained information of a type 
likely  to  be  useful  to  a  person  preparing  or  committing  an  act  of  terrorism) 
principally to access the ideological content [Particular (iv)]. On 22 April 2011, in 
the context of having read Inspire, he had discussed the possibility of engaging in 
terrorist action in the UK using an IED – however that had been speculative and 
nothing  had  been  done  to  further  the  idea.    Whilst  he  had  contemplated  the 
possibility  of  committing  an  act  of  terrorism  in  the  UK,  he  had  not  formed  a 
specific intent to do so.  On 12 May 2011 he had discussed obtaining firearms ­
 
however that too had been speculative.  On 25 May 2011 he had again discussed 
obtaining a firearm – but that had been in the context of an escalation of violence 
between  Muslim  groups  in  Luton.    Thereafter  he  had  neither  obtained,  nor 
 
attempted to obtain, a firearm.  [Particular (v)]. He had also received funds from 
 
others and provided funds to those whom he reasonably believed were engaged in 
terrorist activities overseas [Particular (vi)]. In the period after the police searches 
on 2 September 2011 there was, as the prosecution accepted, no evidence that he 
had pursued any ambition to leave the UK for training.  Reliance was placed in 
mitigation on a letter from Ahmed’s elder sister; the fact that he had since married 
 
a woman chosen by his family; and the assertion that he was not dangerous - as to 
which  reliance  was  placed  on  the  letter  from  the  sister,  references  in  the  Pre-
Sentence Report to the fact that he had exaggerated his experiences in Pakistan 
and had since disengaged from radical Islamist ideology voluntarily, and the lack 
of imminent threat posed by him between September 2011 and his arrest in April 
 
2012. 

 

(3)  Arshad had no intention of travelling to Pakistan himself, but accepted that he had 
become aware of his friend Ahmed’s intention to depart there for military training 
- but only shortly before Ahmed’s departure on 9 March 2011.  He had provided 
Ahmed  with  limited  practical  assistance  on  8  &  9  March  2011  –  namely  the 
 
provision of SIM cards (which had been left over after his own trip to Pakistan in 
 
2010 for a wedding), advice about a cover story and advice about how to blend in 
when  in  Pakistan  [Particular  (i)].  He  had  also  participated  in  physical  training 
and had undertaken a number of trips with Ahmed and others to Snowdonia and 
elsewhere.  It  was  submitted  that  he  had  gone  on  training  days  with  his  friend 
Ahmed  and  in  support  of  Ahmed’s  terrorist  ambitions  –  rather  than  that 
evidencing  his  own  terrorist  ambitions  [Particular  (ii)].  In  mid-August  2011  he 
 
had downloaded a number of electronic editions of ‘Inspire’, principally for their 
ideological content, but accepted that some editions contained information likely
--------

to be useful for a person preparing acts of terrorism, and that he was aware, in 
general terms, of the content [Particular (iv)]. However, he had never engaged in 
discussions about the construction or deployment of an IED in the UK, or about 
 
the  procurement  of  firearms.  He  had  given  Ahmed  £100  before  Ahmed’s 
departure  to  Pakistan  -  which  funds  were  to  be  passed  on  to  others  and  to  be 
deployed  for  terrorist  purposes  overseas  [Particular  (vi)].    In  addition  to  his 
previous good character and young family, reliance was placed in mitigation upon 
 
a letter from his older brother, his remorse, and the fact that, overall, his actions 
had been confined to a few days. 

(4)  Hussain had not formed a specific intent to commit an act of terrorism in the UK. 
 
He  accepted  that  between  mid-May  and  early  July  2011  he  had  discussed 
 
travelling  to  Pakistan  with  Ahmed,  that  Ahmed  had  encouraged  him  to  travel 
there, and that he himself had expressed a desire to do so – but, in the end, he had 
not made any plans as such. He had not facilitated or encouraged anyone else to 
do so either [Particular (i)].  He had not organised or encouraged physical training 
for terrorist purposes, but had participated in a walking trip to Snowdonia on 14 
July 2011 – one of the purposes of which was preparation for training in Pakistan 
[Particular  (ii)].  He  accepted  that  he  had  downloaded  electronic  editions  of 
‘Inspire’ in order to access their ideological content, and was aware that they also 
 
contained information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an 
 
act of terrorism [Particular (iv)]. On 12 & 25 May 2011 he had had discussions 
with Ahmed about sourcing a firearm, but had not taken that any further.  He had 
never discussed IEDs, nor was he aware of any discussion amongst others about 
them [Particular (v)].  Although he had intended to provide funds to others which 
he believed would be sent to those engaged in terrorism in Pakistan, he had not in 
fact done so [Particular (vi)]. In addition to his previous good character, reliance 
was placed in mitigation upon a letter from his father, the continuing support of 
his  family,  his  remorse,  and  the  doubts  and  fears  that  he  had  expressed  when 
indicating a desire to travel to obtain terrorist training. 

 

The judge was referred to a small number of cases, decided at first instance and in this 
Court, in which sentences had been imposed for s.5 offences -including the sentences 
that he himself had imposed at first instance in R v Chowdhury and Others, some of 
 
which were the subject of the appeal in Khan and Others (above). 

On  behalf  of  each  applicant  it  was  argued,  by  reference  to  the  relevant  Sentencing 
Council Guideline, and to the then recent guideline case of Caley and Others [2013] 2 
Cr.App.R. (S.) 47 (which Wilkie J had drawn to the attention of the parties), that there 
should be full discount, or at least more than 25% discount, for plea.  On behalf of 
Arshad and Hussain it was argued that their late change of representation meant that 1 
March 2013 was their first reasonable opportunity to indicate a plea.  On behalf of all 
the applicants it was argued that it was important for a precise Basis of Plea to be 
 
formulated for all of them before the first reasonable opportunity to indicate a plea 
could be said to have arisen for any of them or, alternatively, that the complex factual 
and  evidential  basis  of  the  prosecution  case  meant  that  this  was  a  case  where 
 
considerable  benefits  accrued  from  the  avoidance  of  a  scheduled  three  month  trial, 
and that that should be reflected by a discount of more than 25%.

94. 

It  was  further  argued  on  behalf  of  each  applicant  that  he  was  not  dangerous  in  the 
terms of s.229 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) and that, even if he

was,  the  effect  of  s.246A  of  the  2003  Act  (as  to  eligibility  for  release  under  the 
extended sentence provisions) was such that the court’s discretion should be exercised 
against the imposition of any extended sentence. 

 
95.	 

 
96.	 

 

In his full and clear sentencing remarks (which ran to 114 paragraphs) Wilkie J first 
 
set  out  the  facts  by  reference  to  each  of  the  numbered  Particulars,  and  then  the 
combined  effect  of  the  Basis  of  Plea  and  mitigation  in  the  case  of  each  applicant. 
  
Having recorded the procedural history, and identified the approach to discount for 
plea required by the combination of the relevant Sentencing Council Guideline and 
Caley  and  Others  [above],  Wilkie  J  concluded  that  (for  reasons  that  he  set  out  in 
detail)  none  of  the  applicants  had  indicated  an  intention  to  plead  guilty  at  the  first 
reasonable opportunity because  each well knew what he had done and did not need 
any  sophisticated  advice  to  inform  him  that  what  he  had  done  amounted  to  a  s.5 
 
offence.  In this regard Wilkie J noted that, at least until 20 September 2012, Arshad 
and Hussain had had the benefit of representation by counsel and solicitors (including 
the  benefit  of  one  or  more  consultations  with  leading  counsel)  and  that  from  19 
December 2012 they had had the benefit of representation by the solicitor who had 
been representing Ahmed since the end of May 2012.  Wilkie J further concluded that, 
although the evidence was multifaceted and substantial, the question of whether the 
applicants were guilty or not guilty, given what they knew they had done, was neither 
 
complex nor difficult, and that nor was this a case where a wholly exceptional course 
 
should  be  taken  by  giving  more  than  the  standard  discount  of  25%  for  pleas  at  a 
 
PCMH (which, in this case, had been postponed until just over a month before the 
trial date).  Hence he applied a discount of 25% in each case. 
 

 

Against the background that s.5 of the 2006 Act is a specified offence, Wilkie J then 
went on to consider the dangerousness provisions of the 2003 Act and the guidance 
 
given in Lang [2006] 1 WLR 2509; whether dangerousness was proved in the case of 
any  applicant;  and,  if  so,  whether  he  should  exercise  his  discretion  to  impose  an 
extended sentence.  In the result, he concluded (for reasons that he set out in detail) 
that  neither  Arshad  nor  Hussain  was  dangerous,  and  that  thus  he  would  pass 
 
determinate  sentences  upon  them.    In  contrast,  he  concluded  (for  reasons  which  he 
again set out in detail) that both Iqbal and Ahmed were dangerous, and exercised his 
 
discretion to impose an extended sentence upon each of them.  In particular, Wilkie J 
made  clear  that  he  regarded  the  discussions  in  which  they  had  respectively  been 
involved in relation to IEDs and firearms as being serious in nature (albeit that, by 
September 2011, no practical steps had been taken to carry them into effect).  Iqbal 
 
was, he concluded, naïve – but only about the extent to which he would continue to be 
under surveillance. 

 

97.	  Wilkie  J  summarised  his  conclusions  in  relation  to  the  dangerousness  of  Iqbal  and 

 

Ahmed, and the exercise of his discretion, as follows: 

“92. Despite the search on 2 September 2011, on 24 April there was evidence that he 
 
[Iqbal] continued to have the same views as had informed his earlier activity. He 
had  downloaded,  since  September  2011,  “39  ways  to  support  Jihad”.  He  had 
concealed press cuttings relating to drone attacks in Waziristan. He had mobile 
phones, one of which evidenced a continuing connection with Ahmed.  Also found 
were items capable of use in terrorist related activities or training for it such as 
torches,  a  rucksack  with  GPS  navigator  and  compass. 
I  have  been  told  by 
counsel that these are innocently possessed in connection with his work as a lorry

driver and to enable him to pray facing Mecca.  In addition there was found a 
DVD said by him to be an Arabic Koranic language course which relates to his 
religious  observances.    Whatever  may  be  the  truth  of  that,  I  regard  the 
 
downloading of the “39 ways” as significant. 

…………… 

 

95.  In my judgment, the nature persistence and extent of his [Iqbal’s] involvement in 
a series of different types of possible terrorist activity described above coupled 
with the evidence that he continued after September 2011 with the mindset which 
informed those actions satisfies me that he continues to be a person who poses a 
significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of  serious  harm  occasioned  by  the 
commission  by  him  of  further  specified  offences.  I  do  therefore  find  him  to  be 
dangerous….. 

100. Although he is younger than Iqbal, I do not regard that as a significant factor in 
assessing Ahmed’s dangerousness nor in comparing their culpability. In Ahmed’s 
 
case,  having  regard  to  the  nature,  intensity  and  persistence  of  his  preparatory 
activities  prior  to  2nd  September  and  having  regard  to  the  evidence  of  his 
 
continuing in the same mindset thereafter and until the search on 24 April 2012, I 
am satisfied that, as of that date, he was a person who posed a significant risk to 
members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission of further 
specified offences.  Whilst I have regard to the assessment of the authors of the 
pre-sentence report and their expertise in such matters, I am of the view that the 
effect of the material up to 24th April is not overborne by subsequent assertions by 
him of a change of heart since his remand into custody to the extent necessary to 
avoid  my  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  he  still  satisfies  the  dangerousness 
condition. 

 

101.  In  each  of  their  cases,  having  concluded  that  they  satisfy  the  dangerousness 
condition,  I  have  to  consider  whether  to  exercise  my  discretion  to  impose  an 
 
extended sentence……. 

102. In my judgment, however, in each of their cases, their persistent commitment to 
terrorist activity, in a number of different ways, over a significant period of time 
and,  in  each  case,  their  willingness  to  take  practical  steps  to  obtain  terrorist 
training abroad, marks them out as particularly dangerous.  This, coupled with 
the fact that, after their houses had been searched, and they were obviously under 
serious suspicion, they nonetheless continued to access material consistent with 
 
the mindset which informed their previous preparatory activities, persuades me 
that they continue to be ‘dangerous’ to such a degree that I should exercise my 
discretion to pass an extended sentence.  It is, in my judgment, appropriate for 
the public to be protected by requiring a direction from the Parole Board that 
 
they be released, before they are released prior to the expiration of the custodial 
term.  That direction will be given, or not, in the light of the circumstances which 
exist after they have served two thirds of the appropriate custodial sentence and 
only on the basis that the Parole Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary 
for the protection of the public that the offender should be confined.  Accordingly, 
I will impose on Iqbal and Ahmed an extended sentence….”

98.	  Wilkie J reminded himself that the fact that the main thrust of terrorist activity was 
 
aimed abroad was not a relevant factor in determining seriousness, and considered the 
sentences imposed in the other s.5 cases to which he had been referred – concluding 
that the offences were less serious than those with which he had dealt in Chowdhury 
 
& Others (considered on appeal in Khan & Others above). Wilkie J concluded that, in 
their different ways, Iqbal and Ahmed were the most serious offenders in this case 
and bore equal culpability. He underlined (at para.107 of his remarks) that Iqbal had 
not  only  facilitated,  through  his  contact,  the  travelling  by  Ahmed  to  Pakistan  for 
 
terrorist training, but had virtually completed the practical arrangements for himself to 
go to Pakistan for a similar purpose, taking with him a very significant sum for use, at 
least as to part, in supporting terrorist activity abroad.  In addition he had seriously 
discussed  with  Ahmed  the  assembling  and  deployment  of  an  IED  with  a  specific 
 
target  in  mind,  and  had  discussed  with  others  the  acquisition  of  a  firearm  and 
ammunition. 

 

99.	  Wilkie J further underlined (at para.108 of his remarks) that Ahmed had travelled to 
Pakistan  for  training  taking  funds  with  him  to  support  terrorism  abroad.    He  had 
persisted in his wish to do so, envisaging obtaining the necessary language skills by 
travelling, if need be, to obtain them.  He was actively involved in undertaking and 
encouraging relevant training in the UK for himself and others, including Arshad and 
Hussain.  Taking a steer from the change of direction envisaged in ‘Inspire’, he had 
joined with Iqbal in serious discussions about assembling and deploying one or more 
 
IEDs  and  possibly  targeting  a  Territorial  Army  base.    He  had  also  investigated 
obtaining a firearm and ammunition.  Against that background Wilkie J identified the 
 
notional custodial term after trial in relation to both Iqbal and Ahmed as being one of 
15 years, and then (having applied the 25% discount for plea) proceeded to impose 
 
the sentences upon them to which we have already made reference. 

 

100.	  Wilkie J then concluded (at para.111 of his remarks) that Arshad’s offending was at a 
lower  level  than  that  of  either  Iqbal  or  Ahmed.    Arshad,  he  said,  was  however  no 
“Walter Mitty” character, but was rather a serious minded person who had actively 
participated  in  assisting  and  encouraging  Ahmed  to  go  to  Pakistan  for  terrorist 
training, by providing him with a SIM card, supplying him with advice and support 
and  giving  money  to  support  terrorism  abroad.  Thereafter,  he  had  been  sufficiently 
serious in his commitment to undertake, repeatedly, training in mountainous and other 
terrain in preparation for terrorism.  He, too, had exposed himself to the influence of 
‘Inspire’ and to other texts of radical Islamist ideology.  Hence in his case Wilkie J 
 
identified a notional sentence after trial of 9 years’ imprisonment, and then (having 
again applied the discount for plea of 25%) imposed the sentence to which we have 
already made reference. 

 

101.	  Wilkie  J  then  concluded  (at  para.112  of  his  remarks)  that  Hussain’s  offending  was 
 
less  serious  than  that  of  Arshad.  He  was  also  younger  than  the  others.  He  had 
discussed  a  variety  of  types  of  terrorist  activity  and  expressed  a  willingness  and 
ambition to travel for training, to provide funding for terrorist purposes and to source 
a firearm for Ahmed – but it had never got beyond that, save for one attendance on a 
 
trip organised by Ahmed for military style training in a remote country area.  He too 
had accessed the literature advocating a violent fundamentalist Islamist ideology over 
a period of months prior to the searches on 2 September 2011.  Hence, in his case, 
Wilkie J identified a notional sentence after trial of 7 years’ imprisonment, and then

(having again applied the discount of 25%) imposed the sentence to which we have 
already made reference. 

Iqbal, Ahmed, Arshad & Hussain: Grounds & Submissions 
 

 

102.  Contrary to some of the Grounds originally advanced in writing, it was accepted in 
argument  that,  in  the  light  of  the  then  recent  decisions  in  Attorney  General’s 
Reference  (No.27  of  2013)  [2014]  EWCA  Crim  334  and  Francis  and  Lawrence 
 
[2014] EWCA Crim 334, Wilkie J had not been required to reduce the custodial terms 
 
of the extended sentences imposed in order to reflect the new early release scheme for 
 
such sentences. 

103.  Mr Wood QC, on behalf of Iqbal, argued that Wilkie J had erred in three respects: 

 

(1)  The finding of dangerousness and the imposition of an extended sentence. 

 

(2)  The length of the custodial term. 

(3)  Giving less than full discount for plea. 

 

104.  As  to  dangerousness,  Mr  Wood  submitted  that  there  were  failures,  errors  and 
weaknesses of reasoning in Wilkie J’s factual assessment which should give rise to 
anxious consideration and re-evaluation by the Court.  In this regard Mr Wood placed 
particular emphasis upon paras.92 & 95 of the sentencing remarks (quoted in para.97 
above), and e.g. the fact that phone seized in April 2012 had originally been seized in 
September 2011 and then handed back – hence its connection with Ahmed was old 
not new. Mr Wood relied upon the fact that Iqbal had not been arrested in September 
2011, and that the prosecution had accepted that in the period between then and his 
arrest  in  April  2012  the  evidence  did  not  demonstrate  that  he  posed  an  imminent 
 
threat, and that no further material in relation to preparatory acts had come to light. 
 
Nor,  Mr  Wood  submitted,  did  the  Pre-Sentence  Report  support  a  finding  of 
dangerousness.  As  to  the  imposition  of  the  extended  sentence  Mr  Wood  initially 
sought to argue that, having found dangerousness, Wilkie J had then failed to consider 
the  requisite  exercise  of  his  discretion  as  to  whether  an  extended  sentence  should 
actually be imposed.  However, that argument was abandoned after the passages in 
the sentencing remarks showing that Wilkie J had plainly done so were pointed out.  

 

105.  As  to  the  length  of  the  custodial  term  Mr  Wood,  whilst  acknowledging  that  it  had 
been  a  difficult  sentencing  exercise  for  all  involved,  submitted  that  (given,  in 
 
particular,  that  the  admitted  intention  was general  in  nature)  Wilkie  J  had  failed  to 
honour  Iqbal’s  Basis  of  Plea  in  a  number  of  respects  -  relying,  amongst  others,  on 
paragraphs 14-16, 39, and 42-43 of the sentencing remarks.  Thus, it was said, Wilkie 
J had taken inappropriate matters into  account.  Mr  Wood  submitted  that  a  notional 
custodial term after trial of 15 years was “way too long” and in completely the wrong 
bracket.    This  was  in  reality,  he  submitted,  a  case  involving  much  talk  which  had 
never progressed to preparatory action. 

 

106.  As  to  the  discount  for  plea,  Mr  Wood  submitted  that  this  was,  in  effect,  a  plea 
indicated at the first opportunity.  It was a complex and difficult case in which the 
defence needed to wait until they could see the case in the round, and the defendants 
needed legal advice before being able to indicate a plea – hence the case fell within
--------

Double-click to enter the short title  

the exception recognised in para.14 of the judgment in Caley (above).  It was simply 
not possible for a plea to be indicated until after negotiations involving all parties had 
taken  place  –  with  the  prosecution  being  aware  of  the  full  picture  and  thus  able  to 
 
decide upon the acceptability of all the defendants’ bases of plea.  In the alternative, 
the fact that a long trial had been avoided made it a proper case for full discount. 

107.	  On behalf of Ahmed, Mr Blaxland QC relied upon four Grounds, as follows: 

 

(1)  There was no proper evidential basis for the finding of dangerousness. 

(2)  The  judge  should  have  exercised  his  discretion  against  imposing  an  extended 

sentence. 

(3) The notional custodial term after trial was significantly too long. 

(4) Full discount for plea should have been given. 

 

108.	  As to the finding of dangerousness, Mr Blaxland strongly relied upon the content of 
Ahmed’s Pre-Sentence Report and, in particular, the fact that the authors recorded that 
 
he appeared to have disengaged from his previous ideology and that that reflected a 
reduction  in  risk.    Mr  Blaxland  submitted  that  the  fact  that  in  the  period  between 
September 2011 and April 2012 Ahmed had downloaded a complete set of ‘Inspire’ 
 
magazines (including the then latest edition which commemorated the 9/11 attacks), 
and that outward bound equipment was recovered in April 2012, did not displace the 
“very  clear”  conclusion  of  the  author  of  the  Pre-Sentence  Report  that  Ahmed  had 
disengaged.  Mr  Blaxland  relied  upon  the  fact  that  Ahmed  was  not  arrested  in 
September  2011,  and  the  undisputed  inference  to  be  drawn  from  that  that  the 
authorities did not believe that he posed an imminent threat.  Mr Blaxland also relied 
upon the approach in para.73 of the judgment in Khan & Others (see para.14 above). 
Thus, he submitted, Wilkie J’s finding of dangerousness was against the weight of the 
evidence. 
If  those  submissions  were  rejected,  Mr  Blaxland  invited  the  Court  to 
conclude that, given the terrorist notification provisions, this was a case in which the 
judge  should  have  exercised  his  discretion  against  the  imposition  of  an  extended 
 
sentence and imposed an appropriate determinate sentence instead.  

 

109.	  As  to  the  notional  custodial  term  after  trial,  Mr  Blaxland  submitted  that  it  was 
important to distinguish between what Ahmed did by way of actual preparation and 
what  he  talked  about  but  took  no  further.    The  many  hours  of  recordings  of 
conversations  gave  a  clear  evidential  picture  of  what  Ahmed  and  the  others  were 
actually  up  to  –  which  amounted  to  much  talk  but  little  by  way  of  action.    For 
example,  whilst  there  had  been  talk  about  Improvised  Explosive  Devices  and 
firearms,  no  explosive  materials  or  firearms  had  ever  been  obtained.  Ahmed’s 
principal focus had been on travel abroad and training – hence the determinate term 
should not have exceeded the maximum for a  s.6 offence.  Ahmed also had strong 
 
personal  mitigation.  Whilst  rightly  accepting  that  comparison  with  other  cases 
 
decided  on  their  own  particular  facts  did  not  assist  a  great  deal,  Mr  Blaxland 
submitted that, in Ahmed’s case, Wilkie J had “got it badly wrong”. 

 

 

110.	  As  to  discount  for  plea,  Mr  Blaxland  accepted  that  normally  there  could  be  no 
complaint about the award of a 25% discount for a plea first indicated at a PCMH 
(especially when it took place relatively shortly before trial).  He submitted, however,

that given the breadth of s.5 there were problems in this case (which were likely to 
occur  in  other  s.5  cases)  in  view  of  the  broad  nature  of  the  Particulars.    That  had 
required advice to be tendered before pleas were indicated – which advice could only 
sensibly be given once the picture in the round could be seen, particularly given the 
problems in representation. It was also impracticable and undesirable to have semi-
public negotiations about the basis of plea.  In any event, the pleas had resulted in a 
huge saving of public money and Wilkie J should have regarded the case as being one 
where the exercise of his residual flexibility, as explained at para.28 of the judgment 
 
in  Caley  (above),  required  the  award  of  full  discount.    Hence,  by  whichever  route, 
there should have been full discount in this particular case. 

111.	  On behalf of Arshad, Mr Bennathan QC relied on two Grounds, as follows: 

 

(1)  The  notional  sentence  after  trial  of  9  years’  imprisonment  was  manifestly 

 

excessive. 

(2)  There should have been full discount for plea. 

 

112.	  As to the notional sentence after trial, Mr Bennathan underlined that the particulars of 
conduct in preparation for giving effect to his intention that Arshad had admitted in 
his Basis of Plea were limited to facilitating the overseas travel of Ahmed (i.e. two 
months  after  Iqbal  and  Ahmed  had  discussed  Ahmed  travelling  to  Pakistan  and 
 
pretending to be a member of the Tablighi sect as cover, he had two conversations 
 
with his friend Ahmed in the course of which he encouraged Ahmed to go, saying e.g. 
“true Muslims march towards death and don’t come back”, gave advice as to how a 
 
Tablighi  would  dress,  gave  Ahmed  two  appropriate  hats,  gave  advice  about  not 
drinking the water and avoiding being cheated by taxi drivers, and gave him a local 
SIM card - which Arshad had obtained on an innocent visit to Pakistan); participating 
in physical training (namely trips with Ahmed and others to Snowdonia and to the 
countryside near Luton, and playing football on a number of occasions – but not with 
the  intention  of  going  to  Pakistan  or  elsewhere  for  training  himself);  downloading 
electronic files containing practical instructions for terrorism (which was done over a 
 
period  of  three  days  in  early  August  2011  and  involved  the  bulk  downloading  of 
“Jihadist” material including copies of ‘Inspire’ but not, albeit that he was aware in 
general terms of the nature of the material, the accessing of all the copies of ‘Inspire’ - 
given  that  his  principal  interest  was  in  their  ideological  content,  and  he  had  not 
downloaded  any  further  material  after  2  September  2011);  and  supplying  funds  for 
terrorism (namely the £100 that he had given to Ahmed in the hope that it would be 
 
given to those with whom Ahmed hoped to train for terrorism). 

 

113.	  Thus Mr Bennathan submitted that, by reference to other s.5 cases (albeit decided on 
 
their  own  facts)  and  to  the  statutory  maxima  of  7  years’  custody  for  encouraging 
terrorism  (contrary  to  s.1  of  the  2006  Act)  and  10  years’  custody  for  providing 
training  (contrary  to  s.6  of  the  2006  Act),  and  given  the  mitigation  provided  by 
Arshad’s  previous  good  character,  good  work  record,  age  and  the  impact  on  his 
family (albeit accepting that personal mitigation is of less importance in cases of this 
 
type), the notional sentence after trial was “far, far too high”. 

 

114.	  As  to  the  appropriate  discount  for  plea,  Mr  Bennathan  submitted  that  in  saying  (at 
para.74 of his sentencing remarks) that this was not one of those cases in which “a 
wholly exceptional course should be taken of giving more than the standard discount

for a plea of guilty at the PCMH” Wilkie J applied the wrong test – in that in dealing 
with residual flexibility at paras.28 & 29 of the judgment in Caley (above) the Court 
did  not  so  limit  the  exercise  of  a  judge’s  discretion.    Hence,  in  the  particular 
circumstances of this case, full discount for plea should have been given. 

115.	  On behalf of Hussain, Mr Zahir also relied on two Grounds, as follows: 

 

(1)  The  notional  sentence  after  trial  of  7  years’  imprisonment  was  manifestly 

 

excessive. 

(2) 	 In the particular circumstances of this case, there should have been full discount 
 

for plea. 
 

 

 

116.	  As  to  the  notional  sentence  after  trial,  Mr  Zahir  emphasised  that  the  particulars  of 
 
conduct in preparation that Hussain had admitted in his Basis of Plea were limited to 
the period between May 2011 and September 2011 and to planning travel overseas 
(but  only  to  the  very  limited  extent  of  being  encouraged  by  Ahmed  to  travel  to 
Pakistan for training and on occasion expressing a desire to do so); participating in 
physical training (but only by going on a walking trip to Snowdonia with Ahmed and 
others on 14 July 2011 – in part in preparation for training in Pakistan); downloading 
electronic files containing instruction for a terrorist attack (by downloading a number 
of  electronic  editions  of  ‘Inspire’  –  principally  in  order  to  access  the  ideological 
 
content, but accepting that some of the editions contained information of a kind likely 
 
to  be  useful  to  a  person  preparing  an  act  of  terrorism);  discussing  firearms  (with 
Ahmed on 12 & 25 May 2011, when they discussed the possible sourcing of a firearm 
–  but  he  had  never  attempted  to  obtain  a  firearm  and  had  never  formed  a  specific 
intent to commit an act of terrorism in the UK); collecting and supplying funds (but 
 
limited to intending to provide funds to others who he believed would send them to 
 
those engaged in terrorism in Pakistan) 

 

117.	  Against  that  background,  Mr  Zahir  submitted  that  Hussain  was  very  much  at  the 
lowest  end  of  the  wide  spectrum  of  s.5  offences,  and  that  when  compared  to  the 
sentences imposed in other cases, and given the mitigating features (including the fact 
that that Hussain was aged only 20/21 during the material period, his previous good 
character, the fact that his offending was largely talk that never went anywhere and 
involved a degree of bravado, the fact that after the search of his home in September 
 
2011  his  offending  had  ceased  and  that  the  prosecution  accepted  that  there  was  no 
evidence  demonstrating  that  he  posed  an  imminent  threat)  the  appropriate  notional 
sentence  after  trial  in  his  case  was  shorter than  7  years.    In  the  Grounds  originally 
submitted on Hussain’s behalf it was argued that the correct sentence in his case was 
one of no more than 5 years’ imprisonment.  

 

118.	  As to discount for plea, Mr Zahir argued that Hussain’s previous solicitors had failed 
to provide him with sensible advice, and that it was not until after his representation 
order had been transferred to his current solicitors in December 2012 that work on his 
case (which involved voluminous papers) had truly begun.  Mr Zahir further argued 
that  given,  amongst  other  things,  that  Hussain  was  aged  only  21  when  he  was 
 
charged,  that  a  substantial  amount  of  key  prosecution  evidence  was  only  served  in 
September  2012,  that  (in  Hussain’s  particular  circumstances)  legal  advice  was 
 
required to help him as to whether he was guilty or not, that his current lawyers could

not have acted more quickly than they did, and for the sound reasons advanced by the 
other applicants, full discount should have been given. 

119.  On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Hill QC submitted, in short, that: 

 

(1)  It  was  quite  wrong,  in  particular  in  the  cases  of  Iqbal  and  Ahmed,  to  seek  to 
equate the Respondent’s acceptance that, in the period between September 2011 
 
and April 2012, there was no evidence that either posed an imminent threat (such 
as  to  require  an  operational  decision  to  arrest  them),  with  a  concession  that 
neither was dangerous for the purposes of the 2003 Act.  Mindful of all the served 
material,  it  was  axiomatic  that  the  police  and  the  Security  Service  maintained 
close  coverage  upon  the  applicants  during  the  period  between  the  two  police 
searches, and imminence of threat and dangerousness were not one and the same 
 
thing.  The Respondent had never conceded, as had been asserted at one stage on 
Ahmed’s behalf, that he had not posed a threat in September 2011. 

(2)  	 Rather,  for  the  reasons  that  he  carefully  explained,  Wilkie  J  was  obviously 
entitled to conclude that Iqbal and Ahmed were dangerous, and to exercise his 
 
discretion (as he undoubtedly did) to impose an extended sentence in each case. 
 
He was, for example, not bound by the views expressed in Ahmed’s Pre-Sentence 
Report, and clearly entitled to take into account what had been found during the 
searches  at  the  homes  of  Iqbal  and  Ahmed  in  both  September  2011  and  April 
2012. 

(3) 	 The applicants had each pleaded guilty to a joint s.5 offence, rather than to any 
other  offence,  and  in  circumstances  in  which  the  activities  alleged  in  the 
remaining counts were subsumed in those pleas.  In relation to s.5 offences the 
prosecution  were  entitled  to  rely  upon  a  general  intent  to  commit  an  act  of 
terrorism (as defined) and/or an intention to assist one or more others to do so.  It 
was perfectly possible for the applicants to have indicated what broad type(s) of 
 
act of terrorism they intended to commit, or that they intended to assist others to 
 
commit  and,  failing  that,  it  was  open  to  the  judge  to  draw  any  appropriate 
inferences, consistent with each applicant’s Basis of Plea, as to what the general 
intention of each involved. 

(4) 	 Viewed overall, the instant case involved a course of conduct over many months, 
including in the cases of Iqbal and Ahmed facilitation for and/or actual travel, as 
well as multiple discussions of attack planning, together with discussions about 
firearms and improvised explosive devices.  Thus, even if it was right to have the 
maximum for offences contrary to ss.5 & 8 of the 2006 Act in mind at the outset, 
the application of aggravating features would result in the same custodial terms 
being achieved.  In addition, the joint venture nature of much of the surveilled 
and  recorded  activity  was  an  important  feature  of  the  case  in  general  – 
notwithstanding  the  comparative  roles  and  therefore  the  limited  culpability  of 
Arshad and Hussain as compared to Iqbal and Ahmed – as reflected in the marked 
distinctions in the respective notional custodial terms after trial. 

(5)  This  was  clearly  not  a  case  in  which  the  pleas  had  been  indicated  at  the  first 
reasonable opportunity.  Wilkie J, who was a member of the Court in Caley, was 
 
right to conclude that all the applicants “well knew what they had done and did 
not need any sophisticated legal advice to inform them that what they had done

amounted to the section 5 offence”. Whilst discussions between the parties had 
begun at the end of January 2013, the pleas did not crystallise until very shortly 
before the PCMH on 1 March 2013, which was some ten months after charge and 
only some six weeks before the trial date.  The Respondent had not been able to 
scale  down  its  preparation  until  that  stage  -  by  which  time  the  majority  of  the 
necessary  pre-trial  work  (including  about  three  quarters  of  the  electronic 
presentation  material)  had  been  completed.    Hence  this  was  not  a  case  for  the 
exercise  of  residual  flexibility  to  give  full  discount.   Wilkie  J  had  clearly  been 
entitled to limit discount for plea to 25%. 

Iqbal, Ahmed, Arshad & Hussain: Conclusion 
 

 
120.	 

In our view Wilkie J was clearly entitled to conclude, for the reasons that he gave, that 
both Iqbal and Ahmed were dangerous.  The prosecution’s concession that there was 
no evidence that, in the period between September 2011 and April 2012, they posed 
an imminent threat (such as to require their arrest) did not prevent such a conclusion. 
As the Respondent argued, in the circumstances of this case, imminence of threat and 
dangerousness under the 2003 Act are not one and the same thing. Equally clearly, 
Wilkie J was entitled to take into account, amongst other things, the content of the 
recorded discussions involving Iqbal and/or Ahmed (which he was equally entitled to 
conclude  were  serious  in  nature  -  notwithstanding  that  they  did  not  result  in  any 
crystallisation of intent, nor in any further action prior to the searches in September 
 
2011), as well as what was found during the searches in both September 2011 and 
April 2012.  Nor can we see any arguably significant failures, errors and weaknesses 
 
of reasoning in Wilkie J’s factual assessment, and (to the extent that he did) he was 
plainly  entitled,  given  the  wider  evidence,  to  reach  a  different  conclusion  those 
expressed in the Pre-Sentence Reports in relation to Iqbal and Ahmed.  Nor is there 
any  arguable  merit  in  the  submission  that  he  should  have  exercised  his  discretion 
against the imposition of an extended sentence. 

 

121.	  As to the 25% discount for plea, it will be recalled that Wilkie J was a member of the 

Court in Caley (above) and that it was he who drew the attention of the parties to it.  

122.	  At para. 28 of the judgment in Caley the Court said: 

 

“…..A third case which is sometimes treated as meriting exceptional treatment is the 
exceptionally long and complex trial, whether in fraud or otherwise (such as people 
 
trafficking, complex drug cases, serial sex abuse cases with many complainants and 
the like). Since the rationale of reduction for plea is the public benefit which we have 
described, we leave open the possibility that, unusually, some considerable benefits 
may well ensue from a plea of guilty even at a late stage.  Care must however be 
taken  with  such  a  proposition  so  that  it  does  not  become  routine………”  (our 
 
emphasis). 

 

123.	  At para.68 of his sentencing remarks Wilkie J accurately summarised the effect of that 
part  of  the  judgment  in  Caley.  Whether  the  words  that  we  have  highlighted  are 
accurately summarised in a phrase to the effect that the giving of a greater discount 
than the standard discount is “a wholly exceptional course” (which Wilkie J used at 
para.74  of  his  sentencing  remarks)  or  “an  exceptional  course”  may  be  debated. 
However,  we  are  clear  that  Wilkie  J  did  not  inappropriately  fetter  his  residual 
flexibility in relation to discount for plea.  In the particular circumstances of this case,
--------

and for the reasons that he gave, the pleas simply did not merit a discount in excess of 
25%.  The contrary is, in our view, unarguable.   

124.	  That leaves, in the case of each applicant, the question of whether it is arguable that 

 

his notional custodial term after trial was manifestly excessive. 

 

125.	  By his plea of guilty each applicant admitted that he intended to carry out an act of 
 
terrorism  (as  defined)  and/or  to  assist  another  to  do  so.    As  we  have  noted  above, 
s.5(2)  of  the  2006  Act  makes  clear  that  it  is  irrelevant  whether  the  intention  (and 
preparations) relate to one or more particular acts of terrorism, acts of terrorism of a 
particular description, or acts of terrorism generally.  In this case each asserted that his 
intention was general in nature.  It is a striking feature of the Bases of Plea that whilst, 
in a number of instances, there were statements as to what the general intention did 
not include, there was little spelling out of the broad sort(s) of acts of terrorism that 
were  encompassed  within  the  scope  of  the  admitted  general  intent.    Accordingly, 
 
Wilkie  J  was  entitled  to  reach  his  own  conclusions  in  that  regard  provided  that,  in 
 
each case, his finding was consistent with the relevant Basis of Plea.  It is clear that he 
 
concluded, whether explicitly or implicitly, that the broadly intended acts were at the 
upper  end  of  the  spectrum  of  operational  acts  of  terrorism  –  i.e.  killing  people, 
endangering life, and other serious violence.  In our view he was entitled to do so.  As 
he  rightly  reminded  himself,  the  fact  that  the  main  thrust  of  the  terrorist  acts  was 
aimed abroad was not a relevant factor in determining seriousness.  It follows that the 
 
starting  point  in  the  consideration  of  each  custodial  term  was  one  of  life 
imprisonment. 

It was then necessary to examine the factual nexus between each applicant’s conduct 
in  preparation  for  giving  effect  to  his  intention  and  the  future  commission  of  the 
intended  act(s)  of  terrorism.    Again,  that  is  what  Wilkie  J  did.    We  detect,  in  that 
 
process, no arguably significant departure by him from any Basis of Plea. 

Iqbal,  who  was  an  Islamist  who  sympathised  with  the  insurgency  in  Afghanistan, 
clearly intended both to commit an act or acts of terrorism himself (whether alone or 
in conjunction with others) and to assist others to commit such acts.  His conduct in 
preparation for giving affect to those intentions (which included acting with others) 
took place over an extended period of time and included use of his contact in Pakistan 
(who in turn was in contact with insurgents) to assist Ahmed to travel to Pakistan in 
March 2011 for terrorist training with a view to terrorist action. He also gave Ahmed 
£850 to be passed on to his (Iqbal’s) contact in Pakistan for use for terrorist purposes. 
 
Ahmed  did  travel  to  Pakistan  -  albeit  that  he  did  not  obtain  any  training.    Iqbal 
 
downloaded electronic files containing practical instructions for terrorist attacks.  He 
also  conducted  serious,  albeit  embryonic,  discussions  about  methods,  materials  and 
targets for a terrorist attack (including exploring the possibility of constructing an IED 
by  the  method  described  in  an  edition  of  ‘Inspire’)  and  about  the  feasibility  of 
obtaining a firearm.  He had virtually completed the practical arrangements to travel 
to  Pakistan  himself  in  early  September  2011  for  terrorist  training  with  a  view  to 
terrorist action, intending to take with him some £10,000 in cash (which he had saved 
and  collected)  –  some  of  which  was  to  be  used  for  terrorist  purposes.    It  was  only 
because of the intervention by the authorities that he did not go to Pakistan.  Whilst, in 
the  sense  described  by  the  Respondent,  there  was  no  evidence  that  he  posed  an 
imminent threat in the months between September 2011 and his arrest in April 2012, 
he had during that period downloaded “39 ways to support Jihad”

128.	  As  in  Dart’s  case  (see  para.72  above)  the  prosecution  were  clearly  entitled  in 
accordance with Iqbal & Iqbal (above) to charge a s.5 offence, and the judge was not 
 
bound by the maximum for a s.6 offence. 

 

 

129.	  Having  taken  into  account  all  the  relevant  factors  advanced  in  mitigation,  Wilkie  J 
concluded that, in Iqbal’s case, the appropriate notional custodial term after trial was 
15 years.  Given the dual intention, the nexus of the conduct in preparation in relation 
to each intention, the period of time of the conduct, the involvement with others, and 
the  purpose  of  sentence  in  this  type  of  case  (tempered  by  the  need  to  avoid 
disproportionality)  it  seems  to  us  that  that  term,  albeit  tough,  was  within  the 
 
appropriate range.  Accordingly it is not, in our view, arguable that Iqbal’s ultimate 
sentence was manifestly excessive. 

 

130.	  Ahmed  also  clearly  intended  both  to  commit  an  act  or  acts  of  terrorism  himself 
(whether alone or in conjunction with others) and to assist others to commit such acts. 
 
Like  Iqbal  his  conduct  in  preparation  for  giving  effect  to  those  intentions  (which 
included acting with others) took place over an extended period of time.  It included 
 
the fact that in March 2011 he had travelled to Pakistan for the purpose of obtaining 
terrorist training with a view to terrorist action.  Albeit that he had failed to obtain the 
training, he had taken money with him - somewhat less than £1,000 of which he had 
given  to  those  purporting  to  offer  training  to  be  deployed  for  a  terrorist  purpose 
overseas.  After his return he had been persistent in his desire and planning to obtain 
training  in  the  end.  He  had  also  sought,  in  general  terms,  to  persuade  Hussain  to 
travel  to  Pakistan  for  training.  He  had  purchased  survival  equipment  for  use  in 
Pakistan, and for exercising in the UK.  He had been involved in the organisation of, 
and had participated in, mountain walks and physical exercises with others – in part to 
prepare  himself  for  the  rigours  of  a  training  camp.    He  had  downloaded  copies  of 
‘Inspire’ and, in that context, had seriously (but speculatively) discussed engaging in 
terrorist  action  using  an  IED  and  (on  one  occasion)  firearms.    Between  September 
2011 and April 2012 he had downloaded a complete set of ‘Inspire’ magazines 

 

131.	  Against that background it seems to us that Wilkie J was entitled to conclude that, in 
their different ways, the culpability of Ahmed and Iqbal was broadly equal.  Hence, 
 
having  taken  into  account  all  the  relevant  mitigating  features  (which  were  also 
 
broadly  equal)  he  identified  a  notional  custodial  term  after  trial  of  15  years.    For 
 
broadly the same reasons as our conclusion in relation to Iqbal, it seems to us that that 
term,  albeit  tough,  was  within  the  appropriate  range  in  relation  to  Ahmed  as  well. 
 
Accordingly  it  is  not,  in  our  view,  arguable  that  Ahmed’s  ultimate  sentence  was 
manifestly excessive. 

 

132.	  Arshad’s  intention  was  to  assist  others  to  commit  acts  of  terrorism.  Wilkie  J  was 
entitled to conclude, as he did, that Arshad was a serious minded person.  Arshad’s 
conduct  in  preparation  for  giving  effect  to  his  intention  took  place  on  a  relatively 
limited  number  of  days  but  was  spread  across  the  period  between  March  and 
September 2011.  In the run up to his friend Ahmed’s departure to Pakistan in March 
2011 he had two conversations with him in the course of which, knowing that Ahmed 
was going with the intention of undergoing terrorist training with a view to terrorist 
 
action, he encouraged him to do so and gave him practical assistance and advice in a 
 
number of respects.  He gave Ahmed £100 to pass on to others in Pakistan for use for 
 
terrorist purposes overseas.  After Ahmed’s return he participated in physical training 
on  a  number  of  occasions  with  others,  including  Ahmed,  in  support  of  Ahmed’s

terrorist ambitions.  Over three days in early August he downloaded a great deal of 
“Jihadist”  material,  including  copies  of  ‘Inspire’  and  thereafter  accessed  a  number 
(but not all) of the copies of ‘Inspire’. His principal, but not his sole, interest in doing 
so was the extremist ideological content.   

 

 

133.	  Having  taken  into  account  all  the  relevant  factors  advanced  in  mitigation,  Wilkie  J 
concluded  that,  in  Arshad’s  case,  the  appropriate  notional  custodial  term  after  trial 
was 9 years.  In all the circumstances that was, in our view, too severe.  Accordingly 
 
in his case we propose to grant leave, and to treat the hearing of the application as the 
hearing  of  the  appeal.  We  have  concluded  that  the  correct  notional  custodial  term 
 
after trial in his case was one of 7 years, resulting after discount for plea in a sentence 
of  5  years  3  months’  imprisonment.    In  his  case  therefore  we  quash  the  sentence 
imposed and substitute for it a sentence of 5 years 3 months’ imprisonment. 

 

134.	  Wilkie J correctly concluded that Hussain’s offending was less serious than that of 
Arshad.  Hussain is also younger than the rest. His intention appears to have been to 
commit acts of terrorism.  His conduct in preparation for giving effect to that intention 
involved,  as  set  out  in  para.  116  above,  limited  planning  to  travel  overseas, 
participating  in  physical  training  on  one  occasion,  downloading  electronic  files 
containing  instruction  for  a  terrorist  attack  (principally  in  order  to  access  the 
 
ideological content), discussing sourcing a firearm on two occasions, and intending to 
 
provide funds to others (but never actually doing so). 

 

 

135.	  Having  taken  into  account  all  the  relevant  factors  advanced  in  mitigation,  Wilkie  J 
concluded that, in Hussain’s case, the appropriate notional custodial term after trial 
In  all  the  circumstances  that  was  also,  in  our  view,  too  severe. 
was  7  years. 
 
Accordingly in Hussain’s case we propose to grant leave, and to treat the hearing of 
 
the  application  as  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.    We  have  concluded  that  the  correct 
notional custodial term after trial in his case, particularly bearing in mind his age, was 
one of 5 years, resulting after discount for plea in a sentence of 3 years 9 months’ 
 
imprisonment.  In his case therefore we quash the sentence imposed and substitute for 
 
it  a  sentence  of  3  years  9  months’  imprisonment.    It  follows  that  his  terrorist 
notification period is automatically reduced to one of 10 years 

 

136.	  For the avoidance of doubt, we have considered whether the substituted sentences in 
 
relation  to  Arshad  and  Hussain  result  in  any  unfair  disparity  with  the  sentences 
 
imposed on Iqbal and Ahmed, and have concluded that they do not. 

Overall Conclusion

R (K) v SSHD 

 

MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE:  

INTRODUCTION 

1.  This  is  a  claim  for  damages  for  unlawful  administrative  detention.  The  Claimant,  a 
Turkish national, was detained by the immigration authorities from 10 December 2010, 
when  his  prison  sentence  expired  and  a  deportation  order  was  made,  until  21  October 
2011, when he was released on bail. The Claimant challenged his deportation on Article 
3  ECHR  grounds  and  was  granted  refugee  status  on  14  September  2012.  By  these 
proceedings, the Claimant claims that his immigration detention for this period of over 
10  months  was  unlawful  because  of  his  mental  condition  and  amounted  to  the  tort  of 
false imprisonment, for which he claims he is entitled to more than nominal damages. 

Grounds of challenge 

2.  The Claimant challenges the lawfulness of his detention on two main grounds: 

(1)  First,  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  lawfully  to  consider,  or  apply,  her  policy  in 
Chapter  55.10  Enforcement  Guidance  and  Instructions  (“EIG”)  (regarding  the 
detention  of  persons  with  serious  mental  illness  that  cannot  be  satisfactorily 
managed in detention), both at the outset of detention and thereafter at the time of 
periodical reviews. 

(2)  Second, the Secretary of State breached Articles 3 and 8 ECHR and s 6(1) of the 
Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) in respect of the Claimant’s detention because 
the Claimant was suffering at the time from a serious mental illness of which the 
Secretary of State was, or ought to have been, aware and failed to take the steps 
reasonably available to her, by either providing suitable treatment or releasing the 
Claimant from detention. 

3.  The  Claimant  seeks  (i)  a  declaration  that  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  unlawful;  (ii)  a 
declaration that the Claimant’s Article 3 and 8 rights have been breached, contrary to s 
6(1) HRA; and (iii) damages for false imprisonment and under s.8 HRA in respect of the 
breach of Articles 3 and 8 ECHR. 

Administrative Court list 

4.  The rules provide that claims for damages alone may not be brought in the Administrative 
Court: see CPR 54.3(2) (which provides “a claim for judicial review may include a claim 
for damages … but may not seek such a remedy alone”) and R(D) v Home Office [2006] 
1WLR 1003 at [58] and [105].  The claim for a declaration that the past detention was 
unlawful  adds  nothing  to  the  claim  for  damages.  The  claim  for  judicial  review  was 
lodged  on  22  September  2011,  i.e.  whilst  the  Claimant  was  in  detention  and  shortly 
before his release.  Following his release, there was an application for the matter to be 
transferred to the Queen’s Bench List. However, exceptionally, this case was allowed to 
remain in the Administrative Court list because of the legal issues raised.  

5.  I  nevertheless  draw  attention  to  the  following  pertinent  general  observations  of 

Dingemans J in Swaran v. SSHD [2014] EWHC 1062 (Admin):
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

 

“The  Administrative  Court  seeks  to  make  speedy  decisions  about  the  legality  of 
administrative  decision-making.  The  Administrative  Court  is  heavily  listed  and 
should not become clogged up with what are, in reality, claims only for damages for 
wrongful detention within the jurisdiction of the Queen’s Bench or County Court. 
The  procedures  of  the  Administrative  Court  are,  in  any  event,  not  best  suited  to 
determine  contested  historic  events  where  disclosure  and  cross-examination  of 
witnesses may be necessary.” 

THE FACTS 
 
6.  The Claimant claims damages in tort for the whole period of his immigration detention 
from 10 December 2011 to 21 October 2012. The claim divides the detention into two 
periods: from 10 December 2010 to 19 May 2011 (‘the First Period’) and from 20 May 
2011 to release on 21 October 2011 (‘the Second Period’). The date of 19 May 2011 was 
selected on the basis that, from that date, express reference was made to the Claimant’s 
mental health in the monthly detention reviews. 

 
7.  The following lengthy summary of the facts was drawn up and agreed by Counsel.  It is to 
be queried whether a 14-page summary of the facts is either necessary or proportionate in 
a case such as this. It would not be a sensible use of court time, however, to attempt to cut 
it down. 

8.  The Claimant was born on 5 May 1972.  He is a national of Turkey and is of Kurdish 

ethnicity. 

9.   On  12  February  2000,  the  Claimant  arrived  in  the  UK  from  Turkey  via  Germany  and 
claimed  asylum  upon  arrival.  The  Claimant  indicated  that  he  had  come  directly  from 
Turkey.  Checks  were  made  and  the  German  immigration  authorities  informed  the 
Secretary of State that the Claimant had entered Germany on 11 October 1992 and was 
given leave to remain there until 19 November 1999.  On 4 November 1999 the Claimant 
had claimed asylum in Germany but had left before the claim was decided. The German 
asylum claim was refused on 17 March 2000, after the Claimant arrived in the UK.  

10.  The Secretary of State states that the Claimant was listed as an absconder on 8 September 
2000.  There  is  a  dispute  between  the  parties about  when  the  Claimant  was  required  to 
report and whether he did report at any stage but this cannot be resolved on the material 
available.  

11. On 20 October 2000, the Claimant’s UK asylum claim was refused and certified on safe 
third country grounds. That decision was served on the Claimant at an interview at the 
Secretary of State’s offices on 20 October 2000.  

12. On  21  December  2004,  a  notice  of  the  Claimant’s  asylum  appeal  hearing  listed  for  14 
January  2005  was  sent  to  Kidd  Rapinet  Solicitors.  On  13  January  2005,  the  solicitors 
wrote to the Secretary of State informing them that they are no longer in contact with the 
Claimant and that he may therefore be unaware of the hearing. On 17 January 2005, the 
Claimant’s appeal was dismissed in his absence.   

13.  On  30  March  2006,  the  Claimant  was  convicted  of  common  assault  at  Marylebone 

Magistrates Court and fined £75.

14. On 14 September 2006, there is a referral from the Claimant’s GP to a plastic surgeon at 
Chelsea  and  Westminster  hospital.  The  referral  concerned  treatment  for  scars  on  the 
Claimant’s head which he reported came from a fight in 2005 during which he was hit 
with a pistol and shot on the right side of the head (without penetrating the brain). 

15.  The  Claimant  came  to  the  attention  of  the  UKBA  on  25  February  2007  when  he  was 
arrested for drink driving and possession of cocaine. On 26 February 2007, the Claimant 
was bailed to appear on 12 June 2007. 

16.  On  12  March  2007,  the  Claimant  was  issued  with  an  IS96,  notification  of  Temporary 
Admission, requiring him to report to the Secretary of State’s offices on 22 March 2007 
and  weekly  thereafter.  The  Claimant  complied  with  the  reporting  requirement  until  24 
May 2007 when he ceased reporting.  

17.  On 25 May 2007, the Claimant was convicted at Southwark Crown Court on 3 counts of 
handling stolen goods and was given a 2-year suspended sentence and required to do 240 
hours of community work.   

18.  On  9  June  2007  the  Claimant  was  listed  as  an  absconder  having  failed  to  report  on  3 

consecutive occasions.  

19.  Between 01 October 2007 and 31 January 2008 the Claimant committed ‘fraud by false 
representation’  offences  for  which  he  was  later  convicted.  These  are  the  offences  that 
gave rise to deportation action.  

20.  On 30 October 2007, a visit to the Claimant’s last known address indicated that he was 

not residing there.  

21.  On 28 February 2008, the Claimant was convicted at Southwark Crown Court for breach 
of a suspended sentence resulting from an original conviction on 25 May 2007 to live at 
the required address.  

22.  On 29 February 2008, the Claimant was convicted at Horseferry Road Magistrates Court 
for  driving  a  motor  vehicle  with  excess  alcohol  and  fined  £400  and  disqualified  from 
driving for 18 months. On the same day he was convicted also of common assault and 
sentenced to 6 weeks in custody.  

23.  On 21 April 2008 the Claimant was referred to a psychologist in primary care (in the 
name  of  GK)  on  the  basis  of  having  split  up  with  his  girlfriend  who  had  cut  off 
connection to her family with him and shut down his office. It is recorded that he has no 
known  previous  psychiatric  history  and  was  not  on  any  medication  and  is  a  ‘difficult 
historian’. 

24.  On 16 November 2008, the Claimant presented to A & E with depression and suicidal 
ideation. He was recorded with the name of DK as living at an address in Chelsea and so 
was  referred  to  the  “CRT  South  Kensington  and  Chelsea  for  admission”  (“Crisis 
Resolution Team”). 

25.  On 1 December 2008, the Central & North West London Mental Health NHS Trust CRT 
Case Summary by Dr Ansari confirmed that the Claimant reported that he was a property 
developer who is being harassed by his ex-girlfriend’s father who has contacts with the

police.  He  said  that  his  time  was  being  wasted  fighting  court  cases  in  which  he  was 
innocent. Also, he said he had considered suicide by jumping of a bridge but had backed 
out  at  last  moment.  The  Claimant  reported  hearing  his  dead  father’s  voice  over  the 
previous 6 months, but the voice never told him to hurt himself or others but gave advice 
from  his  father.  The  issues  were  recorded  as  being  largely  resolved  by  the  time  of  his 
discharge  from  the  crisis  team.  It  is  recorded  that  no  medication  anti-depressant  was 
needed  as  he  was  only  mildly  depressed  and  that  Olanzapine  was  discussed  but  the 
Claimant  was  not  keen  because  the  ‘voices  are  gone’.  The  specialist  team  advised  the 
doctor that if the voices reappeared and worsen significantly ‘consider Olanzapine 5 mg’. 
The Claimant was discharged to care of his GP.  

26.  On 12 December 2008, the Claimant was referred to a primary care psychologist by his 
GP. The Claimant’s GP states that the CRT thought he had mild depression but the GP 
believed there was a psychotic element. The Claimant was prescribed Olanzapine (it is 
not recorded that this was in response to the Claimant hearing voices). 

27.  On 5 May 2009, Central and North West London NHS Trust wrote to the Claimant’s GP 
confirming that the Claimant was accepted as under the Mental Health team in Chelsea 
and stating that the consultant, Dr Moodley, was keen for the Claimant to engage with 
counselling services in primary care. 

28.  On 10 August 2009 the Claimant’s GP wrote a letter to ‘Kayders Solicitors’ saying that it 
became  apparent  since  early  2008  that  the  Claimant  was  having  psychiatric  problems. 
The  Claimant’s  GP  says  that  his  “paranoia  appears  to  have  increased”  and  that  the 
Claimant believes that his ex-girlfriend’s family were preventing him from conducting his 
property business and that “an Arab boy” tried to stab him.  

29. The  Claimant  came  to  the  attention  of  UKBA  again  on  2  October  2009  when  he  was 
arrested by the Metropolitan Police for harassment and fraud. He had in his possession ID 
items in a variety of names.  

30. On 16 October 2009, the Claimant was referred by his GP to Dr Klemperer, Consultant 
Psychiatrist. The referral states that neither the psychologist nor the GP believe that the 
Claimant  has  a  primary  care  diagnosis,  that  he  is  having  paranoid  beliefs  and  that  the 
Claimant  says  he  is  buying  both  the  Cadogan  Hotel  and  Blake’s  Hotel  and  has  made 
friends with some of the Royal Family and has recently been dating “a top model”. It is 
recorded that he is ‘otherwise well’. The GP confirms that he is taking citalopram and 
Olanzapine.  It  is  not  clear  whether  the  Claimant  attended  appointments  with  the 
psychiatrist on 9 October 2009 and 30 November 2009.  

31.  On  3  November  2009,  the  Claimant  was  convicted  of  harassment  at  South  Western 
Magistrates Court, given a sentence of 1 day in custody and placed under a restraining 
order. Also, on 3 November 2009 it is confirmed that it is now impossible to return the 
Claimant to Germany, where he first claimed asylum under the relevant EU arrangements 
because of the delay (due to the Claimant being out of contact with the UKBA). In those 
circumstances,  the  Claimant  was  given  temporary  admission  and  released  on  reporting 
conditions on 5 November 2009. The Claimant did not report as required but indicated 
that he would provide medical evidence. After receipt of GP’s notes indicating that he 
was  signed  off  work  due  to  depression  the  reporting  requirement  was  suspended.    His 
asylum claim now fell to be considered in the UK as he had been here too long for him to 
be returned to Germany.

32.  On 28 November 2009 UKBA received a letter from the Claimant’s GP stating that he is 

being treated for psychiatric problems.  

33.  On  16  December  2009,  the  Claimant  was  last  seen  by  his  GP  prior  to  commencing  a 
criminal custodial sentence.  He was prescribed citalopram 20mg and was last prescribed 
a two month supply of Olanzapine in November 2009. On 16 December 2009, he was 
given  a  certificate  signing  him  off  from  work  with  depression  for  3  months  backdated 
from 30 October 2009. 

34.  On 8 January 2010 and 10 February 2010, the UKBA received medical certificates dated 
30 October 2009 and 01 January 2010 signing the Claimant off again for three and two 
months respectively with depression.  

35.  On 11 March 2010, the Claimant was convicted on two counts of dishonestly making 
false representations to make gain for himself or to cause another loss. The Claimant was 
remanded in custody to HMP Bullwood Hall following conviction.  

36.  On 11 March 2010, on arrival in HMP Bullwood Hall, the medical records note that the 
Claimant  said  that  he  had  ‘depression’  and  was  taking  citalopram  and  Olanzapine.  He 
indicated that he had no thoughts of deliberate self harm and on examination his mental 
health was stable. He was re-prescribed citalopram (10 mg) and Olanzapine (5 mg). 

37. On  12  March  2010,  the  medical  reports  at  HMP  Bullwood  Hall  record  the  reception 
health  screening  which  notes  that  his  GP  records  had  been  received  from  the  previous 
responsible  primary  care  clinicians  (the  Good  Practice  GP  group).    It  records  the 
medication he was receiving and states that no medical/psychiatric report was required. 
The  notes  record  that  the  Claimant  stated  that  he  had  not  received  treatment  from  a 
psychiatrist  outside  prison.  The  assessment  of  prisoner  behaviour  and  mental  state  is 
recorded as ‘stable, calm and appropriate’. 

38.  On 15 April 2010, the Claimant was seen by Dr. Holtmanspoetter, who contacted his GP 
in community regarding his history of depression and psychotic symptoms. The notes say 
complaining  of  lower  abdominal  pain.    The  notes  record  in  relation  to  mental  health 
‘NAD, no psychotic features’ and ‘history: treated for depression and psychotic disorder. 
Has seen psychiatrists at C&W H’ and notes a complaint of weight gain. The notes record 
a referral to the GP.  

39.  On  16  March  2010,  the  Claimant  was  sentenced  to  2  terms  of  imprisonment  of  18 
months to be served consecutively for the false representation offences. In sentencing the 
Judge took account of the adverse effect of the offence on the elderly female victim from 
whom the Claimant had taken the money.  The Judge stated: “You also preyed upon her 
by opening up some form of friendship with her and I take into account, as does the writer 
of the pre-sentence report, the emotional upset that this will have caused her when she 
found out that she had been so mistaken in you.  Finally you have no credit for any guilty 
please because you went to trial on both these matters, the effect of which was that she 
was made to testify….I form the view you may very well have calculated that she would 
be  unwilling  to  call  the  police and  call  attention  to  herself  because  of  the  loss  of  face 
involved.  That is my impression of you having seen you in the course of the trial, but 
there is no documentary or other evidence in support of my impression so I have to bear 
that in mind”

40. On 14 May 2010, the medical records indicate the Claimant’s presentation on the mental 
health  assessment  as  ‘appears  mentally  stable’.  His  medication  is  noted,  that  he  self-
administers  the  medication  and  that  no  action  is  required.  The  emotional  state 
observations are ‘calm and cooperative’. It is noted that no medical reports were required.   

41.  On 25 May 2010, the Claimant was referred to “mental health in-reach” by the prison 
medical team ‘for further investigation and ongoing treatment’ due to ‘ideas that may be 
indicative of an ongoing psychotic illness’. 

42.  On 5 June 2010, the Claimant completed a response to deportation questionnaire. He said 
he has a “few businesses”, “several properties on my name” and “I have couple 5 star 
hotel in the United Kingdom.”  

43.  On 7 June 2010, the Claimant had a mental health assessment at HMP Bullwood Hall by 
Rebecca  Hankins,  in-reach  co-ordinator.  The  medical  notes  record  that  the  Claimant 
reported that he feels well and thinks his mood is fine.  He recounts the history of splitting 
up with his ex-partner and suffering depression as a result for the last 2 years. He notes 
the episode when he considered jumping off a bridge but was talked out of it by a passer 
by.  He  denied  any  current  thoughts  of  suicide.  The  Claimant  reported  good  supportive 
relationships  in  the  community  and  regular  contact  with  his  family.  The  notes  record: 
“[H]e  appeared  to  be  in  stable  mood  on  assessment  with  no  evidence  of  response  to 
psychotic  phenomena.  He  stated  that  he  heard  the  voice  of  his  father  up  until  6  or  7 
months ago; he stated that this was a pleasant voice and would advise him to stay out of 
trouble.  He denied hearing voices or any other hallucinatory experience, he denied any 
thought insertion or ideas of reference….there is no evidence for any further intervention 
from  In-Reach  and  his  case  will  now  be  closed.”.  The  more  detailed  Mental  Health 
Assessment form records similar information but notes under ‘mental health history’ that 
he  was  treated  by  his  GP  for  depression  and  ‘No  intervention  from  secondary  mental 
health services’. His mood is recorded as ‘stable, no evidence of low mood (the Claimant 
reports  a  good  mood  with  no  problems).    No  current  risks  to  himself  or  others  are 
identified.  The  conclusion  is  “[D]  was  appropriate  throughout  the  assessment…there 
was no evidence of response to psychotic phenomena, nor was there evidence of thought 
disorder, insertion, ideas of reference or bizarre belief.  His emotions and behaviour were 
congruent  to  the  situation  and  no  concerns  were  raised...  no  evidence  for  any  further 
input  from  In-Reach;  for  closure”.  The  Claimant  was  advised  to  remain  on  his 
medication,  including  anti-psychotics  (citalopram  and  Olanzapine)  and  to  see  his  GP 
upon  release  in  6  weeks  (no  decision  having  been  taken  at that  time  that  the  Claimant 
would be detained under immigration powers). 

44.  On  4  August  2010,  the  Claimant  had  his  asylum  screening  interview.  He  repeated  the 
claim  that  he  was  in  Turkey  in  2000.  The  Claimant  reported  that  he  has  taken  anti-
depressants  since  2008.  He  claimed  to  have  no  convictions  in  the  UK  other  than  the 
current  conviction.  He  claimed  to  be  a  PKK  supporter  but  was  not  involved  in  any 
terrorist acts.  Also he claimed that UK police arrested him and he was “taken to Notting 
Hill Police State for interview which was given by the Turkish Government to Scotland 
Yard  who  is  supporting  the  PKK”  and  that  he  was  in  the  Turkish  newspaper  and  on 
Turkish TV.  

45. On 12 August 2010, the Claimant was notified of his liability to deportation under the 
Automatic Deportation regime and given the one stop warning that he was required to 
state all information relevant to whether he falls within any of the exceptions to automatic
--------

deportation (and provided with a detailed questionnaire to assist with providing relevant 
information). 

46.  On 23 August 2010 the Claimant had his asylum interview. In his interview he said he 
was a PKK supporter whose family had provided financial support to the PKK so he had 
been arrested 3 times by the Turkish authorities in 1999 and 2000 but was not charged.  
He described his family’s longstanding hotel businesses. He stated that he and his family 
had business interests in the UK: properties, companies, and hotels. The Claimant also 
said that he was arrested in the UK for funding terrorism and money laundering. He said 
he took medication for depression that started in 2008 (2 tablets a day). 

47.  On  25  September  2010  the  Claimant  said  he  no  longer  wishes  to  take  citalopram  or 

Olanzapine and his prescriptions were stopped.  

48.  On 2 September 2010, the Claimant’s restraining order was revoked by South Western 

Magistrates’ Court. 

49.  On 22 November 2010, the Secretary of State’s GCID Case Record Sheet records the 
Secretary of State’s caseworker’s internal consideration of the Claimant’s asylum claim. 
The consideration says that the Claimant’s claims relating to arrests and businesses were 
considered to be elaborate, were investigated and shown to be false. It refers to the letter 
dated 10 August 2009 from the Claimant’s GP (to Kayders Solicitors, see above), notes 
that  the  Claimant  has  been  suffering  from  paranoia  and  was  prescribed  anti-psychotic 
medication in the past, and considers that his claims relating to his business transactions 
might be linked to his mental health. However, the same note later states “there is nothing 
to indicate that [the Claimant] is not well at present”. 

50.  As well as consideration of the asylum claim it was necessary for the Claimant’s case to 
be  considered  by  the  Criminal  Casework  Directorate  (CCD).  As  a  Foreign  National 
Offender (FNO), the Claimant fell within the Automatic Deportation regime under s.32 
UK Borders Act 2007 in principle. Therefore, consideration was required by the CCD as 
to whether he fell within any of the exceptions to the statutory regime (which includes 
establishing  a  right  to  international  protection  under  the  Refugee  Convention  or  the 
ECHR). 

51.  On 29 November 2010 the Criminal Casework Directorate responsible officer (‘the CCD 
caseworker’) made the decision to detain the Claimant pursuant to s. 36(1) of the Borders 
Act  2007  pending  consideration  of  whether  any  of  the  exceptions  to  the  Automatic 
Deportation  regime  applied.  The  decision  records  similar  information  to  the  asylum 
consideration  in  relation  to  the  Claimant’s  mental  health.  In  her  statement  the  CCD 
caseworker states that she had a letter of 10 August 2009 by the Claimant’s GP and that 
she considered Chapter 55.10 EIG but that “on the materials available to me there is there 
was  no  evidence  upon  which  I  could  have  concluded  that  the  Claimant  was  currently 
suffering  from  a  serious  mental  illness  that  could  not  be  managed  satisfactorily  in 
detention.”  The  minute  of  the  decision  to  detain  records  there  is  ‘no  evidence’  of  any 
‘compassionate factors’. 

52.  On 30 November 2010, the Minute of the decision to detain under s 36(1) Border Act 
2007  was  completed.  It  concludes  that  the  Claimant  is  not  suitable  for  release  in  the 
absence of evidence of family members in the UK given the risk of absconding again and 
re-offending. The proposal to detain was agreed by the CCD Team Leader.  On that day

R (K) v SSHD 

 

an  IS.91RA  (risk  assessment)  form  was  faxed  to  prison  and  the  prison  was  asked  to 
comment on all questions.  

53.  On  6  December  2010,  the  Claimant  asked  the  prison  staff  to  re-start  his  medication 
because  he  was  feeling  anxious  and  depressed.  He  was  given  citalopram  but  not 
Olanzapine.  

54.  On 7 December 2010, HMP Bullwood Hall sent back the IS.91RA risk assessment form.  
The  form  was  returned  with  a  tick  in  the  box  marked  “psychiatric  disorder”  under  the 
potential  risk  factor  categories,  which  appear  under  the  statement:  “Any  positive 
indicators of risk MUST be explained fully in writing below. Indication of risk should take 
into account any significant historical information as well as current circumstances and 
behaviour as appropriate”.  The only comment is “1 x harassment sentence – revoked”. 
This is received by UKBA on the same day.  

55.  On 9 December 2010, the IS 91 Detention Authority was completed by UKBA. No box 
is checked for ‘psychiatric illness’ requiring any special monitoring or supervision and 
nothing is recorded in the section for medication.   

 

‘First period’ of detention 
 
56. The Claimant entered immigration detention on 9 December 2010 and was detained at 

HMP Bullwood Hall until his transfer on 21 December 2010 to an IRC.    

57.  The Claimant’s latest asylum claim was refused on 14 December 2010.  

58.  On 18 December 2010, the Claimant’s medical records were transferred from prison to 

the IRC primary care team.   

59.  On 21 December 2010, the Claimant was transferred from HMP Bullwood Hall to IRC 

Harmondsworth. 

60. During his health care induction the Claimant informs A. Staples (a mental health nurse) 
that  he  has  been  under  the  care  of  a  psychiatrist.  The  induction  form  records  that  the 
Claimant  reported  suffering  from  depression  since  2008  for  which  he  takes  citalopram 
and  that  he  was  taking  Olanzapine  until  approximately  3  months  ago  but  stopped 
Olanzapine  due  to  weight  gain.  It  records  the  incident  of  the  Claimant  considering 
throwing  himself  in  the  River  Thames  in  2008  but  records  there  is  no  current  suicidal 
ideation.  A  negative  response  is  recorded  against  the  question  on  the  form  assessing 
whether the Detainee seemed anxious, withdrawn or depressed and whether any concerns 
had  been  raised  by  outside  agencies.  The  Claimant  is  recorded  as  stating  that  he  was 
coping  well  until  he  learnt  that  he  would  be  detained  and  that  he  asked  to  see  a 
psychiatrist.  The  Claimant’s  medical  notes  say  “refer  to  GP  and  would  like  to  see 
psychiatrist’. There is a dispute between the parties as to whether a healthcare assessment 
was  conducted  for  the  purposes  of  Rule  34  of  the  Detention  Centre  Rules,  which  the 
Court is asked to resolve. 

61.  On  31  December  2010,  the  Claimant  saw  a  GP  and  was  prescribed  Omeprazole  for 

gastritis.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

62. On  5  January  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  continued  detention 

authorised.    

63.  On 25 January 2011, the Secretary of State made a decision to deport and a deportation 

order was signed against the Claimant.    

64.  On 1 February 2011, the Claimant was briefly transferred to Colnbrook IRC for service 
of documents.  A healthcare induction was conducted at Colnbrook IRC followed by a 
GP  appointment.  The  Claimant  signed  a  routine  disclaimer  allowing  the  Colnbrook 
healthcare team to disclose relevant information regarding his medical conditions, history 
or mental heath to named entities including the UKBA ‘whilst in the establishment’ i.e. 
Colnbrook IRC. He was returned to Harmondsworth IRC the same day on 21 February 
2011. 

65. On 2 February 2011, the Claimant’s detention was reviewed and maintained.  

66. On 8 February 2011, the Claimant did not attend an appointment with the GP. 

67.  On  17  February  2011,  an  Emergency  Travel  Document  interview  was  conducted  to 

arrange travel documents for the Claimant.  

68. On  23  February  2011,  the  medical  notes  record  that  the  Claimant  did  not  attend  an 

appointment with the GP. 

69.  On  28  February  and  28  March  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his 

continued detention authorised.  

70. On 10 April 2011, the Claimant requested temporary admission on the basis that he did 
not regard himself a properly liable to detention.  On 12 April 2011, the Claimant wrote a 
letter to the Secretary of State’s caseworker asking why it had taken so long to serve the 
deportation order and saying: “... As far as I concern you’re part of the corruption which 
related with Nothing hill gate police officers and Drug dealer Simon Ford and Radwan 
Alrawi That’s why they keep chasing my immigration case to know what’s going on. I 
have  been  visited  by  two  Scotlandyard  officers.  They  know  the  case  was  set  up.  They 
know you’re link wit them. That’s why you’re holding me here to not release any evidence 
to media or public. Deport me now where you can deport me. Mr. ‘J’ ??? Ford.” [sic]  

71.  On 14 April 2011, the Claimant was briefly transferred to Colnbrook IRC for one day 
where he saw a nurse and then later a GP. The medical notes record that the Claimant was 
on citalopram for depression and considered his mental health was currently stable but 
was feeling stressed.  He denied suicidal thoughts and self harm to the nurse. 

72.  On 18 April 2011, the Claimant lodged an appeal against the refusal of his asylum claim. 

73.  On 19 April 2011, a completed application for Emergency Travel Documents from the 

Turkish Embassy was submitted.   

74.  On 28 April 2011, the Claimant’s Harmondsworth IRC medical notes record ‘would like 
to restart [Olanzapine] as hearing voices’. Olanzapine 5 mg was prescribed for 28 days.  
There is a dispute as to whether Olanzapine was re-prescribed after the expiry of the 28 
day  period  before  21  July  2011  and  whether  that  dispute  can  be  resolved  on  the 
information available.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

75.  Also,  on  28  April  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his  continued 

detention authorised.   

76.  On  4  May  2011,  the  Claimant  was  seen  by  a  GP,  Dr.  Walker,  who  records  that  the 
Claimant has ‘long-standing mental health issues’ and that the Claimant feels that he is 
being bullied, reported this to officers but they told him to ‘keep head down’. The note 
also records that the Claimant is ‘feeling stressed’ and that his court case is on 7/5/11.  

77.  On 5 May 2011, the Secretary of State’s CCD caseworker was advised that she should 
not  pursue  Emergency  Travel  Documentation  until  the  Claimant’s  appeal  rights  were 
exhausted for his asylum claim.   

78.  On 6 May 2011, the Claimant’s previous legal representatives ceased to represent him. 
The solicitors wrote to him saying this was because he claimed to have £8m in savings 
and to be a funder of the PKK.  

79. On 7 May 2011, the Claimant wrote to his CCD caseworker requesting information about 
the position of his case.  The caseworker replies on 8 May 2011 confirming that he has a 
First Tier Tribunal hearing of his appeal scheduled for 17 May 2011. 

80.  On 10 May 2011 the medical notes record the Claimant complained of bullying and that 

he was told to approach UKBA as this is not a medical problem.  

81. On 11 May 2011, the Claimant wrote to his caseworker questioning the history recorded 

in the Monthly Progress report. 

82. On 14 May 2011, the Claimant’s medical notes record that the Claimant did not attend an 

appointment with the GP. 

83.  On  17  May  2011,  the  Claimant  has  his  FTT  asylum  appeal  hearing.  The  Claimant 
withdrew  the  bail  application  that  was  listed  for  that  day.    The  Claimant  applied  to 
adjourn the appeal and that was refused. During the hearing the Immigration Judge raised 
concerns about the Claimant’s mental health which were passed on to UKBA.  

84.  On  18  May  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his  continued  detention 

authorised.   

 

‘Second period’ of detention 
 
85. On  19  May  2011,  the  GCID  Case  Record  entry  notes  concerns  around  mental  health 
following  hearing  on  17/5/11  stating  that  the  Claimant  “was  making  some  extravagant 
claims, his behaviour was such that the Judge believed him to be delusional”. The CCD 
Caseworker spoke with officers at Harmondsworth to check if there were any records of 
the subject having suffered any mental health problems, and noted  “informed that from 
the  subjects  casefile,  he  is  not  believed  to  be  suffering  from  any  mental  health 
conditions.” and ‘Request made for the subject to be assessed by a mental health official’.  

86. On 19 May 2011 a fax was sent from UKBA to Harmondsworth IRC requesting a mental 
health assessment because the Claimant’s behaviour and actions at court were “a cause 
for concern for the Judge and other court members” and the Judge believed the Claimant 
“to be delusional if he genuinely believed his claims and statements.”

R (K) v SSHD 

 

87. On 19 May 2011, the Claimant instructed his current representatives, Wilson Solicitors 

LLP. 

88.  On  20  May  2011,  the  Health  Care  Manager  at  Harmondsworth  wrote  a  fax  to  UKBA 
saying that the Claimant has been seen by the GP who has not asked for a mental health 
assessment at this time, it is recorded that the Claimant is stable on medication, and the 
only concern relates to allegations of bullying. There is a dispute between the parties as to 
whether this fax is accurate.  

89.  On  24  May  2011,  the  Claimant’s  medical  notes  record  that  he  did  not  attend  an 

appointment with the GP. 

90.  On  25  May  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his  continued  detention 
authorised.  The  review  refers  to  the  Claimant’s  behaviour  at  his  appeal  hearing  giving 
cause for concern, ‘However, healthcare have confirmed that there is no evidence on the 
file  to  support  this  and  the  Doctor  does  not  consider  a  mental  health  assessment 
appropriate. It is considered likely Mr. K put on this behaviour in an attempt to sway the 
appeal judge’. It is recorded that release has been considered in accordance with Chapter 
55 EIG but refused in the light of the risk of reoffending and absconding. 

91.  On 1 June 2011, the Claimant’s asylum appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal 
(IAC). The determination includes the following: “The appellant’s evidence had a bizarre 
quality,  which  seemed  to  increase  in  absurdity  towards  the  end  of  his  evidence.”  In 
relation  to  the  Article  8  ECHR  claim  the  FTT  stated  “We  note  that  he  has  received 
treatment for depression in 2009 and 2010 as evidence by prescriptions from his General 
Practitioner….  We  are  not  aware  of  any  medical  treatment  he  has  received  whilst  in 
detention. There is insufficient evidence before us that the appellant is suffering from any 
major  health  problems  of  either  a  physical  or  mental  nature”  and  conclude  he  can  be 
removed.  The  Claimant’s  claims  regarding  his  businesses,  his  arrests  for  terrorism 
offences, and being shot in 2005 by Turkish agents were rejected.   

92. On 8 June 2011, the Claimant’s representatives provide an authority to act declaration to 

the UKBA. 

93.  On 10 June 2011, the Claimant lodged an appeal against the refusal of his asylum appeal.   

94.  On the same day, the Claimant’s representatives wrote to Harmondsworth medical team 

requesting details of his current medication. 

95.  On 13 June 2011, the UKBA chased up the healthcare team at the IRC to provide what 

information was possible about the Claimant’s medical position.  

96.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused on 22 June 2011 by the First Tier 

Tribunal. The Claimant renewed this application to the Upper Tribunal. 

97.  On  23  June  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his  continued  detention 
authorised  ‘in  accordance  with  Chapter  55  EIG’.  In  the  detailed  facts  of  the  case 
recorded, there is reference to mental health concerns and that a request was made by 
the CCD caseworker to the primary care team for a mental health assessment but this 
was declined  as the ‘doctor’ felt it was not needed.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

98.   On  27  June  2011,  Harmondsworth  medical  team  responded  to  the  Claimant’s 
representatives letter of 10/6/11 stating “This gentleman is currently taking citraprim 
10 mg daily in the morning”. 

99.  On 30 June 2011, the Claimant’s representatives wrote to Harmondsworth Medical Team 
requesting  confirmation  of  whether  the  Claimant  had  been  prescribed  Olanzapine 
since being detained and noting that on 28 April 2011 the Claimant requested that he 
be prescribed Olanzapine because he is hearing voices.  

100.   On  1  July  2011,  Harmondsworth  healthcare  contract  to  provide  primary  healthcare 

services was transferred from ‘Drummonds’ to ‘Primecare’.  

101.  On 4 July 2011, a bail hearing was scheduled before the FTT for 7 July 2011. 

102.  On 7 July 2011, the Claimant attended a GP appointment at which he reported that the 
citalopram  was  not  helping  and  that  he  feels  low  sometimes  and  has  occasional 
suicidal thoughts.  

103.   On  8  July  2011,  the  Claimant’s  representatives  instructed  Dr  Ben  Robinson,  NHS 
Consultant Psychiatrist at Camden and Islington Mental Health Trust and Medical Justice 
volunteer  doctor,  to  prepare  a  medical  report.  In  their  instructions  the  Claimant’s 
representatives  provide  details  of  bizarre  instructions  that  they  have  been  unable  to 
substantiate.  

104.   On 9 July 2011, Dr Ben Robinson assessed the Claimant for 2 hours.  Dr Robinson 
wrote  his  opinion  directly  on  the  Claimant’s  medical  notes.  The  notes  say:  “Stress  of 
detention is worsening mental health problems. – Extensive delusional system. – Paranoia 
about  Turkish  Government  controlling  UK  policy.  –  Suicidal  thoughts.”  Following  his 
appointment Dr Robinson wrote a letter setting out his preliminary views. In that letter he 
said  that  the  Claimant  is  “currently  psychotic  and  requires  anti-psychotic  medication 
which he used to take but is not being given currently in detention. It is unclear why this 
is so, because when I asked if he would be willing to take such medication he said that he 
would. [The Claimant] also has retrograde memory loss and shows some signs of alcohol-
related neural degeneration which requires further investigation.”  

105.   On  11  July  2011,  the  Claimant’s  former  GP  wrote  to  the  Claimant’s  representatives 
confirming that in 2009 he was prescribed citalopram and Olanzapine. His GP notes that 
she thought he had a psychotic element in addition to the psychiatric crisis team’s 2008 
diagnosis of mild depression. She says that although he was re-referred to psychiatrists in 
Autumn 2009 contact was never made.   

106.   On 12 July 2011, Dr Robinson completed his psychiatric report. His opinion is that the 
Claimant demonstrates several different types of psychotic thoughts including: Paranoid 
Persecutory Delusions, Grandiose Delusions related to PKK, relationships, property and 
crime,  and  potentially  Passivity  Phenomena.  He  says  that  the  Claimant  indicated  that 
occasionally he hears the voice of his dead father but this does not seem to represent a 
hallucination but rather a strong memory. Dr Robinson concludes that, in his opinion, the 
Claimant is suffering from a psychotic disorder, needs medication, needs psychological 
support, detention is worsening his illness making his beliefs more fixed, and that in his 
opinion the Claimant does not appear to have been receiving adequate treatment.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

107.   On 18 July 2011, the Claimant’s representatives wrote to the Harmondsworth Medical 
Team  drawing  their  attention  to  the  Claimant’s  poor  mental  health  and  requesting 
confirmation of what steps have been taken to alert the Secretary of State to this and what 
medical  treatment  the  Claimant  has  received  in  detention.  The  medical  team  was 
requested to urgently arrange an appointment with a GP and Consultant Psychiatrist.  

108.   On 18 July 2011, the Claimant’s representatives wrote to UKBA requesting temporary 
admission and drawing UKBA’s attention to the Claimant’s poor mental health and Dr 
Robinson’s initial opinion.   

109.   On 20 July 2011, the Claimant’s detention was reviewed and his continued detention 
authorised.  The review refers to mental health concerns, but says an assessment will not 
be done because the “doctor” felt it was not needed. 

110.   On  21  July  2011,  the  Claimant’s  medical  notes  record  that  there  is  a  “medication 
problem”, and the Claimant wants to start again, “Olanzapine 5mg od”.  On the same day 
the Claimant’s prescription chart records a 28 day supply of Olanzapine is prescribed. 

111.   On 27 July 2011, the Claimant’s representatives wrote to Harmondsworth Healthcare 
requesting clarification of when the Claimant was prescribed Olanzapine and the reasons 
for stopping Olanzapine after the April 2011 prescription.  

112.   On  2  August  2011,  the  IRC  healthcare  team  seek  a  medical  disclaimer  to  allow 
information  about  the  Claimant’s  health  to  be  given  to  UKBA.  This  is  provided  on  4 
August 2011.   

113.   By a letter dated 4 August 2011 (recorded as received on 5 August 2011) the report of 
Dr Robinson (dated 12 July 2011) is provided to the Secretary of State with a copy of the 
letter dated 18 July 2011 in relation to temporary admission. The letter and enclosures are 
copied  to  Harmondsworth  Healthcare.  The  GCID  notes  for  5  August  2011  record  the 
receipt  of  the  letter  and  report  and  an  attempt  to  contact  the  Healthcare  Manager  at 
Harmonsdsworth  IRC  and  a  request  that  the  healthcare  manager  contact  the  CCD 
caseworker.  

114.   On 7 August 2011, the Claimant was referred to the NHS Consultant Psychiatrist. He 

was booked in to see the senior nurse on 9 August 2011.   

115.   On  11  August  2011,  the  UKBA  caseworker  spoke  with  ‘Val’  (Valerie  Anderson, 
Healthcare  Manager  and  Senior  Nurse  at  Harmondsworth  IRC),  who  explained  that 
‘unless  the  guards  had  cause  for  concern  regarding  the  subject’s  mental  health  a 
psychiatric  report  would  not  have  been  done’.  The  caseworker  requested  that  a  mental 
health assessment be carried out. It was confirmed that the Claimant was due to see the 
psychiatrist on 12 August 2011 and he had seen by the Registered Mental Health Nurse.  

116.   On 12 August 2011, the medical notes record that the Claimant refused to attend the 

appointment with the psychiatrist.  

117.   On 17 August 2011, the GCID notes record that the CCD caseworker sent a message to 
the  Healthcare  Manager  at  Harmondsworth  to  check  if  the  Claimant  was  seen  by  a 
psychiatrist. The Claimant confirmed that he was not willing to see Turkish officials to 
progress an ETD.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

118.   Also  on  17  August  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his  continued 
detention authorised in reliance on the risk of absconding and reoffending. The review 
refers to receipt of letter from the Claimant’s representatives on 5 August 2011 claiming 
that the Claimant is suffering from a “psychotic disorder”, records that he will be seen by 
the psychiatrist and that once the report is available the matter will be reassessed.  

119.   On 18 August 2011, the Claimant was seen for a mental health review.  

120.   On  20  August  2011,  the  Claimant  was  seen  by  Dr.  Burrun,  NHS  Consultant 
Psychiatrist.  The  notes  from  this  assessment  say:  Known  to  be  suffering  from 
‘depression’,  that  the  Claimant  is  feeling  better  since  re-starting  Olanzapine,  he  hears 
father’s voice less frequently, and he denies any psychotic symptoms. The medical plan is 
to continue citalopram and Olanzapine, individual support and for a further review.  

121.   On 22 August 2011, the Claimant was refused bail by the First-tier Tribunal.  

122.   On 26 August 2011, the Claimant’s representatives sent a Letter Before Action to the 

Secretary of State. 

123.   On 30 August 2011, the Harmondsworth Healthcare Services (Primecare) responded to 
the Claimant’s Representative’s letter of 27/7/2011 stating that they are unable to clarify 
the situation with the Claimant’s medication under the previous provider since  Primecare 
had recently taken over responsibility for the provision of healthcare.  It is confirmed that 
the Claimant had been seen by a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Burrun, and been reviewed by 
the mental health nurse.   

124.   On  1  September  2011,  the  Claimant  was  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper 
Tribunal citing concerns around the refusal of an adjournment application.  

125.   On 6 September 2011, the Claimant was seen by the healthcare team and reported to be 
“calm & cheerful” with “no current issues.” He was advised of the importance of continuing 
with his medication to lessen the chance of future relapse.   

126.   On 9 September 2011, the FTT heard an application for bail relying on mental illness 
grounds, the opinion of Dr Robinson and several witness statements. The Immigration Judge 
who  refused  bail  noted  that  there  was  a  significant  risk  of  absconding  ‘in  light  of  his 
psychiatric  condition,  which  is  said  to  involve  delusions  and  he  may  be  suffering  from 
schizophrenia’. The judge also noted that he is said to need regular medication. He concluded 
that in those circumstances the Claimant could not be released in the absence of a surety. It 
was said that any concern about continued detention whilst the appeal was outstanding could 
be addressed by requesting an expedited hearing.  

127.   On  12  September  2011,  the  Claimant  wrote  to  his  UKBA  caseworker  requesting 
evidence  that  he  has  previously  absconded  and  saying:  “As  far  I  know.  As  far  I  concern 
behind all problems always same people which related with you. you are linked with those 
people who is well known in london as crooks. Who robbing people legiment uou can’t sue 
them.  because  they’re  in  government.  Some  Police  officers.  some  politicians.  Some 
Accountant’s Lawyers are in same game. you’re ripping people by the law can you imagine I 
have  only  problem  with  Nottinghill  gate  police  station.  Even  my  area  doesn’t  cover  this 
police station but they always there... Just let you know I am taking legal action against you.”

R (K) v SSHD 

 

128.  On  13  September  2011,  the  CCD  Caseworker  spoke  to  the  UKBA  liaison  at 
Harmondsworth  requesting  information  as  to  whether  the  psychiatric  appointment  went 
ahead.  The liaison officer confirmed that he could not give any medical details but that the 
appointment went ahead. The CCD caseworker asked for a copy of the medical report and the 
liaison officer confirmed that a copy of a medical report can be provided only if a medical 
disclaimer  was  provided.  The  CCD  caseworker wrote to Harmondsworth healthcare centre 
noting that a medical disclaimer was needed to permit the UKBA to be given the results of 
the  psychiatric  assessment  undertaken  in  August  and  requested  a  copy  of  the  psychiatric 
report of the treating clinician.  

129.  On  14  September  2011,  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  reviewed  and  his  continued 
detention  authorised.    The  review  refers  to  the  investigations  into  the  Claimant’s  mental 
health and says that UKBA was still awaiting outcome of psychiatric assessment. 

130.  On 14 September 2011, the Claimant signed a disclaimer giving consent to release of 
his  medical  records  by  Harmondsworth  healthcare  team  to  UKBA,  receipt  of  which  was 
confirmed by the UKBA caseworker on 15 September 2011.  

131.  On 15 September 2011, the Secretary of State responded to the Claimant’s letter before 
action.  The  response  notes  receipt  of  Dr  Robinson’s  opinion  under  cover  of  letter  dated  4 
August  2011  and  says:  “In  order  for  the  UK  Border  Agency  to  fully  consider  whether 
detention is appropriate where a person may be suffering from a mental health condition a 
psychiatric assessment and report must be completed on behalf of the UK Border Agency. 
This  has  now  been  undertaken.”  It  was  said  that  a  medical  disclaimer  is  required  for 
disclosure of the ‘report’ and the disclaimer was completed by the Claimant on 14 September 
2014.  

132.  On 15 September 2011, the GCID notes record that detention will be reviewed once the 
psychiatric  report  is  received  from  Harmondsworth.  On  the  same  day  the  Claimant’s 
representatives  wrote  to  Harmondsworth  healthcare  again  requesting  clarification  of  the 
Claimant’s  medication  and  asking  for  disclosure  of  the  records  relating  to  the  Consultant 
Psychiatrist’s visit and review by the mental health nurse.   

133.  On 20 September 2011, the ETD application was refused by the Turkish Embassy as 
the details provided by the Claimant were not verifiable as correct.  

134.   On 22 September 2011, the present judicial review proceedings were filed.  

135.  On 23 September 2011 the Claimant was seen in Healthcare and the notes record that 
the  Claimant  was  complaining  of  hearing  his  father’s  voice  telling  him  to  ‘do  things’  and 
keeping him awake at night.  The Claimant’s Olanzapine was increased to 10 mg. 

136.  On 26 September 2011, the Claimant’s representatives wrote to the Secretary of State’s 
CCD caseworker enclosing all medical evidence submitted in support of the judicial review 
and asking that the caseworker ensure it is provided to the Consultant Psychiatrist assessing 
the Claimant to consider when forming his diagnosis. The letter records that a request had 
now  been  made  to  Hillingdon  Social  Services  for  a  s.47  assessment  of  the  Claimant  (in 
relation to provision of care on any release).

R (K) v SSHD 

 

137.   On  29  September  2011,  the  Claimant’s  representatives  again  wrote  to  the  CCD 
caseworker asking for confirmation that the Claimant’s medical papers were provided to 
the psychiatrist assessing Claimant and requesting a copy of the psychiatrist’s report.  

138.   On 30 September 2011, the UKBA caseworker contacted the healthcare team again to 
seek  a  response  to  the  request  of  a  copy  of  the  psychiatric  report  of  the  treating 
Consultant. The caseworker was told that she will be given a copy as soon as possible.  

139.  On  5  October  2011,  the  Claimant  was  assessed  for  2  hours  by  Dr  Amlan  Basu, 

independent Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist instructed by the Claimant’s solicitors 

140.   On 7 October 2011, the CCD caseworker made a request to Harmondsworth for the 

Claimant’s Healthcare records.  

141.   On  11  October  2011,  the  Claimant’s  representatives  wrote  to  the  Treasury  Solicitor 
asking for confirmation of whether the psychiatrist at Harmondsworth had access to the 
Claimant’s medical records and Dr Ben Robinson’s report when assessing the Claimant’s 
mental health.   

142.   Also  on  11  October  2011,  the  Claimant  was  seen  by  a  GP  after  complaining  of 

heartburn. 

143.   On the same date, the Claimant’s detention was reviewed and his continued detention 
authorised. The review refers to mental health concerns and the steps taken to investigate 
the Claimant’s mental health. It states that the detention and healthcare records have been 
requested from the IRC, the outcome of an assessment is awaited and that the case must 
be reassessed once the outcome on the Claimant’s psychiatric condition is received. 

144.   On 13 October 2011, a bail application was received scheduled for 18 October 2011. 

This application was withdrawn and scheduled for 20 October 2011.   

145.  On 18 October 2011, the UKBA received the Claimant’s medical notes pursuant to the 

medical disclaimer signed.  

146.   On 19 October 2011 Dr Basu completed his first report on the Claimant  

147.  On  21  October  2011,  the  Claimant  was  released  on  bail  by  the  FTT  having  now 

provided a surety and Dr Basu’s report.  

 

 
Post release 
148.  The following facts are not considered by the Secretary of State to be relevant to the 
question of the lawfulness of the Claimant’s detention since they post-date the Claimant’s 
release  from  detention.  However,  in  my  view,  they  form  part  of  the  relevant  factual 
background. 

149.  On 28 October 2011 the Claimant starts reporting to the Secretary of State’s offices and 

reports regularly thereafter. 

150.  On  28  November  2011  there  is  a  review  (post-release)  of  mental  health  status  by 
Haringey Primary Care Trust Mental Health Team nurse.  The plan is to continue with

current medication 10 mg at night and ‘care to be transferred to the Psychosis Complex 
care team for longer term monitoring and support’. 

151.  On 22 December 2011 Upper Tribunal finds that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by 
failing  to  adjourn,  the  determination  dismissing  Claimant’s  asylum  and  deportation 
appeal is set aside and the case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal.  

152.  On 25 June 2012 the Claimant’s asylum and deportation appeal is allowed on refugee 
and  human  rights  grounds  (Article  3).  The  Tribunal  accepts  the  reports  and  diagnosis 
(schizophrenia)  of  Dr  Basu  and  Dr  Robinson  and  finds  that  the  Claimant  suffers  from 
delusions  and  cannot  be  believed  with  regard  to  his  claimed  business  dealings  and 
relationships. The Secretary of State did not appeal this decision and did not dispute the 
medical evidence at that hearing.   

153.  On 14 September 2012 the Claimant was granted refugee status. 

154.  On  16  April  2013  the  Claimant  was  examined  for  2  hours  for  a  second  time  by  Dr 

Basu. On 26 June 2013 Dr Basu completed his second report on the Claimant.  

155.  On 14 March 2014, approximately two years and seven months after he assessed the 
Claimant, Dr Burrun provided a witness statement for the purposes of these proceedings.  

 
THE LAW 

Immigration detention of the mentally ill 

156.  Administrative  detention  under  s.36(1)  or  (2)  Borders  Act  2007  will  be  unlawful  on 
public  law  grounds  if  the  Secretary  of  State  fails  properly,  i.e.  lawfully,  to  apply  her 
policy in Chapter 55.10 of the Enforcement Instructions and Guidance (‘EIG’). 

157.  Chapter  55.10  of  the  Secretary  of  State’s  Enforcement  Instructions  and  Guidance 

provides as follows: 

“55.10. Persons considered unsuitable for detention  

Certain persons are normally considered suitable for detention 
in  only  very  exceptional  circumstances,  whether  in  dedicated 
immigration  accommodation  or  prisons.  Others  are  unsuitable 
for 
their 
detention requires particular security, care and control.  

immigration  detention  accommodation  because 

In  criminal  casework  cases,  the  risk  of  further  offending  or 
harm to the public must be carefully weighed against the reason 
why the individual may be unsuitable for detention. There may 
be  cases  where  the  risk  of  harm  to  the  public  is  such  that  it 
outweighs factors that would otherwise normally indicate that a 
person was unsuitable for detention.  

The following are normally considered suitable for detention in 
only  very  exceptional  circumstances,  whether  in  dedicated 
immigration detention accommodation or prisons:

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

 

  Unaccompanied  children  and  young  persons  under  the 

age of 18 (see 55.9.3 above).  

  The  elderly,  especially  where  significant  or  constant 
supervision  is  required  which  cannot  be  satisfactorily 
managed within detention.  

  Pregnant  women,  unless  there  is  the  clear  prospect  of 
early removal and medical advice suggests no question 
of confinement prior to this (but see 55.4 above for the 
detention of women in the early stages of pregnancy at 
Yarl’s Wood).  

  Those suffering from serious medical conditions which 

cannot be satisfactorily managed within detention.  

  Those  suffering  from  serious  mental  illness  which 
cannot  be  satisfactorily  managed  within  detention  (in 
criminal  casework  cases,  please  contact  the  specialist 
mentally  disordered  offender  team).  In  exceptional 
cases  it  may  be  necessary  for  detention  at  a  removal 
centre or prison to continue while individuals are being 
or waiting to be assessed, or are awaiting transfer under 
the Mental Health Act.  

  Those  where  there  is  independent  evidence  that  they 

have been tortured.  

  People  with  serious  disabilities  which  cannot  be 

satisfactorily managed within detention.  

  Persons  identified  by  the  competent  authorities  as 
victims  of  trafficking  (as  set  out  in  Chapter  9,  which 
contains  very  specific  criteria  concerning  detention  of 
such persons).  

If  a  decision  is  made  to  detain  a  person  in  any  of  the  above 
categories,  the  caseworker  must  set  out  the  very  exceptional 
circumstances for doing so on file."" 

158.  The phrase “…suffering serious mental illness which cannot be satisfactorily managed 
within detention” has been the subject of recent and definitive guidance by the Court of 
Appeal  in  R  (Das)  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  45.  I  set  out  below  Ms  Anderson’s 
summary of the guidance in Das adopted by Mr CMG Ockelton, Vice President of the 
Upper Tribunal (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) in SA(Holland) v. SSHD [2014] 
EWHC 2570 (Admin) which is a useful summary of the general principles: 

(1)  When interpreting and applying Chapter 55.10 it was essential to 
keep firmly in mind the purpose of the policy, which was to ensure 
compliance  with 
immigration  control 
(especially in the context of the removal of FNOs where that was

accorded  a  particular  importance  by  the  statutory  policy  of

of the Secretary of State) but prevent treatment that was inhumane 
[46]. 

(2) 

(3)

(5) 

(6) 

A  purposive  and  pragmatic  construction  was  required  “[i]n  the 
light of the purpose of immigration detention identified above, that 
is  enabling  lawful  removal  pursuant  to  an  effective  immigration 
policy, the policy seeks to ensure that account is taken of the health

circumstances) to prevent the detention of those who, because of a 
serious mental illness are not fit to be detained because their illness 
cannot be satisfactorily managed in detention” [47]. 

individuals  affected  and  (save 

the 

The phrase “suffering from a serious mental illness which cannot 
be managed satisfactorily within detention” must not be dissected 
but considered as a whole. [47] and [57]. 

The  policy  exception  in  Chapter  55.10  does  not  apply  simply 
because a person has a diagnosis of a mental illness that is regarded 
as ‘serious’ [48], [50], [55] and [57].  In LE (Jamaica) the claimant 
had a long established condition of Paranoid Schizophrenia (which 
had rendered him unfit to plead to criminal charges) but the policy 
was not engaged as the condition was one that could be managed 
satisfactorily in detention. 

The  ‘threshold  for  applicability  of  the  policy’  is  that  the  mental 
illness 
it  cannot  be  managed 
satisfactorily in detention. [67] 

is  serious  enough 

to  mean 

‘Satisfactory  management’  involves  considerations  such  as  the 
medication  required  and  whether  ‘demonstrated  needs’  can  or 
cannot be provided by the place of detention.  The Court noted that 
OM (Nigeria) at [33] shows that some of those suffering significant 
adverse effects of mental illness may be managed appropriately in 
detention, the views of the experts were divided but the Court of 
Appeal found that the balance of expert advice was that her illness 
could be managed appropriately in detention [67].  It is noted that 
in OM there were expert reports in much stronger terms than in this 
case that stated that the treatment needed by OM was not available 
in  detention  and 
that  her  mental  health  was  deteriorating 
significantly as a result of detention so she was unfit to be detained 
(and lacked capacity to act).  Whilst the responsible clinicians did 
not provide ‘expert reports’ in the same way as those procured by 
claimant representatives, the Court considered the views expressed 
in  the  medical  papers  to  the  effect  that  the  needs  for  satisfactory 
management of OM’s mental health were met in detention and the 
Court  of  Appeal  accepted  the  approach  of  the  responsible 
clinicians.

R (K) v SSHD

(8) 

The  Secretary  of  State  was  generally  entitled  to  rely  on  the 
responsible  clinicians  where  reasonable  enquiries  had  been  made 
and  the  requirements  of  Chapter  55.10  were  considered  where 
applicable,  so  long  as  there  was  not  a  total  abdication  of  the 
Secretary of State’s own responsibilities to the clinicians. [70]. 

For the purposes of the decision in Das, the Court did not decide 
whether  ‘satisfactory  management’ 
the 
possibility of recovery but at [71] the Court ‘strongly doubted’ that 
this was the correct approach as:

this  was  unlikely  to  be  the  intention  of  the  policy 
given its purpose 

it  was  unlikely  to  be  the  natural  construction  of  the 
words used 

it was inconsistent with the established jurisprudence 
of the higher courts 

it  was  impractical  given  the  variance  of  treatment 
available in the community  

it was inconsistent with the context of the purpose of 
removal from the UK as soon as possible 

(9)  Where  the  threshold  for  applicability  was  met  and  a  serious 
mental illness could not be managed satisfactorily in detention 
so  the  policy  applied  –  the  ‘very  exceptional  circumstances’ 
test was a demanding one.  It was not met by the mere fact of 
liability for circumstances’ test was a demanding one.  It was 
not met by the mere fact of liability for removal and the refusal 
to repatriate voluntarily.  It could be met by circumstances such 
as the detainee posing a serious risk of harm to the public or the 
anticipated period of further detention being short.  It required 
an  assessment  of  where  on  the  ‘spectrum’  of  seriousness  the 
case  fell  (that  spectrum  including  those  with  no  record  of 
offending  right  through  to  the  most  serious  terrorism  cases). 
[68].” 

159.  The  Secretary  of  State’s  exercise  of  the  power  to  detain  under  Chapter  55.10  is 
reviewable on public law grounds (R (EO) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1236 (Admin), [16]), 
including classic Tameside grounds (Secretary of State for Education v Tameside MBC 
[1977] AC 1014, 1065).   

160.  The issues commonly arising are threefold: (i) first, whether the detainee was suffering 
a “serious mental illness which could not properly be managed in detention”; (ii) second, 
if so, whether or not there existed “very exceptional circumstances” justifying detention 
in any event; and (iii) third, even if the Secretary of State failed to act in accordance with 
her  policy,  whether  the  Secretary  of  State  would  have  detained  in  any  event,  if  proper

regard had been had to the policy, so that any damages to be awarded should be nominal, 
applying the guidance in R(Lumba) v. SSHD [2011] UKSC 12. 

 

 

ANALYSIS 

 

LEGAL ISSUES 

161.  I  turn  first  to  a  number  of  specific  legal  issues  raised  by  Counsel  in  the  course  of 

argument. 

 

Evidence or assumptions? 

162.  The first legal issue related to the approach by the court to the making of findings of 
fact.  The  Claimant  invited  the  Court  to  reach  ‘the  same  general  findings’  as  to  the 
conditions of detention and the quality of the healthcare provision at Harmondsworth IRC 
as those of Laing QC in R (BA) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2748 (Admin) (A/13/361) HHJ 
Anthony Thornton QC in S v SSHD [2014] EWHC 50 (Admin) (A/30/1125).  

 
163.  Ms Anderson, on behalf of the Secretary of State, took exception to this approach on 
the  basis  of  relevance.  In  my  view,  she  was  right  do  so.    The  practice  of claimants 
selecting  particular  decisions  with  favourable  outcomes  and  asking  the  Court  to  be 
influenced by them has been deplored by the Courts, see e.g. Irwin J in NAB [2010] 
EWHC 3137 at [77]-[80]. In Das [2014] EWCA Civ 45, the Court of Appeal refused 
to make assumptions about inadequate provision  of mental health care in IRCs at the 
invitation  of  intervenors  (Medical  Justice).  I  reject  the  Claimant’s  approach.  Cases 
should be decided on evidence, not assumptions.   

 
The Tameside issue  

164.  The second (and major) legal issue between the parties related to the question of the 
nature of the Tameside duty in the context of Chapter 55.10 EIG and the decision of Sales 
J and the Court of Appeal in R (Das) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 683 (Admin) and [2014] 
EWCA Civ 45.    

 

Submissions 
165.  The Claimant’s submissions can be summarised as follows: 

 

(1)  First, a  Tameside  duty  to  inquire  was  triggered  whenever  “there  was  a  real  (as 
opposed  to  a  fanciful  or  insubstantial)  possibility  that  an  immigrant  facing 
removal  was  suffering  from  serious  mental  ill-health  which  could  not  be 
satisfactorily  managed  while  in  detention”  (per  Sales  J  in  R  (Das)  v.  SSHD 
(supra) at [42]). 

(2)  Second, Sales J laid down a general test in Das for the application of Tameside in 
this context which still held good and which was supported by passages in the 
Court of Appeal in R (Das) v. SSHD (supra) [70], in R(S) v. SSHD [2011] EWHC 
2120  (Admin)  [171],  and  in  R(S)  v.  SSHD  [2011]  EWHC  2748  (Admin)  [183-
186].
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

 

(3)  Third,  there  was  a  continuing  Tameside  duty  which  arose  at  every  monthly 

review required by Chapter 55.8 EIG. 

(4)  Fourth, the threshold at which the Tameside duty was engaged was lower than the 

threshold at which the policy at Chapter 55.10 EIG applied to the individual. 

(5)  Fifth, once there was a ‘real possibility’ that an individual fell within the policy, 
no  reasonable  decision-maker  could  apply  the  policy  without  obtaining  ‘up-to-
date psychiatric evidence’. 

(6)  Sixth,  at  all  material  times  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to  make  sufficient 

inquiries in the present case at to the Claimant’s condition. 

166.  Ms Anderson’s submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State can be summarised as 

follows: 

(1)  First,  no  general  legal  test  was  developed  by  Sales  J  in  Das  in  the  context  of 

Chapter 55.10 EIG, nor is any appropriate. 

(2)  Second, even if Sales J purported to formulate a general test, any such test did not 

survive the Court of Appeal which set his decision aside. 

(3)  Third,  in  any  event,  on  the  facts  of  the  Das  case,  an  orthodox  application  of 
Tameside plainly required the Secretary of State there to consider a psychiatric 
report raising mental heath issues since one was in the actual possession of the 
UKBA at the time of the detention decision. 

(4)  Fourth, there was no Tameside or other public law breach in this case. 

 

 

Classic Tameside principles 
167.  The  general  principles  arising  out  of  the  Tameside  duty  were  summarised  in  R 
(Plantagenet  Alliance  Limited)  v.  Secretary  of  State  for  Justice  [2014]  EWHC  1662 
(Admin) [99]-[100] as follows: 

“99.  A public body has a duty to carry out a sufficient inquiry prior to making its 
decision. This is sometimes known as the ‘Tameside’ duty since the principle 
derives from Lord Diplock’s speech in Secretary of State for Education and 
Science  v  Tameside  MBC  [1977]  AC  1014,  where  he  said  (at  page  1065B): 
“The question for the court is, did the Secretary of State ask himself the right 
question  and  take  reasonable  steps  to  acquaint  himself  with  the  relevant 
information to enable him to answer it correctly?”. 

100. 

The following principles can be gleaned from the authorities: 

(1) 

(2) 

The obligation upon the decision-maker is only to take such steps to 
inform himself as are reasonable. 

Subject to a Wednesbury challenge, it is for the public body, and not 
the  court  to  decide  upon  the  manner  and  intensity  of  inquiry  to  be

undertaken  (R(Khatun)  v  Newham  LBC  [2005]  QB  37  at  paragraph 
[35], per Laws LJ). 

The court should not intervene merely because it considers that further 
inquiries  would  have  been  sensible  or  desirable.    It  should  intervene 
only if no reasonable authority could have been satisfied on the basis 
of the inquiries made that it possessed the information necessary for its 
decision (per Neill LJ in R (Bayani) v. Kensington and Chelsea Royal 
LBC (1990) 22 HLR 406). 

The court should establish what material was before the authority and 
should only strike down a decision by the authority not to make further 
inquiries  if  no  reasonable  council  possessed  of  that  material  could 
suppose  that  the  inquiries  they  had  made  were  sufficient  (per 
Schiemann  J  in  R  (Costello)  v  Nottingham  City  Council  (1989)  21 
HLR 301; cited with approval by Laws LJ in (R(Khatun) v Newham 
LBC (supra) at paragraph [35]). 

The  principle  that  the  decision-maker  must  call  his  own  attention  to 
considerations relevant to his decision, a duty which in practice may 
require him to consult outside bodies with a particular knowledge or 
involvement  in  the  case,  does  not  spring  from  a  duty  of  procedural 
fairness to the applicant, but from the Secretary of State’s duty so to 
inform himself as to arrive at a rational conclusion (per Laws LJ in (R 
(London  Borough  of  Southwark)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Education 
(supra) at page 323D). 

The wider the discretion conferred on the Secretary of State, the more 
important  it  must  be  that  he  has  all  relevant  material  to  enable  him 
properly to exercise it (R (Venables) v Secretary of State for the Home 
Department [1998] AC 407 at 466G).”

(6) 

 

Sales J and CA in Das 
 
168.  The construction and application of the phrase “suffering from a serious mental illness 
which  cannot  be  satisfactorily  managed  within  detention”  in  Chapter  55.10  EIG  was 
extensively  analysed  at  first  instance  and  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  R  (Das)  v  SSHD 
[2013] EWHC 683 (Admin) and [2014] EWCA Civ 45. 

 
169.  At first instance, Sales J held at [42]-[45] that the Secretary of State did not consider the 
application  of  the  policy  in  Chapter  55.10  EIG  adequately  because  she  did  not  take 
reasonable steps, either before or during Ms Das’s detention, to inform herself sufficiently 
about  Ms  Das’s  mental  health  so  as  to  make  an  informed  judgment  about  whether  the 
policy  applied  to  her.  Sales  J  nevertheless  held  that  the  Claimant  would  have  been 
detained in any event and awarded only nominal damages. 

 
170.  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  Sales  J  had  applied  too  high  a  threshold  test  for  the 
applicability of Chapter 55.10 EIG when stating (in ([61] of his judgment) that the term 
“serious mental illness” connoted “a serious inability to cope with ordinary life, to the 
level  (or  thereabouts)  of  requiring  in-patient  medical  attention  or  being  liable  to  be

sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983”. The Court of Appeal went on to allow the 
Claimant’s appeal, and remit the matter, on the basis that it was unable to conclude that 
the error of law did not affect the outcome of Ms Das’s claim (CA [8]). 

 
171.  In  the  leading  judgment  (with  which  Moses  and  Underhill  LJJ  agreed),  Beatson  LJ, 
emphasised that the fact-sensitive nature of the question meant that there were limits to 
the detailed guidance which could be given in relation to the policy. However, with that 
caveat, Beatson LJ nevertheless helpfully went on to make a number of general points by 
way of useful guidance ([61]-[77]). I respectfully summarise these as follows: 

(1)  First, it is necessary for the Secretary of State to consider whether the policy in 
Chapter 55.10 EIG applies to the case of an individual whose detention is being 
considered.   

 
(2)  Second, the threshold for applicability of Chapter 55.10 EIG is that the mental 
illness must be serious enough to mean that it cannot be satisfactorily managed in 
detention.  Satisfactory  management  meant  considering  matters  such  as  the 
medication  being  taken,  the  facilities  at  the  detention  centre  and  whether  the 
detainee’s  demonstrated  needs  are  such  that  they  can  or  cannot  be  provided  in 
detention. Beatson LJ highlighted the case of R(OM) v. SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ. 
909 which showed that some of those suffering from significant adverse effects 
from mental illness may be managed appropriately in detention (CA [67]). 

(3)  Third, where Chapter 55.10 EIG does apply, there is a high hurdle to overcome to 
justify  detention  i.e.  the  “very  exceptional  circumstances”  test.  The  balancing 
exercise described in R (Anam) v. SSHD [2009] EWHC 2496 (Admin) [52]-[54] 
included, in the case of foreign national prisoners (“FNP”), taking into account 
the risk the FNP posed to the public (CA [68]). 

(4)  Fourth, whether or not the policy in Chapter 55.10 EIG is strictly engaged, as part 
of  the  operation  of  the  Hardial  Singh  principles,  particular  care  is  needed  in 
assessing  whether  to  detain  a  person  known  to  have  a  mental  illness,  i.e. 
consideration  as  to  whether  particular  arrangements  will  be  needed  for  the 
detainee’s welfare and to monitor for deterioration (CA [69]). 

(5)  Fifth, the Secretary of State is not entitled to abdicate her statutory and public law 
responsibilitites  to  the  relevant  health  authorities  or  clinicians  in  the  way 
deprecated by Singh J in R (HA (Nigeria)) v. SSHD [2012] EWHC 979 (Admin) 
at [155] and [181] (CA [70]). 

(6)  Sixth, whilst it was not necessary to determine the issue in the present case, it was 
doubtful  that  the  framers  of  Chapter  55.10  EIG  meant  that  a  detainee’s  mental 
illness could not be satisfactorily managed in detention unless specific treatment 
which  could  improve  the  detainee’s  condition  was  made  available  in  detention 
(CA [71]).

Findings of facts in Das 
172.  The  facts  in  Das  were  described  by  Beatson  LJ  as  “stark”.    He  highlighted,  in 
particular,  (a)  the  awareness  by  the  Secretary  of  State’s  officials  in  general  terms  of  a 
psychiatric report about Ms Das at the time of her detention, (b) the actual receipt of that 
report  by  those  responsible  for  Ms  Das’s  detention  when  she  was  detained,  (c)  her 
frequent attendance at the health centre, (d) the fact that she was prescribed Risperidone 
(an  anti-psychotic  drug),  and  (e)  the  fact  that,  despite  this,  the  reviews  of  Ms  Das’s 
detention did not consider or review her psychiatric condition (CA [66]). 

173.  In order to appreciate the starkness of the facts in Das, and the gravamen of Sales J’s 
decision on the facts, it is necessary to set out the section of his judgment where he deals 
with the Tameside issue under the heading “Breach of duty of inquiry”:  

“42.  Having adopted a policy regarding detention of persons suffering from serious 
mental  ill-health,  the  Secretary  of  State  was  in  my  view  under  a  public  law 
obligation  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  give  practical  effect  to  that  policy, 
bearing  in  mind  the  importance  of  the  objective  which  it  was  designed  to 
promote  (namely,  the  humane  treatment  of  individuals  who  suffer  from 
serious mental ill-health). That means that if there was a real (as opposed to a 
fanciful  or  insubstantial)  possibility  that  an  immigrant  facing  removal  was 
suffering  from  serious  mental  ill-health  which  could  not  be  effectively 
managed while in detention, the Secretary of State had an obligation to take 
reasonable  steps 
relevant 
circumstances  so  as  to  be  able  to  make  an  informed  judgment  whether  the 
policy would have application or not in that individual's case: see Secretary of 
State  for  Education  and  Science  v  Tameside  Metropolitan  Borough  Council 
[1977] AC 1014, 1065B per Lord Diplock (""…did the Secretary of State ask 
himself the right question and take reasonable steps to acquaint himself with 
the relevant information to enable him to answer it correctly?"").  

inform  himself  sufficiently  about 

to 

the 

43. 

 
44. 

In my judgment, the Secretary of State breached this obligation of inquiry at 
the  outset  of  the  second  period  of  detention.  His  officials  in  the  decision-
making unit at the UKBA knew that there was in existence a psychiatric report 
in  respect  of  the  Claimant  (Dr  Sharma's  report)  which  might  well  have  a 
bearing  on  the  question  whether  she  was  suffering  from  serious  mental  ill-
health and whether she could properly be taken into detention. However, they 
failed  to  obtain  Dr  Sharma's  report  from  the  judicial  review  team,  as  I  find 
they could and should have done. They thereby failed to take reasonable steps 
open to them at the time to inform themselves properly about those issues. 

In  my  view,  that  failure  extended  throughout  and  affected  the  whole  of  the 
second period of detention. The significance placed on Dr Sharma's report on 
behalf of the Claimant was re-emphasised when it was sent to the decision-
making unit on 22 November 2011, but no-one in the unit reviewed it for the 
purposes of assessing whether it was right to continue to detain the Claimant; 
nor did they seek to pass it on to the medical staff at the detention centre to 
assist them in their assessments of the mental health of the Claimant. There 
were  significant  indications  from  what  the  Claimant  said  and  did  when  she 
was first detained and from what was found in her possession (medication and

letters for psychiatric appointments) that her mental health could be a serious 
issue.  The  Secretary  of  State  would  be  looking  to  the  medical  staff  at  the 
detention centre for on-going assessment of the Claimant's mental state, and in 
the circumstances ought to have provided them with relevant information in 
his  possession  which  was  so  clearly  germane  to  that  assessment  as  Dr 
Sharma's  report,  which  might  have  a  bearing  on  their  advice  back  to  him. 
(Incidentally, I note that - although this was not known to the officials in the 
decision-making unit - there were remarks in the medical notes in respect of 
the Claimant during her detention making it clear that the medical staff would 
have  liked  more  background  information  about  the  Claimant:  they  had 
unsuccessfully sought to obtain her medical records from her GP).  
I consider that this failure of inquiry by the Secretary of State so undermined 
the proper application of his policy as to render the whole of the second period 
of detention of the Claimant unlawful. “ 

45. 

174.  In the light of Sales J’s strong findings of fact highlighted above, it is unsurprising that 

he concluded there had been had been a clear breach of the Tameside duty in that case.    

 

 

Sales J and Beatson LJ’s orthodoxy  
175.  I do not read paragraph 42 of Sales J’s judgment as intending to lay down some special 
Tameside test or gloss, let alone a gloss which was heterodox.  Read as a whole, it seems 
to me Sales J was merely seeking to articulate orthodox Tameside in this context, namely, 
that the decision-maker had to take reasonable steps to inform him or herself sufficiently 
to be able to make an informed decision. Further, by highlighting that there must be “a 
real…  possibility”  of  serious  mental  ill-health,  Sales  J  was  merely  emphasising  the 
obvious, namely that a Tameside duty to make further inquiries would only arise where 
the decision-maker was put on reasonable inquiry in the first place.   

176.  Further, I do not think that the Court of Appeal in Das read Sales J’s judgment in any 
different way. In my view, Beatson LJ was merely putting the flipside of Tameside when 
he said at [70]: 

“However, where (unlike the present case) the Secretary of State through the 
UKBA  officials  has  conscientiously  made  reasonable  inquiries  as  to  the 
physical  and  mental  health  of  the  person  who  is  being  considered  for 
detention, has obtained such reports of clinicians who had previously treated 
the person as have been made available, and considered the implications of the 
policy in Chapter 55.10 for the detention of that person, leaving aside cases in 
which there has been negligence by the clinicians at the detention centre, she 
should generally be entitled to rely on the responsible clinician: see, albeit in 
the context of the European Convention of Human Rights, R (P) v. Secretary 
of State for Justice [2009] EWCA Civ. 701 at [49]-[50].” 

 
177.  In  my  view,  both  Sales  J  and  Beatson  LJ  were  merely  echoing  the  straightforward, 
pragmatic,  context-specific  approach  to  the  Tameside  question  seen  in  previous  cases, 
e.g.,  R  (HK  (Turkey)  v.  SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ  1357.    In  HK(Turkey),  the  Court  of 
Appeal held that, absent any independent evidence of torture, mere assertion of torture 
could not be sufficient to render a case unsuitable for the fast track procedure (whether or
--------

not  a  Rule  34  examination  had  been  carried  out)  ([24]-[25]).    I  do  not  accept  the 
Claimant’s  submission  that  HK  (Turkey)  is  irrelevant  because  it  only  involved  short 
periods of detention. The approach and principles are the same. 

178.  If I am wrong about the above, and Sales J was laying down a specific Tameside test in 
the Chapter 55.10 EIG context, I would respectfully disagree with such an approach and 
suggest it was not adopted or approved by the Court of Appeal. In my view, no bespoke 
Tameside test is required in this, or any other similar context. Tameside is a generic and 
flexible  public  law  principle  which  should  not  be  trammelled.  It  has  its  genesis  in  the 
English Common Law principle of ‘fairness’ (c.f. R(Plantagenet Alliance Ltd) (supra) at 
[84]  ff.).  Its  application  is  assuredly  context  and  fact-specific.  The  touchstone  of 
Tameside is that the decision-maker only has to take such steps to inform him or herself 
as are reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case at the time. 

179.  I  prefer  to  base  my  approach  on  orthodox  Tameside  as  enunciated  by  Beatson  LJ  in 
paragraphs  [69]-[70]  of  Das.    Further,  it  to  be  noted  that  Beatson  LJ  referred  to  the 
Secretary of State obtaining reports of clinicians who had previously treated the detainee 
“as  have  been  made  available”  (see  the  passage  from  paragraph  [70]  of  his  judgment 
cited  above).  He  did  so  deliberately,  in  my  view.  He  was  clearly  referring  to  existing 
reports which had come into the possession of the Secretary of State which would inform 
the scope of the duty to enquire. I agree with Ms Anderson that the duty to enquire cannot 
be ‘distorted’ to require the Secretary of State routinely to generate fresh ‘independent’ 
experts reports (see further below). 

 

 

The Claimant’s case fails on an orthodox view of Tameside  
180.  The  nub  of  the  Claimant’s  case,  as  formulated  by  Mr  Bowen  QC  and  Ms  Knorr 
applying  their  view  of  Sales  J  in  Das,  was  as  follows:  where  there  is  evidence  that  is 
available to the Secretary of State that a person is suffering from a mental illness that may 
fall within Chapter 55.10, the information relevant to the decision to detain includes the 
person’s  medical  records  and  an  up-to-date  psychiatric  assessment  and  report  as  to  the 
person’s mental illness and the application of Chapter 55.10.  

181.  In  my  judgment,  the  Claimant’s  case  founders  on  this  single  blanket  proposition.  As 
explained above, it is far too broad a proposition and does not accord with the true view 
of Tameside. If the Claimant’s proposition was correct, then in every case in which there 
was  a  mere possibility that a detainee, or potential detainee, might  be  suffering  from  a 
mental illness which might trigger Chapter 55.10 EIG, the authorities would be obliged 
(a)  to  conduct  a  full  trawl  of  all  the  person’s  medical  records,  including  confidential 
medical  records,  and  (b)  to  procure  a  full  up-to-date  psychiatric  assessment  on  that 
person, whether or not these steps were in fact necessary to determine the application or 
non-application of 55.10 EIG. This is, in my view, clearly incorrect in law and, in any 
event, would be unworkable and wasteful. The decision to detain is made on a case-by-
case basis. I repeat that Tameside requires the decision-maker to make only reasonable 
inquiries as to the potential detainees physical and mental health (See Beatson LJ in Das 
at [70]).  In many cases, the question of the possibility of the application of 55.10 EIG 
will be capable of early and easy resolution without resort to wasteful and unnecessary 
archaeology  into  all  the  detainees’s  medical  records  or  procuring  full-blown  medical 
reports.  Each  case  depends  on  its  own  facts.  I  repeat  that  Tameside  only  requires  the
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

scope of inquiries to be reasonable and proportionate, i.e. tailored to the instant case and 
question. The duty to inquire is not at large or not open-ended. 

182.  The absurdity of the Claimant’s approach can be demonstrated when applied to the rest 
of  55.10  EIG.    Logically,  if  the  Claimant’s  approach  is  correct,  then  the  same  modus 
operandi  should  apply  to  each  of  the  bullet  points  in  55.10  EIG.    Accordingly,  the 
authorities  would  be  obliged  ex  hypothesi  to  conduct  a  blanket  evidence-gathering 
exercise in relation to all those with potential age issues, medical conditions, disabilities 
etc.,  to  obviate  any  risk  that  the  condition  might  not  be  capable  of  being  satisfactorily 
managed  in  detention.  This  would  render  Chapter  55.10  unworkable.  It  would  also 
involve a considerable waste of public resources. To borrow the words of Beatson LJ in 
Das at [71], I strongly doubt whether the framers of the policy intended the policy to have 
such an effect. 

 

 

The Claimant’s case fails on the facts 
183.  In any event, the Claimant’s case also founders on the simple facts of the case.  When 
admitted to Harmondsworth IRC, the Claimant was know to have some mental problems, 
including depression, for which he had been receiving treatment and medication for the 
previous two years. Throughout his time at Harmondsworth IRC the Claimant was given 
regular  GP  appointments  and  his  condition  was  regularly  monitored  and  appropriate 
treatment given.  When, as a result of the intervention by Dr Robinson in July 2011, a 
suggestion was raised that the Claimant might have a more serious mental condition, the 
healthcare  team  set  up  an  appointment  with  a  consultant  psychiatrist  (Dr  Burrun)  who 
examined the Claimant in August 2011 and determined that the Claimant’s condition was 
such that it could continue to be satisfactorily managed in detention.  This proved in fact, 
to  be  the  case.  The  Claimant’s  condition  was  adequately  managed  in  detention  (see 
further below). 

 

Breach of Rule 34 

184.  The third legal issue between the parties relates to the question of Rule 34 examination. 
Rule  34  of  the  Detention  Centre  Rules  provides  that  every  detained  person  “shall  be 
given a physical and mental examination by the medical practitioner… within 24 hours of 
his  admission  to  the  detention  centre”.    Rule  34  links  with  Rule  35,  which  requires  a 
doctor to report to the manager of an IRC an individual whose health may be injuriously 
affected by detention. 

185.  The Claimant’s submissions can be summarised as follows: 

(1)  On the facts, no Rule 34 examination of the Claimant took place within 24 hours 
of his arrival in detention at IRC Harmondsworth. He was seen by a nurse during 
his  health  care  induction  but  was  not  examined  by  a  GP.    But  for  a  brief 
examination by a GP on 31 December 2010 when he was prescribed medication  
for  gastritis,  the Claimant was  not seen by a  GP in Harmondsworth until 28 
April 2011 and was not examined by a psychiatrist from Harmondsworth until 20 
August 2011.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

(2)  On  the  law,  a  failure  to  provide  the  Rule  34  examination  itself  renders  the 
detention unlawful because a breach of Rule 34 of the Detention Rules ‘bears on’ 
the detention and renders the detention unlawful: per Burnett J in R (EO) v SSHD 
[2013]  EWHC  1236  (Admin)  (who  declined  to  follow  Haddon-Cave  J  in  R 
(Belkasim) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWHC 3109 
(Admin)). 

186.  Ms  Anderson  objected  to  this  ground  on  the  basis  that  it  did  not  form  part  of  the 
Claimant’s  pleaded  Grounds  (and  hence  was  not  covered  in  the  witness  evidence)  and 
permission was not given for it.  It is fair to say that the Rule 34 argument was only first 
raised  in  the  Claimant’s  skeleton  dated  24  May  2014.      However,  since  the  matter  has 
been fully developed in argument and the issues are ones of law and the interpretation 
rather than of primary fact (which do not appear to be materially in dispute), it seems to 
me appropriate to admit it. 

 

 

Analysis – the law  
187.  On the law, I can say without hesitation that, having had the benefit of reading studying 
Burnett  J’s  magisterial  analysis  in  EO  of  R  (Lumba)  v  SSHD  [2011]  UKSC  12  and  R 
(Kambadzi) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 23 and Rules 34 and 35 (at [28]-[40] and [49]-[52]), I 
respectfully  agree  with  his  conclusion  that  breach  of  Rule  34  will  render  a  detainee’s 
detention unlawful because it ‘bears on’ the decision to detain in the sense dictated by the 
majority in Lumba. I also respectfully agree with him that my decision on this point in R 
(Belkasim)  v.  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (supra)  at  [121]-[126],  that 
breach  of  Rules  34  and  35  without  more  did  not  render  detention  unlawful  and  the 
detainee  must  prove  causation,  is  wrong.  As  Burnett  J  correctly  observed  at  [52], 
causation  is  relevant  to  the  question  of  whether  a  claimant  should  be  entitled  to 
compensatory  damages  but  not  to  the  anterior  question  of  the  lawfulness  of  detention 
itself. 

188.  Ms Anderson relied on the doctrine of stare decisis (as deployed in e.g. MN(Tanzania) 
[2011] 1 WLR 3200) and submitted that my decision in Belkasim cannot be said to have 
been ‘obviously wrong’. I am afraid that Burnett J’s compelling exergesis in EO shows 
that  my  somewhat  brusque  decision  on  the  point  in  Belkasim  was  obviously  wrong. 
Burnett J was, with respect, obviously right not to follow me. (I console myself with the 
thought that Burnett J may have had the benefit of fuller argument on the point).  

Analysis – the facts 
189.  On the facts, Ms Anderson submitted that the health assessment conducted by a nurse 
on the Claimant’s entry to detention amounted to a valid Rule 34 assessment.  I disagree. 
Rule 34 is quite explicit in requiring “a physical and mental examination” of detainees 
on  admission  by  a  “medical  practitioner”.  The  reference  to  “medical  practitioner”  is 
clearly a reference to a doctor, not a nurse.  As Burnett J pointed out at paragraph [49] of 
EO, a Rule 34 examination is supposed to be in addition to the routine medical screening 
which is conducted by nursing staff on admission. In my judgment, the routine health care 
induction given to the Claimant on his admission to Harmondsworth IRC by a nurse did 
not amount to a Rule 34 examination. It was not a “physical and mental examination” in 
any real sense. Nor was it an examination carried out by a “medical practitioner”. Nor 
does does not pass muster, as Ms Anderson suggested, as being a medical examination by 
someone of a ‘different grade’ (c.f. Lumba at [68]). The routine medical screening carried
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

out by a nurse on admission was altogether something qualitatively quite different from a 
physical and mental examination by a doctor.  

190.  Ms Anderson argued that it was an ‘adequate’ assessment in the sense that it could have 
led to a Rule 35 referral if the nurse had noticed anything to contraindicate detention at 
that  stage.  In  my  view,  however,  this  is  no  answer  in  law  to  the  separate  plain 
requirements of Rule 34. Rules 34 and 35 are cumulative not alternative. Nor does the 
fact that the Claimant was already in custody and being transferred from HMP Bullwood 
Hall  to  Harmondsworth  IRC  dilute  the  requirement  of  Rule  34  to  conduct  a  medical 
examination on admission to the IRC. A rule change would be required to give effect to 
this. 

191.  For the above reasons, therefore, in my view, the failure of the immigration authorities 
to  carry  out  a  Rule  34  medical  examination  of  the  Claimant  on  admission  to 
Harmondsworth IRC within 24 hours of his admission on 21 December 2010 meant that 
his  detention  from  that  point  of  time  was  unlawful.    His  detention  did  not  remain 
unlawful, however, because a Rule 34 examination was carried out some 5-6 weeks later 
(see further below).   

 

Causation 
 192.  I turn, however, to the question of causation, i.e. whether or not, even if a requisite Rule 
34 examination of the Claimant had been carried out on 21 December 2010, this would 
have affected the decision to continue to detain the Claimant. In this case, the answer is 
‘No’. 

193.  In EO, Burnett J said as follows: 

“53.  
In the light of the Secretary of State's acceptance of the materiality of 
Rule 34, the conclusion dictated by Lumba is that if an immigration detainee, 
in the absence of good reason, is not medically examined within 24 hours of 
his arrival at a detention centre, his detention thereafter will be unlawful. That 
is  not  to  say  that  there  is  scope  for  a  multiplicity  of  actions  against  the 
Secretary of State on this narrow ground. There is no reason to suppose that 
Rule  34  medical  examinations  are  not  usually  conducted  within  24  hours. 
Because  the  legality  of  detention  is  concerned  with  compliance  with  the 
Secretary of State's policy (and not with a direct breach of the Rule) a good 
reason for non-compliance would save the legality of detention. The Rule 34 
examination is, in the context of a decision to detain, but a stepping stone to a 
Rule 35 report. If no Rule 35 report were raised when a medical examination 
did  take  place  (albeit  late)  then  it  would  follow  that  the  decision  to  detain 
would have been the same.”  

 

194.  As  will  be  seen  from  the  above  chronology,  on  1  February  2011  the  Claimant  was 
briefly  transferred  to  Colnbrook  IRC  where  a  healthcare  induction  was  conducted  at 
Colnbrook  IRC  followed  by  a  GP  appointment.  The  Claimant  also  signed  a  routine 
disclaimer allowing the Colnbrook IRC healthcare team to disclose relevant information 
regarding his medical conditions, history or mental heath to named entities including the 
UKBA whilst in the establishment, i.e. Colnbrook IRC.  The Claimant was returned to 
Harmondsworth IRC the same day, on 21 February 2011. A Rule 34 examination thus
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

 

took place some 5-6 weeks later after his first admission to IRC detention. At no stage, 
however, did it result in a Rule 35 referral being made. 

 
Nominal damages 
195.  It follows, therefore, subject to any further findings below, that the failure to conduct a 
Rule 34 examination on 21 December 2010 was non-causative, i.e. would have made no 
difference to the Claimant’s continued detention. The Secretary of State would not have 
released the Claimant in any event (c.f. Lumba, supra).  Accordingly, the Claimant is only 
entitled  to  nominal  damages  for  the  period  during  which  the  Claimant’s  detention  was 
unlawful  by  reason  of  the  failure  to  carry  out  a  Rule  34  examination,  i.e.  from  21 
December 2010 to 1 February 2011. 

 

‘Imputation’ of public law errors to the Secretary of State 

196.  The  fourth  legal  issue  raised  by  the  Claimant  related  to  ‘imputation’  of  public  law 
errors. The Claimant contended that a breach by the detaining authority (or its agent or 
employee  or  a  private  contractor  employed  by it)  can  be  ‘imputed’  to  the  Secretary  of 
State  such  as  to  render  a  decision  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  detain  an  individual 
unlawful.  As  authority  for  this  proposition,  the  Claimant  relied  upon  the  following 
citations of authority which it was submitted could not be said to be clearly wrong: R(HA 
Nigeria)) v. SSHD [2012] EWHC 979 (Singh J), §§ 155, 170, 181; R(S) v SSHD, [2011] 
EWHC 2120  § 221  (David Elvin QC); R (EH) v SSHD [2012] EWHC 2569 (Admin), 
§152 (Lang J); S v SSHD [2014] EWHC 50 (Thornton QC), § 274.  The Claimant further 
submitted that the Supreme Court in Woodland v. Essex County Council [2013] UKSC 66 
regarding  non-delegable  duties  was  a  ‘game-changer’  and  reinforced  the  Claimant’s 
imputation argument.  

197.  Ms Anderson submitted that the Claimant’s submission - that any breach of public law 
by those practically concerned with an individual’s detention at the detention centre can 
be ‘imputed’ to the Secretary of State in a manner that makes it legitimate to strike down 
the  decision  to  detain  -  was  erroneous  in  law.    I  agree.    The  authorities  cited  by  the 
Claimant cites do not support the (novel) proposition that any breach by others can be 
‘imputed’ to the Secretary of State in a manner that can give rise to a claim in damages 
for unlawful detention (as opposed, e.g., to a claim for medical negligence in a private 
law tort). The following points are pertinent. 

198.  First, Singh J in HA(Nigeria) is authority for the opposite to that for which the Claimant 
contends.  Singh J expressly declined to visit the errors of others on the Secretary of State 
and found that it was the Secretary of State’s own decision dated 1 February 2010 which 
was  flawed  by  her  own  public  law  error.  The  case  essentially  involved  allegations  of 
medical negligence by the responsible clinicians. There was no ‘imputation’ of public law 
errors to the Secretary of State. Any errors were not public law errors in any event.   

199.  Second, S v SSHD [2014] 2120 (Admin) concerned Article 3 ECHR. The case did not 
involve the ‘imputation’ of public law errors such as to render detention unlawful.  In so 
far as it may be said to have implied there was scope for ‘imputation’ in the context of 
Article 3 ECHR, it is to be doubted since the Deputy Judge does not appear to have had 
the  benefit  of  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  decisions  in  P  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  701  and 
MD(Angola) [2011] EWCA Civ 1238.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

 

200.  Third, I do not read HHJ Thornton QC’s decision in S [2014] EWHC 50 (Admin) as 
purporting to lay down a principle of ‘imputation’ of public law errors. In so far as it does 
speak of a ‘duty of care’, however, it is to be doubted since it is well established that there 
is no duty of care in relation to carrying out public law functions.  

201.  Fourth, the passage from EH [2012] 2569 at paragraph [152] is referring to a (disputed) 
imputation of confidential medical information, not the imputation of a public law error.  
In the latter regard, in my judgment, it is clearly wrong (for the reasons given below). 

202.  Fifth, Beatson LJ made it clear in paragraph 70 of Das (supra)  that the Secretary of 
State  is  generally  entitled  to  proceed  on  the  basis  that  duties  will  be  performed 
competently (consistent with the ‘principle of regularity’).   

203.  Sixth,  public  law  requires  the  Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  the  power  to  detain 
reasonably on the basis of what is reasonably within her knowledge at the time. It does 
not require perfect foresight or perfection in every aspect of decision-making.  

204.  Seventh, the fact that matters may not turn out to be as they were reasonably considered 
to be at the time of decision does not allow a decision to be held unlawful retrospectively. 
Hindsight  has  no  place  in  deciding  unlawful  detention  claims  (c.f.  Hussein  [2009] 
EWHC  2506  at§  105 upheld  in  MH  [2011] EWCA  Civ.  1112;  Shehasdeh  [2013] 
CSOH 139; AA(Afghanistan)[2012] EWCA Civ.  1383 and [2013] UKSC 49). 

205.  For  these  reasons,  the  Claimant’s  proposition  that  public  law  errors  by  the  detaining 

authority may be ‘imputed’ to the Secretary of State is not good law. 

 

‘Imputation’  of knowledge  to the Secretary  of State 
 
206.  The fifth legal issue raised by the Claimant related to ‘imputation’ of knowledge. The 
Claimant  contended  that  knowledge  of  healthcare  staff  employed  by  the  detaining 
authority or a private contractor about a detainee’s condition could be ‘imputed’ to  the 
Secretary  of  State.  In  support  of  this  proposition,  the  Claimant  relied  on  Lang  J’s 
judgment in R (EH) v. SSHD [2012] EWHC 2569 (Admin) [150]-[153] and [156]. 

207.  In my judgment, the Claimant’s proposition is wrong and pays no regard to context. 
Detention Centre Rules, in particular Rules 34 and 35, form part of a general system of 
checks  and  balances  for  the  regular  monitoring  of  detainees  and  ensuring  that  relevant 
information as to their mental and physical condition is brought to the attention of the 
SSHD in a timely fashion (as I said in R (Belkasim) v. Secretary of State for the Home 
Department [2012] EWHC 3109 (Admin) at [35]).    

208.  It  is  clear  that  when  assessing  whether  to  detain  a  person  known  to  have  a  mental 
illness  particular  care  is  needed:  the  Secretary  of  State,  through  her  officials,  should 
consider whether particular arrangements should be made to monitor a detainee’s welfare 
or for signs of deterioration (see Beatson LJ in Das at [69]). If, however, the Secretary of 
State has fulfilled her duty to ensure that suitable particular arrangements are in fact put 
in  place  for  detainees  with  particular  needs,  in  my  judgment,  it  is  not  necessary  (or 
appropriate) as a matter of public law that knowledge of all healthcare staff in the system 
is then automatically ‘deemed’ to be that of the Secretary of State. There are three reasons 
for  this.  First,  the  Secretary  of  State  is  generally  entitled  to  rely  on  medical
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

professionals to fulfil their duties (c.f. Das). Second, individual acts of negligence by 
medical  professionals  do  not  generally  give  rise  to  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  the 
Secretary  of  State  under  Article  3  or  8  ECHR  (c.f.  MD  (Angola)).  Third,  the 
‘imputation’  of  knowledge  would  violate  of  the  fundamental  duty  of  confidentiality 
axiomatic  to  the  clinician-patient  relationship  and  run  counter  to  inter  alia  to:  (i)  the 
ECHR duty of confidentiality (Z v Finland ECHR ruling 22009/93 [1997] at § 95); (ii) 
domestic statutory rules on medical clinician-patient confidentiality, (iii) data protection 
law,  (iv)  contractual  obligations  to  maintain  medical  confidentiality;  and  (v)  the 
professional duties in relation to confidential medical information which the Strasbourg 
Court found were essential to underpin patient confidence in the medical profession. 

209.  For these reasons, I reject the Claimant’s proposition that knowledge of healthcare staff 
may be ‘imputed’ to the Secretary of State.  And to the extent that it is supported by Lang 
J in EH, I would respectfully decline to follow EH.  

 
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OF FACT 

210.  My principal finding of fact are as follows: 

(1)  First,  the  evidence  and  opinion  of  Dr  Burrun  is  to  be  preferred  to  that  of  Dr 
Robinson and Dr Basu, viz. whilst the Claimant’s condition may have included 
depression,  a  diagnosis  of  paranoid  schizophrenia  is  doubtful.  As  Dr  Burrun 
pointed  out,  HMP  Bullwood  Hall  treated  the  Claimant  for  depression  with 
possible psychotic symptoms not for a psychotic disorder.   

(2)  Second, at no stage was the Claimant’s mental condition such that it could not be 
satisfactorily managed in detention and, therefore, Chapter  55.10 EIG was never 
engaged. It is noteworthy that even Dr Basu accepted that the pharmacological 
management of the Claimant’s condition could have been satisfactorily managed 
in detention (see his report dated 26 June 2013). 

(3)  Third,  at  all  material  times  the  Claimant’s  mental  condition  was  in  fact 
adequately  managed  in  detention,  viz.    the  Claimant  was  given  regular  GP 
appointments and his prescriptions adjusted (see Dr Burran’s report).  

 

 
 
EXPERT EVIDENCE 
 
Dr Robinson’s report of 9 July 2011 
211.  The Claimant relied heavily on Dr Robinson’s report of 9 July 2011. I was, however, 
unimpressed with it. It seemed curiously pre-disposed to achieving a finding favourable 
to  the  Claimant’s  case,  i.e.  “psychosis…  which  cannot  be  effectively  diagnosed  or 
managed in a detention centre”. His conclusion that the Claimant “does not appear to be 
receiving adequate treatment in detention” was, moreover, superficial and made without 
any apparent examination of the detailed medical records.  

 
212.  Dr  Robinson  may  have  led  himself  into  thinking  that  the  fact  that  the  Claimant  had 
been  prescribed  Olazapine  in  the  past,  indicated  that  the  Claimant  was  suffering  from
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

 

psychosis. However, as the Claimant himself explained in one of his medical assessments 
at  HMP  Bullwood  Hall,  he  had  been  prescribed  Olanzapine  by  his  GP  in  the  past  for 
agitation and aggression.   

 
Dr Burrun’s examination on 20 August 2011 
213.  Following  Dr  Robinson’s  intervention  on  behalf  of  Medical  Justice  on  9  July  2011 
claiming  that  the  Claimant  had  ‘a  psychotic  disorder’,  the  Claimant  was  seen  on  20 
August  2011  by  the  relevant  IRC  Consultant  Psychiatrist,  Dr  Burrun,  who  satisfied 
himself that the Claimant was not suffering from any serious psychotic problems. In his 
report  for  the  Court  dated  14  March  2014,  Dr  Burrun  stated  as  follows  regarding  his 
examination of the Claimanton 20 August 2010: 

“Mr K reported to be suffering from depression since 2008. DK reported feeling 
better since restarting tablet Olanzapine 5 mg daily on the 07.07.11. DK reported 
that  the  voices  were  less  intense  and  less  frequent.  …  He  said  that  his  appetite 
varies  and  he  has  been  sleeping  properly.  He  denies  harbouring  any  feelings  of 
self-harm or harm to others. He denied experiencing any psychotic symptoms and 
objectively  there  was  no  evidence  of  DK  responding  to  any  kind  of  internal 
stimuli. DK said that he had bail hearing on 21.08.11. He was happy to continue 
taking  his  prescribed  medication  and  he  was  offered  One  to  One  Counselling 
session with the Psychiatric nurse as well as further Psychiatric clinic follow up.”   

214.  There was then suitable follow up by the psychiatric nurse on 6 September 2010 who 

 

 

reported ‘no current issues’. 

 

 

Dr Basu’s first and second reports 19 October 2011 and 16 April 2013 
215.  The  Claimant’s  also  relied  upon  the  first  and  second  reports  of  Dr  Basu  dated  19 
October 2011 and 16 April 2013. Dr Basu examined the Claimant on 5 October 2011 and 
produced a first report on 19 October 2011 diagnosing the Claimant with schizophrenia 
and  criticising  the  Harmondsworth  IRC  healthcare  team  for  the  care  given  to  the 
Claimant.  His  second  report  repeated  these  findings  and  stated  that  the  Claimant’s 
condition  could  not  be  satisfactorily  managed  in  detention  and  again  criticising  the 
Harmondsworth  IRC  healthcare  team  for  the  care  given  to  the  Claimant  whilst  in 
detention. 

216.  I  do  not  accept  Dr  Basu’s  evidence  that  the  Claimant  was  suffering  from  a  serious 

mental condition that could not satisfactorily be managed in detention. 

 
217.  I found both reports unsatisfactory and lacking objectivity. They both appeared to be 
the  inevitable  product  of  a  string  of  leading  questions  formulated  and  posed  by  the 
Claimant’s solicitors, Messrs Wilson.  In relation to the first report, Wilsons posed no less 
than 25 questions for Dr Basu including for e.g. “Whether my client is delusional…?”, “Is 
my  client  taking  the  appropriate  dose  of  Olanzapine?    If  so,  why  does  my  client  still 
appear to be psychotic/ have delusions?” etc.  

 
 
Misconceived approach 
218.  The  Claimant’s  approach  to  the  medical  evidence  in  this  judicial  case  has  been 
misconceived. This is not a private law medical negligence case. Permission for judicial
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

review proceedings was given to bring a public law claim in relation to alleged breaches 
by the Secretary of State of her immigration detention policy.  Under basic administrative 
and  public  law  principles,  the  reasonableness  of  decision-making  is  to  be  judged  by 
reference to the information available to the decision-maker at the time of the impugned 
decision.  In my view, Dr Basu’s first and second reports are not properly directed to the 
main  question  as  to  whether  the  decision  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  detain,  or  to 
continue  to  detain,  under  55.10  EIG  could  be  considered  irrational  or  Wednesbury 
unreasonable or in breach of Tameside duties on the basis of the information reasonably 
available at the time. Instead, they seem primarily aimed at launching an ex post facto 
attack on the responsible healthcare team and Dr Burrun’s diagnosis and treatment of the 
Claimant  and  (in  the  second  report)  criticising  the  general  medical  facilities  at  the 
Harmondsworth IRC on the basis of an HM Inspector of Prison’s Reports of 2010.    

 

219.  The  Claimant  also  seeks  to  criticise  Dr  Burran  for  not  dealing  with  the  Claimant’s 
experts’ critiques of him. However, that is not the role of the responsible clinician in a 
judicial review. Dr Burran is not an ‘expert’ instructed by the Secretary of State in a legal 
negligence claim. He is merely the independent responsible clinician giving purely factual 
evidence as to what steps were taken at the time with regard to the care of a detainee and 
why.    

 
 
Public and private law proceedings 
220.  I am not alone in deprecating the attempts to turn the judicial review procedure into a 
private law recovery procedure, contrary to the CPR. In R (Brendankemp) [2013] EWHC 
2480  (Admin),  Dingmans  J  highlighted  the  distinction  between  public  law  questions 
raised by judicial review (which are concerned with the legality of decisions and not their 
merits) and private law proceedings. He pointed out time-consuming and expensive Part 
18  information  requests  (such  as  I  understand  were  also  deployed  in  this  case)  should 
were  very  rarely  used  in  judicial  review  proceedings  and  drew  attention  to  “[the] 
principled  differences  between  proceedings  by  way  of  judicial  review  and  ordinary 
litigation”. 

 

221.  I  agree  with  Ms  Anderson  that,  if  condoned,  the  Claimant’s  approach  to  this  sort  of 
expert evidence would have potentially wide-ranging deleterious effects, both in relation 
to the conduct of other judicial reviews and the ability of the authorities to persuade NHS 
consultants to provide care to detainees. 

 
The Claimant’s medical records 
222.  The Claimant’s medical records for 2010 at HMP Bullwood Hall are illuminating. His 
medical  assessment  on  6  June  2010  recorded  the  Claimant  (i)  saying  that  he  found 
hearing his late father’s voice telling him to ‘stay out of trouble’ comforting rather than 
distressing; (ii) stating there was no known family history of physical or mental problems; 
(iii) reporting that he had been treated for depression for two years by his GP but denying 
experiencing  any  mental  health  problems  previously;  and  (iv)  stating  that  he  had  been 
prescribed  Olanzapine  because  of  agitation  and  aggression,  but  he  was  better  able  to 
control his temper.  

 
223.  These statements undermine Dr Robinson’s and Dr Basu’s reports. This latter answer 
undermines  Dr  Basu’s  answer  to  the  one  of  Claimant’s  Solicitors’  (Messrs  Wilsons) 
leading  questions  put  to  him,  namely:  ‘Would  a  Psychiatrist  prescribe  Olanzapine  to  a
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

patient who did not have psychosis, i.e. would a patient who had been diagnosed with 
depression be prescribed with Olanzapine?’. In his report dated 19 October 2011, Dr Basu 
said  that  ‘Olanzapine  is  an  antipsychotic  drug  that  is  only  licenced  for  use  with 
schizophrenia  or  mania’  and  it  is  ‘not  indicated  for  a  patient  suffering  solely  from 
depression’. 

 
224.  The Claimant Care Assessment by South Essex Partnership University NHS 

Foundation Trust dated 6 June 2010 concluded:  

“[D]  was  appropriate  throughout  the  assessment,  he  maintained  good  eye 
contact and was able to answer questions concisely. There was no evidence of 
response to psychotic phenomena, no was there evidence of thought disorder, 
insertion,  ideas  of  reference  or  bizarre  beliefs.  His  emotions  and  behaviour 
were congruent to the situation and no concerns were raised. 
 [D] is due for release in six weeks and I have advised him to remain on his 
medication until he can speak to his GP about reducing it.  He agreed with 
this. 
There was no evidence for any further input from In-Reach; for closure.” 

 
225.  I have carefully read and considered the Claimant’s medical records at Harmondsworth 
IRC (a summary of the entries appears in the chronology). The records form a coherent 
sequence. In my view, they demonstrate regular and diligent monitoring of the Claimant 
and  his  needs  throughout  his  period  of  detention  at  Harmondsworth  IRC.  They  do  not 
suggest the Claimant was someone with serious mental problems, let alone that he was 
someone whose ‘serious’ condition was being ignored by the system.  On the contrary, 
the records suggest the healthcare team were responsive in a timely way to the Claimant’s 
various  complaints,  e.g.  feeling  bullied  and  stressed,  and  requests  for  changes  in  his 
medication. This was despite the Claimant feeling free to attend or miss GP appointments 
at will and being capable of being deeply offensive: when the Claimant was advised by 
the GP on 10 May 2011 to approach the UKBA because the bullying problem was not a 
medical problem the Claimant remarked “this Indian is fucking useless”.   

 
226.  It will be apparent from the above that the Claimant’s claim is bound to fail on both the 
factual  and  expert  evidence.    I  nevertheless  turn  to  deal  in  detail  with  the  plethora  of 
grounds raised by the Claimant.  

 

 

GROUNDS 

Ground 1: unlawful detention: issues to be determined on the evidence 

‘First period’ of detention: 12 December 2010 to 19 May 2011 
 
Stage 1 
Was the detention lawful?  
227.  Mr Bowen QC and Ms Knorr submit on behalf of the Claimant that the first period of 
detention, between 12 December 2010 to 19 May 2011, was unlawful on six grounds. I 
consider each of these seriatim below (even though this involves some repetition).
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

 

 

(i)  Claimant’s ‘real possiblity’ test 
228.  First, the Claimant contends that there was a ‘real possibility’, on the evidence available 
to the Secretary of State, that the Claimant fell within Chapter 55.10 EIG before and at 
the time the decision to detain, in particular (i) a letter from the Claimant’s GP dated 10 
August  2009,  and  (ii)  extravagant  claims  made  in  his  asylum  interviews  might  be 
indicative of continuing mental illness such as that described by the Claimant’s GP.  

229.  I reject this ground on the law and the facts. It is based on a misconceived view of the 
law, namely a misunderstanding of Sales J in Das (see above). In any event, on any view 
of the Tameside test in this context, there was insufficient material to put the Secretary of 
State on further inquiry at the time, let alone suggest that the Claimant was suffering from 
a  serious  mental  illness  which  could  not  be  satisfactorily  managed  in  detention.  The 
matter must be judged on the basis of the material available to the Secretary of State at 
the time, not with hindsight. The material relied upon by the Claimant does not begin to 
pass  any  sort  of  threshold  test.  The  GP’s  letter  in  question  was  dated  over  16  months 
before the Claimant’s admission to IRC detention. The Claimants’ claims to have had a 
successful family business in Cyprus and access to substantial funds do not in any way 
undermine the conclusion of the caseworker in the GCID Case Record Sheet: 

“DK  is  38  and  10  months  of  age,  believed  to  be  in  good  health,  apart  from  some 
mental health issues that a Doctor confirmed he was suffering from in 2008. In 2010 
he was suffering from depression, but there is nothing to indicate that DK is not well 
at present.”  

230.  It  is  clear  from  LE  (Jamaica)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2012] 
EWCA Civ 597 and OM (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] 
EWHC  2147  (Admin)  (both  approved  of  in  Das)  that  even  those  with  much  more 
debilitating serious mental illnesses with current adverse effects did not engage Chapter  
55.10  EIG.    In  LE(Jamaica)  the  detainee  suffered  from  very  serious  schizophrenia.  In 
OM(Nigeria) the detainee suffered from very severe depression rendering the individual 
suicidal. There was no evidence before the Secretary of State (or the treating clinicians) in 
this case that the Claimant has been diagnosed with, or was suffering from, a psychotic 
illness, let alone one that could not be managed satisfactorily in detention. 

 
 
(ii)  ‘Duty to obtain ‘independent’ psychiatric report’  
231.  Second, Mr Bowen QC and Ms Knorr argued that, in the light of the evidence under (i) 
above,  and  applying  Tameside,  the  the  Secretary  of  State  have  obtained  further 
information, in particular the Claimant’s medical records from the community and HMP 
Bullwood Hall together with an ‘independent’ psychiatric assessment and report as to the 
Claimant’s  mental  illness  before,  or  within  a  reasonable  period  after,  the  decision  to 
detain.   

 
232.  This  argument  fails  because  of  my  finding  on  the  facts  that  there  was  insufficient 
evidence to put the Secretary of State on further inquiry, even on the Claimant’s view of 
the Tameside test in this context (see above). In any event, the argument is circular. Mr 
Boyd  QC  and  Ms  Knorr  argue  that  the  question  whether  the  Claimant’s  mental  illness 
was  so  ‘serious’  it  could  not  be  satisfactorily  managed  in  detention  could  only  be 
answered by ‘up-to-date’ medical evidence from a qualified psychiatrist, with access to 
medical records from the community and HMP Bullwood Hall. This begs the question
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

 

whether there was sufficient material to put the Secretary of State on reasonable inquiry 
in the first place. There was not.   

233.  I should make it clear, however, that I do not accept that there is a duty on the Secretary 
of State to obtain an ‘independent’ medical report, in the sense apparently contended for 
by Mr Bowen QC and Ms Knorr, namely independent from the UKBA. 

234.  In  any  event,  even  if  (contrary  to  the  above)  the  Secretary  of  State  had  a  legal 
obligation  to  obtain  the  Claimant’s  confidential  medical  records  or  an  ‘independent’ 
expert psychiatric report regarding the Claimant, it would have made no difference to the 
decision  to  detain  in  this  case.    It  is  clear  from  the  prison  medical  records  that  the 
Claimant was referred for examination to the ‘In-Reach’ team in prison but discharged 
without  any  follow  up  on  the  basis  that  his  mental  health  was  stable  and  he  did  not 
display  any  evidence  of  psychosis.  The  Claimant’s  case  based  on  the  obtaining  of 
unspecified ‘independent’ Psychiatric Consultant’s reports is essentially speculative.  

 
 
(iii)  ‘Failure to pass on information’  
235.  Third, Mr Bowen QC and Ms Knorr argue that the UKBA’s failure to pass information 
from HMP Bullwood Hall relevant to the Claimant’s mental illness to UKBA on form 
IS91RA to Harmondsworth IRC rendered the detention unlawful. 

 

236.  This is a makeweight point. The omission was not causative. The missing information 
in question was simply the fact that, whilst the ‘psychiatric disorder’ box had been ticked 
on the IS91RA, this had not been transferred to the IS 91 Detention Authority. However, 
during  his  health  care  induction,  the  Claimant  gave  the  mental  health  nurse  all  the 
relevant information, viz. that (i) he had been suffering from depression since 2008 for 
which  had  been  taking  citalopram  and  Olanzapine,  (ii)  he  had  considered  throwing 
himself in the Thames in 2008, and (iii)  he wanted to see a psychiatrist. Thus, the fact 
that  the  Claimant  had  suffered  from  psychiatric  problems  had  already  been  noted  (see 
above). There was no, however, indication or information provided by the prison that the 
Claimant was suffering from a psychotic illness which contra-indicated detention.   

 
237.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  point  was  not  pleaded,  nor  had  permission,  nor  was  it 
explained  how  a  failure  to  transmit  the  information  about  the  ticked  box  rendered  the 
detention  unlawful.  It  was  not  a  public  law  error,  nor  one  which  could  bear  on  the 
decision to detain in the relevant sense. Neither was it shown how this ‘failure’ would 
have had any effect even if full medical records had been available. It is clear that the 
same  decision  to  detain  would  have  been  made  in  any  event.  These  sort  of  points 
underscore the general lack of merit of the Claimant’s case. 

 
 
Confidential medical information 
238.  I  accept  Ms  Anderson’s  general  submission  that  the  usual  system  for  passing 
confidential  medical  information  from  responsible  clinician  to  responsible  clinician 
applies in detention as in the community. Accordingly, aside from the usual statutory and 
professional duties on responsible clinicians, the primary healthcare providers are under a 
contractual  obligation  to  obtain  records  with  consent  through  Rules  34-36  of  the 
Detention Service Operating Standards Provision. As recorded in the agreed chronology, 
the responsible clinicians at the IRC received the Claimant’s detailed medical notes on 18
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

 

November  2010  prior  to  the  transfer  of  the  Claimant  on  21  November  2010.  These 
records included the previous medical records obtained by the prison healthcare services.   

 

(iv)  ‘Failure to act on information at medical screening’  
239.  Fourth, Mr Bowen QC and Ms Knorr argue that the failure to refer the Claimant to a 
psychiatrist in the light of the disclosure by the Claimant during his medical screening 
interview, that he was taking Olanzipine and wished to see a psychiatrist, rendered the 
detention  unlawful.    They  submit  the  Claimant  should  have  been  be  seen  by  the  GP, 
either as part of the Rule 34 report process or independently of that process, such that a 
referral to a psychiatrist could be pursued. 

240.  I  do  not  accept  that  the  mere  failure  to  accede  to  a  detainee’s  request  to  see  a 
psychiatrist  renders  detention  unlawful.  As  stated  above,  the  usual  process  of  referral 
from primary care clinicians to the NHS Consultant secondary care specialists applies in 
detention as in the community. It is a matter of clinical judgment for the primary care 
clinician as to whether intervention by a consultant is needed and when. The Secretary of 
State is not involved in such clinical judgments. It should be noted that, again, this point 
was not pleaded as an independent ground to render detention unlawful. Nor did it have 
permission. In my view, it does not amount to an arguable public law breach.  
 

 (v)  ‘Failure to conduct a Rule 34 examination’  
241.  Fifth,  Mr  Bowen  QC  and  Ms  Knorr  argue  that  the  failure  to  conduct  a  Rule  34 
examination renders the detention unlawful.  I have set out my conclusions on this point 
above, namely, that (i) there was a failure to carry out a Rule 34 examination within 24 
hours of the Claimant’s admission to Harmondsworth IRC on 21 December 2010 which 
rendered the detention unlawful (until 1 February 2011 when a Rule 34 examination was 
carried out at Colnbrook IRC); (ii) however, since no Rule 35 referral would have been 
made, the Claimant’s damages for this period would be nominal. 

 

 

(vi)    ‘Failure  thereafter  to  consider  the  Claimant’s  mental  illness,  or  obtain  further 
information’  
242.  Sixth, Mr Bowen QC and Ms Knorr argue that there was a failure thereafter to consider 
the  Claimant’s  mental 
from 
Harmondsworth  IRC,  at  the  monthly  detention  reviews  up  to,  and  including,  18  May 
2011. They point to the fact that the monthly reviews make no reference to consideration 
being given to the Claimant’s mental illness under Chapter 55.10 EIG or any requests for 
further  information  being  made.  They  also  suggest  that  UKBA  failed  to  pass  relevant 
information pertaining to the Claimant’s mental health to Harmondsworth (including GP 
records and delusional letters received from the Claimant). 

including  obtaining 

information 

illness, 

further 

243.  These  submissions  have  little  weight,  however,  in  the  light  of  the  regular  medical 
monitoring the Claimant was in fact receiving throughout his detention. It is clear from 
the medical records that, far from being ignored, the Claimant’s condition and reported 
symptoms were being regularly and appropriately monitored and treated. The Claimant 
was  given  GP  appointments  on  a  regular  monthly  or  bi-monthly  basis.  The  Claimant 
chose  to  attend  some  appointments  and  not  others.  He  was  prescribed  various  anti-
depressants.  His  condition  and  prescriptions  were  regularly  reviewed.  Symptoms 
association  with  depression  are  commonly  found  amongst  detainees.  His  condition  did

not present as particularly serious or difficult to treat. At all material times, his medical 
condition was in fact being properly managed in detention.   

244.  I am unimpressed by the Claimant’s point that no express reference was made to the 
Claimant’s  psychiatric  in  the  Claimant’s  monthly  detention  reviews.    There  was  no 
particular reason why the monthly detention reviews should have made special note of the 
Claimant’s  medical  condition  or  why  ‘further  information’  should  have  been  sought 
regarding the Claimant’s condition. There is no reason why specific mention should have 
been  made  of  the  Claimant’s  fairly  routine  medical  needs  that  were  being  adequately 
managed  on  a  monthly  basis  by  the  healthcare  team  and  which  were  not  otherwise 
remarkable or noteworthy. 

245.  In  my  view,  there  was  no  duty  on  the  Secretary  of  State  to  go  outside  the  existing 
regime  for  the  provision  of  confidential  medical  information.  If  the  Claimant  or  his 
representatives  had  so  wished,  it  was  open  to  them  at  any  stage  to  ensure  that 
confidentiality  was  waived  and  arrangements  made  for  the  Claimant’s  past  medical 
records to be passed to the Secretary of State. It is instructive that they did not do so. 

246.  In any event, I do not accept that the disclosure of such confidential records at any stage 
would  have  made  any  difference  to  the  detention  decision.  The  diagnosis  of  psychotic 
illness was, at best, controversial and difficult. The Claimant’s medical notes recorded the 
Claimant  as  presenting  to  the  clinicians  whom  saw  him  regularly  as  well-kempt, 
orientated in place and time and able to function normally on a normal location. At no 
stage  was  he  in  the  hospital  wing  or  placed  on  open  ACDT  (Assessment  Care  in 
Detention and Teamwork). This is in contrast to detainees in cases such as HA (Nigeria)) 
v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWHC 979 (Admin) (who refused 
to wash for months, slept on a mattress in the toilet and was drinking out of the toilet 
bowl).  

 

FTT 
247.  The Claimant relies upon a diagnosis of schizophrenia by Dr. Robinson and Dr. Basu, 
whose  views  were  accepted  by  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  (“FTT”)  when  allowing  the 
Claimant’s appeal against deportation on Article 3 grounds on 25 June 2013. The FTT 
Decision dated 25 June 2012, however, merely recites Dr Basu and Dr Robinson’s reports 
without  containing  any  analysis  of  the  medical  background  or  the  Claimant’s  medical 
records in detention.  Nor does  it appear that the FTT had the benefit of any evidence 
from the responsible physicians or Dr Burrun. The finding of the FTT was in fact limited, 
viz. “the medical evidence demonstrates that the appellant suffers from delusions” (see 
paragraph 15 of the Reasons). It is not, therefore, a finding which take the Claimant very 
far.  In any event, I am not bound by the findings of the FTT which I decline to adopt. 

 

 

Detention in any event 
248.  Even  if  I  am  wrong  as  to  the  above,  it  is  clear  that  the  Claimant  would  have  been 
detained in any event.  I accept the evidence of the Executive Criminal Casework officer, 
Annette Doughlin, who stated as follows:  

“In  this  instance  there  was  no  evidence  upon  which  I  could 
have concluded that the Claimant was suffering from a serious
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

mental illness that could not be managed satisfactorily at HMP 
Bellwood or an IRC. Furthermore, on submitting the IS91RA 
(Risk Assessment Form), to the prison and requesting that all 
adjudications  be  listed,  I  was  aware  that  any  serious  medical 
issues  that  could  not  be  managed  by  immigration  detention 
would  have  been  relayed  back  to  the  Home  Office  to  take 
further  action  in  terms  of  assessing  the  Claimant’s  suitability 
for continued detention.  I have reconsidered the position when 
making this statement and I confirm that even in the light of all 
the information now relied on with hindsight, the exclusionary 
policy in Chapter 55.10 would not have been applied without 
substantiating evidence available to me.”  

249.  In  my  view,  contrary  to  the  Claimant’s  interpretation,  Ms  Doughlin  is  quite  clearly 
stating that she still would have recommended the detaining of the Claimant even in the 
light of the information now available (which includes the reports of the examinations by 
Dr  Robinson  and  Dr  Basu);  and  she  would  not  have  recommended  he  be  released 
(excluded from detention) without appropriate evidence to substantiate her triggering the 
exclusionary policy under 55.10 EIG. 

250.  In any event, I am satisfied that the decision to continue to detain the Claimant cannot 
be said to be irrational or unreasonable, even in the light of Dr Robinson and Dr Basu’s 
reports  of  their  examinations.  As  Dr  Burrun  points  out,  diagnosis  of  these  sorts  of 
conditions  by  doctors  can  legitimately  vary.    Furthermore,  even  if  the  Claimant  was 
suffering from a psychotic condition as Dr Robinson and Dr Basu suggest, I am satisfied 
that the Claimant’s condition could be satisfactorily be managed in detention. Proof in the 
pudding is that the Claimant’s condition was satisfactorily managed in detention. This is 
clear from the contemporaneous records themselves. There are no reports of the Claimant 
at any stage suffering from any serious problems or seriously deteriorating mentally.   

251.  Furthermore, as Beatson LJ pointed out in Das (supra at [67]), cases such as R(OM) v. 
SSHD  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  909  show  that  some  of  those  suffering  significant  adverse 
effects  from  mental  illness  may  be  managed  appropriately  in  detention.    OM  had 
attempted suicide by hanging and was diagnosed as having recurrent depressive disorder 
and emotionally unstable personality disorder. The view of the experts were divided but 
Richards LJ stated that the balance of expert advice was that her illness could be managed 
appropriately in detention. 

 
Dr Burrun’s evidence 
 252.  The  Secretary  of  State  has  produced  evidence  from  Dr.  Burrun,  the  psychiatrist  who 
examined the Claimant while in detention on 20 August 2010.  In his report for the Court 
dated  14  March  2014,  Dr  Burrun  summarised  the  findings  of  his  examination  of  the 
Claimant on 20 August 2010. It is worth citing Dr  Burrun’s conclusions in full: 

 “Opinon 

Mr K has been diagnosed to be suffering from Depression since 2008 following a 
break up of a relationship for which he was receiving treatment in the community.  
He gives no past history of any intervention by Secondary Mental Health services 
nor has he had any past Psychiatric Admission.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

During his detention at Harmondsworth IRC Mr K was seen by the Psychiatric 
Nurse  and  he  was  also  regularly  seen  in  the  GP  clinic  when  the  dose  of  his 
antidepressant medication Tablet Citalopram was gradually increased from 10 mg 
daily to 40 mg daily.  He was reported restarting on Tablet Olanzapine 5 mg daily 
in April 2011 which was subsequently increased to 10 mg daily. 

Mr  K  presentation  has  been  inconsistent  as  although  at  times  he  has  been 
reporting to hear the voice of his late father, objectively he has not been observed 
to  be  responding  to  any  kind  of  internal  stimuli.  He  has  been  reported  to  be 
interacting  well  with  officers  on  the  wing  and  observed  to  be  socialising 
appropriately with other detainees at all times. 

It  is  my  opinion  that  Mr  K  treatment  for  his  depression  has  been  appropriately 
managed  within  the  health  care  setting  of  Harmondsworth  IRC.  Transfer  to 
hospital under Section 48/49 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (amended 2007) was 
not necessary. 

I  have  considered  the  diagnosis  given  in  the  reports  commissioned  by  Mr  K 
represetatives. I do not concur with the conclusions of the reports to the effect that 
any potential condition of Paranoid Schizophrenia was not managed satisfactorily 
in detention. Paranoid Schizophrenia is not an uncommon condition, in particular 
amongst  the  prison  population.  It  is  a  mental  disorder  that  is  managed 
satisfactorily regularly across prisons and in detention centres. I have considerable 
professional  experience 
the  diagnosis  and  management  of  Paranoid 
Schizophrenia  including  in  the  detention  context.  The  facilities  available  in  a 
detention  context  are  sufficient  to  manage  the  condition  though  they  may  not 
include all the possible specialist therapies that would be available in Psychiatric 
hospitals. 

in 

In my opinion, his is the type of case where diagnosis may legitimately vary as it 
was, at best, a doubtful case given Mr K presentation on a day to day basis where 
he  was  observed  to  be  interacting  appropriately  in  normal  location  with  other 
detainees and officers. Mr K was also observed to be attending to all his activities 
of daily living appropriately. 

As  the  medical  notes  (including  medical  notes  from  HMP  Bullwood  Hall) 
indicate,  Mr  K  was  treated  for  Depression  with  possible  Psychotic  Symptoms 
(NOT FOR PSYCHOTIC DISORDER) as there were many indicators consistent 
with this diagnosis rather than Paranoid Schizophrenia.  Mr K was treated with the 
appropriate  medication  and  his  mental  state  regularly  reviewed  and  monitored 
during  his  stay  in  detention.  Throughout  his  period  of  detention,  Mr  K  denied 
experiencing any suicidal intent or any plans of ending his life including when he 
was  seen  by  me.  Mr  K  was  not  a  native  English  speaker  and  so  sometimes 
expressed  himself  in  an  idiosyncratic  way  but  I  do  not  consider  that  his 
presentation  was  ever  genuinely  bizarre,  disorientated  or  distracted  during  our 
interactions.  There  was  no  reported  attempts  at  self-harm  whilst  he  was  in 
detention or any conduct of concern that would trigger an ACDT. Whilst it is right 
that  Mr  K  reported  hearing  his  late  father’s  voice  this  seems  to  have  occurred 
mostly  while  he  was  falling  asleep  at  night  which  indicates  that  they  are  more 
likely  to  be  pseudo  hallucinations  or  hypnogogic  hallucinations  rather  than 
psychotic  in  nature.  There  were  no  objective  evidence  [sic]  that  Mr  K  was
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

observed to be responding to any kind of internal stimuli or the voices telling him 
to harm himself or others. 

Mr  K  did  not  present  as  having  any  greater  level  of  anxiety  due  to  situational 
stress than is normal for a person[] whose immigration status is uncertain. There 
was no evidence that detention in itself was causing or materially worsening any 
mental  illness  either  from  a  fair  reading  of  the  contemporaneous  objective 
evidence or based on my interaction with Mr K.” 

 

253.  I accept these views and conclusions of Dr Burrun. 

254.  I accept his evidence that the Claimant was not suffering from a psychotic condition 
and,  in  any  event,  his  condition  was  in  fact  managed  adequately  in  detention.  The 
Secretary  of  State  was  entitled  to  rely  on  the  professional  expertise  of  responsible 
healthcare experts who were responsible for the Claimant’s care at the time. 

255.  As  stated  above,  I  reject  the  Claimant’s  criticisms  of  Dr  Burrun’s  evidence  and  his 
assessment of the Claimant on 20 August 2011. The fact that it was a short examination 
does not in any way undermine his conclusions. Dr Burrun is a very well qualified and 
experienced  Consultant  Psychiatrist  with  particular  experience  in  locked  rehabilitation 
centres,  prisons  and  IRCs.  I  am  satisfied  that  Dr  Burrun  had  Dr  Robinson’s  report 
available to him when he conducted his examination of the Claimant. In any event, Dr 
Robinson’s  intervention  and  views  were  recorded  on  the  patient  notes,  so  Dr  Burrun 
would have been aware of them. 

256.  I  reject  the  Claimant’s  disingenuous  attack  on  Dr  Burrun’s  assessment  as  being 
‘arguably  negligent’  whilst  acknowledging  that  the  court  could  not  make  any  specific 
findings  of  negligence  without  hearing  from  Dr.  Burrun.  The  Claimant’s  attack  on  Dr 
Burrun is, in any event, misconceived. Dr Burrun’s examination of the Claimant on 20 
August  2011  was  not  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  a  full  psychiatric  report  on  this 
detainee,  let  alone  a  report  for  litigation.    It  was  merely  an  appointment  for  a  routine 
examination of a patient about whom some mental health concerns had been raised. He 
conducted a perfectly proper examination which he recorded in the patient’s notes.  He 
was not required to write a full report on the patient but merely make a diagnosis and 
satisfy  himself  as  the  condition  of  the  patient  in  detention.    Nor  was  he  required  to 
‘engage  with  the  reasoning’  of  Dr  Robinson  (or  Dr  Basu)  in  his  notes  or  his  later 
statement for the court.  He was one of the responsible clinicians at the IRC at the time 
who examined the Claimant and was merely required to explain to the Court what steps 
he and the IRC healthcare team took with regard to the Claimant and why. This he has 
done perfectly clearly and I accept his evidence. 

257.  The  Claimant’s  approach  is  also  predicated  on  a  misapprehension:  that  ‘satisfactory 
management’  of  a  detainee’s  condition  necessarily  involves  facilitating  recovery  not 
merely preventing deterioration.  In so far as it is necessary to do so, I respectfully adopt 
the same view as that expressed by Beatson LJ in Das at [71] on this point when rejecting 
a submission by MIND, namely, that it was doubtful that the framers of Chapter 55.10 
EIG  meant  that  a  detainee’s  mental  illness  could  not  be  satisfactorily  managed  in 
detention  unless  specific  treatment,  such  as  counselling,  which  could  improve  the 
detainee’s condition was made available in detention.

R (K) v SSHD 

 

 

 

Admissibility of Dr Basu’s third report 
258.  I have been asked to rule on the admissibility of a third report by Dr Basu dated 21 May 
2014, which the Claimant served on 30 May 2012, only two weeks before the hearing. 
The Claimant contended that Dr Basu’s third report should be admitted out of time under 
CPR 54.16 because Dr Burrun was not called to give evidence and the Claimant did not 
apply  to  cross-examine  him,  but  instead  took  the  ‘proportionate’  step  of  serving  a 
supplementary report by Dr Basu responding to Dr Burrun’s statement of 14 March 2014 
(which itself was served late two weeks late on 24 March 2014).  Ms Anderson objected 
to its admissibility.   

259.  I  reject  the  Claimant’s  application  to  adduce  the  third  report  by  Dr  Basu  on  both 

procedural and substantive grounds.  

260.  As  to  procedural  grounds:  Dr  Basu’s  third  report  was  served  outwith  the  Order  for 
directions made on 30 October 2014. That Order only granted the Claimant permission to 
adduce an Addendum to Dr Basu’s existing report dated 19 October 2011 (following his 
examination of the Claimant on 5 October 2011). It did not give the Claimant permission 
to  serve  any  further  report  by  Dr  Basu,  nor  was  a  further  report  contemplated  or 
envisaged.  This  was  unsurprising  in  the  context  of  judicial  review  which  does  not 
encourage  ex  post  facto  expert  disputes  in  a  case  of  this  sort.    The  Order  gave  the 
Secretary of State permission to adduce any further evidence by 3 March 2014 and for the 
Claimant to make any application to cross-examine any witness who had filed evidence 
on behalf of the Secretary of State by 21 March 2014. The Order also was set the matter 
down for trial on 18 and 19 June 2014.  I do not accept that it appropriate for the Claimant 
to  choose  to  serve  a  supplementary  report  from  Dr  Basu  under  the  guise  of  a 
‘proportionate’  alternative  to seeking  to  cross-examine  Dr  Burrun.  It  was  disingenuous 
for  the  Claimant’s  advisors  to  suggest  surprise  that  Dr  Burrun  was  not  called  to  give 
evidence. As Ms Anderson pointed out, no competent practitioner in the field of judicial 
review could have envisaged that a live witness would be called to give evidence absent 
an  application  by  the  other  side  to  cross-examine.  It  is  equally  disingenuous  for  the 
Claimant  to  express  surprise  that  Dr  Burrun’s  witness  statement  would  reflect  his  own 
medical  assessment  of  the  Claimant  and  not  agree  with  Dr  Robinson  and  Dr  Basu’s 
assessments.    In  any  event,  I  do  not  accept  that  it  was  appropriate  for  the  Claimant  to 
delay a further two months to serve Dr Basu’s further report, which was then served just 
two weeks before the trial. This was prejudicial to the other side who were given no time 
to respond.   

261.  As to substantive grounds: it seems to me, on reading Dr Basu’s third report de bene 
esse,  that  it  is  inappropriate  and  unsatisfactory  for  similar  reasons  to  those  I  have 
articulated in relation to his first and second reports (see above).  His third report is not 
properly  directed  to  the  public  law  questions  arising  from  55.10  EIG  but  seeks 
inferentially  to  attack  the  responsible  healthcare  team  and  Dr  Burrun’s  diagnosis  and 
treatment of the Claimant and criticises the facilities at the Harmondsworth IRC on the 
basis of HM Inspector of Prison’s Reports in 2010. 

262.  For these reasons, I refuse the Claimant’s application to admit the third report of Dr 

Basu.

Stage 2 

Would the Claimant have been detained in any event? 

information 

to 

263.  The Claimant appeared to contend for four public law errors: (i) First, errors on a basis 
of  the  Claimant’s  Tameside  test,  in  particular  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to  obtain 
further 
the  GP  note  showing  a  past  history  of 
depression/IS91RA  note.  (ii)  Second,  the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to  pass  on  the 
information in the IS91RA to healthcare. (iii) Third, alleged medical negligence by the 
primary care clinician for not referring the Claimant immediately to the NHS Consultant 
on entry to the IRC.  (iv) Fourth, failure to comply with Rule 34. 

in  response 

264.  In my judgment, as explained above, only one public law error is made out: the failure 
the  comply  with  Rule  34.  However,  as  set  out  above,  a  Rule  34  examination  was 
conducted on 1 February 2011 and no Rule 35 referral was made. It is clear, therefore, 
that the Claimant would have been detained in any event (see above). Accordingly, the 
breach of Rule 34 was non-causative and sounds only in nominal damages.   

265.  I  should  make  it  clear  that,  in  my  judgment,  the  first  three  alleged  public  law  errors 
would not pass the ‘but for’ Lumba test either (assuming, ex hypothesi, these were public 
law errors at all).  It is quite clear, in my view, that the Secretary of State would have 
detained the Claimant in any event, and could lawfully have done so. This is clear from 
the contemporaneous and witness evidence which show that the responsible clinicians did 
not consider that the Claimant was suffering from a serious mental illness that could not 
be managed satisfactorily in detention. This is an opinion which Dr Burrun still holds, 
notwithstanding the Claimant’s materials. Further, it was lawfully open to the Secretary 
of State to detain under the section 36(1) power and then s 36(2) absent the alleged public 
law  errors.  It  would  not  have  been  irrational  or  unreasonable  to  have  done  so  on  the 
evidence then available. 

 
 
Were there exceptional circumstances justifying detention in any event? 

266.  In  view  of  my  finding  that  the  Claimant’s  detention  was  not  unlawful,  it  is  not 
necessary  to  determine  the  second  question,  namely,  were  exceptional  circumstances 
justifying detention in any event?  However, I turn deal with this issue briefly since it was 
argued.  

267.  I  direct  myself  that  where  the  policy  Chapter  55.10  does  apply,  the  ‘exceptional 
circumstances’ test is a high hurdle to overcome to justify detention (per Beatson LJ in 
Das at [68]).   

268.  In my judgment, the Secretary of State would be able to satisfy the test in this case. 
First, the Claimant was a Foreign National Offender (“FNO”) with a history of offending 
and  was,  therefore,  accordingly  some  way  across  the  ‘spectrum  approach’  in  Anam  v 
Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 1140 when weighing the 
public interest against the individual interest in avoiding any suffering (albeit his index 
offence  was  a  less  serious  offence  with  the  guidance  in  Chapter  55.3A  EIG).  The 
Claimant’s point (again raised after the hearing) that the Court should place weight on the 
fact  that  the  Claimant  was  not  recommended  for  deportation  by  the  criminal  court  is 
misconceived.  The  Automatic  Deportation  regime  simply  removes  the  Secretary  of
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

R (K) v SSHD 

State’s  discretion  to  determine  whether  deportation  is  ‘conducive  to  the  public  good’. 
Accordingly, deportation recommendations are not sought in FNO automatic deportation 
cases (though occasionally the courts still make them of their own motion despite being 
of no effect since the FNO must be deported if it is lawful to do so). Second, in my view, 
the  Claimant  represented  a  clear  risk  of  absconding  since  he  had  absconded  before  in 
2007  (notwithstanding  that  Chapter  55.1.3  EIG  recognises  that  a  person  who  has  an 
appeal pending may be more like to comply with conditions if released). Third, the effects 
of continuing detention on the Claimant were not such as to lead to significant suffering 
(over and above the inherent ordinary adverse effect of any detention on most individuals 
as recognised in the Article 3 ECHR jurisprudence). 

 

 

‘Second period’ of detention: 19 May 2011 to 21 October 2011 
269.  In view of my findings regarding the first period of detention, I can see no basis on 
which  the  Claimant  can  succeed  in  relation  to  (what  is  called)  the  ‘second  period’  of 
detention. It is not alleged that, e.g., the Claimant’s condition suddenly deteriorated in the 
second  period  to  a  state  where  it  could  not  be  satisfactorily  managed  in  detention  and 
ergo the Claimant should have then been released. The thrust of the Claimant’s case has 
been that the Claimant was suffering ab initio from a mental condition which could not be 
satisfactorily managed in detention. I have rejected that case for the reasons set out above. 
The same reasons apply mutatis mutandis to the second period. 

270.  Nevertheless, I turn to consider seriatim the further grounds argued by the Claimant in 

relation to the second period in case there is some differentiation.   

 

(i) 

Tameside  

271.  The Claimant’s contends that the Secretary of State came under a ‘fresh’ Tameside duty 
once she was informed of the First Tier Tribunal’s concerns regarding the the Claimant’s 
possibly  delusional  behaviour  at  the  asylum  appeal  on  17  May  2011  and  a  public  law 
error is disclosed because the Secretary of State should have proceeded to obtain a mental 
health assessment (as requested by the UKBA in a fax to Harmondsworth dated 19 May 
2011).  I  disagree.  In  my  judgment,  the  information  that  the  Claimant  has  made 
extravagant claims at the immigration hearing was not such as to materially change the 
picture  about  this  detainee.    Nor  does  it  give  rise  to  a  public  law  error  bearing  on 
detention.    In  any  event,  the  response  of  Harmondsworth  IRC  to  this  information  was 
timely,  proportionate  and  reasonable:  the  Claimant’s  medical  file  was  reviewed  by  the 
Health Care Manager at Harmondsworth IRC who responded to UKBA on 20 May 2011 
that the Claimant has been seen by a GP and was stable on medication.  

(ii) ‘Inaccurate’ fax of 20 May 2011 

272.  The Claimant contends that the Health Care Manager at Harmondsworth IRC’s fax of 
20 May 2011 was ‘inaccurate’ since the Claimant had not been seen by a GP since the 
UKBA’s request was made and it was not true to say that the Claimant was ‘stable on 
medication’. The Claimant does not, however, condescend to explain how this gives rise 
to a public law error, let alone one which bears on detention.  In my judgment, it does not.  
In any event, the fax of 20 May 2011 was not self-evidently inaccurate on the information 
available at the time (or now): the Claimant had been seen by a GP no less than three
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

times in the past five weeks (on 14 and 28 April and 4 May) and the Claimant had been 
re-started on a course of Olanzapine.  Further, the point was not pleaded and, given the 
passage of time, it is not necessary, possible, proportionate or fair to expect the Secretary 
of State to respond to factual allegations of this sort of granularity. 

(iii) ‘Failures to pass on information to Harmondsworth IRC’ 

273.  The Claimant’s next point is put in the following somewhat convoluted fashion: Can 
the  Secretary  of  State  rely  on  that  letter  for  the  failure  to  insist  upon  a  mental  health 
assessment until after 11 August 2011, having regard to the fact that the Secretary of State 
did  not  pass  information  to  Harmondsworth  IRC  concerning  (a)  the  evidence  she  had 
from the Claimant’s GP; (b) the extravagant claims made by the Claimant in his response 
to  deportation  questionnaire  and  asylum  interview;  (c)  the  nature  of  the  extravagant 
claims  made  by  the  Claimant  at  his  asylum  appeal,  and  the  concerns  of  the  judge  and 
presenting officer that he was delusional; (d) the clearly paranoid  letters written by the 
Claimant to the Secretary of State on 12 April 2011? 

274.  It appears to be an attempt to aggregate what the Claimant claims are earlier failures by 
the Secretary of State with regard to failures to pass information Harmondsworth IRC in 
order to undermine the efficacy of the 20 May 2011 message.  In view of my findings 
above, this point has no substance.  In any event, I do not accept the underlying premise 
that  the  only  way  in  which  Harmondsworth  IRC  would  have  been  aware  of  the 
Claimant’s  complaints  that  his  problems  were  being  caused  by  a  ‘conspiracy’  of  the 
Home Office, police etc is through these channels.  It is clear that he raised this sort of 
point (which are not uncommon allegations by detainees) with the healthcare team and 
others.  Further, and in any event, I do not accept that the Secretary of State was entitled, 
let alone obliged, to disclose confidential information about the Claimant’s immigration 
and asylum claims. 

275.  The Claimant sought to raise a yet further point under this head as follows: Further or 
alternatively,  the  Secretary  of  State’s  decision  not  to  obtain  a  further  psychiatric 
assessment and report at this stage was based upon a material error of fact, which itself 
gives rise to a breach of public law: see e.g. R (Connolly) v Havering LBC [2010] 2 P. + 
C.R.  1,  Chapter  §32-37,  so  that  the  decision  to  detain  is  vitiated  on  the  grounds  of 
unfairness. This point was neither pleaded, nor given permission, and not raised until after 
the hearing. In the interests of fairness, finality and proportionality, I refuse to permit the 
argument to be run.  In any event, in view of my finding that there was no material error 
of fact regarding the Claimant’s condition, it would appear to be of no substance. 

(iii) ‘Failures to pass on information to Harmondsworth IRC was public law error’ 

276.  The Claimant next contends that, in any event, (i) the failure by Harmondsworth to pass 
relevant  information  concerning  the  Secretary  of  State’s  mental  condition  (which 
included two recent GP visits in which he had reported the return of the voices and had 
requested Olanzipine) was itself a breach of public law that bore on, and was relevant to, 
the detention that vitiated the lawfulness of the detention; and (ii) Harmondworth IRC’s 
knowledge is to be imputed to the Secretary of State. 

277.   In view of my findings above, there is no substance in this point. I do not accept that 
the  message  of  20  May  2011  was  misleading.  I  do  not  accept  that  there  were  relevant 
failures to pass on any material information about the Claimant’s condition, or that these

R (K) v SSHD 

 

could be classed as public law errors. In any event, I do not accept that any alleged public 
law error by the responsible clinicians may be imputed to the Secretary of State. Rule 35 
only  requires  the  Secretary  of  State  to  be  informed  of  any  mental  condition  that 
contraindicates  detention.  It  does  not  require  the  disclosure  of  confidential  medical 
information about what a patient said to the clinicians as the Claimant suggests.  

‘Delay’ 

 
(v) 
 
278.  The  Claimant  contends  that  a  delay  of  five  months  in  obtaining  a  psychiatric 
assessment of the Claimant was so unreasonable as to breach Tameside. I do not accept 
that  there  was  an  unreasonable  delay  in  obtaining  a  psychiatric  assessment  of  the 
Claimant. It is clear from Dr Burrun’s evidence that the Claimant’s psychiatric condition 
was being regularly and properly monitored and assessed (see above).  I do not accept 
that  it  is  an  alleged  failure  to  conduct  an  assessment  by  a  primary  care  clinicians  may 
properly be imputed to the Secretary of State. As set out above, the Secretary of State was 
entitled to rely on the professional judgment of the responsible clinicians as to what the 
Claimant’s  medical  needs  were  and  whether  they  could  satisfactorily  be  managed  in 
detention and on the proper operation of Rule 35 (c.f. Das in the Court of Appeal at [70]). 

 

Stage 2 questions 
 
279.  The Claimant has not demonstrated either a public law error giving rise to the quashing 
of  the  decisions  to  detain  in  the  Second  period,  or  that  Chapter  55.10  applies. 
Accordingly, the Stage 2 questions do not arise.  However, in so far as necessary, I repeat 
mutatis mutandis the points made under the Stage 2 hearing in relation to the First Period 
(see above). 

 

Further late evidence 
280.  I reject the Claimant’s further application to admit yet further late evidence in the form 
of  a  statement  from  the  Claimant’s  solicitor  exhibiting  an  article  from  the  Guardian 
newspaper criticising Harmondsworth IRC’s record keeping in another case. This sort of 
evidence is irrelevant and unhelpful. 

 

Ground 2: claims under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) 

 

Article 5 
281.  The Claimant further claims under the ECHR are of no substance. 

282.  The  Claimant  sought  in  post-hearing  written  submissions  to  maintain  a  claim  for  a 
declaration  under  Article  5  ECHR.  This  was  surprising.  The  Claimant  expressly 
disavowed  Article  5  ECHR  at  the  permission  hearing  and  cannot  properly  raise  it 
again. The Claimant’s submissions on Article 5 were not pleaded or raised in opening, 
but referred to for the first time in the Claimant’s Note of 25 June 2014.  In any event, 
they add nothing to the case.
--------

R (K) v SSHD 

 

Article 3  
283.  The Claimant maintains the Secretary of State was in breach of the Claimant’s Article 3 
ECHR rights. The Strasbourg case law makes it clear that the refusal to release a detainee 
suffering from a naturally occurring mental or physical illness is not a breach of Article 3 
or 8 ECHR. The heavy burden of proof on the Claimant under relation to Article 3 to 
establish a breach ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ has not be met in this case. There was no 
evidence e.g. of systemic risk or intense suffering. 

 

Article 8  
284.  The  Claimant  maintains  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  in  breach  of  the  Claimant’s 
Article  8  ECHR  rights.  Article  8  ECHR  rights  are,  however,  qualified.  The  obligation 
under  the  ECHR  is  to  establish  and  maintain  a  proper  system  of  law  and  practice  to 
provide healthcare to detainees.  It is not a counsel of perfection. There is no basis upon 
which the Claimant can maintain a breach of such obligations. 

 
CONCLUSION 
 
285.  For the reasons set out above, the Claimant’s claim for damages for wrongful detention 

is refused on all grounds and the claim dismissed. 

 
Postcript 
286.  The manner in which the Claimant’s case has been argued has been unsatisfactory and 

costly. The Secretary of State has had to respond to an endless litany of points taken 
under the guise of public law errors, many neither pleaded nor properly raised, or raised 
well out of time. The Claimant’s approach has been out of all proportion to what is at 
stake. I trust it will not be emulated in future cases. Both sides have been being funded by 
the public purse.",2014-10-21 00:00:00,UK High Court

Guardian News and Media Ltd - v - AB and CD 

 
 

 

LORD JUSTICE GROSS:  

INTRODUCTION 

Today, we give our Decision on the recent appeal of the media, accompanied 
by a brief overview.  This is not our Judgment; our Judgments (plural, as will 
be explained presently) have been reserved and will be given in due course.     

The Rule of Law is a priceless asset of our country and a foundation of our 
Constitution.    One  aspect  of  the  Rule  of  Law  –  both  a  hallmark  and  a 
safeguard - is open justice, which includes criminal trials being held in public 
and  the  publication  of  the  names  of  defendants.    Open  justice  is  both  a 
fundamental  principle  of  the  common  law  and  a  means  of  ensuring  public 
confidence in our legal system; exceptions are rare and must be justified on 
the facts.  Any such exceptions must be necessary and proportionate.  No more 
than the minimum departure from open justice will be countenanced.   

These principles as to open justice were essentially not in dispute before us.  
However, it was also common ground that there are exceptions.  For example, 
as rightly accepted by Mr. Hudson (for the media), the Court has a common 
law power to hear a trial (or part of a trial) in private (“in camera”). The Court 
does not require a party to destroy the right it is seeking to assert or protect as 
the  price  of  its  vindication.    We  detect  no  difference  of  substance  in  this 
connection between the common law and Art. 6 of the European Convention 
of Human Rights (“ECHR”).     

National  security  is  itself  a  national  interest  of  the  first  importance  and  the 
raison d’ etre of the Security and Intelligence Agencies (“the Agencies”), who 
themselves operate within a framework of law and oversight. For the Agencies 
to operate effectively, at least much of their work is secret and must remain so 
as a matter of necessity. From time to time, tensions between the principle of 
open justice and the needs of national security will be inevitable.   

As  is  well-established  in  our  law,  these  tensions  are  resolved  along  the 
following lines: 

i) 

ii) 

Considerations  of  national  security  will  not  by  themselves  justify  a 
departure from the principle of open justice. 

Open  justice  must,  however,  give  way  to  the  yet  more  fundamental 
principle  that  the  paramount  object  of  the  Court  is  to  do  justice; 
accordingly, where there is a serious possibility that an insistence on 
open  justice  in  the  national  security  context  would  frustrate  the 
administration  of  justice,  for  example,  by  deterring  the  Crown  from 
prosecuting a case where it otherwise should do so, a departure from 
open justice may be justified.

Guardian News and Media Ltd - v - AB and CD 

iii) 

The  question  of  whether  to  give  effect  to  a  Ministerial  Certificate 
(asserting, for instance, the need for privacy) such as those relied upon 
by  the  Crown  here  is  ultimately  for  the  Court,  not  a  Minister.  
However,  in  the  field  of  national  security,  a  Court  will  not  lightly 
depart from the assessment made by a Minister. 

PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

6. 

The Defendants, for the moment AB and CD, face the following charges: 

i) 

ii) 

AB  is  charged  with  an  offence  contrary  to  s.  5,  Terrorism  Act  2006 
(“TA  2006”,  preparation  of  terrorist  acts)  and  an  offence  contrary  to 
s.58, Terrorism Act 2000 (“TA 2000”, collection of information). 

CD is charged with an offence contrary to s.58 TA 2000 (collection of 
information)  and  an  offence  contrary  to  s.4,  Identity  Documents  Act 
2010  (“IDA  2010”,  possession  of  false  identity  documents  etc  with 
improper intention).  

7. 

By order dated 19th May, 2014 (“the order”), Nicol J ruled: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

The entirety of the criminal trial of the Defendants should be in private 
(i.e., with the public and media excluded) and the publication of reports 
of the trial be prohibited.   

The  names  and  identities  of  the  Defendants  should  be  withheld  from 
the public and publication of their names/identities in connection with 
the proceedings be prohibited. 

The  publication  of  reports  of  the  hearing  in  open  court  on  19th  May, 
2014  and  the  open  judgment  handed  down  on  that  day  be  postponed 
until the conclusion of the trial or further order. 

The order was made by Nicol J pursuant to his common law powers, together 
with  those  contained  in  s.11  and  s.4(2)  of  the  Contempt  of  Court  Act  1981 
(“the CCA 1981”). 

Pursuant to s.159, Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the CJA 1988”), the Applicants 
(for  convenience,  “the  media”)  sought  leave  to  appeal  from  the  order  and 
contended that it be set aside.  We treated the hearing as if it were the hearing 
of the substantive appeal and formally give leave.  We make it plain that we 
have not treated the hearing as a review of the decision of Nicol J but have 
instead come to an independent conclusion on the material placed before us. 

The matter is urgent as the criminal trial is due to commence on Monday 16th 
June at the Central Criminal Court.  Accordingly, in the course of the hearing 
before  us  on  the  4th  June,  we  indicated  that  we  would  give  our  Decision  as 
soon as possible, with fully reasoned Judgments to follow in due course.  The 
present document contains our Decision.   

8. 

9. 

10. 

So  far  as  concerns  the  procedure  followed,  Nicol  J  was  dealing  with  an 
application by the Crown that the trial should be held in private in its entirety 

 

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down 
(subject to editorial corrections) 

 

Guardian News and Media Ltd - v - AB and CD 

and that the Defendants should be anonymous. That application was supported 
by Certificates (“the Certificates”), setting out the reasons relied on in support, 
signed by the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“SSHD”) and the 
Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Affairs  (“SSFCA”).  
Further  material  was  provided  in  Schedules  to  the  Certificates  (“the 
Schedules”).    The  Certificates  but  not  the  Schedules  were  provided  to  the  
Defendants and their legal representative and to the legal representatives of the  
media, on terms as to confidentiality. 

11. 

The Judge heard part of the application in open court.  He then heard part of 
the application in private, i.e., in the presence of the Defendants, their legal 
representatives and the media’s legal representatives.  All had access to secret 
material  relied  upon  in  support  of  the  application.    Finally,  the  Judge 
considered further material in the absence of all except the Prosecution (“the 
ex parte hearing”).   

12.  We followed the same course – i.e., part of the hearing in open Court, part of 
the hearing in private and part (a very small part) ex parte.  With regard to the 
last-mentioned  (ex  parte)  part  of  the  hearing,  we  rejected  an  argument 
advanced  by  Mr.  Hudson  that,  unlike  Nicol  J,  we  were  not  entitled  to  have 
regard to such material. When we come to produce our full Judgments, there 
will be an Open Judgment, a Private Judgment and an Ex Parte Judgment.     

THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES 

13.  We turn to our conclusions on the principal Issues, namely: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

Issue (I): Trial in camera; 

Issue (II):  Anonymisation of the Defendants; 

Issue (III):  S.4(2), CCA 1981. 

ISSUE (I): TRIAL IN CAMERA 

This  case  is  exceptional.  We  are  persuaded  on  the  evidence  before  us  that 
there  is  a  significant  risk  –  at  the  very  least,  a  serious  possibility  –  that  the 
administration of justice would be frustrated were the trial to be conducted in 
open Court; for what appears to be good reason on the material we have seen, 
the  Crown  might  be  deterred  from  continuing  with  the  prosecution.  We  are 
also of the clear view that in this case it is unreal to contemplate a split trial – 
with the core of the trial being split into open and in camera hearings.  In our 
judgment,  as  a  matter  of  necessity,  the  core  of  the  trial  must  be  heard  in 
camera.  Our reasons will be elaborated upon in our Judgments in due course.  

It is important to underline that a defendant’s rights are unchanged whether a 
criminal  trial  is  heard  in  open  court  or  in  camera  and  whether  or  not  the 
proceedings may be reported by the media. 

As already underlined, no departure from the principle of open justice must be 
greater than necessary. While we are driven to conclude that the core of the 

14.

16. 

 

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down 
(subject to editorial corrections) 

 

Guardian News and Media Ltd - v - AB and CD 

trial must be in camera, on the material before us, we are not persuaded that 
there  would  be  a  risk  to  the  administration  of  justice  were  the  following 
elements of the trial heard in open Court: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

v) 

vi) 

Swearing in of the jury. 

Reading the charges to the Jury. 

 At least a part of the Judge’s introductory remarks to the Jury. 

At least a part of the Prosecution opening. 

The verdicts. 

If any convictions result, sentencing (subject to any further argument 
before the trial Judge as to the need for a confidential annexe). 

Our Order should be drawn up accordingly. 

There is, we underline, no dispute that a transcript of the proceedings will be 
kept, save in respect of a certain (few) discrete matters, thus far dealt with ex 
parte.  

Further and importantly, we direct that the position as to publication is to be 
reviewed at the conclusion of the trial, thus permitting (if need be) a further 
application for leave to appeal under s.159, CJA 1988.  For the avoidance of 
doubt, as trials are dynamic processes, our order does not preclude a review by 
the Crown and the Judge in the course of the trial, in the event of a substantial 
change of circumstances.   

Still further, as we understand it, one issue canvassed before the Judge in open 
Court was whether a small number of “accredited journalists” might be invited 
to attend the bulk of the trial (subject to being excluded when a small number 
of matters are discussed in accordance with the Certificates and the Crown’s 
submissions),  on  terms  which  compelled  confidentiality  until  review  at  the 
conclusion of the trial and any further order.  Notably, this issue was raised in 
the Certificates and supported by the SSHD and SSFCA.   The Judge was not 
persuaded,  essentially  on  grounds  of  practicality.    We  respectfully  disagree.  
The arrangements can be agreed or can be dealt with in our Order, if need be, 
following  further  brief  argument.    Any  breach  would  obviously  carry  the 
likelihood  of  severe  sanctions  and,  as  has  been  observed  on  previous 
occasions, reliance must be placed on the responsibility of the media.  Further 
and in particular, any doubts with regard to policing are resolved by the fact 
that this is a proposal emanating from the SSHD and SSFCA and serving to 
minimise the extent of departure from the principle of open justice.  While the 
terms may need refinement, for the assistance of the parties we indicate the 
following: 

i) 

We  have  in  mind  a  small  number  of  accredited  journalists  (“the 
journalists”) – drawn from the media parties to these proceedings.

Guardian News and Media Ltd - v - AB and CD 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

Notes can be made (if the journalists so choose, given the availability 
of a transcript - see below) but cannot be taken away at the end of the 
day’s  or  session’s  proceedings;  they  will  be  securely  stored  until  the 
end of the trial. 

A transcript of the proceedings (excluding the discrete ex parte areas) 
will  be  available  for  review  at  the  conclusion  of  the  proceedings  in 
connection with any further consideration of publication. 

An order should be “tailor made” to deal with this unusual situation; 
we  were  not  persuaded  that  the  matter  could  be  encompassed  within 
any order made simply under s.4(2) or s.11, CCA 1981.  

ISSUE (II): ANONYMISATION OF THE DEFENDANTS 

20. 

This issue is to be approached on the footing that the core of the trial is to be 
conducted in camera, as set out above.  On this footing, we are not persuaded, 
on the material before us, that there is a risk to the administration of justice 
warranting anonymisation of the Defendants; nor do we think that, properly 
understood, the Crown’s material supported that outcome, provided the bulk 
of the trial was in camera. In this regard, we respectfully part company with 
the Judge and permit the Defendants to be named.  We shall expand on these 
reasons  in  the  Judgments  to  come.    For  completeness,  we  regard  the 
preservation  of  flexibility  until  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  as  an  inadequate 
foundation upon which to base this significant departure from the principle of 
open justice in the absence of a clear justification at this stage.      

21.  We add only this.  We express grave concern as to the cumulative effects of 
(1) holding a criminal trial in camera and (2) anonymising the defendants. We 
find  it  difficult  to  conceive  of  a  situation  where  both  departures  from  open 
justice  will  be  justified.    Suffice  to  say,  we  are  not  persuaded  of  any  such 
justification in the present case. 

ISSUE (III): S.4(2), CCA 1981 

The hearing before us: For the duration of the hearing before us, we “held the 
ring” by imposing an order until s.4(2), CCA 1981.  At the conclusion of the 
hearing,  we  indicated  that  the  order  would  not  be  continued  in  respect  of 
hearing in open Court before us on the 4th June.  We could not see any good 
reason to postpone publication of any open part of that hearing.  The effect of 
our order is that the ordinary reporting restrictions applying to appeals from 
preparatory  hearings  (strictly  so  called)  should  not  apply  to  the  extent  that 
anything said in the open hearing before us could be reported:  see, s.37(4), 
Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (“CPIA 1996”). 

The hearing before Nicol J on the 19th May: We are likewise not persuaded of 
the  justification  for  a  s.4(2)  order  in  respect  of  that  part  of  the  19th  May 
hearing before Nicol J which took place in open Court and the open judgment 
given  by  the  Judge  on  that  day.    That  said,  we  underline  that  the  hearing 
before  Nicol  J  was  a  preparatory  hearing  and  therefore  subject  to  reporting 
restrictions contained in s.37, CPIA 1996.  The media’s success in this regard 

22.

Guardian News and Media Ltd - v - AB and CD 

may therefore be limited, at least so far as it relates to the open proceedings 
before Nicol J.  However, our conclusion also means that the open judgment 
of  the  19th  May  given  by  the  Judge  is  no  longer  subject  to  any  s.4(2)  order 
because its material parts were referred to before us.   

OVERALL CONCLUSION 

24. 

Pulling the threads together: 

i) 

To the limited extent indicated above, we vary the order made by Nicol 
J for the trial to be in camera. 

ii)  We  allow  the  media’s  appeal  from  the  order  made  by  Nicol  J  for 

anonymisation of the Defendants. 

iii)  We allow the media’s appeal from the s.4(2), CCA 1981 order imposed 
by Nicol J in respect of that part of the 19th May hearing held in open 
Court, together with his open judgment of that date.",2014-06-12 10:02:32,UK Court of Appeal

SENTENCING REMARKS 

 
 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

 
4.	 

 

You have been convicted of, and I sentence you for, one offence of indecent 
assault. 

The assault took place on 16th January 1995.  The woman you assaulted was 22 
 
years old and 4' 11"" in height.  She worked on the Mrs Merton Show; it was her 
first  real  job  since  University.    You  were  in  your  late  40’s,  an  experienced 
presenter  and  DJ,  and  still  a  very  well  known  media  personality  not  only  as 
perceived by the public but also through your own eyes, and, at over 6' tall you 
towered over her. 

You saw her smoking in the dressing room corridor.  You went over to her and 
said “Oh X you shouldn’t be smoking, think about your poor little lungs.”  I 
 
have no doubt that you used this as an excuse to get close to her and to touch 
her.  You pinned her up against the wall and started to touch her rib cage and 
then slid your hands up over her breasts and her clothes, and started squeezing 
them.  You left your hands there for several seconds. 

 
She said it felt shocking.  She could not believe what was happening.  She told 
 
the court that she had done nothing to encourage your attention and suddenly 
there you were, touching her really hard in what she described as a squeezing 
grope as you stared intensely at her breasts. 

1

5.	 

 
6.	 

 
7.	 

She  said  that,  with  you  looming  over  her,  she  felt  scared  and  when  she  got 
away she was shaking and a bit beside herself.  She described her feeling of 
being violated.   

For years she did not talk about it.  Having thought at first that this was all part 
of showbiz, when she got into her 30’s she started to think that what you did 
was really out of order and she became angry.  It was after that she used it as a 
humorous anecdote in her shows, the humour arising from the way she reacted 
to what you did. 

In her victim impact statement she describes herself as a naïve and trusting 22 
year  old.  She  was  subjected  to  an  unprovoked  and  terrifying  assault  and 
considers  herself  lucky  to  be  psychologically  robust  enough  to  deal  with  the 
distress,  supported  by  family  and  friends.    Using  humour  has  been  for  her  a 
 
defence mechanism.  Giving evidence about these events has been painful for 
her. 

 

8.	  When you gave evidence you described what she was alleging took place as “a 
nasty thing to do”.  You are right in your assessment: it was a nasty thing to do 
 
but it was more than that.  It was an intentional and unpleasant sexual assault. 
You took advantage of a young woman in a vulnerable position whose job it 
was to look after you that day.   

 
9.	 

 
I judge that you believed she would not make a fuss about what you did to her. 
You were right about that, too.  She  made  no  complaint  until she heard you 
 
describe the witnesses in your previous trial as “liars”.  That encouraged her to 
come forward. 

 

  
10.	  You  have  been  convicted  of  indecent  assault  under  an  Act  passed  in  1956. 
The maximum sentence for these offences was set at two years imprisonment.

In  deciding  the  appropriate  sentence  I  have  taken  into  account  the  guidance 
 
provided  in  the  relevant  authorities  and  the  assistance  given  at  p.155  of  the 
latest  Definitive  Guidelines.  I  am  required  to  have  regard  to  the  sentencing 
guidelines as they now are for an equivalent offence under the Sexual Offences 
Act 2003. 

Following  those  guidelines,  which  came  into  effect  in  April  2014,  the 
prosecution accepts, rightly, that this offending falls into the lowest category, 
that  is  category  3(b),  with  a  recommended  starting  point  of  a  high  level 
community order and a category range from a medium level community order 
up  to  26  weeks  imprisonment.    It  follows  that  the  difference  in  maximum 
sentences  between  the  offence  you  were  convicted  of  and  its  present  day 
equivalent has no impact on my sentence. 

It has been urged upon me by your counsel that your offending does not pass 
the custody threshold and that I should impose a community order.  Mr Vullo 
QC was right to submit that, if I judge a community sentence to be unsuitable 
for a man of your age and background, then the law requires me to consider 
some lesser sentence, such as a conditional discharge.   

In my judgement the aggravating feature in this case is the disparity in your age 
 
and status compared to that of the victim which made her vulnerable to your 
advances and is not outweighed by the mitigating factors of having no previous 
convictions  and  being  of  good  character.    In  my  judgment  that  takes  your 
offending  above  the  recommended  starting  point  and  through  the  custody 
threshold.  

 

The prosecution submits that a further aggravating feature is the way in which 
it is suggested that you used the media to proclaim your innocence from the 
moment you were arrested.  They rely on paragraphs 66 to 70 of the judgment 
in  Attorney  General’s  Reference  No.  38  of  2013,  R.  v.  Stuart  Hall  [2013] 
EWCA Crim 1450 where the Court of Appeal decided that Hall’s descriptions 

3
--------
of  the  allegations  as  “…pernicious,  callous,  cruel  and,  above  all,  spurious” 
followed by a plea of guilty was a serious aggravating feature of his offending. 
 
In  my  judgment  that  has  only  a  very  limited  impact  in  your  case  where  you 
have been acquitted of 14 out of the 15 charges which have been put before 
two juries, and where the offence of which you have been convicted was not 
 
known  at  the  time  you  made  your  comments  to  the  media.    It  follows  that  I 
shall take no account of this issue when passing sentence. 

 

16.	  Whilst the commission of any indecent assault is serious and reprehensible, the 
scale and nature of the offences of which Stuart Hall and other defendants who 
 
have been successfully prosecuted under Operation Yew Tree and have been 
sentenced are of a different order of magnitude to the single offence of which 
you have been convicted. 

 
17.	 

The mitigating factors I take into account include that:- 

 

 
(a)	  You have no previous convictions.  In the course of two trials I have 
heard  from  a  great  number  of  character  witnesses  called  on  your 
behalf.  Their  descriptions  included  the  following:  a  kind  person 
always trying to help people, friendly, no airs and graces, generous, 
warm hearted and a good friend. 

 
(b)	 

 
(c)	 

 
(d)	 

 
I am to sentence you for a single offence of indecent assault and the 
Crown’s case that you had a propensity to commit indecent assaults 
has not been made out. 

The investigation and trials have taken over two years to complete 
and you have in no way contributed to that delay. 

They have had a toll on your health and, additionally, you are having 
to deal with other health issues within your family. 

 

4
--------
(e)	  Your conviction is is likely to effect your ability to gain employment 

 

in the future. 

 

18.	  Although  I  have  concluded  that  your  offending  passes  the  custody  threshold 
and that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for it, 
because of the mitigating factors that apply in your case, I have decided that I 
can suspend that sentence. 

 
19.	 

 
20.	 

Taking into account the seriousness of your offence and the mitigating factors 
 
in your case which I have set out, I sentence you to 3 months imprisonment. 

The sentence of 3 months will be suspended for 2 years. This is the operational 
period of the sentence and if in the next 2 years you commit any offence you 
will be brought back to court and you will be liable to serve the sentence.  

 
21.	 

 
The  surcharge  provisions  apply  to  this  case  and  the  order  will  be  drawn  up 
accordingly.

SENTENCING REMARKS
 
 

 

 

 

You have pleaded guilty to a number of offences. You have also been convicted by a jury of 
 
""attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming"". 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
   

On the 10th February 2014, you pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to ""Administering 
 
a poison or noxious substance"". I give you maximum credit for that early guilty plea. On 6th 
 
 
July 2010, you soaked a cloth with dry‐cleaning fluid and placed it over the face of Urlene 
 
King. She was a friend of yours and was visiting your home. Mercifully, she protested. She 
 
felt dizzy and you stopped what you were doing. I have read a victim personal statement 
 
from her and there is no doubt that she has suffered considerable trauma as a result of this 
 
incident. It has unsurprisingly had a very bad psychological effect upon her and the effects 
 
will be long term. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

On the 10th February 2014, you also pleaded guilty to 2 counts of making indecent images 
 
of children. These were pseudo‐images in the sense that they had been digitally altered. 
 
There were a total of nine images and included images of a naked female child, aged 
 
between 6 to 9 years, lying on the side of what appears to be a large serving dish with an 
 
 
apple in her mouth; a naked girl of between 11 to 13 years of age, wearing lace topped 
 
stockings; a naked female child aged between 12 and 15 years, standing in front of an oven 
 
 
with another naked female child of  four or five years of age inside the oven; a naked female 
 
child of between six and eight years of age, tied with a rope around her ankles, knees and 
 
pelvis, to a metal pole which is positioned over a barbecue, and other like images which 
 
have a cannibalistic theme. I give you maximum credit for pleading guilty at the earliest 
 
opportunity to these offences. These images are extremely sickening examples of indecent 
 
images of children. 
 

 
 
 

 
   

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Counts 1 to 7 on the first indictment represent offences of ""Publishing an Obscene Article"". 
 
They relate to 7 ""chat logs"" in which you were discussing over the Internet with a variety of 
 
different people and in the most extreme and explicit terms kidnap, sexual abuse, torture, 
 
murder and cannibalism of women and children. You discussed disabling a woman by the 
 
use of chloroform. This was an unhappy but clear echo of your behaviour towards, and 
 
 
treatment of, Urlene King. It is plain that you were obtaining sexual gratification from 
 
 
indulging in these discussions.
--------
You did not plead guilty to these charges at the first opportunity. Instead, it was argued on 
 
your behalf that these matters did not amount to the criminal charges alleged because the 
 
material under discussion was not obscene or that to prosecute you amounted to an abuse 
 
 
of the process of the court. The court rejected these arguments on 21st March 2014 
 
whereupon you pleaded guilty to these counts. I will therefore give you 20% credit for your 
 
 
guilty pleas. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

The jury convicted you of ""Attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming"". You were 
 
communicating with a person whom you believed to be a 14‐year‐old girl called Eva who 
 
was living in Germany. You believed from what she told you that she was vulnerable. You 
 
invited her to visit you in the UK. You made arrangements with her for you both to meet at 
 
 
Ashford International railway station. You discussed with her how you wanted to have 
 
sexual intercourse with her and how you would then kill her with an axe and eat her. On 
 
17th September 2012, you purchased an axe in Broadstairs and later photographed yourself 
 
holding the axe in your bedroom. On the day upon which you had arranged to meet Eva, 
 
you travelled to Ashford International Station but happily no one arrived. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

I have seen and heard you give evidence. You told the court that you had had fantasies 
 
 
about cannibalism since you were a child. You are now 58 years of age. You have been 
 
married, have had children and have been employed as a nurse. You demonstrated when 
 
 
giving evidence that you are an arrogant and manipulative man. You have shown no 
 
remorse and indeed cannot understand why anyone should find your behaviour in any way 
 
abnormal or perverted, let alone criminal. You lack any insight into your behaviour and fail 
 
to understand that right minded people will find your behaviour abhorrent, shocking, 
 
repulsive and dangerous, dangerous because, by talking about these activities, there is 
 
 
always the risk that your fantasies will tip over into actions. There was also the real danger 
 
that you would inflame or incite the people with whom you were discussing these activities 
 
 
to move from fantasy to action themselves. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
   
 

I have read the careful report prepared on you by Dr Joseph. Dr Joseph observes  and I 
 
   
conclude that the Urlene King incident and the “Eva” incident are examples where you 
 
crossed a threshold and began to act out your fantasies. There are here a unique series of 
 
 
offences. I have heard mitigation ably advanced on your behalf by Mr Jarvis. I follow the 
 
sentencing guidelines where they apply. For the substantive offence of ""Attempting to meet 
 
a child"", this is in my judgment a Category 1 offence. You exposed your victim to extreme 
 
 
sexual discussion, you believed that she was a particularly vulnerable child and you said that
--------
you wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. The indecent pseudo‐images are Category 
 
A images because they involve sadistic activity and bondage. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
   

   
 

All your behaviour was designed to indulge your perverted sexual fantasies and to obtain 
 
sexual gratification. I bear in mind that you are 58 years old and that you have no previous 
 
convictions. Having seen and heard you give evidence, I conclude that you do pose a risk to 
 
the public. Given the statutory constraints on my sentencing powers, I have had to consider 
 
very carefully how I can best protect the public from you. I have come to the conclusion that 
 
I can best do that by the imposition of a long, determinate sentence coupled with a Sexual 
 
 
Offences Prevention Order. The effect of the sentences that I'm about to impose upon you 
 
is that you will be on licence for a very long period. Should you breach the terms of your 
 
license, you can expect to be returned to custody in order to serve the balance of your 
 
sentence. 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   
 

On the second indictment, I remind myself that the statutory maximum sentence for the 
 
offence of ""Administering a noxious substance"" is one of five years imprisonment. I take as a 
 
 
starting point four and a half years imprisonment because I regard this as a very serious 
   
 
example of this type of offence. With maximum credit for your early plea of guilty, the 
 
 
sentence of the court is one of three years imprisonment. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On the first indictment Counts 1 to 7, offences of ""Publishing an Obscene Article"", I take as a 
 
 
starting point.30 months imprisonment. Giving you the 20% credit to which I have earlier 
 
referred, the sentence of the court for each one of these 7 offences is one of two years 
 
 
imprisonment, to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to the sentence for 
 
 
the offence of ‘Administering a noxious substance’. 
 

   
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

On Count eight, the offence of ""Attempting to meet a child"", I remind myself that this was 
 
an attempt and not the full offence. You were convicted after trial. The sentence of the 
 
court is one of three years imprisonment consecutive.

Ben Blakeley  


Sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Eccles Q.C. 


25 July 2014 


 

 
1.	  Ben Blakeley, you have been convicted by the jury of the offence of murder.  On  3rd 

 

 

 

 

December 2013 you took Jayden Parkinson, a complicated but loving and vulnerable 
 

 

17  year  old  girl,  into  open  country  near  Upton  and  in  the  dark  of  an  early  winter’s 
 

evening  you  murdered  her  by  strangulation.  There  is  only  one  sentence  for  this 
 

 

 

offence and it is life imprisonment. It is my duty however to specify under Schedule 21 

 

to  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  the  minimum  period  you  must  spend  in  prison 
 

before  being  considered  for  parole  and  in  doing  so  I  have  to  identify  those  features 
 

which aggravate your crime and those which may, to a very small extent, mitigate it. 

2.	  I also have to sentence you on Count 2 of the indictment for the offence of doing acts 

 

 

tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice. To this offence you have 
 

pleaded  guilty  on  the  basis  that  you  buried  the  body  of  Jayden  Parkinson  in  the 
 

 

 

graveyard  at  All  Saints  Church,  Didcot  to  prevent  the  police  from  discovering  her 

 

whereabouts. 

3.	  First,  I  have  to  identify  the  starting  point  for  assessing  the  appropriate  minimum 

 

 
term. Given that no weapon was used and that there are no circumstances that would 

 
place  this  offence  in  the  more  serious  categories  referred  to  in  Schedule  21  the 

 

 
statutory starting point is one of 15 years.
--------
4.  There are however in my judgment two matters which require a significant increase 

 

on that starting point. The first is the violent nature of your relationship with Jayden 

 
Parkinson, a vulnerable young person, and the second is your conduct after you had 

killed her, in particular the heartless and distressing way in which you disposed of and 

 

 
concealed her body. I bear in mind that the second matter is encompassed by Count 2 

 

on the indictment for which a concurrent sentence of imprisonment must be imposed.  

5.	  I  am  satisfied  on  the  evidence  given  at  your  trial  that  you  were  both  physically  and 

 

 

 

emotionally  abusive  towards  Jayden  Parkinson.  By  your  own  candid  admission  you 

 

were unreasonably jealous during your relationship and unfairly suspected Jayden of 

 
being unfaithful when she was not. You dominated and controlled her every day life 

 
by demanding that she should have no contact with other young men; you removed 

 

her phone so she could not contact others, and when she was at the hostel at One Foot 

 

 

Forward you demanded that she stay in her room, even to the extent of forbidding her 

 
for a while from using the toilet, with the result that she had to urinate in milk bottles. 

 

 

 
There  is  evidence  that  satisfies  me  that  there  were  occasions  when  you  argued  with 

 
Jayden  when  you  assaulted  her  with  slaps,  punches,  kicks,  stamps  and  bites;  and 

 
there  were  dangerous  attacks  upon  Jayden  Parkinson  when  you  squeezed  her  neck 

 
with enough force to leave marks. In a fit of jealous pique, when you heard that she 

 

had been intimate with another young man you deliberately sought to humiliate her 

 

 

by threatening to upload private and explicit images of her onto the internet. Yet, like 

 

 
so  many  victims  of  domestic  violence  Jayden  was  infatuated  with  you,  her  violent 

abuser,  and  found  it  difficult  to  separate  emotionally  from  you;  she  may  not  have  a 

 
been  a  perfect  young  woman  but  you  deliberately  and  selfishly  encouraged  her 

 

emotional  dependence  on  you  by  manipulating  her  feelings  through  fear  and 

neediness. 

 
6.	  At length in November 2013 Jayden Parkinson, with the help of the support staff at 

 

 

One Foot Forward, found the will-power to end her relationship with you and there is 

 
cogent  evidence  that  she  became  much  happier  and  more  confident  when  she  had 

Page 2 of 6
--------
taken that decision and was looking forward to a new and better life. Unfortunately, 

 
she discovered that she was pregnant and that you were the father, but being a decent 

young woman she wished to inform you of that fact and to offer you the chance in due 

 
course of seeing your child.  I am satisfied on all the evidence I have heard that she 

 

 

 

 
was in fact pregnant with your child but you utterly refused to believe her, and I am 

 
also satisfied that on the 3rd December Jayden Parkinson only went out to meet you, 

 

against the advice of staff at the hostel, in order to persuade you of the truth about her 

 
condition. You then bullied her emotionally into denying her own pregnancy and you 

manipulated  her  feelings  so  that  she  felt  she  had  no  choice  but  to  go  with  you  to 

Didcot  and  then  into  the  fields  where  she  met  her  end.  At  the  time  you  were  in  my 

 
judgment consumed with anger, having found out that Jayden had been intimate with 

 

another young man after she had broken off her relationship with you. 

7.	  There you strangled her to death in a jealous rage and is doing so gave no thought to 

 

the possibility that she might indeed have been carrying your child. 

8.	  I make it clear now that although you have demonstrated a pattern of abusive violence 

 

 

 

 

 
in other relationships your sentence is not increased by the way you behaved towards 

 

your other girlfriends, because those offences are not before this court; but emotional 

and physical abuse of the order I have described towards Jayden Parkinson is in my 

judgment a significantly aggravating factor. 

 
9.	  I turn now to the way you conducted yourself after killing Jayden Parkinson. To every 

 

 

 

 
reasonable  enquiry  by  police  officers  and  others  about  the  disappearance  of  Jayden 

 
you  responded  with  foul  mouthed  abuse  in  which  you  created  a  web  of  lies  about 

 
where  she  might  be,  accompanied  by  obscene  imprecations  that  you  did  not  care 

 
where she was and that she meant nothing to you.  It required a heart of stone to keep 

 

up that pretence, and a heart of stone as well to deal with her body in the way you did. 

 

 
I accept your evidence and that of your brother Jake that you first concealed her body 

 
in a ditch close to the place where she was killed. It is clear that you later decided to 

Page 3 of 6
--------
move her body, and to a limited extent I accept that you began to have feelings of guilt 

 

 

 

 

 

 
about where you had buried her. 

10. What,  however,  is  shocking  to  all  who  have  had  anything  to  do  with  the  police 

 

investigation  and  subsequent  trial  is  the  knowledge  that  in  the  early  hours  of  the 

 

morning  of  the  9th  December  2013  you  returned  to  that  ditch  and  dug  up  Jayden 
 

 

Parkinson’s  body.  You  then  crammed  the  mortal  remains  of  poor  Jayden  into  a 

suitcase  and  having  prepared  a  false  story  to  explain  your  actions  persuaded  an 
 

unwitting  taxi  driver  to  help  you  transport  her  body  to  All  Saints  Church  in  Didcot. 
 

There,  with  the  assistance  of  your  younger  brother  you  had  dug  a  grave  for  Jayden 

over  the  interred  body  of  your  uncle  Alan,  and  before  dawn  of  that  day  you  tipped 

Jayden  Parkinson  into  that  grave,  with  her  legs  folded  behind  and  tucked  into  her 

underwear, and covered her up. Though in your twisted mind you may possibly have 

 

thought that a graveyard was a better place for Jayden to be buried than a ditch in a 
 

 

field,  there  was  no  hint  of  respect  or  remorse  in  this  hasty  interment  and  I  am 

convinced that your primary purpose was to prevent anyone else from ever knowing 
 

 

what had happened to Jayden Parkinson. 

11.  Jayden Parkinson’s burial in this way is not only shocking for all who have listened to 

 

 
the  evidence,  but  it  was  and  always  will  be  an  intensely  distressing  memory  for  her 

 

family;  her  poor  father  passed  away  just  before  this  trial  and  he  must  have  been 

 

 
haunted before he died by the thought of what you had done to his daughter. I have 

 

 
read and heard the Victim Personal Statements written by Jayden’s mother and sister 

and express my appreciation of the moving way in which their grief and pain has been 

 

 
described. In addition to the distress experienced by Jayden’s family it should in my 

 
view  not  be  overlooked  that  in  concealing  her  body  in  a  grave  in  a  churchyard  you 

have also caused the priest in charge and the parishioners whose relatives lie at rest to 

 
be upset at the sacrilege done to the memory of those buried there. 

 

 
12.  A  further  relevant  consideration  to  my  mind  is  that  you  involved  your  younger 

 

brother  Jake  in  concealing  Jayden’s  body  both  in  the  ditch  and  then  in  the 

 

Page 4 of 6
--------
churchyard.  You  have  been  involved  in  petty  crime  for  much  of  your  life  but  he, 

 

 
despite looking up to you, managed to avoid any serious offending until you called on 

him to help you after Jayden had been murdered. From the witness box you rightly 

 
acknowledged  that  you  have  now  ruined  Jake’s  life,  but  in  December  last  year  you  

cared not one jot for the trouble you were causing him by demanding his assistance. 

 
Whether or not Jake knew that the hole he helped to dig in the churchyard was for the 

 

 

 
burial of Jayden Parkinson, a matter about which the jury have been unable to agree, 

you bear the responsibility for involving him. 

 
13.  Having said all that, I have to bear in mind that despite all the hurt you have caused 

 

 

and  all  the  public  outrage  at  your  wicked  behaviour,  the  increase  in  the  minimum 

 

 
term  must  be  proportionate  to  the  statutory  starting  position  and  must  take  into 

 
account any proper points to be made in mitigation. There are in my view four such 

points. First, I accept that you did not intend to kill Jayden Parkinson but to cause her 

 

 
grievous bodily harm.  Secondly, I accept that the offence was not premeditated but 

 

was  impulsive.  Thirdly,  I  believe  that  the  confession  you  wrote  in  prison  was 

motivated  by  some  beginnings  of  compassion  and  it  was,  as  the  record  shows, 

followed by a formal acceptance that you were responsible for the unlawful killing of 

 

Jayden,  though sadly  not  by  a  plea  of  guilty  to  her  murder.  Fourthly,  though  in  the 

 

 

context of what you have done these are but minor points, there is the clear emotional 

 

damage done to you as a child, the fact that you were still only 22 years of age at the 

 
time of the killing and the fact that within your relationship with Jayden there were 

times when you showed her kindness. 

 

 
14.  How then is the minimum term to be appropriately assessed? In calculating the uplift 

 

 
for the offence comprised in Count 2, namely the burial and concealment of Jayden’s 

 

body to prevent apprehension for the offence of murder, R v Grimes [2012] 1 Cr App 

Rep (S) 97 is authority for the proposition that I should decide what the appropriate 

 
determinate sentence should be on a plea of guilty to Count 2, and on the basis that 

 
only half that sentence would be served in custody whereas the whole of a minimum 

 

Page 5 of 6
--------
term  must  be  served  before  eligibility  for  parole  arises,  I  must  then  increase  the 

starting point by half of that sentence.  

15.  I  have	  been  referred  to  a  number  of  sentencing  appeal  decisions,  from  which  it 

 

 

 

appears  that  the  top  of  the  sentencing  range  hitherto  for  a  comparable  offence 

 
committed to avoid apprehension for murder has been 6 years after a plea of guilty; 

 
see R v Lang [2002] 2 Cr App Rep (S) 15. [In the unreported case of R v Dennehy and 

others, 28 February 2014 I note that sentences of 15 years imprisonment after a trial 

 

were  imposed  for  the  unlawful  burial  and  concealment  from  the  police  of  three 

 
separate victims]. In my judgment the concealment of Jayden Parkinson’s body in a 

grave  in  a  churchyard  with  the  other  features  to  which  I  have  referred,  for  the 

purposes  of  avoiding  arrest  and  prosecution  for  murder,  makes  this  a  more  serious 

and  disturbing  case  than  Lang  justifying  a  greater,  though  not  a  disproportionately 

greater, sentence. 

 
16.	  There  must  then  be  a  further  increase  to  mark  the  history  of  your  physical  and 

 

 

 

  

emotional abuse of a vulnerable young woman, conduct which is to be condemned the 

more in the case of a man with a proved history of violent offending and petty crime. 

 

 
In general terms that would warrant a further uplift of at least three years. 

 
17.  Taking these two matters and the other aggravating circumstances into consideration, 

 

 
and bearing in mind that sentences for murder are not mathematical exercises, I am 

 

satisfied  that  before  making  an  allowance  for  your  mitigation  the  15  year  period 

 
should be increased to 22 years and after making such allowance it should be one of 

20 years, from which the time you have spent in custody on remand will be deducted. 

 

The provisions for a victim surcharge will also apply. 

 
18. Ben Blakeley, on Count 1 of the indictment you will be sentenced to life imprisonment 

 

 
with a minimum term of 20 years less the number of days on remand, a figure that 

 

will  be  calculated  administratively.  On  Count  2  you  will  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of 

eight years imprisonment concurrent. The existing community orders are revoked.

Kasim Ahmed and Shamraze Khan
Sheffield Crown Court
25 July 2014
Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Coulson
Kasim Ahmed and Shamraze Khan, you may remain seated until I tell you to stand. lam
going to sentence you individually, starting with you, Kasim Ahmed.
You were born on the 19 February 1996. You are now 18 years old. The offences for which I
sentence you were committed on 27th October 2013, less than 4 months before your 18th
birthday.
On the first day of this trial, you pleaded guilty to the murder of Thavisha Peiris. Mr Peiris
was a Sri Lankan who had qualified at Sheffield Hallam University and was working as a pizza
delivery driver for Domino’s in order to pay back the money that he had borrowed from his
family to fund his studies. The evidence was that he was an exceptionally pleasant and
likable young man who worked hard and had a solid future in front of him as a software
engineer. It was a future that you took away from him.
His father, Serath, provides a graphic account of the loss suffered by Thavisha's family.
""The premature death of our youngest son Thavisha has had a profound impact on our lives.
In October 2013, we were devastated and shocked to hear of his tragic end. Even now, we
are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone.
Thavisha was one of the most caring and loving sons a parent could have. He was full of life
and always had a smile on his face. Anyone who met him immediately liked him. He was
bright, intelligent, hardworking and energetic and had all the potential of bringing success
for his future as well as his parents. We are now left with nothing but a broken heart.""
He also demonstrates the catastrophic financial consequences of his son's murder:
""The financial impact of losing our son will have a major impact on our life. On retirement, I
received a sum of 3,500,000 rupees, equivalent to £15,800. The cost to send Thavisha
through college in Sri Lanka cost approximately £2700, to send him through college in
Sheffield cost approximately £5000 and the cost of his food and lodgings cost the family
1
--------
£2700. All these expenses were born out of me, having utilised my retirement savings for
my son’s future well being, as an investment for the family as well as for Thavisha. Our
future reserves have been spent educating Thavisha and now at the age of sixty seven years,
my wife being a the age of fifty nine years, we are suffering from diabetes and high blood
pressure and have no household income.""
On Sunday 27th October 2013, at about 10:00 in the evening, in the company of your older
cousin, Shamraze Khan, you were walking down Southey Crescent in the Southey Green area
of Sheffield when Mr Peiris stopped you to ask for directions. You apparently told him that,
since he was a delivery driver, he should know where he was going. The two of you then
followed Thavisha Peiris when he turned into a parking bay where he parked his car. | find
that, by then, the two of you had decided to rob Thavisha Peiris of his mobile phone, and
possibly also his SatNav and his money belt.
You had a knife in your pocket because you are a habitual street robber who always carries a
knife with him for that purpose. However, on this occasion, despite the production of the
knife, Thavisha Peiris resisted your attempt to take his phone. You do not like to be
challenged; as the pre—sentence report makes clear, it is an affront to your self—esteem.
So you stabbed him. You then decided to stab him again and again. The post—mortem
revealed that Thavisha Peiris had a total of 14 wounds inflicted by your knife. Whilst perhaps
four of those might be said to be defensive injuries, the remaining 10 stab wounds were all
offensive injuries inflicted by you. Some of those injuries were particularly severe, such as
injury 4, which penetrated Thavisha Peiris' neck and cut his carotid artery; and injury 12,
which penetrated and sliced through one of the main chambers of his heart.
When you first stabbed Thavisha Peiris, you may well have intended only to do him really
serious harm. But the number of blows inflicted, the considerable force with which you
stabbed him (about which there was evidence at the trial), and the effort required to pull
the knife out of his body and stab him again, leave me in no doubt whatsoever that, as you
continued to stab him, you were concerned only to kill Thavisha Peiris.
For his murder, the only sentence I can impose is one of detention for life. The remaining
issue for me is the minimum term that you will serve before you are first considered for
release.
In that regard, I have considered carefully the pre—sentence report dated 16th July and
prepared by the Probation Service. That assessed you as posing a high risk of causing serious
harm; in other words, you are a dangerous man. That accords with my own assessment of
you: I recall that when you appeared on the videolink at the preliminary hearing, and did not
realise that I could hear, you were boasting to Shamraze Khan that you had already been
involved in 5 fights in prison.
The pre—sentence report does not conclude that you are particularly immature or mentally
underdeveloped: on the contrary, the report’s picture of you is of someone of reasonable
maturity with a good insight and understanding into what you do and have done.
If you had been over 18 at the time of this murder, the standard starting point of 15 years
imprisonment would have been doubled to 30 years, because this was a murder carried out
in the course of a robbery, and was, in my view, an offence of particularly high seriousness.
2
--------
However because you were 17 at the time of the killing, Parliament has decided that the
single starting point is 12 years imprisonment, pursuant to schedule 21, paragraph 7, of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003. That starting point does not, however, take into account any of
the circumstances of this particular murder; it is akin to the standard 15 year starting point
for an adult.
In the present case, there can be no doubt that there were numerous aggravating factors —I
have identified a total of six — which warrant a very significant increase in the 12 year starting
point.
The first is the one to which I have already referred, namely that you killed Thavisha Peiris in
the course of a robbery. You brutally killed someone providing a form of public service, just
because you wanted his mobile phone. As I have said, the seriousness of the offence was
particularly high.
The second aggravating factor is that you murdered Thavisha Peiris with a knife taken to the
scene, which indicates a significant degree of premeditation on your part. Whilst you had
not targeted Thavisha Peiris as your next victim until he came into view on Southey
Crescent, you planned to rob anybody at knifepoint whom you considered to be worth
robbing, and if the circumstances were right. That is why you had the knife in the first place.
The third aggravating factor is the amount of physical suffering you inflicted on him before
he died: there was graphic evidence at the trial of Thavisha Peiris' screams as you plunged
the knife into him again and again. You ignored those screams.
The fourth aggravating factor is your criminal record. It is a truly terrible record for someone
so young.
In July 2010 you were convicted of the possession of an offensive weapon in a public place
and sentenced to a youth rehabilitation order. In November 2011 you were convicted of an
attempted robbery and sentenced to a detention and training order. You failed to comply
with the terms of that order and you had to be returned to detention for a period of 8
weeks.
In November 2012 you were convicted of two offences of robbery and two offences of
possession of a knife in a public place. You were sentenced to a detention and training order
for 2 years, the maximum period allowed for a DTO. In September 2013, just 10 months
later, you were released from detention (because Parliament insists that offenders such as
yourself serve half, and sometimes less, of the sentence originally imposed by thejudge).
However, by the 19th October 2013 you were in breach of your release conditions and you
were remanded in custody. You were released on bail on 21 October 2013. Just 6 days later
you murdered Thavisha Peiris in a knifepoint robbery that went wrong. It is not fanciful to
conclude that, in the light of your criminal history, this was a murder that was waiting to
happen.
Accordingly, the fourth aggravating factor is your many previous convictions for possessing a
knife and knifepoint robbery; and the fifth, separate aggravating factor is that you were on
bail at the time of this murder.
Finally in this catalogue of aggravating factors, there are the two knifepoint robberies which,
together with Shamraze Khan, you committed just an hour before the murder of Thavisha

3
--------
Peiris in Sheffield City Centre. Again these were typical of your style: you had a knife and the
two of you had a general plan to rob anybody who seemed vulnerable to such an attack. You
inflicted injury to one of your victims, Aiden Foster, using the handle of the knife, just
because you could. The other victim was Leah Burgess, a terrified 14 year old girl. You stole
their mobile phones and a small amount of money.
I am not going to impose separate sentences for those robberies: instead I am going to
regard them as aggravating factors which further increase the minimum term in your case.
In myjudgment, those six aggravating factors double the length of the statutory starting
point. In other words, they increase the appropriate minimum term in your case to one of 24
years. It follows from what I have said that, if you had been the same age as your co—
accused, Shamraze Khan, this minimum term would have been significantly higher.
I consider that the only mitigating factor is your plea of guilty. Although that was very late,
and although there was an overwhelming case against you (in addition to everything else
that l have mentioned, there was forensic evidence and you confessed to the murder to
your family, the day after it had happened), I consider that there should be some modest
reduction to reflect your guilty plea. I would therefore reduce the minimum term in your
case from 24 to 23 years.
| reject any suggestion that your difficult home life is a mitigating factor. You had received
the benefit of numerous interventions from various public authorities which were designed
to help you, and you had ignored them. I also reject the suggestion that you are remorseful.
You did not plead guilty until the day of trial and | find that that was motivated solely by
your realisation that the case against you was overwhelming.
Kasim Ahmed, stand up.
On count 3, for the murder of Thavisha Peiris, and taking into account the knifepoint
robberies committed an hour before his murder, l sentence you to detention for life with a
minimum term of 23 years.
Nobody in court should be in any doubt about that sentence. It means that you will serve a
minimum of 23 years in detention and prison. That term cannot be reduced or diminished in
any way because of good behaviour or anything else. It is only after you have served those
23 years that you will be even considered for release. It means that you will remain in
detention and then prison until at least the year 2037. You may not be considered suitable
for release even then.
There is no separate penalty on counts 1 and 2. The victim surcharge applies. Any time spent
on remand should count towards the minimum term.
Take him down.
Shamraze Khan, you are 26. Yesterday, you were found guilty of the murder of Thavisha
Peiris. In myjudgment, the evidence against you was overwhelming. As I told you yesterday,
the only sentence that I can impose is one of life imprisonment. Again, the only remaining
issue is the length of the minimum term that you will serve before you are first considered
for release.

4
--------
You were the partner of Kasim Ahmed in the carrying out of two knifepoint robberies in
Sheffield City Centre at about 9 o’clock that night, and you were again his partner in the
similar attempted robbery which led to the murder of Thavisha Peiris about an hour later.
Your case, that you were nowhere near the car when the stabbing happened, was rightly
rejected by thejury, given the eye witness evidence of Peter Bartholomew, who saw both
you and Kasim Ahmed standing by the driver's door when the car was parked, immediately
prior to the stabbing; and your palm print found on the rear quarter light which made plain
that you had been looking into the car before or at the time of the murder.
As I have already said, Thavisha Peiris was murdered in the course of a robbery and I regard
his murder as an offence of particularly high seriousness. Thus the statutory starting point in
your case is one of 30 years imprisonment.
In addition, there is one clear and obvious aggravating factor: your involvement in the
knifepoint robberies an hour before the murder.
It did you no credit that, both in your basis of plea and in your evidence at trial, you sought
to play down your involvement in those events to an unrealistic and dishonest extent. It was
clear from the evidence of both Aiden Foster and Leah Burgess that you and Kasim Ahmed
acted together in carrying out those robberies. That is best demonstrated by the evidence of
both of them that, whilst Kasim Ahmed took the phone from Leah Burgess, you were
emptying out her bag and sorting through its contents to find money or something else
valuable to take.
I am not going to impose a separate sentence in respect to those robberies, but they are
aggravating factors which have to be reflected in the minimum term. They would increase
the minimum term beyond the 30 year starting point.
However, whilst in the case of Kasim Ahmed, there were numerous other aggravating
factors that increased the minimum term in his case, there are a number of mitigating
factors that reduce the length of the minimum term appropriate in your case.
First, I accept your case that you did not have a knife at the time of the robberies or at the
time of the murder. Secondly, the evidence was plain that you took no part in the stabbing
of Thavisha Peiris. Kasim Ahmed alone wielded the knife.
Thirdly, whilst you knew that, if the robberies that you carried out with Kasim Ahmed went
wrong, the victims could suffer really serious bodily harm as a result of the use of the knife, I
accept that at no time did you intend the killing of your victims. Thus, when Thavisha Peiris
was stabbed, | find that you intended him to suffer really serious harm, but I accept that
your intention did not go beyond that. You did not, at any time, intend him to die.
Fourthly, and most importantly, I accept that you were a secondary party in these planned
robberies. You played a significant role, but a lesser role than that of Kasim Ahmed.
But this mitigating factor is offset, to a relatively large extent, by the age difference between
you. You were 8 years older than Kasim Ahmed, and referred to him as your nephew. You
have a wife and 4 children. You were plainly more mature than him. You were someone he
looked up to. You should have steered him away from his serious criminal activity or, at the
very least, had nothing to do with him. Instead you became his willing partner.

5
--------
Finally in the list of mitigating factors, I note that, although you have a criminal record for
minor offences, you have no previous convictions for violence, or for the use or the carrying
of a weapon; or for anything which remotely resembles what happened on the night of the
27 October 2013.
Shamraze Khan, stand up
Taking all these matters into account, I conclude that the appropriate minimum term in your
case is one of 24 years imprisonment. That is the same minimum term which I have applied
to Kasim Ahmed, before the discount for his guilty plea. As I have already said, if he had
been your age, his sentence would have been higher. To put that point another way, your
overall culpability is similar to his because, although you were a secondary party, you were
much older and more mature than him, and had an even better understanding of what you
were doing. That age difference is, of course, reflected in the different statutory starting
points.
The comments that I have already made to Kasim Ahmed in respect of his minimum term
also apply to you.
Accordingly on count 3 the sentence is life imprisonment with a minimum term of 24 years.
There is no separate penalty on counts 1 and 2. The victim surcharge applies. Any time spent
on remand should count towards the minimum term.
Take him down.

Application  has  been  made  to  me  to  discharge  this  jury  on  the  basis  that  it  is  no 
 
longer possible for Andrew Coulson and Clive Goodman to have a fair trial on the 
 
remaining two counts that the jury are considering. The application is based on the 
 
publicity  last  night  and  this morning  following  the  verdicts delivered yesterday  on 
 
count 1.  Immediately after the verdict the PM issued a statement apologising for 
 
employing Mr. Coulson. That statement has been followed by pronouncements by a 
 
large  number  of  politicians  from  all  parties.  I  have  not  considered  and  will  not 
 
consider  anything  that  has  been  said  in  Parliament  as  that  is  covered  by 
 
parliamentary privilege and is the sole prerogative of Parliament. 
  
 
I  asked  for  an  explanation  from  the  Prime  Minister  as  to  why  he  had  issued  his 
 
 
statement while the jury were still considering verdicts. I received a response from 
 
his principal private secretary which said ‘the Prime Minister was responding to the 
 
guilty verdict on hacking charges that had been delivered in open court. He did this 
 
in the light of the intense media coverage and understandable public interest. The 
 
Prime  Minister  was  careful  to  make  no  further  comment  about  any  matters  that 
 
 
might still be before the court.’ 
 
 
I accept that that was the Prime Minister’s intention but I am afraid that to an extent 
 
 
his explanation misses the point. He has now told the public and therefore the jury 
 
that he was given assurances by Mr. Coulson before he employed him which turned 
 
out to be untrue. The jury were not aware of that before and it is a matter which is 
 
capable of affecting Mr. Coulson’s credibility in their eyes. Mr. Coulson’s credibility is 
 
a matter which is in issue on the final two charges that the jury have to consider. 
 
  
 
Other politicians have chosen to comment about Mr. Coulson and as a result the jury 
 
have heard of matters which were not admitted at the trial for legal reasons. I am 
 
certainly not seeking or intending to single out the Prime Minister. Politicians from 
 
across  the  political  spectrum  have  seen  fit  to  make  strong  comments  about  Mr. 
 
Coulson  despite  the  fact  that  the  jury  are  still  deliberating.  The  Chairman  of  the 
 
parliamentary committee which investigated phone hacking has told the public that 
 
Mr. Coulson lied to them in the evidence that he gave. Evidence of what Mr. Coulson 
 
said  before  the  committee  could  not  be  given  in  court  as  it  would  amount  to  a 
 
breach of parliamentary privilege. That was the view of parliamentary counsel which 
 
was conveyed to the court and which I accepted. Again that information is capable of 
 
affecting the jury’s view of Mr. Coulson’s credibility.
--------
Mr. Langdale who made powerful and well argued submissions to me relies on the 
 
public importance of those who made the comments and the increased likelihood 
 
therefore of the jury being influenced by them. This was a significant factor in the 
 
court of appeal’s decision in the case of McCann and as he says, while the decision is 
 
an old one, the principle has not changed. 
  
 
My sole concern is to ensure that justice is done. Politicians have other imperatives 
 
and I understand that.  Whether the political imperative was such that statements 
 
could not await all the verdicts, I leave to others to judge. The issue for me now is to 
 
decide whether I am satisfied that Mr. Coulson will receive a fair trial on the other 
 
 
two counts or whether the prejudice is such that that is impossible. 
  
 
I  have  been  referred  to  the  decision  of  the  administrative  court  in  contempt 
 
 
proceedings brought against parts of the media following the partial verdicts in the 
 
case  of  Levi  Belfield.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  revelations  in  those  reports  were 
 
considerably  more  prejudicial  to  the  fair  trial  of  Belfield  on  the  remaining  counts 
 
than is the case here. 
  
 
The decision in this application is entirely fact specific. Not merely is it fact specific 
 
but it is also specific to this jury who we all have been watching at work for eight 
 
months.  First this jury have shown that they are entirely capable of putting out of 
 
their minds prejudicial material in reaching their decisions. At the start of this trial I 
   
heard two days of submissions on behalf of Rebekah Brooks to the effect that there 
 
was so much prejudicial material about her in the public domain that the jury would 
 
inevitably convict her and it was impossible for her to have a fair trial. She has been 
 
acquitted  of  all  the  charges  against  her.  I  trust  that  no‐one  will  maintain  that 
 
complaint now. Everyone who has watched the jury have been impressed with their 
 
dedication and their ability to concentrate on the evidence and follow directions of 
 
law. Our legal system is based on the premise that juries comply with directions of 
 
 
 
law given by the Judge. 
  
We should not forget the stage of the case that we have reached. The jury at the 
 
 
moment are deep into an analytical discussion of the evidence on counts 2 and 3 and 
 
 
have been for sometime. I am fortified in that belief by consideration of the notes 
 
that  I  have  received  from  them.  There  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  they  will  be 
 
diverted  from  that  course.  We  underrate  juries,  and  particularly  this  one,  at  our 
 
peril. 
  
It should also be born in mind that by virtue of the verdict that the jury have already 
 
returned, they are sure that Andrew Coulson has lied to them about his involvement 
 
in phone hacking. Therefore, while important public figures in defence of their own 
 
position  or  to  attack  another’s  have  revealed  other  lies  told  by  Andrew  Coulson, 
 
those revelations will have less effect on the jury. 
  
 
I  watched  a  fair  amount  of  the  news  coverage  last  night  in  anticipation  of  this

and R –v‐ McCann.

I have decided that the jury should not be discharged as I am satisfied that the jury 
 
 
will continue to try Mr. Coulson and Mr. Goodman on the evidence that they have 
 
 
heard in court and solely on that evidence. 
  
That does not mean that I am not concerned about what has happened in this case. I 
   
consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of

reporting  of  this  case  but  when  politicians  regard  it  as  open  season,  one  cannot 
 
expect the press to remain silent. I accept that this case is very unusual if not unique, 
 
but the situation could occur again and I would urge that discussions take place to 
 
 
try and set up a better system of dealing with it. 
  
 
I have considered whether, in the light of what has happened, I was correct to take 
 
 
partial verdicts. I am fortified in what I did by the fact that no counsel has suggested I 
   
was wrong even with the benefit of hindsight and by the fact that what I did accords 
 
entirely  with  the  Practice  Direction  which  lays  down  the  procedure  for  taking 
 
 
verdicts and emphasises the necessity for the same procedure to be followed by all

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Saunders 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Central Criminal Court 
 

 

 

4 July 2014 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Parliament has decided that it is a criminal offence to access the voicemails of other people 
 
without  their  consent  or  an  order  of  the  court.  Parliament  has  decided  that  the  offence 
 
applies to members of the press in the same way as it does to all other citizens. This law 
 
provides the same protection to all citizens  including those who, for one reason or another, 
 
are in the public eye. Parliament set the maximum sentence for the offence of intercepting 
 
communications  at  2  years  imprisonment  and  Parliament  has  decided  that  the  same 
 
maximum sentence applies to an offence of conspiracy which can cover, as it does in this 
 
case, a very large number of individual offences. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
   

My function is to pass sentences which reflect the criminality of the Defendants as defined 
 
by  that  law  and  are  within  the  range  of  sentences  prescribed  by  Parliament.  I  take  into 
 
account the effect on those whose phones were hacked and those whose messages were 
 
intercepted;  what  the  Defendants  got  out  of  their  crimes  and  all  proper  matters  of 
 
mitigation. I also have to do justice between Defendants. To assist me in that, I consider 
 
previous relevant decisions of the court so that, as far as possible, there is consistency in 
 
sentencing. I then pass what it is the least possible sentence which properly reflects those 
 
factors.

It is not my job to pass judgment on, or make observations about, the relationship between 
 
the press, the police and the politicians. The Leveson Inquiry has done that.  It is not my job 
 
to comment on press regulation; nor is it my job to comment on whether this trial has been 
 
worth  the  expense  that  has  been  incurred  except  perhaps  I  can  observe  that  it  is  not 
 
necessarily correct  to measure the value of a trial only in terms of the number of people 
 
convicted  or  the  severity  of  the  sentences imposed.  Nor  is  it  for  me  to comment  on  the 
 
quality of the News of the World as a newspaper, I am not qualified to do that. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

What is an important matter for me to have in mind in considering sentence is the amount 
 
of  phone  hacking  that went  on  for  the  benefit  of  the  News  of  the  World  and  over  what 
 
period. It had started by April 2002 when Milly Dowler’s phone was hacked and it continued 
 
until August 2006 with the arrest of Mulcaire and Goodman. The amount of phone hacking 
 
increased  during  the  period  of  time  covered  by  the  indictment  to  a  level  where  Glenn 
 
Mulcaire was saying that he couldn’t cope with being given anymore targets to  hack. Over 
 
the period there were many thousands of phone hacks and many hundreds of voicemails 
 
 
were accessed illegally. 
  

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Targets of phone hacking were politicians, celebrities, and royalty. In addition there were 
 
people  who  were  targeted  simply  because  they  were  friends  of,  worked  with,  or  were 
 
related to famous people. The voicemail of Helen Asprey, who was the personal assistant to 
 
Prince  William  and  Prince  Harry,  was  hacked  hundreds  of  times;  the  phone  of  Hannah 
 
Pawlby, who worked in Charles Clarke’s office when he was Home Secretary, was hacked to 
 
try and get evidence to support a false rumour that she was having an affair with Charles 
 
Clarke.  Laura  Rooney’s  phone  was  hacked  because  she  shared  a  name  with  a  famous 
 
footballer. These are just a small number of examples. So it is a mistake to believe that the 
 
only people whose phones were hacked or whose messages were intercepted were people 
 
in the public eye who courted publicity. 
 

 
 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Phone  hacking  is a  time consuming  occupation  and  many hours were no doubt  spent  by 
 
Mulcaire and by reporters listening to messages which did not provide any leads for stories. 
 
They  did  however  pick  up  intensely  personal  messages,  some  but  not  all  of  which  were 
 
about  relationships. Other  personal  material  included  messages left  by  doctors’  surgeries 
 
and clinics which the recipients were entitled to expect would remain private. As a result of 
 
intercepting thousands of messages,  the News of the World discovered information about 
   
famous and powerful people which ended up as front page exclusives and caused serious 
 
upset and distress to the subjects and to those close to them. An additional consequence 
 
was that, as nobody knew how the News of the World had got the stories, an undercurrent 
 
of distrust developed between friends and family who suspected each other of selling the 
 
information.

It is true that some celebrities attempted to use the press to put themselves in the best 
 
possible light while putting others in the worst possible light. It is also true that some people 
 
who  were  discovered  to  be  having  inappropriate  sexual  relationships  with  other  people 
 
made money out of telling their stories. They responded to inducements from the News of 
 
the World that, as the story was coming out anyway, they might as well sell their account 
 
and  be  portrayed  sympathetically.  There  were  people  close  to  celebrities,  and  even 
 
members of their families, who were prepared to supply information to the News of the 
 
World, sometimes for money. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

None of this justified phone hacking. The law’s protection is given to the rich, famous and 
 
powerful as it is to all. Some commentators believe that invading the privacy of the famous 
 
by accessing their voicemail messages should be permissible. They are entitled to their view 
 
but it is not the law, and while the law remains as it is, the courts have a duty to provide the 
 
 
same protection to all citizens. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

In fairness to these Defendants and all those involved in the trial, no‐one has suggested that 
 
the  phone  hacking  which  occurred  in  this  case  was  justified.  They  all  knew  that  it  was 
 
contrary to the PCC code which governs the conduct of journalists and they all knew it was 
 
morally wrong. These Defendants have said that they did not realise that it was a criminal 
 
offence. Not only is Ignorance of the law no defence but it seldom provides any mitigation. 
 
It is the duty of senior journalists to know the law particularly in so far as it affects their 
 
work. While there were genuine differences between lawyers as to whether the offence of 
 
intercepting communications could be committed after the message had been listened to 
 
by the intended recipient, there was no debate as to whether it was committed by listening 
 
to someone else’s voicemail before they had received it. In the circumstances of this case, I 
   
 
do not accept that ignorance of the law provides any mitigation. 
  

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

The evidence is clear that there was a very great deal of phone hacking while Andy Coulson 
 
was editor. In April 2002, while he was still deputy editor, Milly Dowler’s phone was hacked. 
 
I intend to say a little about those events. It was Neville Thurlbeck who instructed Mulcaire 
 
 
to carry out that investigation on 10th April 2002. Andy Coulson was editing the paper in the 
 
absence of Rebekah Brooks. Mulcaire picked up a message left on Milly Dowler’s phone by 
 
an  employment  agency  in  Telford  inviting  her  to  an  interview.  We  now  know  that  the 
 
message was left by mistake on Milly’s phone and was intended for someone who had a 
 
similar mobile phone number and name. The News of the World didn’t know that, and a 
 
team of reporters were despatched to find her.  They failed. As we now know, Milly was 
 
already  dead.  The  News  of  the  World  delayed  telling  the  police  the  contents  of  the 
 
voicemail until they realised that they were not going to find Milly. That was unforgiveable 
 
and could only, in my judgment, have happened with the knowledge of the person editing 
 
the paper that week, Andy Coulson. In reaching that conclusion, I make it clear that I have 
 
not relied on the mitigation put forward on behalf of Neville Thurlbeck. It is an inevitable 
 
conclusion from the evidence I heard of the part that the editor played in managing major

news  stories,  particularly  at  the  end  of  the  week  in  the  run  up  to  publication.  Neville 
 
Thurlbeck,  who  despatched  the  team  to  Telford  to  look  for  Milly,  must  also  have  been 
 
involved in that decision, although his case now is that that was decided by Coulson and 
 
Kuttner. Neville Thurlbeck was not some minor cog in the wheel at the News of the World. 
 
He was an important and distinguished journalist. I also reject the mitigation put forward by 
 
Mulcaire that he hacked the phone of Milly Dowler in the belief that he was doing it in some 
 
way to assist the police. Mr. Mulcaire knew perfectly well that he was hacking Milly’s phone 
 
to assist the News of the World to obtain a story by finding her. He played no part however 
 
in the delay in informing the police of what had been discovered on the voicemail. I do not 
 
propose to hear evidence on this issue as, having read what Mulcaire says in interview as to 
 
his belief that he was assisting the police, I am quite satisfied that it is incapable of belief. In 
 
 
any event, even if it were accurate, it would make no difference to the sentence. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
   

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The News of the World were using their resources to try to find Milly Dowler. The fact that 
 
they delayed telling the police of the contents of the voicemail demonstrates that their true 
 
motivation was not to act in the best interests of the child but to get  credit for finding her 
 
and thereby  sell the maximum number of newspapers. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

The  true  reason  for  the  phone  hacking  was  to  sell  newspapers.  In  an  increasingly 
 
competitive  market,  the  editor  wanted  to  make  sure  that  it  was  his  paper  that  got  the 
 
stories which would create the biggest headlines and sell the most newspapers and he, and 
 
others  at  the  newspaper,  were  prepared  to  use  illegal  means  to  do  that.  No  doubt  Mr. 
 
Coulson was under considerable pressure to maintain, if not increase, market share. He had 
 
been appointed as editor at a very young age.  He was ambitious and it was important for 
 
him  to  succeed.  He,  amongst  others,  passed  that  pressure  down  to  their  subordinates. 
 
There was great competition between the various desks. The evidence in the case is that 
 
there was considerable pressure on desk heads to get good headline grabbing stories every 
 
week  and  there  was  little  concern  for  how  they  got  them.  Apart  from  phone  hackings, 
 
personal phone data was obtained, presumably by deceiving phone companies; rubbish bins 
 
were  gone  through  and  surveillance  was  carried  out  by  skilled  investigators.  No  charges 
 
arise  out  of  this  other  behaviour  but  it  demonstrates  that  rights  to  individual  privacy 
 
counted  for  little  in  the  period  of  2003  to  August  2006  at  the  News  of  the  World.  After 
 
January 2005 phone hacking was being carried out by the news desk with the assistance of 
 
Mulcaire  and  for  the  features desk by  Dan  Evans as well  as by  Clive Goodman,  who was 
 
phone hacking members of the royal family and the royal household. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

It would be wrong and unbalanced to attribute all of the success of the News of the World 
 
to phone hacking. There were, of course, important parts of the contribution made by the 
 
News  of  the  World  to  public  life  that  were  entirely  unrelated  to  phone  hacking. 
  
Nevertheless, the editor and others clearly thought it necessary to use phone hacking to find 
 
 
important stories to maintain their competitive edge.

--------
When the police arrested Mulcaire and Goodman, phone hacking at the News of the World 
 
stopped.  The  News  of  the  World  told  the  PCC,  the  public  and  Parliament  that  Clive 
 
Goodman was the only journalist at the paper who had been involved in phone hacking.  It 
 
was not Mr. Coulson who put this forward to the PCC or Parliament. He had resigned by 
 
then, but he took an active part before he left in seeking to ensure that Mr. Goodman did 
 
not reveal publicly what he knew of the activity of others. He did not want it known that he 
 
was one of those involved in phone hacking at the News of the World. I do not suggest that 
 
he had any influence on the advice that the lawyers gave Mr. Goodman but he did try and 
 
influence Mr. Goodman in the decisions that he made about what he was going to reveal. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Coulson was not the only person at the News of the World who knew that this activity 
 
extended beyond Goodman. Anyone who read the transcript of the proceedings in front of 
 
Gross  J  would  have  been  put  on  enquiry  that  others  at  the  News  of  the  World  were 
 
involved. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is no evidence that Mr. Coulson played any part in the cover up that occurred after his 
 
 
resignation. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

All  the  Defendants  that  I  have  to  sentence  save  for  Mr.  Mulcaire  are  distinguished 
 
journalists  who  had  no  need  to  behave  as  they  did  to  be  successful.  They  all  achieved  a 
 
great  deal  without  resorting  to  the  unlawful  invasion  of  other  peoples’  privacy.  Those 
 
achievements will now count for nothing.  I accept that their reputations and their careers 
 
are irreparably damaged. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

    

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

There  is  no  evidence  that  phone  hacking  at  the  News  of  the  World  continued  after  the 
 
arrest of Clive Goodman save for an isolated occasion when Dan Evans hacked the phone of 
 
Kelly Hoppen. That does not mean that there is no need for any element of deterrence in 
 
the sentence. If the criminal law is to be used as a means of curtailing excesses of the press, 
 
reporters  need  to  know  that  punishment  will  follow  if  breaches  of  the  criminal  law  are 
 
proved. These types of offences are extremely difficult to prove and require the investment 
 
of huge resources by the prosecuting authorities. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

Mr. Coulson, on the jury’s verdict, has to take the major share of the blame for the phone 
 
hacking at the News of the World. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that he started 
 
the phone hacking but there is ample evidence that it increased enormously while he was 
 
the editor. On the jury’s verdict he knew about it and encouraged it when he should have 
 
stopped it. It was his reputation as an editor and journalist which was increased through the 
 
stories that were obtained by phone hacking and, even though he resigned, he did so with 
 
his reputation intact.  News International decided it was appropriate to make a substantial 
 
 
severance payment to him.

--------
I  take  no  account  of  his  good  character  and  reputation  as  a  journalist  in  reducing  his 
 
 
sentence  because  it  was  that  reputation  which  put  him  in  day  to  day  control  of  the 
 
 
newspaper and in a position to make use of  phone hacking. 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

His  good  character  has  another  aspect  to  it  that  I  do  reflect  to  a  limited  extent  in  the 
 
sentence. As I heard during the trial, and as I have read since, he has given help and shown 
 
kindness to others when they have faced personal tragedy or difficulties. 
  

   
 

 
   

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The other mitigating feature in his case is the delay in this matter coming to trial. There is no 
 
evidence that Mr. Coulson has contributed to the delay in the proper investigation of these 
 
 
offences.  I have to remember that I am sentencing him for offences that occurred many 
    
 
years ago. 
  

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

Mr. Miskiw, Mr. Thurlbeck and Mr. Weatherup have all pleaded guilty. They did not do so at 
 
the first reasonable opportunity as defined by the Court of Appeal in the case of Caley but in 
 
my  judgment  this  is  one  of  those  rare  cases  mentioned  in  that  decision  where  the 
 
complexity,  length  and  therefore  expense  of  the  trial  is  such  that  a  greater  than  normal 
 
reduction in sentence to reflect the plea is appropriate. Accordingly, in their cases I will give 
 
the maximum one third discount to reflect their pleas of guilty. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Going beyond that reduction is a great deal more difficult. As with Mr. Coulson the good 
 
character of Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Weatherup counts for very little. They would not have 
 
held the senior positions at the newspaper that they did if they were not well respected 
 
journalists. It was because of the respect in which they were held that they were able to get 
 
 
away with this criminal conduct for so long. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

In mitigation Mr. Thurlbeck and Mr. Weatherup have spoken of the involvement of people 
 
at higher levels in the newspaper who they say bore more responsibility for what happened 
 
than  they  did.  This  is  the  first  time  that  they  have  said  this  publicly.  They  have  both 
 
expressed concern for the state of, and the need for, reform of the activities of journalists. 
 
Indeed  Mr.  Thurlbeck  has  lectured  on  the  subject.  All  three  have  expressed  remorse  for 
 
what  they  have  done.  I  am  afraid  that  that  has  the  appearance  of  regret  for  the 
 
consequences, both to them and others, of getting caught, rather than true remorse. Had 
 
there  been  some  positive  demonstration  of  remorse  such  as 
co‐operation  with  the 
 
authorities in revealing the true extent of criminal activity among journalists, I might have 
 
been able to make some further reduction to reflect remorse. It is important that  those 
 
who will have to police the press in the future know what has gone on in the past and what 
 
changes they need to make to ensure it doesn’t happen again. There is a certain irony in 
 
seeing men who pride themselves on being distinguished investigative journalists, who have 
 
shed light in dark corners and forced others to reveal the truth, being unprepared to do the 
 
same for their own profession. I accept that that would require great courage but the best 
 
investigative journalists have never been short of courage.

--------
Mr.  Mulcaire  was  sentenced  in  2007  by  Gross  J.  to  6  months  imprisonment.  He  was 
 
sentenced  for  only  a  fraction  of  the  phone  hacking  that  he  had  carried  out,  although  of 
 
course the Judge didn’t know that. Over the years he made a great deal of money out of 
 
phone  hacking  for  the  News  of  the  World.  Only  a  very  small  percentage  of  that  was 
 
recovered  by  the  order  for  confiscation.  He  has  now  pleaded  guilty  to  three  further 
 
conspiracies, each relating to a single victim, and to one substantive count of hacking Milly 
 
Dowler’s phone. All of those matters could have been proved in 2007 but, for reasons which 
 
have  been  considered  by  the  Leveson  Inquiry,  they  were  not.  There  were  other 
 
opportunities when they could have been investigated between then and 2011 but again 
 
they were not.  It makes sentencing Mr. Mulcaire today extremely difficult. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

Mr. Coulson:  the appropriate starting point in your cases is two years. That is because of 
 
the quantity of phone hacking you were involved in and because you were the editor who 
 
controlled  the  investigative  methods  used  by  your  reporters.  I  have  reduced  that  to  18 
 
months to reflect the two matters of mitigation that I have identified. 
  

 
 
 
   

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Mr  Miskiw  and  Mr.  Thurlbeck:  the  appropriate  starting  point  in  your  cases  is  one  of  12 
 
months imprisonment. You were both in senior positions at the newspaper and you were 
 
both involved in phone hacking for a considerable period of time.  I reduce that by a third to 
 
reflect your pleas of guilty which have saved the country a great deal of money. I reduce 
 
that by a further two months to reflect the delay which is no fault of yours and the matters 
 
of  private  mitigation  outside  your  records  as  journalists.  The  sentence  therefore  in  each 
 
case is one of 6 months imprisonment. 
  

 
    
 
 

 
   
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Although  it  is  a  short  term  of  imprisonment,  I  am  unable  to  suspend  it  because  of  the 
 
 
seriousness and persistence of the offences and the need to deter others. You spent 105 
 
 
days on a qualifying curfew.  Half the time that you spent on a qualifying curfew will count 
 
  
towards the sentence which is 53 days. If the period is incorrect then it will be amended 
 
 
administratively by the court. 
  

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 
 

 
   

 
 
 
 

Mr.  Weatherup.  I  accept  that  you  were  less  involved.  You  returned  to  the  News  of  the 
 
World  when  phone  hacking  was  well  established  as  a  way  of  getting  stories.  You  were 
 
involved for a shorter period of time. I accept that you may have been unhappy with the 
 
situation in which you found yourself and that may explain your demotion. The appropriate 
 
 
reduce that by a third to 
starting point in your case is one of 8 months imprisonment. I 
 
     
reflect your plea  and  then  a  further  amount  to reflect the  delay  for which  you were  not 
 
 
responsible.  You  have  also  served  some  of  that  time  on  a  qualifying  curfew.  As  a 
 
consequence of those matters, the length of time that you would actually serve would be 
 
very short. In those circumstances I consider that it is appropriate, exceptionally, to suspend 
 
the  sentence  in  your  case.  The  sentence  in  your  case  will  be  4  months  imprisonment 
 
suspended for 12 months and an order to do unpaid work for 200 hours. If you commit a 
 
further offence during that period or do not do the work then you can be recalled to court 
 
 
and the sentence of imprisonment can be activated.

--------
Mr. Mulcaire:  you are the lucky one. It would in my judgment be wrong to send you back to 
 
prison today when you have already served a prison sentence, although one that was too 
 
short to reflect the full extent of  your phone hacking activities. If a full investigation had 
 
been carried  out  in  2007 then all those  matters could  have  been dealt  with  at  the  same 
 
time. It is not your fault that they were not. A prison sentence must be passed but I shall 
 
suspend it and combine it with a requirement to do unpaid work for the community. The 
 
sentence  will  be  6  months  imprisonment  suspended  for  12  months  and  you  will  do  200 
 
hours of unpaid work. There will be identical concurrent sentences on the four charges to 
 
which you have pleaded guilty.

JUDICIARY OF
ENGLAND AND WALES
In the Southwark Crown Court
R
.v-
Rolf Harris
Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Sweeney
4 July 2014
Rolf Harris you are 84 years old. You have no previous criminal convictions or cautions
recorded against you. You are no longer in the best of health. For well over 50 years you
have been a popular entertainer and television personality of international standing — with a
speciality in children's entertainment. You are also an artist of renown. You have been the
recipient of a number of honours and awards over the years. You have done many good and
charitable works and numerous people have attested to your positive good character.
But the verdicts of thejury show that in the period from 1969 to 1986 you were also a sex
offender — committing 12 offences of indecent assault on 4 victims who were variously aged
between 8 and 19 at the time. There were a number of aggravating features. You took
advantage of the trust placed in you, because of your celebrity status, to commit the
offences against three of your victims ’A' (Count 1), ’3' (Count 2) and Tonya Lee (Counts 10—
12). All your offences in relation to ’C’ (Counts 3—9) were committed in breach of the trust
that her parents had placed in you, and two of them took place in her own home. In every
case the age gap between you and your victim was a very considerable one. You clearly got
a thrill from committing the offences whilst others were present or nearby. Whilst such
others did not realise what you were doing, their presence added to the ordeal of your
victims. It is clear from the evidence that what you did has had a significant adverse effect
on each victim, and particularly so in relation to ’C’ who suffered severe psychological injury
in consequence. None of the victims had the confidence to complain at the time. Each,
including Tonya Lee, and especially ’C’, showed considerable courage in eventually coming
forward and in giving evidence.
You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you
have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.
On Count 1 you indecently assaulted ’A' in 1969 (when she was aged 8 and you were aged
39). You did so when you made an appearance at the Leigh Park Community Centre in
Havant, and she approached you for your autograph. Others were present. Taking
advantage of your celebrity status, you twice put your hand up her skirt between her legs
and touched her vagina over her clothing. In her Victim Impact Statement 'A' states, which I
--------
am sure is true, that you took her childhood innocence — for which she blamed herself and
became an angry child and teenager, unable to express herself and unable to trust men. She
continued ”I have carried what Rolf Harris did to me for most of my life, it took away my
childhood, it affected every aspect of my life from the point he assaulted me. Something
that he did to me for fun that caused me physical and mental pain for his own pleasure and
then probably forgot about as quickly as he did it, has had a catastrophic effect on me.....""
On Count 2| have no doubt that you indecently assaulted 'B’ in July 1978 (when she was
aged 16. and you were aged 48). You did so on the day that you took part in Star Games on
Jesus Green in Cambridge. You were clowning around and took advantage of the fact that
she was somewhat awestruck. Again others were present. You groped her bottom,
squeezing her left buttock a number of times. In her Victim Impact Statement, which I am
also sure is true, she says amongst other things ”...Rolf Harris took advantage of me and
made me feel ashamed. That an adult man could do what he did to me made me feel so
powerless. He treated me like a toy that he played with for his own pleasure with absolutely
no regard for what he was inflicting and then getting on with his life as if nothing had
happened....”.

’C’ and her family began living across the road from you and your family in Sydenham in the
mid 19605. She and your daughter Bindi became the very best of friends. In late 1978 when
’C’ was aged 13 and you were aged 48 you were allowed by 'C”s parents to take her on
holiday with your wife and Bindi to Canada, Hawaii and Australia. Her parents trusted you to
look after their daughter and continued to do so after the end of the holiday. I have no
doubt that you fancied ’C’ — even at that young age. I make clear that I am not sentencing
you in relation to what happened on that holiday, but I am sure, in the light of thejury's
verdicts, that ’C’ gave truthful evidence as to what occurred, and that it was the indecent
assaults that you carried out on that holiday that emboldened you to commit offences
against her in this country thereafter.

On Count 3 you indecently assaulted 'C' in the latter part of 1980 by which time she was
aged 15 and you were aged 50. You had moved to Bray, and were visiting the 'Cs' with your
wife. You committed the offence in breach of trust, and it was further aggravated by being
committed in lC""s own home. You left your wife and 'C”s parents downstairs and you went
up to ’C”s bedroom on the top floor of the house. You spat on the fingers of one hand, put
that hand down herjeans and knickers, and digitally penetrated her vagina. The episode
lasted for about a minute until she managed to get away.

On Count 4 you indecently assaulted 'C' after Xmas 1980 when she was still aged 15 and you
were aged 50. Again you were visiting the ’C""s with your wife. Again you committed the
offence in breach of trust and it was further aggravated by being committed in 'C""s own
home. You left your wife and lC""s parents downstairs whilst you went up to the TV room on
the first floor where ’C’ was. You spat on the fingers of one hand, put that hand down her
dungarees and knickers and digitally penetrated her vagina. You continued for up to a
minute until she managed to get away.

Counts 5 & 6 arose from a single incident in the period between the autumn of 1980 and
Easter 1981 when 'C' was aged 15 and you were aged 50. 'C' was visiting Bindi at Bray and
was permitted by her parents to stay— sleeping in one of two single beds in Bindi’s room.
On this occasion after Bindi had got up, and whilst she and/or your wife were in the house,
and again in breach of trust, you went into the bedroom where ’C’ was still in bed. You took
her pants down, spat on the fingers of one of your hands, and digitally penetrated her vagina
--------
(Count 5), then you took off your glasses bent down to her vagina and started licking it
(Count 6) — continuing until she closed her legs and pushed you away.

Counts 7 & 8 arose from another single incident in the same period between the autumn of
1980 and Easter 1981— and thus when 'C’ was still aged 15 and you were aged 50. Again 'C'
was visiting Bindi at Bray and was sleeping in one of the two single beds in Bindi’s room. On
this occasion, whilst Bindi was still asleep in her bed and ’C’ was in the other bed you
entered the room, again in breach of trust, pulled 'C”s pants down to her ankles, spat on the
fingers of one hand and digitally penetrated her vagina (Count 7), then you licked her vagina
again keeping an eye on Bindi (who was still asleep) as you did so (Count 8) — continuing until
’C’ closed her legs and pushed you away.

On Count 9 you indecently assaulted ’C’ in 1984 when she was aged 19 and you were aged
54. On this occasion she and her mother were visiting your wife at Bray. 'C' was using the
indoor swimming pool when you appeared in your swimming trunks and got in. Your wife
and Mrs ’C’ (who trusted you) withdrew to another part of the house whereupon you
touched ’C”s breasts and then put one of your hands down her bikini bottom and digitally
penetrated her vagina.

Whilst I do not sentence you in relation to what you did to ’C’ in the decade that followed
that offence, lam sure that offences against her continued until 1994. Indeed the point is
made on your behalf that you have not committed any further offences since then.

In her Victim Impact Statement, which lam sure is true, 'C' says, among other things, ”...The
attacks that happened have made me feel dirty, grubby and disgusting. The whole sordid
saga has traumatised me. I have panic attacks and suffer from anxiety. The effects of the
abuse have been with me for many years. I started drinking at the age of 14 to 15 years old.
This was to block out the effects of what he was doing to me. This had an effect on my
relationship with my parents and people close to me. The slightest thing would upset me, I
would get so angry, my reaction would be so disproportionate and over the top. As a young
girl I had aspirations to have a career, settle down and have a family. However, as a direct
result of his actions, this has never materialised. I have never had a meaningful relationship
whilst sober. I have also never been able to hold down a job. This was down to the need to
block out what he had done to me through drink. Rolf Harris had a hold over me that made
me a quivering wreck....He made me feel like a sexual object. He used and abused me to
such an extent that it made me feel worthless..... I suffered abuse at the hands of a person
who thought he could get away with it. He made me feel that I would not be believed and as
a result I suffered in silence. This has had a detrimental effect on my life and health
outcome...."".

I have no doubt, in view of the evidence given at trial by 'C', and by the doctors and
counsellors who treated her, that it was your crimes against her that resulted in her
becoming an alcoholic for many years with all that that entailed, and that thus (as I have
already touched on) you caused her severe psychological harm

On Count 10 you indecently assaulted Tonya Lee on 31 May 1986 — when she was aged 15
and you were aged 56. She was one of the Shopfront Theatre Group from Sydney, Australia
who were on a tour of the UK at that time. You knew the lady who was in charge of the
Group, and at her invitation had attended the Group's last performance on the tour which
was in South London. Thereafter you accompanied them to a public house called the
Queen’s Arms. It was there, in the presence of others, that you committed the offence.
--------
Taking advantage of you celebrity status you got Tonya to sit on your knee, put your hand on
her thigh under her skirt and moved it up to her vagina over her tights and knickers and
fondled her there until she managed to make an excuse and fled to the Ladies toilet.

You followed her to the vicinity of the toilet and waited outside.

Counts 11 & 12 arose from a single incident after she came out. Others, although not
present, were nearby. You got her in a forceful bear hug, put one hand down her top and
into her bra and played with one of her breasts for about 30 seconds, fondling and
squeezing it (Count 11). Then, really quickly, you moved the same hand under her skirt,
down her tights and knickers and quickly digitally penetrated her vagina (Count 12). You
then stopped and walked away.

In an email from Australia Tonya Lee writes that what you did to her was a turning point in
her life that she has never recovered from. She says, among other things, that ”...What Rolf
Harris took from me was my self belief and more so the ability to feel safe. I have never felt
safe since. I live in a constant state of anxiety"".., She goes on to describe the difficulties that
she and her children have faced since and continues ”...What Mr Harris took from me was
my very essence. I believe that it was for Mr Harris a forgettable moment but it was
something for me that l have never moved on from and will never forget...""

I proceed upon the basis, as both sides have invited me to, that (consistent with her
evidence at trial) your offences were not the sole cause of Tonya Lee’s problems

It was in the mid 19905, and after it had stopped, that 'C' then still an alcoholic, finally told
her family what you had done to her. In 1997 she confronted you and you sent that letter to
her father in the hope of avoiding or minimising the consequences. You succeeded at that
stage, but only because she was in no fit state to face making an official complaint.
However, following her brave recovery from alcoholism, and after extensive counselling and
support from her family, it was 'C”s eventual complaint in the autumn of 2012 which began
the series of events that led to your prosecution and conviction.

| apply the approach to sentencing historic sexual offences set out in Annex B of the current
Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline, and have also considered the guidance given in the
judgment of the Court of Appeal in Attorney Genera/’5 Reference (No.38 af2013)(R v Stuart
Hall) [2014] 1 Cr.App.R. (5.) 61

The maximum sentence on Count 1 is one of 5 years' imprisonment, on each of Counts 2—9 it
is one of 2 year's imprisonment, and on each of Counts 10—12 it is one of 10 years’
imprisonment.

With the exception of Counts 10 & 11 the equivalent offences today attract significantly
higher maximum sentences. For example on Count 1 the equivalent offence today is sexual
assault of a child which carries a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment and would be likely to
involve a starting point of around one year's imprisonment. On Counts 3,4,5,7,9&12 the
equivalent offence today is assault by penetration which carries a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and would be likely, to involve a starting point (given the severity of the
psychological damage to 'C') of around 8 years’ imprisonment on Counts 3,4,5,7, & 9 and a
starting point of around 4 years' imprisonment on Count 12
--------
On your behalfl am asked to take into account a number of matters in mitigation, including

the following:

(1) With the exception of ’C’ the offences were brief and opportunistic.

(2) The fact that you have no previous convictions and have led an upright life since
1994 — albeit it is accepted that that must be tempered by the reality, underlined in
the Attorney Genera/’5 Reference (above), that you got away with your offending for
years.

(3) The fact that you have a good side, that there are many people who know you who
speak well of you, and that over many years you have dedicated yourself to a
number of charitable causes.

(4) The fact that you are not in the best of health, as attested to in the report of Dr
Fertleman, and that therefore, although capable of serving a prison sentence, it will
be particularly tough on you.

(5) The fact that your wife, who you help in looking after, has various health problems,
as attested to in the report of Dr Mitchell—Fox.

(6) That you should be enabled to spend your twilight years with your family.

I have no doubt, despite your age and the other matters relied upon in mitigation on your

behalf, that given the seriousness of the offences and particularly those in relation to ’C’)

and the extent of the aggravating features that I have identified only an immediate custodial

sentence is appropriate for each. Sensibly, no argument to the contrary has been put
forward on your behalf. Some of the sentences will be consecutive — in passing them I bear

firmly in mind the principle of totality and have reduced a number of the sentences that I

would otherwise have passed accordingly.

The sentences that I impose are as follows:

Count 1: 9 months’ imprisonment.

Count 2: 6 months’ imprisonment consecutive.

Count 3: 15 months’ imprisonment consecutive

Count 4: 15 months’ imprisonment concurrent

Count 5: 15 months’ imprisonment concurrent

Count 6: 12 months imprisonment concurrent

Count 7: 15 months’ imprisonment consecutive

Count 8: 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent

Count 9: 12 months’ imprisonment consecutive

Count 10: 9 months’ imprisonment concurrent

Count 11 9 months imprisonment concurrent.

Count 12 12 months’ imprisonment consecutive

The total sentence is therefore one of 5 years and nine months’ imprisonment

Unless released earlier, you will serve half that sentence when you will be released on

licence for the remainder of the sentence. Should you breach the terms of that licence,

including by the commission of further offences, you will be liable to recall.

Your convictions mean that you are automatically subject to the notification requirements of

the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and you will also be considered under the provisions of the

Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006
--------
In my view it is not appropriate for me to make any awards of compensation. The issues
involved are too complex and the information before me insufficient for me to be able to
properly do so.

You will however pay the costs of the prosecution in such sum as may be agreed or assessed
in due course.

I order that a copy of the medical report from Dr Fertleman be provided to the Prison
Service for their information.",2014-07-04 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

1.	  Daniel Evans is to be sentenced on 4 counts. He worked as a reporter at the Sunday 
 
Mirror from 2003 to 2005 and then at the News of the World from 2005 until 2011 
 
 
when the paper closed.  He has admitted phone hacking to get stories at both 
 
newspapers. His phone hacking activities at the News of the World stopped almost 
 
entirely in August 2006 when Clive Goodman was arrested. In 2009 he did hack the 
 
phone of Kelly Hoppen which led to her taking out a civil action. In those 
 
proceedings  he made a statement  denying  hacking Kelly Hoppen’s phone. That 
 
was a lie as he has admitted. That is count 4 on the indictment. He has also pleaded 
 
guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office (count 3) by paying  a 
 
prison officer to provide information about Ian Huntley and paying a police officer 
 
for information about a celebrity. In September 2010 the New York Times revealed 
 
his phone hacking activities and he was suspended by the News of the World and 
 
remained suspended until the paper closed. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.	  These are serious offences which  merit cumulatively a significant sentence of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

imprisonment. The mitigation in this case is that Mr. Evans not only pleaded guilty to 
 
 
these offences at the first opportunity but has  assisted  the prosecution by making 
 
statements and agreeing to give evidence for the prosecution. He has already given 
 
 
evidence in the trial that has just finished and may be required to give evidence in 
 
 
future trials. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  
 

 
 
 

3.	  There are two consequences of the fact that he is a prosecution witness. Firstly he 
 
has been put forward as a witness of truth by the prosecution. That does not mean 
 
that  they accept that every word that he said in the witness box was accurate. It 
 
 
was demonstrated in the trial not to be, but it does mean that the Prosecution 
  
accept the general thrust of his account. That being the view of the prosecution, I 
   
will accept it as the factual basis on which I sentence. I would need to be sure that 
 
 
the prosecution were wrong to put him forward as a witness of truth before I 
    
sentenced on any other basis. I have not formed that view. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.	  Daniel Evans’ evidence was  that he was taught how to phone hack when working 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

for the Sunday Mirror  and was encouraged to use those skills to find stories by 
 
people who were senior to him at the Sunday Mirror and later at the News of the
--------
World. He also said that he was put under considerable pressure to come up with 
 
stories. I sentence him on that basis. 

 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
5.	  The second consequence is that , having entered into a s. 73 agreement with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 
prosecution, he is entitled to a  substantial reduction in his sentence. The amount of 
 
that reduction depends on a number of factors including the difficulty the 
 
prosecution have had in obtaining other evidence from independent witnesses. It 
 
became  clear in the trial that I have just completed, that getting people who work in 
 
newspapers to give evidence of phone hacking is extremely difficult, if not 
 
 
impossible. The undisputed  evidence in the trial was  that between 2004 and 2006, 
   
 
there was a great deal of phone hacking at the News of the World.  While I have no 
 
doubt it wasn’t done openly, it must have been known about by more people than 
 
have been prepared to give evidence about it in court. Mr. Evans and Mr. Goodman 
 
are the  only people  who have been prepared to give evidence of their knowledge 
 
 
 
and involvement in phone hacking at the News of the World. Mr. Goodman made it 
 
 
clear in his evidence that he would not have given evidence about it but for his 
 
position as a Defendant in the trial. 

 
  

  
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
6.	  Why so few people have been prepared to give evidence in court about what went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
on is not for me to say, but it makes Mr. Evans’ position unique. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
7.	  Having heard his evidence I am quite satisfied  that the only reason Mr. Evans 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
entered into a s. 73 agreement was to eliminate or reduce any penalty imposed on 
 
him. He originally wanted a complete immunity before agreeing to give evidence 
 
 
and only entered into a s. 73 agreement when it was obvious to him that he would 
 
be prosecuted and convicted. But that is why most people enter into such 
 
agreements.  He is entitled to ask for a substantial reduction in sentence having 
 
complied with the conditions of the agreement. While it is normally desirable that 
 
criminals receive the appropriate penalty for their crimes, that has to be balanced 
  
against  the cost and difficulty of proving these offences. 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
8.	  The appropriate sentences for the offences of phone hacking, counts 1 and 2 after a 

 
 
trial would have been 9 months imprisonment concurrent with each other. To 
 
reflect the plea and the s. 73 agreement I reduce those sentences to 4 months. The 
 
appropriate sentence after a trial for the offence of perverting the course of justice 
 
would be 9 months imprisonment which I again reduce to 4 months to reflect the 
 
 
plea and the s. 73 agreement. That will be consecutive to the sentences on count 1 
 
 
and 2. Finally for the offence of misconduct in a public office the sentence after a 
 
trial would have been 6 months imprisonment which I reduce to 2 months 
  
imprisonment again consecutive to reflect the plea and the s. 73 agreement. 

   
 
   
 

 
 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
9.	  That is a total of 10 months imprisonment. The issue then arises as to whether I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

   
 

 
should suspend that sentence. I have considered the case of Dougall and the case of 
 
Ford. In the case of Dougall the Court of Appeal agreed that a sentence of 12 months 
 
 
should be suspended as otherwise the benefit from the s. 73 agreement would be 
 
 
limited. In the case of Ford the Court of Appeal made it clear that the case of Dougall 
  
was not setting out an absolute rule but was fact dependent. 
  
 
10.  In the circumstances of this case and in particular the co‐operation that Mr. Evans 
 
has given and has agreed  to  give  the police and the prosecution  in the future, as 
 
compared with the lack of co‐operation from others, I do feel able to suspend the 
 
sentence for a period of 12 months. I would not have done that had Mr. Evans not 
 
made a clean breast of his involvement in these offences. There should be some 
 
element of immediate punishment and in addition I order the Defendant to do 200 
  
hours unpaid work in the community.",2014-07-24 00:00:00,UK Crown Court
2225240,R v Edwards and Edwards: Sentencing Remarks,"In the Crown Court Nottingham 

R v Christopher Edwards and Susan Edwards 

Sentencing Remarks 

1)  A great deal has been written about you in recent days.  I shall sentence you 

on the basis only of the evidence heard in this courtroom. 

2)  You have each been convicted of two offences of murder.  You have each 

pleaded guilty to Obstructing the Coroner and to Theft.    

3)  These were shocking crimes.    William and Patricia Wycherley were the 

parents of Susan Edwards.  In May of 1998 the two of you planned to shoot 

and kill them in their own home.    And that is what you did.    

  

4)  Mr Wycherley was 86, Mrs Wycherley was nearly 64.    They were living a 

quiet, reclusive life in Mansfield.  They knew no one.  They had as little 

contact as possible with other people.  You knew they wouldn’t be missed, if 

they disappeared.   And they weren’t.   

5)  At that time you, Christopher Edwards, were 41.  You, Susan Edwards, were 

39.  You were educated people.  You were living a quiet life.  Christopher 

Edwards you were in steady employment.  You had been an accounts clerk 

for the same firm for years.  Susan Edwards, you had worked as a very young
--------
woman but gave up your post in the 1980s and did not work after that.  You 

had no friends and did not enjoy meeting new people. Christopher Edwards, 

you had work colleagues but gave up socializing because your wife did not 

like it.   

6)  You were a completely self contained couple.   So far as you were concerned 

only the two of you mattered.    

 

7)  Christopher Edwards, you were interested in military history.  You also had an 

interest in and expertise in firearms, as you described during the course of 

the trial.   Susan Edwards, you had an interest in historical military heroic 

figures.  By the late 1990s you were building up debts by, you say, purchasing 

memorabilia and stamps relating to your military heroes, things you could 

not afford.   

 
8)  Susan Edwards, 30 years ago you told your husband that you had been 
sexually abused by your father when you were a little girl.   You told the 

police the same thing, and repeated it to the jury in your trial.  Because you 

are an accomplished liar and a fantasist I have hesitated before accepting 

this.  However there is evidence, wholly independent of the two of you, that 

when you were married, William Wycherley was irrationally jealous.  On 

reflection and balance therefore I accept that your father had sexually 

assaulted you when you were young.  The abuse stopped when you were 11.  

You left home in your early 20s.   That background may well explain why you 

hated him, which you did, and why you have no remorse about killing him.  

Given that you left home in the early 1980s, some 15 years before the 

murders I cannot accept that his conduct, wholly wrong as it was, explains 

your decision to kill him in 1998.   Having heard your account to the jury I do 

not accept that your mother was ever aware of what your father had done.      

9)  There was something that you held against both your parents for many years.  

When you were 21 you were left £10,000 by the second wife of your adored
--------
grandfather.   Half of it you spent on holidays for yourself and your mother.  

In 1979 the other half was used in the purchase of your parents’ home in 

Edgware.  Your name was on the deeds.  You say that your parents 

emotionally blackmailed you into signing over your interest in the house to 

them because it had been your grandfather’s wish that your mother should 

inherit.  That was in 1983 and it is plain from your interviews and from your 

evidence in the trial that you considered then and still consider that your 

parents had deprived you of what you thought was rightfully yours.    They 

sold that house at a profit, and bought a cheaper house in Mansfield.  They 

kept all of the proceeds.  You never forgave them.  Your resentment festered 

for years and at the same time you were getting yourself into debt, as I have 

described.    

10) I sentence you on the basis that each of you intended that both Mr and Mrs 
Wycherley should be shot dead.     I do not know whether you acquired the 

murder weapon in advance and brought it to their home or whether you 

planned to use a gun owned by Mr Wycherley; it doesn’t matter.   Either way 

the plan was to shoot them, to kill them and you made sure you had a gun to 

do so.   I am sure that it was you, Christopher Edwards, who held the gun.  At 

point blank range you fired two bullets into each of them with deadly 

accuracy.  15 years later when her body was examined one of those bullets 

was still lodged in the spine of Mrs Wycherley.  It must have gone through 

her aorta.  She would have died within seconds.    The evidence was that Mr 

Wycherley too would have died quickly, though not as quickly as his wife.     I 

am sure, Susan Edwards, that these killings were initially your idea and that 

your husband agreed to carry them out.   I have no doubt that you were 

acting together, you Susan Edwards encouraging Christopher Edwards at the 

scene and assisting him later in concealing the bodies to which I shall turn in a 

moment.   You are each as responsible as the other for these crimes and I see 

no reason to distinguish between you on sentence.

11) Having carried out these ruthless killings you got rid of the bodies.  I use that 
phrase deliberately. This was in no sense a burial.  There was no dignity, no 

respect.   The point of this was to cover up the killings and move onto the 

next stage of your plan.   

12) You wrapped the bodies in duvet covers, you dragged them down the stairs.  

Everyone who heard your matter of fact accounts of how you did that will 

remember them for years.   Those graphic accounts were delivered with 

remarkable detachment.   I will not repeat them.   Christopher Edwards dug 

the hole in the back garden.   As the photographs show, you folded the 

bodies and bundled them into the hole so that they were found with their 

knees bent, in the foetal position, one on top of another.  You filled the hole 

and then planted shrubs on top.   Those facts are the basis of the count of 

obstructing the coroner, to which you pleaded guilty shortly before your trial. 

13) You told the neighbours that Mr and Mrs Wycherley had gone on holiday, 

and then, in due course that they had decided to sell the house.   Susan 

Edwards concocted and sent lively and imaginative notes and Christmas cards 

to relatives to give the impression that your parents were travelling around 

Ireland where the air was good.  The relatives were completely taken in by 

your lies.   No one asked a single question.  You wrote letters to the doctor’s 

surgery when reminders came for vaccinations and the like, refusing them on 

plausible grounds. 

14) But before you began writing letters to maintain the fiction that your parents 
were still alive you had first got on with what you were really interested in – 

getting their money.   These facts formed the basis of the count of theft to 

which you also pleaded guilty before trial.    

15) As soon as the banks opened, on the Tuesday after the bank holiday, you 

were in the building society doing two things just as you had intended to do: 

opening a new account in the joint names of yourself and your dead mother,
--------
closing two accounts in the joint names of your parents, and taking every 

penny out of them, about £40,000.    You say £15,000 went to pay off a credit 

card.   What happened to the rest is unclear.  You suggested it went on 

memorabilia.  Who knows?  Either way, it went to you and Christopher 

Edwards and you spent it.   True it is that after claiming Mr Wycherley’s 

pension for some time you tried in October 1998 to cancel it, but once you 

learned that it could be paid into a bank account you made arrangements for 

that to be done.  For 15 years, the two of you took and spent over £175,000 

which was payable to Patricia and William Wycherley in private pensions, 

state pensions, industrial injuries benefits, winter fuel payments and even 

Christmas bonus payments.  Christopher Edwards was still working and Susan 

Edwards was still at home.   Thousands of pounds were spent on celebrity 

photographs, letters and so on.  Notwithstanding the pensions and the 

savings you got into more debt.  You obtained loans and credit cards in Mrs 

Wycherley’s name, and still the spending continued and you decided the 

house would be sold in 2005.  You forged the necessary documents and kept 

the proceeds of sale, just under £67,000.  Christopher Edwards you said you 

were against the house being sold because it would mean losing control of 

what you described as the burial site.  And so it would.  But your concern was 

only for the two of you, that this loss of control might lead to discovery.  No 

thought was given to the people who would buy the house or to the family 

who would live there for years, learning only in 2013 of what had gone on in 

their home and what lay in their garden.    In 2012 you fled to France when 
the DWP contacted Mr Wycherley, seeking a meeting before his 100th 

birthday.  You returned to the jurisdiction voluntarily, in 2013, with no 

money.    

 

16) Because you committed these offences so long ago I must apply the 

sentencing regime that was in force at the time.    I must not specify a 

minimum term greater than that which the Secretary of State would have 

notified at that time.   The provisions of Schedule 21 of the CJA 2003 which 

identify a number of starting points were not then in force.  The single
--------
starting point for the minimum term for murder in 1998 was identified by the 

then Lord Chief Justice as 14 years and that is the starting point that I take. 

  

17) Mr Enoch and Mr Howker have reminded me that I should have regard to the 
Practice Statements that followed in 2000 and 2002, most recently in Practice 

Statement (Crime Life Sentences) [2002] which contained three starting 

points: a normal starting point of 12, a higher starting point of 15/16 and a 

further starting point of 20 years for offences described as especially grave, 

including terrorism cases.   This is not such a case, they submit.  This is not a 

case which in 2002 would have merited a starting point of 20 years.  In 

respect of the 15/16 year starting point I note paragraph 49.19 of the 

direction (referred to in paragraph 32 of the decision of the Court of Appeal 

in R v Sullivan [2005] 1 Cr App R (s) 67,  “A substantial upward adjustment 

may be appropriate in the most serious cases….in suitable cases the result 

might even be a minimum term of 30 years”.  This chimes with the 

observations of Lord Bingham in 1997 that a punitive term of longer than 30 

years would (at that time) be very rare indeed.   

        

18)  Lord Bingham identified 8 mitigating factors, none of which is present here.   
Of the list of 11 factors requiring a sentence more severe than the norm, no 

fewer than 6 are present here: this was a planned shooting for gain of two 

victims, one of whom was in his 80s.  Once they were dead their bodies were 

dumped in a hole in the back garden to avoid discovery.  And then the 

elaborate charade began, pretending they were alive, for 15 years.   This is 

not a question of ticking boxes.  It is a question of accurately assessing the 

seriousness of these offences and your culpability for them.  I have 

considered with care all that has been urged on your behalf, Christopher 

Edwards, by Mr Enoch and on your behalf, Susan Edwards, by Mr Howker but 

the facts of this case are so serious and your culpability so high as to require 

me to move a very great deal higher than the 14 year starting point to which I 

have already referred.
--------
19) You are in your late 50s.   You are going to spend most, if not all, of the rest of 

your lives in prison.  I accept that prison has been very difficult for both of 

you.  Susan Edwards, I accept that you are particularly isolated and will 

remain so throughout your sentence.   

Christopher Edwards, Susan Edwards. 
20) The sentence I impose upon each of you is the same.  On each count of 

murder, life imprisonment with a minimum term to be served before you are 

considered for parole of 25 years.    For the offence of obstructing a coroner, 

5 years’ imprisonment.  For the offence of theft, 4 years’ imprisonment.   All 

those sentences will run concurrently.   The minimum term you will serve 

before you are considered for parole therefore is 25 years.",2014-06-23 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Newcastle Crown Court 

20 June 2014 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw 

After a long trial, the defendant Donald Graham was yesterday convicted by the jury of the 
murder of Janet Brown; he now falls to be sentenced. Having presided over the trial, I must 
set out the facts.  

Janet Brown disappeared on or about the 17 June 2005; she has never been seen since; her 
body has never been found. She was then aged 45. Her parents Eric and Olive Brown lived at 
Planetrees Farm, in the hamlet of Lowgate, near Hexham; she lived in the converted barn.  
She had had a long‐standing relationship with the defendant, although he never left his own 
wife.  

Janet Brown had no regular employment; she occasionally worked as a film extra and a 
market researcher. 

On 1 June 2005, she booked a ferry passage for herself and for the defendant to travel, with 
her car, from Dover to Calais in the early hours of June 18, returning on the 27 June; she told 
her friends that they were to go on holiday together touring in France.  

Some time later, the defendant gave back word. He said his wife was very ill; that was a 
complete lie. Janet Brown, who was highly independent, decided she would go alone. I 
do not think that he had the slightest intention of ever going on holiday; he had other plans, 
realising that her planned holiday created an opportunity of claiming that she had gone 
abroad and stayed by choice.  

I need not repeat Mr Smith’s outline of the singular financial transactions that she made 
shortly before her planned departure in June 2005 but she made various attempts to 
withdraw £300,000 from one of her accounts, telling the bank that she required the money 
to buy property; she gave no further details.  

Eventually, on June 16, she made a telegraphic transfer of some of £300,000 from one of her 
savings accounts to one of the defendant’s accounts. That transaction is also entirely 
unexplained: it is not accompanied by any documentation, the defendant repeatedly said in 
interview that that he could not say anything about it unless Janet Brown authorised him to 
do so – and of course she was by then dead.
--------
I am sure that this sum was obtained by some deceit on his part. It is at least possible that 
she may have thought that he intended to buy a property with the money. In fact, within a 
couple of months, he had spent £193,000 of the £300,000 that he had obtained from Janet 
Brown, to buy a house at 109 Elsdon Avenue, Seaton Deleval for his new girlfriend Elisabeth 
Todd, whom he met only a couple of weeks before Janet Brown’s disappearance; she has 
always claimed that she was an innocent dupe, yet another victim of his deceit and 
manipulation. If Janet Brown intended that he should buy property with the money, she 
certainly did not have in mind that he would buy a house for Elizabeth Todd to live in.  

If Janet Brown was to catch the ferry at Dover in the early hours of the 18 June, she would 
have had to leave Hexham during the early afternoon of the 17 June.  That evening, by 
arrangement, a friend went round to her house to collect her dog; Janet Brown was 
nowhere to be seen; the friend naturally assumed that she was on her way to Dover to catch 
the ferry. In fact, she never caught the ferry; indeed, she never left Hexham.  

I cannot properly infer from the evidence where, or when, or how, the defendant murdered 
Janet Brown but it is proved beyond doubt that he did so.  Nor can I say where or how he 
disposed of her body; he was once a JCB driver; he could have disposed of her in some 
deeply dug pit, or put her down one of the many mineshafts in the area or perhaps buried 
her in some wild and remote place. That he has disposed of her body is an aggravating 
factor. 

I find as the fact that this murder was committed for gain, either to obtain or to keep the 
£300,000; the seriousness of this murder is ‘particularly high’, as defined in Schedule 21 of 
the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 

Furthermore there was a clear element of planning. 

It is a curious feature that, even when Janet Brown should have come back from her holiday, 
but did not so, no one raised the alarm.  Her parents were elderly; the relationship between 
Janet and her parents was strained, although there is clear evidence that she held them in 
affection.  Somehow, the defendant managed to persuade them, by writing letters and 
cards, as if from her, that she had left England and intended to make her life abroad, 
variously in France or in Switzerland. 

There was some evidence of a telephone call on 23 July 2005; if such a call was made, which 
I doubt, it was certainly not made by Janet Brown herself, it must in some way have been 
devised and engineered by the defendant. 

He must have been astonished that her parents seemed to accept her disappearance and 
that no missing person investigation was set in train.  But, as the months and years passed, 
he must have come to believe that he had indeed got away with murder. He then turned his 
hands to other frauds and forgery. 

Even after paying out the £300,000 to which I have already referred, over £85,000 still 
remained standing to Janet Brown’s credit in her various account: over the course of the 
next few years, by forgery and fraud he cleaned out the credit balance on her two accounts 
obtaining in all over £100,000. In this way, he had taken every penny she had.

--------
Janet Brown’s parents were elderly, Olive Brown died in January 2007. Eric was mentally 
alert but was suffering from failing eyesight. The defendant became a regular visitor to his 
house.  It is obvious that in some way he managed to insinuate his way into Eric’s 
confidence, for even before Eric’s death, he had persuaded him to make some payments to 
him.  

Eric Brown died on 16 March, 2008; the defendant arranged the funeral; he did not inform 
Eric Brown’s few relatives, nor his (Eric’s) solicitor of his death.   

After his death, the defendant realised that with Janet Brown dead, and no other children to 
interfere, he could embark upon an even more audacious series of frauds.  By his genuine 
will, Eric Brown had left his estate to his daughter Janet Brown; if she predeceased him, his 
estate was to pass to the Guide Dogs for the Blind, he was no doubt sympathetic to that 
charity by reason of his own failing eyesight.  

He made Elizabeth Todd write out a forged will, purporting to have been made and signed 
by Eric Brown, leaving all Eric Brown’s property to the defendant himself. He even made her 
forge Janet Brown’s signature to give the impression that she (Janet Brown) had been a 
witness to the will by which she had been disinherited by her own father. Although the will is 
dated in May 2007, it is not possible to say when it was actually written. 

Armed with this forgery, and seemingly having access to the relevant passwords and security 
questions, he issued a series of forged cheques and withdrawal slips, he obtained £123,000 
from Eric and Olive Brown’s Nationwide account and nearly £40,000 from their NatWest 
accounts. 

He then started to make withdrawals from Eric’s account at the Skipton Building Society.  
This was his undoing, because an alert clerk realised that the signature on one of his 
withdrawal slips did not match the specimen signature in their records.  When the Society 
wrote saying that they intended to visit Mr Brown to validate his signature, the defendant 
prevaricated; he wrote a series of ever more extravagant letters, first writing as Eric Brown 
claiming that he was now aged and infirm, and later getting Elizabeth Todd to write to 
pathetic letters in the name of Janet Brown, explaining that in his now pitiful condition, a 
personal visit was simply out of the question as he was moving into residential care.  
Fortunately, the Society was not deceived by these devious and extravagant falsehoods and 
they informed the police. 

The police investigation started as an investigation into this fraud and forgery but it 
gradually developed, as the scale of the frauds and the forgeries became clear. Eventually, 
the missing person enquiry became a murder enquiry. 

Meanwhile, the defendant had even attempted to have at the farm transferred to him: he 
made a personal visit to the solicitors in Hexham, claiming that he was entitled to the farm. 
He later compelled his wife to impersonate Janet Brown over the phone; fortunately, the 
solicitors refused to proceed with the transfer without documentary validation and Janet 
Brown’s identification, which of course he could never provide. 

Page 3 of 5
--------
Over and above the original £300,000 he actually obtained £285,000 by fraud and tried to 
get more. These withdrawals were fraudulent from the outset, they were professionally 
planned and were carried out on many occasions over a long period of time: these are all 
aggravating factors as identified by the Guidelines. Furthermore, all these offences were 
made possible only by the murder.  He used the money to fund his extravagant and flashy 
lifestyle. 

As the police enquiry proceeded, the defendant persuaded Elizabeth Todd to ring the 
Overstone Care home in Hexham on the pretext of ringing one of Janet’s friends who 
worked there, the purpose of the call was for her to pretend to be Janet Brown, back home 
on a visit from Switzerland, and for this information to be passed on to the police, with view 
to deflecting or impeding the investigation into her disappearance. He was on bail at the 
time; providing false information to the police during a course an investigation into murder 
is a serious business. This was the subject of the charge of perverting the course of justice in 
count 19. 

I entirely accept that these later forgeries and withdrawals were opportunistic; he did not 
have them in mind when he murdered Janet Brown; these later offences were committed 
over and above the gain that he originally intended, and they must therefore result in some 
increase in the minimum term, otherwise, he will have committed these later offences 
without any additional penalty, which cannot be right. 

The defendant is aged 60. He has a conviction thirty years ago for making a threat to kill. I do 
not say that this is entirely irrelevant but I do not consider that after thirty years it is a 
separate aggravating factor. His other convictions are, it seems to me irrelevant.  

This murder is a murder for gain, which should normally carry a starting point of 30 years. No 
substantial mitigation has been put forward, therefore I see no reason to reduce the starting 
point. I have already said that it is an aggravating factor that he disposed of the body.  It is, 
as I have just said, a further aggravating factor that he committed these other frauds and 
forgeries after her death. 

I have anxiously considered whether I should make some reduction on account of the fact 
that the defendant will be a very old man by the time he would be eligible for release, but 
when Parliament enacted that the age of a defendant could be a mitigating circumstance, 
they surely had in mind his age at the time of sentence, not at the time of his release.  The 
defendant has been convicted of a terrible offence and he must now pay the price.  I fix the 
minimum term at 32 years; he will of course have credit for the 279 days that he has already 
spent in custody. 

I must pass determinate sentences for the other offences to which he has pleaded guilty; he 
is entitled to some credit for his pleas of guilty entered on 14 March, that was after he had 
entered pleas of not guilty back in January but seven weeks or so before the trial started on

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Spencer
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 July 2014
 
 

 

 

Fiaz Munshi, you may remain seated for the time being. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have to sentence you for your part in causing the death of two children, seventeen years 
   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ago  in  1997.  They  were  asleep  in  their  family  home  in  Oxford  when  the  house  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately set on fire shortly after 3 o’clock in the morning. There could easily have been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more deaths. Another five occupants of the house managed to escape with comparatively 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor physical injuries.  But the psychological and emotional scars of that night will remain 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with them and with every member the family for ever. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Anum was only 8 years old. Majid was only 15 years old. They were the youngest children of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the family. In their short lives they brought great joy and happiness to their parents and to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their brother and sisters. I have read in full the harrowing victim personal statements made 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by members of the family. Those moving statements reveal very clearly the depths of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sadness and desolation the family felt and still feel at the loss of these two precious much 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loved children. Those feelings are as raw now as they were 17 years ago. No sentence I can 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass will ease that pain. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Six of those involved in this wicked plan to set fire to the house were brought to justice at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time.  In  1998  five  men  were  convicted  of  murder,  one  of  them  your  boyfriend  Haq 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nawaz. In 1999 your sister Riaz was, like you, convicted of manslaughter. She was sentenced 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
to  12  years  imprisonment.  That  sentence  was  upheld  by  the  Court  of  Appeal,  which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described  it  as  manslaughter  of  a  particularly  serious  and  horrifying  type.  The  Court  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeal concluded that though a severe sentence, it was fully justified. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By the time those six defendants were arrested and charged in December 1997 you had left 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the country and travelled to Pakistan. You remained there for several years, making a new 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  for  yourself  with  a  husband  and  children.  In  2004  you  returned  to  this  country  living 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

openly in Sheffield and then in Oldham. It was only in October 2013 that you were finally 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested and brought to justice. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

The jury acquitted you of murder but convicted you of manslaughter. These are nevertheless 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very serious offences which must attract a very substantial sentence. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You and your sister travelled that night from Letchworth to Oxford in a car driven by your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boyfriend Haq Nawaz. You were only too willing to make that long journey late at night in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to seek out and fight with one of the Khan/Akhtar sisters with whom you had already 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had two serious physical confrontations in Oxford. But there was another more sinister plan, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of which I am quite sure you were well aware, a plan to set fire to the family home. Two 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

young  men,  Liedl  and  Swanton,  had  been  recruited  specifically  to  carry  out  the  act  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starting that fire. They were travelling in the other car, driven by your boyfriend’s brother, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed Nawaz.  I reject entirely, as I am sure the jury must have done, your assertion in 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that you never noticed these two young men that night. Had you noticed them, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and had you truly been ignorant of the plan, you would have been bound to ask why they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were there. You knew perfectly well why they were there. That is why you never asked. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am quite sure as well that it was you who bore the greatest grudge towards the family. You 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been in love with the eldest son of the family Amjad Ali Khan. It had been a deeply close 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and emotional relationship. When he was arrested for dealing in Class A drugs and sent to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison, the family blamed you and your sister, and your sister’s boyfriend Haroon Sharif, for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bad  influence  they  believed  you  had  exercised  over  Amjad.  You  resented  that.  Your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resentment  increased  when  the  family  tried  to  stop  you  seeing  Amjad  in  prison.  Your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resentment grew to anger and spilt over in two unseemly episodes of violence, one at your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home, the other in Oxford city centre in broad daylight. I am quite sure, having heard all the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
evidence, that you were particularly aggressive in both those episodes, whatever the role 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

played by others. 
 

 

 

 

Your  resentment  and  anger  grew  even  more  when,  as  a  result  of  the  second  of  these 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incidents,  you  and  your  sister  were  ordered  out  of  your  family  home  in  Oxford  by  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother, and had to go to live in a women’s refuge in Stevenage. You and your sister began a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

campaign of harassment of the family, making nuisance phone calls at all hours of the day 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and night. The billing proves that such calls were made on your sister’s phone. I accept the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence the jury heard from members of the family that on occasions there were calls in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  voices  of  two  girls  could  be  heard.  I  am  quite  sure  that  it  was  this  simmering 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resentment and anger towards the family which was the motivation for the fire that night. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the light of my directions in the summing up as to what had to be proved, the jury by their 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdicts must have been sure that there was a plan to set fire to the house while the family 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were at home asleep, and sure that you were a party to the plan or at least knew of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan. The jury must also have been sure that you deliberately encouraged others involved in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plan to carry it out. I am quite sure on all the evidence that your encouragement took 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two of the three forms alleged by the prosecution. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, I am sure that by your presence in the car travelling to Oxford you intended to and did 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encourage others to go through with the plan. Secondly, I am also sure on all the evidence 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when the cars arrived in Oxford they drove in convoy along Magdalen Road so that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house could be pointed out to Liedl and Swanton who were going to set fire to it. I am quite 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that you played a part in pointing out the house. You knew that house all too well. You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore played an important part in the execution of the plan. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  am  also  sure  on  the  evidence  of  Sunder  Khutan  and  Sarah  Moon  that  you  were  in  an 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely  aggressive mood  that night,  fired  up  for  a  physical  confrontation  with  Shahnaz 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Akhtar and, by inference, for revenge on the family. That was in contrast with your sister 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Riaz, who seemed much more reluctant. The evidence is that you were egging her on. You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must have known that the only reason there was such a long delay in Oxford until 3 o’clock 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the morning was to ensure that the lights in the house were out and the family in bed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the fire was set. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
By their verdicts the jury must have been sure that you intended or foresaw some physical 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm to the family as a result of the fire, albeit not death or really serious injury. You can 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been in no doubt, however, just how dangerous it was to start any fire in a house when 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occupants were asleep. 
  

 

 

 

 

I  am  quite  sure  on  the  evidence  that  you  knew  full  well  straightaway  that  night  that  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house had been set on fire. You lied to the police five days later in making a false witness 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  denying  that  you  had  been  in  Oxford  that  night.  That  was  a  serious  criminal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offence in itself. You and your boyfriend Haq and your sister Riaz all put forward the same 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false alibi. Far from distancing yourself from your boyfriend, whom you now knew to be a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

killer, you chose to remain with him for the next four weeks. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I bear in mind your counsel’s submissions that you were by now in an abusive relationship 
   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with Haq on top of the abuse you had suffered at the hands of your brothers. I accept that 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours had been troubled teenage years, with family pressure to conform to traditions and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customs alien to the life you wanted to lead.  You had tried to take your own life when you 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were only 14 because you were so unhappy. But what stopped you coming clean with the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police, as Sarah Moon did, was the fact that you knew you had been part of the plan to set 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fire to the house. You knew you were guilty. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then on 23rd September 1997 you were arrested and interviewed as a suspect. You told the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police the same lies. I am sure you realised by now that the heat was on and I am sure that it 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was for that reason, in part at least, that you moved to Sheffield. When the police pestered 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you in Sheffield, trying to break down your alibi and persuade you to become a witness, you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must have realised that it was only a matter of time before you would be arrested again 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the truth finally came out. That was always likely to happen. It took the courage of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sunder Khutan in the end to come forward and tell the police what had happened in Oxford 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that night. 
 

 

 

There was no restriction on your leaving the country when you did. You were not on bail. It 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is true that your father was seriously ill in Pakistan. However, I have no doubt that it was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than coincidence that you left this country when you did and I have no doubt that your 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive for doing so was not purely to look after your father.  Your counsel accepted in the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course of her submissions that it probably was no coincidence, but she submitted that it was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
at  the  prompting  of  your  brothers  that  you  left  when  you  did.  Just  two  days  after  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departure  your  sister,  your  boyfriend  and  the  other  defendants  were  all  arrested  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged. Had you remained in the United Kingdom you too would have been arrested and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged and tried along with the others in 1998. By 2004 you thought it was safe to return 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this country. You did not expect to be brought to justice. But justice has a long reach and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a long memory. 
 
  

 

 

Your sister Riaz was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for manslaughter. The judge, Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Jowitt,  told  her  that  sentences  of  up  to  15  years  imprisonment  are  passed  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manslaughter by arson when there has been a plea of not guilty. That was in 1999. Later 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions of the Court of Appeal have confirmed this to be the appropriate level of sentence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for manslaughter by arson: see, for example, R v Jones [2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 19, and R v 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mahmood [2012] 2 Cr App R (S) 63. If the whole case had been tried now, rather than in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1997, it may even be that the level of sentence would have been somewhat higher, in the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light of R v Appleby [2010] 2 Cr App R (S) 46. But I shall not go above the starting point of 15 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years identified by Mr Justice Jowitt. To that extent the delay has, if anything, worked to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your advantage. 
 

 

 

  

In the case of your sister Riaz Mr Justice Jowitt passed a somewhat lesser sentence than 15 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years because he thought it possible that she was to some extent talked into participating by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others. He was satisfied that she had played an important part in the offence because it was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her telephone that was being used to relay messages between those in the two cars and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Haroon Sharif, who was watching to see whether the lights were still on in the house. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For the reasons I have already explained, you too played an important role in the offence 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  am  quite  satisfied,  in  addition,  that  unlike  your  sister  you  were  not  talked  into 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participating in the plan by others. You were very much up for it and needed no persuading 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all. You were 4 years younger than your sister, but you were nearly 22 years old and a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mature intelligent and articulate young woman, who had  been aspiring to a career in the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police force and had embarked on training as a paralegal. Despite the submissions of your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel,  in  my  judgment  your  culpability  was  greater  than  your  sister’s,  and  the  starting 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point for your sentence must be somewhat higher than the sentence passed on your sister

You  have  shown  no  genuine  remorse  whatsoever,  either  at  the  time,  or  when  you  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested last year, or during the course of the trial. The way in which you gave evidence, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  in  which  the  trial  was  conducted  on  your  behalf,  with  all  manner  of  serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations  against  members  of  the  family,  only  added  to  the  distress  of  the  family.  Your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence will not be longer on that account, because as a matter of principle that would be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  But  it  does  mean  that  you  can  pray  in  aid  no  mitigation  of  any  admission  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility and no mitigation of any profession of remorse now. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In your favour I take into account that you have no previous convictions. As I have already 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, at the time of these offences you were only 21 years of age. But you were by no 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  the  youngest  of  those  involved.  All  those  convicted  of  murder,  except  Haq,  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

younger than you. You are now 38 years old. You have made a new life for yourself. You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have four children whom you have not seen since you were arrested in October last year. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For understandable reasons the view was taken that it was better for the time being that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your children did not know that you were in prison and why you were there. Your children 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are further victims of your own serious criminal conduct. But you must have known in your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heart of hearts, when you married and had children, that there might eventually be a day of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckoning resulting in a long prison sentence. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have considered carefully the extent to which the 17 year delay should impact upon the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence you receive. For the reasons already explained, I am quite sure that part of your 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivation in leaving the country when you did was the expectation that if you remained 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would be arrested again. Your  evidence to the jury was that your father told you he 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would return with you to the United Kingdom in due course. He died in February 1998. You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not return. You were not married until 2001.  I am prepared to accept that you were 
 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under pressure from your husband and your own family not to return to this country.  You 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they must have known that if you returned to the United Kingdom before the trial of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your sister and the other defendants, or soon after their trials were over, you were likely to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be arrested and charged as well. In the result you have enjoyed years of freedom and family 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life that you should never then have had. The day of reckoning has now arrived. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You should have been arrested 7 or 8 years earlier than you were in fact arrested. That was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the result of a highly regrettable error on the part of the police in 2005, when an e‐mail from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  police  force  was  missed.  That  email  gave  information  that  you  were  back  in  this

the context of my finding that, albeit no doubt with the encouragement of your family, you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had deliberately absented yourself in Pakistan in the first place. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You have four children, now aged 12, 11, 6 and 4.  You are a good mother. That is evident 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  testimonials  and  medical  reports  I  have  read.  The  eldest  two  children  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  health  problems,  which  are  well  documented  in  the  papers  before  me.  Your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

husband has also been in poor health, suffering a heart attack two years ago. I bear all these

children, particularly knowing that the elder children have these additional health problems. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The sentence will be hard for your children and hard for your family looking after them. I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  taken  into  account  the  article  8  rights  of  your  children,  and  of  yourself  and  your

impose  appropriate  punishment,  I  am  satisfied  that  it  is  proportionate  to  impose  the

starting point in your case would have been 14 years. I reduce that by one year on account

Because the offence was committed in 1997, your sentence will be governed by the previous

Lady Justice Rafferty: 
 

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

On 4 August 2000 at the Central Criminal Court Thomas Kingston (56) and Thomas 
 
 
Reynolds  (53)  were  convicted  of  conspiracy  to  supply  amphetamine.  Terence 
O'Connell  (57)  was  convicted  of  doing  an  act  tending  and  intended  to  pervert  the 
 
course of justice. On the same day Kingston and Reynolds were sentenced to three 
 
and a half years imprisonment and O’Connell to two years imprisonment. 

The  case  has  been  referred  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  by  the  Criminal  Cases  Review 
Commission (”CCRC”) on the basis of fresh evidence as to Neil Putnam, the principal 
witness for the Crown. Their trial was said by the trial judge to begin and end with 
him, presented as disgraced, corrupt and dishonest. Post-trial Putnam claimed to have 
 
told the police of a corrupt relationship between Detective Sergeant Davidson and an 
individual  near  the  centre  of  the  McPherson  Enquiry  into  the  death  of  Stephen 
Lawrence and that his, Putnam’s, account of that aspect was suppressed.  

All three Appellants denied wrongdoing. They, like convicted police officers Clark, 
Drury,  and  Putnam,  are  former  members  of  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service  South 
East Regional Crime squad (“SERCS”).  

The facts led by the Crown to prove the case against the Appellants. 

On 7 July 1995 Kingston and O’Connell with Putnam and others raided the Clapham 
address  of  James  Jones.  A  holdall  found  in  the  kitchen  had  held  six  packages  of 
amphetamine.  

Jones  told  the  jury  the  drugs  were  delivered  in  a  large  white  plastic  bag,  each 
kilogram said to be worth £3,750.  Jones wrote “6 x 3750” on a piece of paper, took 
the  white  plastic  bag  into  the  kitchen  and  emptied  it  on  the  floor.  There  were  six 
packages. His son alerted him to the police outside. Jones said he put two packages in 
a black holdall, leaving two on the floor and two in a blue plastic bag. He threw all the 
drugs into a cupboard and opened the door. 

Officers  took  him  into  the  living  room  where  he  remained  during  a  search.  Jones 
heard a call that drugs had been found. He was taken into the kitchen where were two 
officers  and  the  empty  white  bag.  His  best  recollection  was  of  two  packets  in  the 
 
holdall, two on the floor and two in the blue bag.  Once back in the living room, he 
 
did not return to the kitchen. It was common ground that the drugs could only have 
been stolen after he had been shown the packages in the kitchen.  

Putnam told the jury that after an arrest outside he went inside to find Jones in the 
living room. Putnam went upstairs to deal with Jones’s son and heard a shout that they 
had  “got  the  gear”.  Downstairs  he  tapped  on  the  closed  kitchen  door.  Inside  were 
 
Kingston  and  O’Connell.  Kingston  put  two  parcels  in  a  carrier  bag  and  gave  it  to

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

Putnam, asking, “Will you run with the bag?” telling him to take the drugs to “T.R.” 
(Reynolds) and Putnam did.  

Kingston admitted to the jury that he was in the kitchen with O’Connell, the drugs in 
a black holdall. He claimed he had not counted the packages until back at the police 
station. He said that after Jones had been shown the drugs, with Kingston he stayed in 
the  living  room  which  gave  Putnam  the  chance  to  steal  them.  He  accepted  that  his 
statement was silent as to his move to the living room. Reynolds denied having met 
Putnam that day or later. O’Connell denied knowing how many packages the holdall 
held until he returned to the police station. 

Putnam denied having stolen the drugs and having falsely implicated others so as to 
improve his standing with the police and further to reduce his sentence.  

After  allegations  in  1998  by  convicted  drug  dealer  Evelyn  Fleckney  of  SERCS 
corruption  the  Metropolitan  Police  Criminal  Investigation  Branch,  CIB3,  (“CIB3”) 
searched  Putnam’s  house  under  the  direction  of  DCS  Yates.  Putnam  knew  he  was 
 
considered on the fringe of corrupt activities and he was suspended. On 13th July 1998 
he  admitted  to  DCS  Yates  his  involvement  in  two  acts  of  corruption  with  SERCS 
 
officers  including  Clark  and  Drury.  CIB3  officers  removed  him  to  a  police  station 
 
where he was questioned with the knowledge of his solicitor. He stayed there until 
October 1998 and disclosed his part in other offences further implicating Clark and 
 
Drury and, for the first time, the Appellants. He accepted that his first aim had been to 
 
implicate  only  Clark  and  Drury  whom  he  considered  more  fully  involved  in  the 
corruption at SERCS. 

His  second  allegation,  that  he,  Kingston,  Reynolds,  Clark,  Drury  and  another  had 
stolen cash during the search of a house of a suspected fraudster, was not proceeded 
with. 

In October 1998 Putnam pleaded guilty to 16 offences committed between 1991 and 
1997. As well as substantive offences he admitted perjury on six or so occasions to 
bolster weak cases. 

After his evidence for the Crown in the trial of Clark and Drury he was sentenced to 3 
years 11 months imprisonment. Their appeals were dismissed on 11th April 2001 but a 
 
CCRC referral in 2009 led to a re-trial on four counts, none of which depended solely 
on the evidence of Putnam. They were acquitted after the Crown offered no evidence 
 
due to the unwillingness of a witness to give evidence.  

By the time Putnam gave evidence at the trial of the Appellants he had been released 
on licence. Their first appeal in April 2011 was joined to that of Clark and Drury. One 
Ground  was  that  after  the  trial  of  the  Appellants  another  corrupt  police  officer, 
Hanrahan, alleged that during a search 54 foreign bonds with a high face value were 
 
shown as seized. Later civil proceedings against the Metropolitan Police alleged that

there had been 92. Hanrahan claimed he had been told that Putnam had been involved 
in attempts to cash them. Putnam denied it.  

The Appellants in 2011 argued that they would have asked Putnam about this: they 
suggested  he  might  have  admitted  it,  showing  his  capacity  to  behave  dishonestly 
during a search, or denied it, potentially further undermining his credibility. 

The  Court  of  Appeal,  whilst  acknowledging  the  possible  relevance  of  the  material, 
noted that it was common ground that Putnam was disgraced, dishonest and corrupt. 
Even admitted theft of the bonds would have added nothing significant to his discredit 
and the matter would have made no difference to the verdicts.

Panorama 2006 

 
17.	 

 
18.	 

On  26th  July  2006  in  a  Panorama  programme  “The  boys  who  killed  Stephen 
Lawrence” Putnam alleged that in 1998 he told the CIB3 under the command of DCS 
Yates about DS Davidson a former SERCS officer confessing in 1994 to a corrupt 
relationship  with  Clifford  Norris,  father  of  the  suspect  David  Norris,  at  the  1993 
ineffectual Lawrence investigation. Putnam said the officers who debriefed him said 
 
that  what  he  had  to  say  would  “blow  the  Met  wide  apart”  and  they  withheld  this 
tranche of the information he offered.  

On 12th October 2011 Putnam repeated the Panorama allegations in a voir dire at the 
 
re-trial of Clark and Drury. Mark Ellison QC for the Crown called Graeme McLagan, 
a journalist who had interviewed Putnam in 2000 for another Panorama programme 
 
“Bent  Coppers”.  McLagan  confirmed  that  Putnam  did  not  raise  a  link  between 
Davidson  and  Clifford  Norris  or  claim  to  have  told  CIB3  officers  of  it  in  1998. 
McLagan told the court he would have pursued the topic vigorously. Mr Ellison made 
plain  that  Putnam  could  not  be  relied  upon  as  a  witness  of  truth  in  any  future 
  
proceedings. 

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (“IPCC”) 
 

 
19.	 

The IPCC investigated Putnam’s 2006 Panorama allegations. In September 2006 he 
repeated  them.  In  2007  the  IPCC  found  no  evidence  to  substantiate  his  claims.  Its 
review of its investigation found no new evidence or information to cast doubt on its 
2007 conclusions.

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

“The detail of Neil Putnam’s debriefing John Davidson in 1998 

The records that survive from Neil Putnam’s debriefing in 1998 
show  that  he  provided  potential  evidence  of  John  Davidson’s 
corrupt  activity  in  the  South  East  Regional  Crime  Squad 
(SERCS).  This  alleged  activity  began  shortly  after  John 
Davidson arrived at SERCS from the Stephen Lawrence murder 
investigation in the early summer of 1994.  It included: 

(i)  	 Recycling  drugs  and  stolen  property,  often  seized  as  a  result  of 
informant  information,  back  to  the  informant  for  them  to  sell  for  the 
 
shared benefit of the informant and officers; 
 

(ii) 	 A history of corrupt relationships with one or two such informants that 
 
had  gone  back  years.  This  explained  why  he  had  ‘hit  the  ground 
running’ at SERCS in terms of acting corruptly.  It also suggested that 
 
he had been involved in corrupt activity including with informants both 
before and immediately after he had worked on the Stephen Lawrence 
 
murder investigation; and 

(iii) Involving Neil Putnam and other officers in the squad in collaborating in 
 

corrupt activity. 

Whilst  we  do  not  have  the  original  intelligence  available  in 
1998 to CIB3, we do have the recollection of John Yates, who 
was in effective day-to-day command of the debriefing process 
of Neil Putnam.  Mr Yates told us about the response that he 
got after asking the intelligence section of CIB3 what they knew 
about John Davidson in 1998: 

“…he  had  been  the  subject  of  intelligence  work  for 
years  as  I  understood  it…from  recollection  without 
doubt  somebody  that  they  have  been  wanting  to  find 
something about for a while.” 

Findings 

In our view, both the intelligence picture suggesting that John 
Davidson  was  a  corrupt  officer  and  the  content  of  Neil 
Putnam’s debriefing relating to Mr Davidson should have been 
revealed to the Chairman of the Inquiry. 

Anybody  who  was  focused  on  the  vexed  issue  of  the  motives 
behind John Davidson’s involvement in the deficient Lawrence 
investigation, and who knew that the source of the “new line of 
enquiry” concerning Mr Davidson was a self-confessed fellow 
corrupt  officer,  should  have  recognised  the  potential  for  Mr 
Davidson  to  have  confided  in  that  officer  as  to  his  true 
motivation  in  the  Lawrence  case.    It  is  a  source  of  some
--------

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

concern to us that nobody in the MPS who was aware of the 
detail  of  what  Neil  Putnam  was  saying  about  Mr  Davidson 
appears  to  have  thought  to  ask  him  about  Mr  Davidson’s 
motives in the Lawrence case. 

The absence of contemporaneous records showing exactly what 
level  of  information  from  Neil  Putnam’s  debriefing  regarding 
John Davidson was passed up the chain of command makes it 
difficult to identify where any personal criticism is merited….   

The alleged confession by John Davidson to Neil Putnam that 
he  had  a  corrupt  relationship  with  Clifford  Norris  when  he 
 
worked on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation 

After the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry had reported, and after he 
 
had  been  released  from  prison  in  2000,  Neil  Putnam  alleged 
that in the summer of 1994, John Davidson had admitted to him 
that  he  had  a  corrupt  connection  with  Clifford  Norris  at  the 
time that he worked on the Stephen Lawrence investigation. 

Mr Putnam also alleged that he had told his debriefers about 
 
this  in  July  1998.  They  responded  by  saying  that  it  “would 
blow the MPS wide apart” but that they would speak to senior 
officers  about  it.  He  had  assumed  someone  would  come  and 
see him about it, and thought that what he had said had been 
noted.  However, no one did come to see him. 

In  our  report  we  have  set  out  in  detail  the  substantial 
arguments  that  we  believe  exist  on  either  side  as  to  the 
credibility of Mr Putnam’s allegation.  We have also explained 
the reasons why we have found them to be sufficiently balanced 
to leave us unable to resolve the issue with the powers we have. 

Findings 

We believe that there are substantial arguments on either side 
of the issue of whether John Davidson admitted to Neil Putnam 
that he was in a corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris at the 
time  that  he  worked  on  the  Stephen  Lawrence  murder 
investigation. 

 

This is, for us, an unresolved issue…. 

Independent  corroboration  of  Neil  Putnam’s  allegation  does 
 
not currently exist, so far as we are aware.  However, there do 
remain  some  outstanding  lines  of  enquiry  identified  in  the 
 
1999-2000  intelligence  reports  which  could  be  investigated, 
which,  were  they  to  amount  to  evidence  capable  of  providing 
independent support, may change that assessment….”

The CCRC 

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

 
21.	 

 
22.	 

Putnam’s  post-trial  allegations  have  persuaded  the  CCRC  that  there  is  a  real 
possibility this court will not uphold the Appellants’ convictions, substantial doubts 
being  raised  as  to  his  credibility  and  reliability,  though  it  acknowledged  that  those 
were in issue and the subject of substantial attack at the trial and at the appeal.  

Nevertheless  the  CCRC  considered  it  a  real  possibility  we  could  be  persuaded 
Putnam’s  post-trial  allegations  add  substantially  to  the  information  previously 
available  and  are  very  different  in  nature  from  matters  known  at  the  trial  and  the 
appeal.  Those  latter  are  said  to  have  gone  to  offences  in  which  he  had  admitted 
involvement, his lies so as to protect himself and other officers, admitted perjury to 
bolster weak cases and his failure to admit involvement in theft of bonds, such failure 
at a time when he claimed to be telling the unvarnished truth.  

23.	  We  reminded ourselves that in 2001 another constitution of this court noted: 

 

 

“At  trial  Putnam  admitted  having  originally  lied  about  [the 
drugs  theft  at  Clapham]  when  he  first  mentioned  it  to  the 
police, trying to minimise what had happened. However he said 
that  he  had  now  told  the  unvarnished  truth.  He  also  admitted 
having  given  perjured  evidence  in  other  matters  in  the  past 
(though  nothing  to  do  with  police  corruption):  “noble  cause” 
 
lying as he called it, on six or seven occasions……….Even if 
 
he had admitted corrupt involvement in the seizure of the bonds 
(which we consider most unlikely) it would have added nothing 
significant to his discredit” 

By contrast, the CCRC considers his post-trial allegations go to a high profile murder 
 
enquiry and have the potential to destabilise the MPS. It considers that he has made 
 
these  allegations  repeatedly  in  great  circumstantial  detail  over  five  years,  in  formal 
 
interviews with the IPCC and under oath in the 2011 voir dire.  

His allegations about Davidson and Clifford Norris post-date his avowed conversion 
to Christianity. The CCRC, noting that, and that the Crown in the Clark and Drury 
2010  appeal  and  2011  retrial  distanced  itself  from  his  allegations  and  from  him, 
suggested that it would not necessarily be inconsistent for the Crown to concede that 
his evidence could not be relied upon for the future whilst maintaining that that of the 
 
past was capable of belief. That said, it concedes that the only evidence he could be 
 
expected in future to give would go to the same subject matter as that he had already 
given.

The Appellants’ developed arguments. 

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

 
26.	 

The Appellants submit that a major issue at their 2000 trial, and at the earlier trial of 
Clark and Drury, was whether the evidence of Putnam, in 1998 detained in legally 
uncertain conditions without being charged with offences to which he confessed, most 
of his interviews not recorded, should have been admitted. 

 
27.	 

Their convictions they claim are unsafe because one of the following three statements 
is correct:  

“1. Putnam invented this allegation post-2000 (the Appellants 
do not concede that this is correct) and is a clever, calculated, 
detailed and persuasive liar, no longer regarded by the Crown 
as a truthful witness. He has lied determinedly from 2006. The 
Crown’s  view  set  out  by  Mr  Ellison  QC  [rejecting  him  as  a 
witness  of  truth  in  futuro]  is  fatal  to  the  safety  of  these 
convictions. 

2. Putnam made the allegation truthfully in 1998 but the police 
suppressed it, critical as it was to the defence at the 2000 trial;  

3.  Putnam  made  the  allegation  untruthfully  in  1998  but  the 
police suppressed it, critical as it was to the defence at the 2000 
trial.” 

 
28.	 

The argument is that had the Putnam allegations against Davidson been known (a) the 
trial judge would or might well have excluded the evidence of Putnam under s78 (1) 
 
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or as an abuse of the process of the court; (b) 
the jury would or might well have acquitted the Appellants or (c) the Court of Appeal 
in 2001 would or might well have allowed their appeals.     

 

29.	  Mr  Alun  Jones  QC  for  the  Appellants  relied  on  what  he  described  as  a  deliberate 
 
decision by the police not to record all that Putnam and for that matter Fleckley said 
 
when debriefed. In 2001 this court concluded in the appeals of Clark and Drury and of 
the  Appellants  that  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Act  (“PACE”)    Codes  had  been 
breached but that the effect was not fatal.  

 

30.	  Mr Jones posed the rhetorical question: What if during the Appellants’ trial counsel 
had asked Putnam about Davidson and Putnam had said “He told me of the Lawrence 
 
corruption”? That, he argued, would have meant the end of the trial since the police 
 
would certainly have said Putnam was lying about it. There would then have been no 
prospect of a jury convicting. 

 

 
31. 

Putnam has said that he divulged all the 1998 information only after DCS Yates and 
his team told him he could get 18 years if he failed to plead guilty and that he must
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

disclose  all  he  knew.  Mr  Jones  characterised  this  as  the  Yates  bluff-calling  or  the 
Yates threats.  

 

32.	  Whatever the appropriate epithet, we note that the issue was before the jury which at 
the  Appellants’  trial  heard  DCS  Yates  say  he  had  to  “cleanse”  Putnam.  Mr  Jones 
argued  that  the  jury  would  have  been  impressed  to  hear  that  Putnam,  under  these 
pressures, told officers something which, had it not been suppressed, would “blow the 
MPS apart”. There was he suggested a deliberate and cynical decision not to record 
the debrief and interviews. 

 

 
33.	 

That decision is said to go to the third of Mr Jones’s propositions, that Putnam was 
untruthful but the police suppressed what he told them. Putnam he argued was sure to 
have been under considerable stress and fearful of being ejected from the system he 
could have expected would protect him. The importance of this aspect was said to be 
that  it  may  suggest  other  allegations  including  those  against  the  Appellants  were 
untruthful but made as a consequence of the Yates threats. 

34.	  Mr Ellison QC was invited by the CCRC to comment on Putnam as a witness of truth. 
 

 

He wrote: 

“It had been recognised by the Crown at the trial of Clark and 
Drury  and  the  jury  had  been  directed,  that  Putnam  and 
Fleckney  were  each  deeply  flawed  witnesses  whose  evidence 
the  jury  could  not  act  on  unless  it  were  corroborated  from  a 
wholly independent source. It was the Crown’s case that each 
was independent of the other - “the sterile corridor”- and on a 
number of counts it was evidence from the other that was relied 
on as the independent corroborative source. As we prepared for 
 
the  hearing  of  the  CCRC  Reference  of  Clark  and  Drury’s 
convictions  to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  Putnam’s  position  as  a 
 
potential Crown witness had to be reviewed. My recollection is 
that at some stage I was informed he would not agree to give 
evidence  again  having  become  disillusioned  with  the  way  he

35.	  Mr Jones submitted that since Mr Ellison QC could not determine whether Putnam or 
CIB3  were  truthful  the  three  propositions  for  which  he  argued  are  supported.  He 
urged  us  to  hear  Putnam  and  decide  for  ourselves  whether  he  were  or  remains

confused. If we concluded that he was or is, this appeal would fall away. If we found 
him devious and capable of detailed falsehoods then we should be obliged to conclude 
that the jury in 2000 would have been likely to have acquitted the appellants.  

 

36.	  Were we to allow this appeal, the Crown would not seek a retrial since, we were told, 
 
Putnam has fallen out with the police. Mr Jones sounded the warning note that there is 
 
no evidence that Putnam is an unwilling witness. 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

 
39.	 

 
40.	 

The police have throughout maintained that they recorded and disclosed all Putnam 
said in 1998. Mr Jones submitted that insufficient had been disclosed to him to permit 
 
him  fully  to  advance  argument  on  what  passed  between  parties.  We  invited  him  to 
identify what it was which he complained was not disclosed and, assuming he were 
correct, the consequences. He told us it is impossible to say since there are no tapes. 
No-one,  he  suggested,  can  have  confidence  in  the  regime  of  disclosure,  and  he 
reminded  us  that  Clark  and  Drury  were  successful  on  that  basis,  substantial  non-
disclosure going to Fleckney’s credibility. 

The Crown’s position is that at the Appellants’ trial it was entitled to regard Putnam 
as  a  witness  of  truth.  He  had  made  self-incriminating  statements,  and  had  pleaded 
guilty to and been punished for a number of offences, of some of which without him 
the police would have been unaware. 

The issue in the Appellants’ trial was narrow. The evidence relating to what Putnam 
 
did or did not say in 1998 is confusing and unclear: he did say Davidson was corrupt 
and  it  was  known  at  the  time  that  Davidson  had  been  involved  in  the  Stephen 
Lawrence investigation. Nothing supports Putnam’s claim that he told police in 1998 
that Davidson had acted corruptly in the Lawrence investigation. Even at its highest, 
his  allegation  of  a  corrupt  link  between  Davidson  and  Clifford  Norris  is  unspecific 
and vague. 

 

The jury, asked to consider this, would have seen it as a collateral matter impossible 
 
of resolution and a distraction from the narrow issue, which, it should be remembered, 
was  whether  the  Crown  could  prove  that  the  Appellants  stole  two  one  kilogram 
packets  of  drugs  at  the  home  of  James  Jones.  Nothing  which  has  arisen  since  the 
 
Appellants were convicted bears on their guilt. This Court cannot resolve the factual 
issue of whether Putnam did tell the police of a corrupt link between Davidson and 
Clifford  Norris.  Whether  Putnam  can  now be  regarded  as  a  witness  of  truth  would 
only arise were the Crown to seek to call him at any re-trial of the Appellants. Since 
he is no longer willing to co-operate there can be no retrial. 

 

 

 
41.	 

The Crown relied upon what it described as the thorough work of the IPCC which 
accepted that Putnam was not being truthful but argued that adding this knowledge to 
what  the  jury  in  any  event  knew  of  him  and  of  the  facts  does  not  compromise  the 
safety of these convictions.

Discussion and conclusion. 

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

 

42.	  Mr Ellison QC told the court at the appeal prosecuted by the Appellants and during 
 
the argument advanced by Clark and Drury on abuse of process that Putnam was not 
to be regarded as a witness of truth. We are not persuaded that those comments can be 
translated  into  a  concession  that  Clarke,  Drury,  and  the  Appellants  are  not  guilty. 
They  are  no  more  than  a  distillation  of  the  Crown’s  conclusion  that  in  the 
circumstances it was undesirable to call Putnam. He was known to be at loggerheads 
with the police over, inter alia, his pension, and it is best described as a pragmatic 
decision expressed in abbreviated terms. 

 
43.	 

 
44.	 

 
45.	 

Attention  to  the  unfolding  events  of  July  1998  pays  dividends.  Putnam  was  being 
debriefed. The McPherson Enquiry was in train. On 16th July Davidson was recalled 
to it to enlarge upon earlier answers about his registering of an informant since it had 
become  clear  that  there  was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  he  had  done  so. 
Consequently, even as Putnam was disclosing what he knew, Davidson’s status, his 
 
escutcheons already blemished, was in the public domain. 

On  29th  July  Putnam  said  Davidson’s  account  to  Macpherson  was  correct. 
Consequently, at a point when Davidson’s position was already under review Putnam 
was  providing  information  about  and  plainly  had  his  mind  upon  Davidson  and,  far 
 
from impugning him, supported his account.  

All those to whom Putnam claimed to have explained the Davidson corruption have 
denied that he did so. The suggested auditors include CIB3, whose task was after all 
to root out corruption and whom Putnam in July 1998 thought “straight”.  His account 
to interviewing officers must have been passed upward to senior officers. If Putnam’s 
present stance is based on truth, then his 1998 account of Davidson’s corrupt activities 
means those senior officers must have reached a joint conclusion to remain silent as to 
it. 

 

 
46.	 

Arguably  yet  more  damaging  and  more  probative  is  the  evidence  of  Graham 
McLagan. Putnam claimed to have told him in 2000 of Davidson’s corrupt behaviour. 
The transcript of McLagan’s interview records him asking Putnam ""Why did you not 
tell me about it?""  

 

47.	  Were one to track a course through what Putnam would if called now say and put at 
its side the position in 1998, the diptyches are: Putnam did tell police in 1998 that 
Davidson was corrupt: Davidson was corrupt. Putnam told his story when he thought 
Davidson’s name was in the news: in July 1998 Davidson’s name was in the news.  

 

48.	  What Putnam had to say about what each corrupt end of the bargain, Davidson and 
Clifford Norris, had done for the other varied. It is unnecessary to set out the detail. 
Quite what Putnam asserts Davidson did for Clifford Norris has never been clear. This 
is  the  more  interesting  set  against  Putnam’s  remarkable  memory.  A  review  of  his
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Kingston, Reynolds and O’Connell 

evidence and of his dialogue with McLagan reveals a man who, once the “On” switch 
has  been  pressed,  can  begin  construct  and  conclude  an  account  of  detail  and  of 
consistency.  The  Davidson/Clifford  Norris  link  on  the  other  hand  at  the  very  least 
lacks that clarity and precision and could be described as confused. If his account to 
date provides the foundation for any evidence he could give to this court, one might 
expect it would be similarly vague. 

 
49.	 

 
50.	 

Additionally,  since  Putnam  would  say  his  evidence  in  2000  at  the  Appellants’  trial 
was the truth and nothing in the interim suggests he has resiled from that, revisiting 
the facts upon which the Crown relied pays dividends once again.  

It was common ground that the drugs were stolen. The question was, by whom? By 
Putnam  with  another,  or  by  Kingston  with  the  connivance  of  O’Connell  so  that 
Reynolds could sell them on with Putnam playing his part for a cut, or by Putnam 
acting alone? 
  

 

51.	  We wonder why, if the last, he volunteered the information to the police at all. By 
definition  without  him  they  would  not  have  known  of  it.  Kingston  O’Connell  and 
Reynolds were never going to tell them. They told the jury that had they known what 
 
Putnam was doing – stealing the drugs - they would have reported him. 
  

 
52.	 

 
53.	 

A  moment’s  reflection  reveals  that  were  they  telling  the  truth  Putnam  took  an 
extraordinary risk by stealing under their noses. He could not have known, were he 
acting alone, that the Appellants would later say they had not counted the packs. Had 
they said they had counted six he would have been hopelessly exposed.  

The net effect of the evidence upon which the Crown could rely – a surveillance log, a 
 
record  of  seizure  at  the  scene,  the  intelligence  triggering  the  operation  -  tended  to 
confirm the evidence of Putnam and of Jones that in the kitchen the drugs were on the 
floor in different bags. The case for the Appellants was the drugs were and remained 
in a black holdall. 

 

54.	  We considered the likely position were a notional jury to hear Putnam cross-examined 
 
upon what he had or had not said, in 1998 or at any point, about Davidson and the 
 
extent of the latter’s Macpherson enquiry misconduct. It would doubtless have been 
grist to the defence mill but what would be its practical impact? If Putnam claimed to 
 
have  spoken  of  it,  would  the  Crown  have  sought  to  rebut  its  own  witness  on  a 
collateral issue? Would the approach of the court have mirrored that taken by another 
 
constitution  of  this  court  in  2001  when  the  issue  of  non-disclosure  as  to  the  bonds 
allegedly stolen by Putnam arose? In its view that matter would not have affected the 
 
safety  of  the  conviction.  We  are  confident  that  the  trial  of  the  Appellants  a  like 
approach would prevail.  

 

55.  We are also confident that the route to a conclusion upon this appeal is simple and 
simply expressed. Putnam was from start to finish advanced as thoroughly corrupt and

dishonest,  and  as  admitting  six  offences  of  perjury.  His  Panorama  stance  would  be 
seen as the seventh, and nothing more. 

 
56.	 

He was at the time of the Appellants’ trial known to be devious, a skilled liar, out to 
advance his own position where he thought he could, and capable of prodigious feats 
of recall. The addition to that opprobrium of one allegation against Davidson, once 
 
explored, would not in the scheme of things have been of the significance necessary 
to cast doubt upon the safety of their convictions.

following that meeting that Shaun Carter drove the Yaris with Kemo Porter and Cairo Parker

arranged  for  him  to  make  his  separate  way  to  Wood  Hill  in  the  Yaris  so  that  he  (Tristan

Mullings, Jackson Powell, Cairo Parker and Akeem Jeffers. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cairo Parker was recruited because he, as a resident of Wood Hill knew or thought he knew 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where Abdul Hakim lived and so it was that he was called forward by Tristan Richards to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point out the house. 
  

 

 

 

 

The  horror  of  what  then  happened  is  all  too  apparent.  The  quantity  of  petrol  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pouring of petrol through the letter box provide the evidence the plan was that the house 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to be consumed by fire, a fire  which took  hold instantly and spread upstairs.  The 
 

     

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrified  Shehnila  Taufiq,  her  daughter  Zainab  and  her  sons  Mohammed  Bilal  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohammed Jamal tried to escape but there was and could not have been any escape from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that ferocious fire.  A small, but moving detail in the evidence was the account of the next 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

door neighbour who heard over a period of 10/15 seconds what she described as “panicky 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noises” crying and words such as ‘help’ from the children’s bedroom. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the house had been Abdul Hakim’s house and he with members of his family had been 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, these  would have been atrocious crimes and the  belief  he was responsible for the

--------
murder of Antoin Akpom would in no way have mitigated the offending. Indeed the taking 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the defendants of the law into their own hands should properly be regarded, and will be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarded, as an aggravating factor in each case. Other aggravating factors are that there was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  degree  of  premeditation  and  planning,  there  was  the  use  of  petrol  as  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accelerant and this was group offending. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

That the victims were the wholly innocent and worthy Mrs Taufiq and her three children, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who on any view were forces for good in the community, makes the offending even more 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heinous. 
  

Doctor Taufiq, whose dignified presence throughout the trial has been remarkable, said: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“I am sure any husband and parent thinks and speaks fondly of their spouse and offspring 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I say this with complete conviction, these four people were extra‐ordinary people.  They 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a strong concern for the welfare of others even before their own comfort.  They had 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

devoted  their  lives  to  a  dream  to  give  to  others.  To  serve  others  –  the  needy,  the  less 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileged,  the misguided.  It hurts me  from the core of my soul that these four amazing 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

human beings whom I had the honour of being directly related to have been cheated of their 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural life.  This fire has stolen everything from me” 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He told in the most moving of terms of his loss, its effect upon him and of his dedication to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete, in their memory, the family goal of setting up a community centre in Dublin. He 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too is a victim of what he described as “a heartless, malicious act”. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

While Tristan Richards has no convictions which aggravate his offending, he was clearly a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Class A drug dealer but there is no evidence that these events were linked to the drug trade 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or to a Post Code gang dispute. Even so, on the evidence I am satisfied that Tristan Richards 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a reputation as someone who was not to be crossed. In reaching that conclusion, I have 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not been influenced by the evidence of some of the defendants to the effect that he has a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
reputation  as  one  who  stabs  and  shoots  people  and  burns  houses  down.  There  is  no 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence whatsoever to support those allegations but I am sure he is someone who is feared 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for other reasons. The credible evidence of Aaron Webb was that he was not the sort of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  you  can  talk  to.  I  observe  that  Tristan  Richards  yet  again  made  his  partner  give 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perjured evidence in support of his defence case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have no doubt that it was his decision to use petrol to attack the house and that his target 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout was Abdul Hakim. 
  

 

 

 

 

A feature of this case is that the defendants, with the exception of Tristan Richards, acted 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of character. 
 

 

 

Kemo Porter, now aged 19 years was described by a character witness as “polite, quiet and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very unselfish”. He had learnt how to mentor young people, to help them make something 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their lives. I accept that assessment of him and the assessment of a member of his church 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  was  reserved,  well‐mannered  and  very  helpful  when  in  church.  I  consider  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reprimand  in  2010  can  be  ignored  and  he  can  be  treated  as  a  person  of  previous  good 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character. 
 

Nathaniel Mullings is 19 years old; I consider his conviction in 2009, when he was 14 years 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old can also be ignored and he too can be treated as a person of previous good character. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cairo Parker is now 17 years old but was only 16 years old in September 2103. Like Jackson 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Powell, Aaron Webb and Akeem Jeffers he has no convictions, cautions or reprimands. All 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be treated as persons of previous good character. In the cases of Jackson Powell and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aaron Webb, both 20 years old and Akeem Jeffers who is 21 years old there is the evidence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered by the jury of their positive good character and in the case of Aaron Webb, four 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further references which confirm the assessment that he acted out of character. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Cairo Parker’s case, I have read and considered four statements from witnesses whose 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions are that his offending  was also out of character. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
In each of their cases, I shall treat their previous good character as a mitigating factor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
While  Shaun  Carter  was  convicted  in  May  2013  of  possession  of  cannabis  with  intent  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
supply, in my judgment, it has no relevance to issues of his culpability and  his reprimand in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
2002 for theft of a bicycle can be ignored. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I  accept  that  each  defendant  was  very  upset  at  the  death  of  Antoin  Akpom  whom  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individually regarded as a friend. Their participation, and that of Kemo Porter is explained, in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  judgment,  not  only  by  their  upset  but  also  by  the  reactions  of  the  many  who  met 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together in the hours following his death to share their grief.  He was undoubtedly a very 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

popular man. But while this may explain the behaviour of the defendants, it cannot excuse 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
it. 

 

 
While  Tristan  Richards  is  a  calculating  man,  I  have  no  doubt  the  other  defendants  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
carried away by their own grief and by the reactions of others and that this explains why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
they  were  influenced  to  act  out  of  character.  In  that  regard,  their  ages  are  a  relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
consideration. 

  

 
TRISTAN RICHARDS & KEMO PORTER 

 

 

 

 

 
You were parties to the plan to set the house of Abdul Hakim on fire in the belief that he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
there and with the intention of killing him. You, Tristan Richard, were the ring leader. I have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
no doubt that yours was the dominant role.  You acquired the petrol and you led the other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
defendants to the house. 

 

 

 

 
Kemo Porter, although you acted under the influence of Tristan Richards, you knew full well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
what  the  consequences  of  your  actions  would  be.  You  had  opportunities  to  dissociate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
yourself from the plan but you did not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6
--------
The sentence in both your cases must reflect both the number of deaths and also that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
setting of fire to a person’s home with the intention of causing death is peculiarly horrifying,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
because the victims will inevitably suffer real agony.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The sentences in your cases, having regard to the facts of the offending and the aggravating
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and mitigating factors I have identified are as follows:
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The sentences in your case Tristan Richards are concurrent sentences of Life Imprisonment.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The minimum term you will serve before the Parole Board will consider your release is 35

The sentences in your case Kemo Porter, having regard to your age, to the evidence of your
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
good  character  and  the  fact  that  you  acted  under  the  influence  of  Tristan  Richards  are
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
concurrent  sentences  of  Custody  for  Life.  The  minimum  term  you  will  serve  before  the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Parole Board will consider your release is 25 years.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
In  the  cases  of  each  of  the  remaining  defendants,  I  have  considered  whether  there  is
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
evidence that any presents a danger to the public. I have concluded there is none and so
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
there will be determinate custodial sentences in each case.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Each of you was party to a premeditated plan to set fire to the house, an unlawful act which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
any sensible  person would inevitably realise must subject someone to at least the  risk of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
some  physical  harm.  Each  of  you  ‐ and  this  observation  applies  with  equal  force  to  Cairo

believed Abdul Hakim or his family were there, you were not to know whether others may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
be there. The attack was carried out at night when the house would be expected to be in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
darkness and no steps were taken to ensure the house was empty.

satisfied you were recruited because the others thought you knew where Abdul Hakim lived

As you answered no questions and did not give evidence, I look to other evidence for an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessment of your maturity, observing that one of your character references describes you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  ‘young  for  your  age’  and  another  –  albeit  in  a  footballing  context  ‐ as  ‘a  very  mature 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

young person who knew when to draw the line’. After considering the detailed chronology 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the events and your part in them, I am satisfied not only that you knew full well what the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan was but also of your importance to its implementation by reason of the fact that you

Sentencing remarks of the Hon Mr Justice Walker 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Christian DARKO, you have been found guilty of the murder of Rose Doughty. Your 
 
 
 
only defence to that charge was an assertion of a mental disorder giving rise to 
 
diminished responsibility. That defence has been rejected by the jury. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Rose Doughty had turned 72 on 22 November last year. She was described by one 
 
of her children as a lovely woman, who was kind hearted and would speak her mind. 
 
 
Everything that I have heard in this case bears that out. 
  
 
Rose Doughty lived in the flat above you, and showed you nothing but kindness. Yet 
 
on 23 November last year you brutally murdered her, using a knife to stab her in the 
 
 
 
neck and abdomen, and then applying pressure to her neck so as effectively to 
 
strangle her. There were at least 3 separate actions of the knife. You did all that in 
 
 
order to steal £30 from her. 
  
 
How did that come about? You wanted money from her. There was no good reason 
 
for you to have needed money. You were receiving weekly benefits. However, as was 
 
your habit, you squandered much of your benefit on lottery tickets. On 22 November 
 
you told Rose Doughty that you had no money for electricity. She came to your aid 
 
with tea and a flask. She let you use her phone. But that was not enough for you. 
 
Previously she had lent you money and your promises of repayment had either been 
 
unfulfilled or took a long time to be fulfilled. She was not going to lend you money 
 
willingly again. By the morning of 23 November you had made a decision. Your 
 
decision was that you would take a knife from your flat, and threaten her with it in 
 
 
her flat, in order to get money from her. That decision did not cause you to kill Rose 
 
 
Doughty. It was only later, and in circumstances that I shall describe, that you 
 
formed a murderous intent. 
 
 
That morning you repeatedly went to Rose Doughty’s flat door. You were planning 
 
to get money from her. In accordance with the decision I have described, you
--------
planned to threaten her, and for that purpose you were carrying an orange bag 
 
containing the knife. We know from the CCTV that your initial trips were 
 
unsuccessful. She did not answer your knocks and you went back to your flat. It does 
 
 
not matter why. You were allowed in on your fourth attempt at 10 minutes past 10 
 
that morning. We know that you spent a minute and a half there, came out with the 
 
bag, and went into your flat. Within a minute you had left your flat, leaving the bag 
 
behind, and had gone into Rose Doughty’s flat again, this time walking straight in 
 
without knocking. Just under half an hour later you came out, locked the door 
 
behind you, and pushed the keys through the letterbox. By that time, perhaps not 
 
 
long after 10 past 10, perhaps later, you had found that Rose Doughty was made of 
 
 
sterner stuff than you expected. She had no intention of giving money to a 41 year 
 
old man with a knife. You then killed her brutally in the way that I have described. 
 
She was still in pyjamas and a dressing gown. You dragged her body to one side to 
 
get it out of the way, and you took £30 from her purse. 
  
 
Then you tried to cover your tracks. You washed the knife and you washed your 
 
clothes. You went to the supermarket, made some purchases including an electricity 
 
top up, and used it to get your electricity back on. You then went to another 
 
neighbour’s flat with a view to pretending you’d been there all along. At this point I 
   
 
accept that you started to have feelings of concern about what you had done – 
 
concern for yourself rather than for Rose Doughty. You told your neighbour you 
 
were in trouble. Any feelings of concern, however, did not stop you from pretending 
 
to be anxious to help Rose Doughty’s granddaughter when it must have been 
 
obvious to you that she had found her grandmother’s body. It was not until the 
 
following afternoon that you told Dr Jafari something close to the truth about what 
 
you had done. 
  
 
Rose Doughty’s physical and mental suffering must have been substantial. Death 
 
brought an end to her suffering, but not that of her family and friends. In their 
 
dignified impact statement her family have described the terrible anguish and sense 
 
 
of loss arising from her death. They, like all right‐thinking members of the public, are 
 
 
shocked by the brutal murder of their mother and nana. It has had a devastating 
 
impact on their lives. I hope that this trial and its outcome, along with the fact that 
 
you have now on several occasions expressed your remorse, may enable them to 
 
achieve a degree of closure. 
  
 
Everything that could possibly be said on your behalf has been said by your counsel. 
 
I take full account of it, and I take account of all the psychiatric and psychological 
 
 
reports that I have seen. 
 
 
Parliament has said that the sentence for murder must be life imprisonment. It has 
  
 
 
also said that I must determine a minimum term, and that if, as here, a murder is 
 
done for gain, then the appropriate starting point for the minimum term is 30 years. 
  
The circumstances in which you took a knife to the scene and used it are such that 
  
 
 
even if this murder had not been committed for gain, there would have been a 
 
starting point of 25 years. Accordingly your use of a knife is a matter which I consider 
 
   
can properly be regarded as encompassed in my starting point of 30 years.
--------
The three separate stabs and the application of pressure to the neck are such as 
 
inevitably show an intention to kill at that time. That is not an aggravating factor 
 
under the statute. If there had been an absence of intention to kill that would have 
 
been a mitigating factor, but that is not the case here. As to premeditation, 
 
Parliament has said that its presence is an aggravating factor and its absence is a 
 
mitigating factor. I shall turn to mitigating factors shortly. I must consider the extent 
 
to which premeditation on your part aggravates the seriousness of what you did. In 
 
 
that regard, there was premeditation in deciding to use the knife as a threat. I do not 
 
 
think it warrants an increase in the minimum term. 
  
 
There is, however, a significant aggravating factor. You killed a vulnerable person, a 
 
woman in her seventies who was alone in her home. I consider that this increases 
 
the seriousness of what you did, and I will reflect that when deciding on the 
 
 
minimum term. 
  
 
I turn to mitigating factors. You have no previous convictions. That is of little weight 
 
 
in a murder of this gravity, but I allow for it none the less. Your counsel has 
 
 
submitted that the evidence suggests a mental disorder or disability which, although 
 
 
not sufficient for diminished responsibility, nevertheless lowered your culpability. I 
   
accept that the evidence shows that all was not well with you, and that you were 
 
socially inadequate. That was a factor in your planned decision to threaten with a 
 
knife. But when it came to the crucial decision, what to do when your first plan 
 
failed, I do not consider that your social difficulties played any part. Nothing in those 
 
 
difficulties prevented you from abandoning your plan. Nothing in those difficulties 
 
caused the brutal attack which you carried out. There was no lowered culpability in 
 
this respect. 
  
 
Importantly, however, when you went beyond threatening Rose Doughty and did 
 
the things which killed her, those things were not pre‐planned and were not 
 
premeditated. Parliament has said that I must regard that as a mitigating factor and I 
   
give effect to that when arriving at my decision on the minimum term. I also give 
 
some credit for the remorse that you have shown. Moreover, while it would not be 
 
 
right to treat you as someone who has pleaded guilty to murder, it is right to give 
 
you substantial credit for your acceptance from a relatively early stage that the 
 
elements of murder were made out and that your only defence was diminished 
 
responsibility. 
  
 
You are entitled to credit for the days you have already spent in prison on remand: 
 
the formal order of the court will take account of this. The statutory victim surcharge 
 
provisions apply. So do the statutory provisions which automatically bar you from 
 
engaging in regulated activity with vulnerable adults and with children. Accordingly 
 
the Disclosure and Barring Service will include you in the barred lists. 
 
 
When I come to the minimum that you will serve I make it plain that I am not 
 
ordering that you are to be released at the end of it. That will be a matter for the 
 
 
Parole Board. Only when the minimum term has been served, will the Board be 
 
entitled for the first time to decide whether it is safe to release you. If the board
--------
does release you then you will remain on licence and liable to recall for the rest of 
 
your life. 
  
 
The sentence for murder is, as it must be, imprisonment for life.

Judgment: Costs (1)
 
 

 

 

Introduction 
 

 

 

1.	  On 4 February 2013, following the failure of dismissal and abuse of process 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications made on his behalf, Mr Huhne pleaded guilty to an offence of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  an  act  tending  and  intended  to  pervert  the  course  of  justice.  On  7 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

March 2013, at the conclusion of her re‐trial, Miss Pryce was convicted of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  offence.  On  11  March  2013  each  was  sentenced  to  eight  months’ 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment. 
 

 

2.	  On 22 April 2013 I heard submissions in connection with an application by the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution,  made  under  the  provisions  of  s.18(1)  of  the  Prosecution  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Offences  Act  1985,  for  a  costs  order  against  Mr  Huhne  in  the  sum  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£108,541.15  (which  included  £31,000  in  relation  to  Operation  Solar)  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against Miss Pryce in the sum of £48,695.56. In addition, an order was sought 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against each in relation to the sentencing hearing and to the costs hearing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself (amounting in total, subject to apportionment, of £1950). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  Neither defendant objected in principle to the making of a costs order against 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  However,  various  objections  were  made  on  behalf  of  Mr  Huhne  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
aspects of the sums sought against him. In particular, it was asserted on his 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behalf that no order should be made in respect of the Operation Solar costs. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.	  Operation Solar arose in this way. At the outset of the case, which began in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

February  2012,  the  prosecution  had  relied,  as  against  Mr  Huhne,  on  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of Constance Briscoe. Ms Briscoe had made a witness statement in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

May  2011  in  which  she  related  a  conversation  with  Ms  Pryce  which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incriminated Mr Huhne. In August 2012 Ms Briscoe made a second witness 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement in which she stated, amongst other things, that she had not told 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Mail  on  Sunday  about  Ms  Pryce  and/or  others  taking  points  for  Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Huhne. 
 

5.	  During  the  course  of  a  pre‐trial  hearing  on  1  October  2012  I  granted  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application, made on behalf of Mr Huhne and supported by the prosecution, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a witness summons against Associated Newspapers Limited requiring it to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produce any material in its possession which resulted from contact with Ms 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briscoe,  or  anyone  on  her  behalf  where  Ms  Briscoe  was  the  source.  The 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material produced in consequence clearly showed that Ms Briscoe had been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intimately  involved  with  The  Mail  on  Sunday  and  the  publication  of  Ms 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pryce’s account. 
 

 

 

6.	  In  the  result,  the  prosecution  abandoned  reliance  upon  Ms  Briscoe  as  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness  of  truth  and  Operation  Solar  was  commenced  to  investigate  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

genesis of the claims made by Ms Pryce and Ms Briscoe against Mr Huhne. In 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence the making of the dismissal and abuse of process applications 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  behalf  of  Mr  Huhne  was  delayed  until  Operation  Solar  had  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completed.  During  the  course  of  the  abuse  of  process  application  reliance 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was placed, on Mr Huhne’s behalf, on both the product from, and the alleged 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failings of, Operation Solar. 
 

 

 

 

 

7.	  Ms Briscoe was first arrested in October 2012. Although she had not  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged at the time of the costs hearing in this case, a prosecution was begun 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against her thereafter. 
 

 

 

 

8.	  This  short  judgment  which,  given  the  dispute  about  the  Operation  Solar 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs,  necessarily  has  to  deal  with  Ms  Briscoe’s  conduct,  has  thus  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delayed by the need to avoid the risk of prejudice in the proceedings brought 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
against Ms Briscoe. Those proceedings have now been completed. Ms Briscoe 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  convicted,  after  a  retrial,  of  three  offences  of  doing  acts  tending  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  pervert  the  course  of  justice.  The  first  offence  related  to  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness statement made in August 2012, the others to subsequent conduct. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On 2 May 2014 she was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment.

are  summarised  in  paragraphs  3  –  27  &  32  of  my  judgment  entitled 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Contempt and  Associated Issues” dated  5 July  2013. For  the  avoidance  of

relation to that judgment has now lapsed. 
 
   
which included the following:

a  witness  statement  in  which,  amongst  other  things,  she 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produced the copy agreement and asserted that, in relation to

2011;  and  that  Ms  Briscoe  was  not  the  late  2010  source,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  abandoned  their  application  in  relation  to  Ms  Briscoe 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during  a  hearing  before  HH  Judge  Hayward‐Smith  QC  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crown Court at Chelmsford. 
 

 

 

 

(6)	  The application in relation to Pryce was, however, continued and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resulted, that same day, in the judge making a Production Order 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in her regard. However, on 10 September 2012, Reynolds Porter 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chamberlain  LLP  wrote  to  the  CPS  indicating  that  ANL  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searched all of its available records and had found no material 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falling within the terms of the Order. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(7)	  The following day Huhne’s solicitors made a written application 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a witness summons the effect of which was, as then drafted, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  require  ANL  to  produce  any  material  which  resulted  from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact with Ms Briscoe (or anyone on her behalf when she was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  original  source)  and  contained  reference  to  the  speeding 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation,  the  police  investigation,  any  suggested/proposed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

publication of an article and any payments made. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(8)	  There was a short hearing at the Central Criminal Court on 14 
 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

September  2012,  of  which  a  transcript  has  been  obtained.  A 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timetable  was  set  for  the  hearing  of  the  application  on  20 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

September 2012. 
 

 

(9)	  At the  hearing on  20 September  2012,  of  which  there is also  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transcript,  I adjourned  the  application  until  1  October  2012 to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enable the papers to be served on Ms Briscoe.

--------
(10) The transcript of the hearing on 1 October 2012 shows, inter alia, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that:‐

        

(i) Counsel for Mr Huhne and the prosecution argued in favour of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  granting  the  application.  Counsel  for  ANL  opposed  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application. 
 

         

(ii) I granted the application, as amended during argument, gave 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief reasons for doing so, and reserved my full reasons which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were delivered in the relevant judgment dated 9 October 2012. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(11)  ANL provided material in relation to Ms Briscoe, some of which 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was redacted with my approval. The material was provided both 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  those  defending  Huhne  and  to  the  Prosecution,  and  both 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before and after 3 October 2012 (with the final documents being 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided on 15 October 2012). 
 

 

 

 

 

(12)	  On 3 October 2012, the Prosecution made clear in open court 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  no  longer  proposed  to  rely  upon  Ms  Briscoe  as  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness of truth, and thereafter indicated (in part ex parte) that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a further investigation would take place, in particular, as to the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

genesis of Pryce’s claim that she had been coerced into taking 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr  Huhne’s  points.  On  that  same  date  I  granted  a  witness 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summons against ANL in relation to documents in its possession 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating to Pryce. 
 

 

 

(13)  The reason for the Prosecution’s stance in relation to Ms Briscoe 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was that, on the face of it, the material provided by ANL showed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, contrary to her August 2012 witness statement, Ms Briscoe 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a source of The Mail on Sunday. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(14)  In the result, the investigation was only finally completed shortly 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the eventual trial date in 2013.  At an early stage of the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation  Ms  Briscoe  was  arrested  and  was  thereafter 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interviewed  at  length.  The  investigation  led,  amongst  other 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, to the uncovering of Mr Alderson as another source of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Mail on Sunday in relation to the Pryce & Huhne affair, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6
--------
to the discovery of telephone numbers related to Mr Alderson 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and ANL journalists. 
 

 

 

(15)	  As indicated above, I heard argument in relation to the alleged 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contempt  during  two  hearings  in  January  2013,  prior  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventual  trial,  because  I  understood  that  it  was  said  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary to determine the issue in order for the trial to be able 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to proceed.  In the event, it became clear that that was not the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and that the best course would be to decide the issue after 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial. In the meanwhile the CPS and police undertook not to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  disclosed  material  for  any  purpose  other  than  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings against Pryce and Huhne.” 
 

 

 

 

 

14. It is thus clear that: 
 

 

 

 

   

(1)	  At the outset Ms Briscoe was strongly relied upon by the prosecution as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being an important witness against Mr Huhne. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2)	  As  the  principal  aspect  of  her  evidence  that  was  relied  upon  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearsay,  the  prosecution  were  under  a  duty  to  investigate  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliability. 
 

(3)	  That duty had not been fully complied with by the time of the dismissal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

/ hearsay application hearing on 27 July 2012. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4)	  The prosecution’s attempts to fully comply with it thereafter were not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful either. 
 

 

 
(5)	 

It  was  not  until  the  success  of  the  application  made  on  behalf  of  Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Huhne on 1 October 2012 that the reality began fully to emerge and Ms 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briscoe was abandoned as a witness of truth by the prosecution. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(6)	  Operation Solar uncovered further evidence of criminal conduct by Ms 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briscoe. 
 

(7)	  The material which emerged from the combination of the success of Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Huhne’s  application  and  Operation  Solar  together  formed  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foundation of a substantial part of the prosecution and conviction of Ms 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briscoe. 
 

 

7
--------
(8)	  The reality, confirmed by her conviction, is that whilst purporting to be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  witness  of  truth  Ms  Briscoe  was,  in  fact,  perverting  the  course  of 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice. 
 

15.  Section 18(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1975 provides that: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

“…the court may make such order as to the costs to be paid by the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused to the prosecution as it considers just and reasonable.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Arguments 
 

 

 

16.  The  prosecution  underlined  that,  despite  his  many  protestations  to  the 
 

  
contrary,  Mr  Huhne  must  have  known  all  along  that  he  was  guilty.  It  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted that he was liable to pay all the just and reasonable costs incurred 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the prosecution in his case – applying the proper approach to apportioning 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs when there is more than one defendant in accordance with R v Fresha 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bakeries Limited [2003] 1 Cr. App. R. (S.) 44. The constituent elements of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sum  sought  (itself  representing  a  considerable  reduction  on  the  sum 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

originally claimed in correspondence) were set out in documents put before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17.  In addition, by reliance on Balshaw [2009] 2 Cr. App. R. 6, the prosecution 
 

the court. 
 
  
sought  the  police  investigation  costs  of  Operation  Solar.  It  was  submitted 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the investigation had been the product of Mr Huhne’s pretence that he 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not  guilty. The costs, if ordered, would be paid by the CPS to the police 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it was proper to order them because the Operation was required for the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of ensuring that the trial was fair and was therefore an integral part 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  trial  process  in  this  case  and  could  thus  be  distinguished  from  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  investigation  costs  of  the  overall  investigation  (Operation  Nigella) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for which no application for costs was made. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

18.  On Mr Huhne’s behalf it was submitted that he was not liable to pay any of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the investigation costs occasioned during Operation Solar. It was submitted, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inter  alia,  that  following  the  revelation  of  the  material  from  The  Mail  on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sunday on 1 October 2012 it was obvious (and should have been before) that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  police  were  under  a  duty  (whatever  the  position  of  Mr  Huhne)  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigate  Ms  Briscoe’s  likely  criminal  conduct,  and  that  the  investigation 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------
had  confirmed  that,  far  from  being  a  witness  of  truth,  Ms  Briscoe  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perverted the course of justice. No doubt today it would be pointed out, as I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have indicated above, that the product of Operation Solar played a significant 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19.  Considerable issue was also taken on Mr Huhne’s behalf with aspects of the 
 

part in the prosecution and conviction of Ms Briscoe. 
 
  
sums otherwise sought by the prosecution. It was submitted, inter alia, that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the basis upon which prosecuting counsel had been remunerated (a mixture 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 

                         

VHCC  and  Graduated  Fee)  had  resulted  in  costs  that  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable. It was submitted that a reasonable figure for prosecution costs 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Mr Huhne’s case was £25,000 – which would reflect pre‐charge costs, costs 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post  charge  up  until  27  July,  costs  relating  to  the  dismissal  and  abuse  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process applications and a generous amount more than that.  Questions were 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  raised,  for  example,  as  to  the  number  of  hours  claimed  (without  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed schedule) by the caseworker (who, with the CPS lawyer Mr Barclay, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formed the CPS team that had worked on the case throughout). 
 
 

20. On Miss Pryce’s behalf the just and reasonable test was underlined. It was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out  that  in  previous  correspondence  the  sum  claimed  had  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£38,473.85,  but  that  that  had  been  increased  after  the  prosecution  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided (as to which there was no complaint) that all pre‐charge costs should 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  equally  apportioned.  I  was  asked  to  bear  in  mind  the  totality  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expenses  which  Miss  Pryce  had  already  had  to  incur  –  particularly  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incurred as a result of the way in which Mr Huhne had conducted his abuse 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of process application, and as a result of her re‐trial. I was also asked to bear 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in mind her age. 
 

 

 

 

 

Conclusion 
 

21. I have presided over this case throughout almost all the proceedings.  Whilst 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Mr  Huhne  falsely  pretended  over  a  long  period,  until  his  eventual  plea  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty,  that  he  was  innocent  (including  the  assertion  in  his  Defence  Case 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statement that he could state unequivocally that he had never asked anyone 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to accept responsibility for a speeding offence) I am not persuaded, in all the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, that it would be just and reasonable to order him to pay any 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9
--------
of the investigation costs in relation to Operation Solar.  On the other hand, I 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have no hesitation in rejecting the submission made on his behalf that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable figure of costs in his case is £25,000.  Having considered at length 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the materials put forward in support of the prosecution application, I have 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  (rounding  down  somewhat  the  sum  sought)  that  the  just  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable costs that Mr Huhne should pay is the sum of £76,000 plus £1750 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reflect a fair apportionment of the prosecution costs incurred in relation to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sentencing and costs hearings.  The total costs order in Mr Huhne’s case 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22. I  have  equally  considered  with  care  all  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of 
 

is therefore one of £77,750. 
 
   
Miss  Pryce.  There  is  clearly  no  need  to  adjust  the  final  apportionment 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested by the prosecution.  Having considered at length the materials put 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward  in  support  of  the  prosecution  application,  I  have  concluded  (again 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rounding down somewhat the sum sought) that the just and reasonable costs 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Miss Pryce should pay is the sum of £48,000 plus £1200 to reflect a fair 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment of the prosecution costs incurred in relation to the sentencing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and costs hearings.  The total costs order in Miss Pryce’s case is therefore one 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23. I propose, next week, to hand down a second costs judgment dealing with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of £49,200.

Sentencing Remarks of H.H. Judge Richard Foster 
  

 
(Honorary Recorder of Luton) 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16th May 2014 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. On 4th November 2013 you were a serving prisoner at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes – 
 
you were serving two life sentences for murder and attempted murder respectively. Kevin 
 
McCarthy was another inmate in the same prison. You have now pleaded guilty to the 
 
attempted murder of Kevin McCarthy. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

2. During association time you enticed Kevin McCarthy into a side room on the pretext of 
 
needing help with ordering some CD’s. In fact your specific intention was to attack him in 
 
order to kill him with an improvised weapon which you were carrying and which you had 
 
previously made. That weapon was a toothbrush with the plastic melted at one end so as to 
 
 
 
attach a blade. You slashed at his neck and then tried to attack him again as he left the 
 
room. He was treated by prison medical staff and did not suffer life‐threatening injuries This 
 
 
was entirely fortuitous and as you said in your police interview you hoped to get a better 
 
shot but you missed – you said your plan was to immobilise him and then get round the 
 
table to complete the attack. The injury was 3 centimetres deep and went across the main 
 
artery. Any deeper and it would have proved fatal. You said when interviewed that it was 
 
your intention to sever the main artery. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

3. Immediately after the attack and whilst still armed Prison Officer Lee Thomas spoke to 
 
you.  He showed considerable bravery in persuading you to give up the weapon. You told 
 
him that you intended to kill Kevin McCarthy because he was “getting needy” and because 
 
you wanted to let people know what you were capable of. You also discussed with him your 
 
 
desire to attack another inmate.
--------
4. You were serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 28 years for the murder of 
 
Roger Denslow in 2006. The victim suffered a massive fracture of the skull. The sentencing 
 
judge on that occasion described you as “an extremely dangerous man who presented a 
 
serious risk to the public”. On 13th August 2011 whilst serving that sentence at HMP Long 
 
Lartin in Worcestershire you launched a vicious attack on another inmate who you believed 
 
had killed a child. Again you used an improvised weapon this time to slash at his throat and 
 
 
eyes. After this attack you held another prisoner as a hostage for some hours. You were 
 
 
convicted of attempted murder (on your guilty plea) and sentenced to a further life 
 
sentence with a minimum term of 20 years. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. You were born on 18th January 1966 so you are now 48 years of age.  The minimum term 
 
for the 2006 murder will not be served until 2034 when you will be 68 years of age. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

6. I have the benefit of a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Ian Yanson, dated 13th May 2014. He 
 
concludes that you do not suffer from a mental illness but rather have a personality 
 
disorder. He also states that you present “a very high risk to others” and that you require 
 
 
management in the prison Exceptional Risk Unit. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

7. By virtue of your history this court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment by virtue 
 
of section 224A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, unless there are particular circumstances 
 
relating to this offence, the previous offences or you which would make it unjust to do so. 
 
 
There are no such circumstances in this case and therefore the sentence of this court is 
 
 
imprisonment for life, to run concurrently with your existing life sentences.  However I 
   
should make it clear that regardless of this provision I am of the opinion that there is a 
 
significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by 
 
you of further specified offences, and as such by virtue of section 225 of the Act a life 
 
sentence would be appropriate. 
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

8. I must set the minimum term which you must serve on this sentence before the Parole 
 
Board can consider you for release on license. If you are ever released it will be on terms 
 
that you are on license for life and can be recalled to prison at any time upon the direction 
 
of the Parole Board or the Secretary of State. That minimum term is usually based upon the 
 
 
notional determinate term which would be passed if this were not a life sentence. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

9. In setting that minimum term I am obliged by statute to follow any relevant sentencing 
 
guidelines unless I am satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so. 
 
The relevant guideline in this case would be level 1 of the Attempted Murder Guidelines of 
 
the former Sentencing Guidelines Council.  If the charge had been murder this case would 
 
have fallen within paragraph 4 of schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 with a 
 
starting point of a whole life order, but the good fortune of no serious and long term harm 
 
 
to the victim places this case in the middle category with a starting point of 20 years and a 
 
sentencing range of 17 to 25 years. The guidelines are also based upon a defendant of 
 
 
previous good character.
--------
10. However I am of the view that to follow those guidelines would be contrary to the 
 
interests of justice. Furthermore in my view the appropriate sentence will exceed those 
 
guidelines by a considerable margin. I am also mindful of the comments of the Court of 
 
Appeal in R. v. Onyenaychi  [2012] EWCA Crim 1460, when on an attempted murder with 
 
very different facts a sentence substantially above the guidelines was upheld. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
  

11. The aggravating features in this case are obvious: your criminal history, the pre‐planning 
 
and premeditation (including testing the weapon for detection by the metal detectors prior 
 
to the commission of this offence), the manufacture and use of the weapon and the manner 
 
in which you enticed the victim into that side‐room.  You have instructed your counsel to 
 
offer no personal mitigation. The only mitigation is your early guilty plea and the fact that 
 
the injuries were not life threatening.  The whole incident was recorded on CCTV and you 
 
had immediately admitted your murderous intent, which you repeated in the subsequent 
 
police interview. The evidence against you was overwhelming. As regards the victim’s 
 
injuries it is only good fortune that these were not more serious – as you said you intended 
 
to immobilise him by the first strike and then move round the table to complete your task. 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12. This case is exceptional and it demands an exceptional sentence. It is in the interests of 
 
justice that even those serving long prison sentences are punished for their crimes. Serving 
 
 
prisoners (as well as prison staff) are entitled to the protection of the courts. Those who 
 
 
commit this sort of crime on a fellow inmate must know that they cannot do so with 
 
immunity. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

   
 
 

13. In calculating the sentence I am about to pass I am fully aware that it is, even after a 
 
guilty plea, the equivalent to a notional determinate term of 50 years. As I have said the 
 
earliest date when you can be considered by the Parole Board for release on license at 
 
present is in 2034 when you will be 68 years of age. I make it clear that in my view you are 
 
 
so dangerous that it would be unsafe for you to live in the community. The minimum term I 
   
impose is one of 25 years. For the avoidance of doubt as a serving prisoner no time served 
 
since this offence counts towards this sentence. The effect of this sentence is that you will 
 
not be eligible for being even considered for release by the Parole Board until 2039 when 
 
you will be 73 years of age. You must also pay the statutory victim surcharge. There will be 
 
 
forfeiture and destruction of the weapon. 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
   
 
 

 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 
 

 
 

14. Before I leave this case I must commend the bravery of Prison Officer Lee Thomas. 
 
Immediately after this horrific attack with the defendant in a small room still armed with his 
 
weapon he calmed him down and persuaded him to give up his weapon.  He gained the 
 
defendant’s trust and compliance at considerable risk to his own safety. I direct that these 
 
comments should be transcribed and sent to the Governor of HMP Woodhill.",2014-05-16 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Rolands Brize you may remain seated throughout. 
 
 
On the 9th April 2013 you pleaded guilty at your first appearance at this court to the 
 
attempted rape of [the victim]  on the 9th March 2013. It is a matter of great concern 
 
that it is now over 13 months later that you are being sentenced. I shall return to the 
 
 
delay that has occurred later as it has attracted national media interest and has 
 
adversely affected the victim’s well‐being and view of the criminal justice system. 
 
Suffice to say that the delay has not been your fault and you will obtain maximum 
 
credit for you early guilty plea. 
 
 
At 2.30am on 9th March 2013 [the victim], 23 years old, left the Sugarmill nightclub in 
 
Hull after a night out with friends. She was planning to get a lift home with her 
 
boyfriend but could not contact him and so she started to walk. At about the same 
 
 
time you were refused admission to the nightclub probably because you were 
 
showing signs of intoxication. You noticed [the victim] and you followed her for 
 
about ¼ of a mile. You approached her from behind and tried to pick her up in your 
 
 
arms but she pushed you away. You tried to grab her and she again pushed you 
 
away. You then walked off. [the victim] continued walking onto Myton Bridge. She 
 
 
called the police when she could still not contact her boyfriend. She was by now 
 
clearly distressed and frightened. She was told by the call operator to remain where 
 
she was and await the arrival of the police. She was reluctant to do so but as you 
 
were not in her sight she agreed. However you returned to the scene by a different 
 
route and took her unawares. You grabbed her and dragged her along the pavement 
 
whilst she struggled violently with you screaming hysterically. She describes 
 
excrutiating pain in her knees and legs as they scraped along the tarmaccadam 
 
footpath. I have seen photographs of the injuries which have left significant scarring
--------
for which she will need plastic surgery to remove them. You dragged her off the 
 
bridge down a stairway away from public view. You forced her to the ground and 
 
lifted her top up exposing her bra. You lifted her skirt exposing her underwear. You 
 
held her down and laid on top of her so she could not escape and  by now she had 
 
no energy left. You undid your trousers and you were almost ready to rape her when 
 
the police arrived. They had spotted a handbag and a pair of shoes on the bridge 
 
footpath and followed the path from the bridge to your location. 
 
 
The police found you on top of the victim and arrested you. You were intoxicated. 
 
[the victim] was totally distraught. She was laid in the foetal position with visible 
 
injuries which were bleeding. She could not communicate with the officers. She was 
 
 
rocking backwards and forwards, shaking and sobbing. It took a female officer ten 
 
 
minutes to calm her and take her to the police vehicle. 
 
 
You answered no questions at police interview. There is evidence that you were 
 
sexually aroused by the questions asked. 
 
 
The offence itself has had a profound effect upon [the victim]. The physical injuries 
 
were painful and she could not walk properly for a few weeks. She has suffered 
 
nightmares and disturbed sleep. She has had weeks off work. She suffers flashbacks 
 
and the memories of the attack intrude upon her daily life. She has been referred for 
 
counselling. She has no social life to speak of as she cannot bear being around 
 
strangers. In short, it has affected every aspect of her life and is likely to continue to 
 
 
do so for some time. 
  
 
This was an extremely serious offence of its kind. The victim was a young woman of 
 
23 and a stranger to you. You followed her and made a determined attempt to grab 
 
her before returning stealthily to the scene. You then used considerable violence to 
 
drag her to a quiet place where you could rape her unobserved and undetected. You 
 
 
were drunk. But for the arrival of the police you would have completed the act of 
 
rape at night in a public place. You have admitted to the author of the Pre‐Sentence 
 
Report that you were intent on rape. It is highly likely that you would have used 
 
 
further violence upon your victim if she continued to put up a struggle. The offence 
 
 
has had a severely detrimental impact on the victim. 
 
 
I have read a good deal about you in the Pre‐ Sentence Report and the various 
 
 
psychiatric reports submitted to the Court. You have previous convictions which 
 
show in‐grained misogyny. You have been violent in the past to your mother and 
 
sister and have harassed them. You have no affection for your mother and claim that 
 
 
she ill‐treated you as a child. You have abused a previous Offender Manager by 
 
following her and threatening violence to her husband. There are documented 
 
assaults on female prison staff. These other incidents, although some of them are 
 
 
minor by comparison, indicate that you are a danger to women. The author of the 
 
 
Pre‐Sentence Report has concluded that you are sexually preoccupied. You also have 
 
 
a history of chronic alcohol abuse. You admit that you have set fire to a house in 
 
 
your native Latvia.
--------
You are a dangerous offender. You pose a significant risk of causing serious harm to 
 
the public by the commission of further specified offences. There is no reliable 
 
estimate of the length of time that you will remain a danger. The provisions of s225 
 
 
of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are engaged. The offence of attempted rape carries 
 
a sentence of life imprisonment. The seriousness of the offence is such as to justify 
 
 
such a sentence. I have considered the case of Burinskas [2014] EWCA Crim 334 
 
particularly paragraphs 9‐23. 
 
 
However, that is not the complete picture. You have a protracted history of mental 
 
disorder which may stem from a serious road accident you suffered about 10 years 
 
ago. You have received psychiatric in‐patient treatment in Latvia and in this country 
 
when you resided in the Spalding area. Before your transfer to hospital on the 27th 
 
January 2014 you had spent time on the hospital wing at HMP Hull and have been 
 
assessed by three psychiatrists all of whose reports I have read with care. In addition 
 
I have received a report and oral evidence from Dr Omar Khan at Chadwick Lodge 
 
 
medium secure unit where you have been assessed and treated since your arrival. 
 
 
Professor Mortimer assessed you in May 2013 and found that you required urgent 
 
mental health treatment. You presented with schizophrenia which needed 
 
compulsory treatment as you had no intention of engaging voluntarily with 
 
psychiatric professionals. She noted that you had disengaged in the past, were non 
 
 
compliant with medication in the community and had no intention of going to 
 
hospital again. She supports an order under section 37 MHA 1983 together with s 41 
 
restrictions and anticipates your treatment being lifelong. 
  
 
Dr Vandenabele assessed you in July 2013 and concluded that you were suffering 
 
from paranoid schizophrenia and presented as acutely thought disordered. He noted 
 
that you were a loner with no close associates, you had a tendency to abuse alcohol 
 
and that you lacked insight into your offending. You were a serious risk to the public 
 
 
which in his view is linked to your mental condition. For those reasons he, too, 
 
recommended a Hospital Order with restrictions. 
 
 
In October 2013, you were assessed by Dr Furtado for the purposes of a “gate‐
keeping” exercise for the Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust. Dr Furtado was more 
 
 
circumspect as to your mental condition. He did not find evidence of thought 
 
disorder. You had been on normal wing location since 16th August 2013 as your 
 
mental state had stabilised. He concluded that it is probable that you suffer from 
 
paranoid schizophrenia which is of a nature but not degree that makes it appropriate 
 
for you to be detained in hospital. Dr Furtado was only prepared to recommend an 
 
 
interim hospital order at that stage in order to clarify whether a hospital order is 
 
appropriate through further assessment. 
 
 
Since 27th January 2014 you have been a patient at Chadwick Lodge medium secure 
 
unit under the care of Dr Omar Khan. I have read his comprehensive report dated 
 
13th May2014. You have a history of both substance and alcohol abuse. There was an 
 
 
absence of remorse which had been observed by others too. Dr Khan believes you 
 
are suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Your insight into your illness is poor and
--------
you have said that you would not take medication if discharged. Your condition has 
 
been exacerbated by ongoing frequent substance and alcohol abuse. Dr Khan 
 
believes that your symptoms have been consistent and repeated enough to suggest 
 
a functional psychosis rather than a drug induced psychotic illness.  You also have a 
 
 
Dissocial personality disorder which may be organic in nature with features such as 
 
 
low tolerance to frustration, violence towards others, numerous anti‐social 
 
behaviours, a lack of remorse and empathy, denial of responsibility and minimisation 
 
of violence. You also have an alcohol dependence disorder. Dr Khan is firmly of the 
 
view that you would be suitable for a hospital order with restrictions in conditions of 
 
 
medium security and a bed is available for you at Chadwick Lodge. 
 
 
I must pay proper regard to your need for treatment. I must also take account of the 
 
 
interests of justice generally and for [the victim] in particular and the need to protect 
 
the public from serious harm. You bear criminal responsibility for the offence of 
 
attempted rape as you have pleaded guilty to it. Furthermore you appear to exhibit 
 
signs of dangerousness which is separate and distinct from your psychotic illness. In 
 
his oral evidence to the Court, Dr Khan has confirmed this. I bear in mind that under 
 
a hospital order with or without restrictions you would be entitled to release when 
 
 
the medical conditions justifying your original admission cease to be met and you 
 
would be liable to recall solely on medical grounds. In my judgement, this is a case 
 
where the mutually exclusive operation of a hospital order on the one hand and a 
 
sentence of imprisonment on the other is unsatisfactory. You require both treatment 
 
and punishment and the public must be protected from the dangerous individual 
 
that you are. 
 
 
The sentence of the Court is one of imprisonment for life. The notional determinate 
 
sentence by reference to the Sentencing Council definitive guideline and giving you 
 
full credit for your plea of guilty is one of 8 years imprisonment. The period that you 
 
 
must serve before you can be considered for parole is 4 years minus the time on 
 
remand which is 429 days. In your case I am satisfied that you are suffering from a 
 
 
mental disorder, namely paranoid schizophrenia which is of a nature and degree 
 
which makes it appropriate for you to be detained in hospital for medical treatment. 
 
Accordingly, I make a direction under s45A(3)(a) MHA1983 that you be taken today 
 
to, and detained at, Chadwick Lodge medium secure unit under the care of Dr Khan 
 
 
your responsible clinician where there is a bed immediately available. I make a 
 
further direction under s45A(3)(b) MHA1983 that you be subject to the special 
 
restrictions set out in s41 MHA 1983. 
 
 
The practical effect of this sentence is that you will receive treatment in hospital for 
 
as long as it is appropriate. Your discharge will be to prison when your release into 
 
the community will only be authorised by the Parole Board when it decides that you 
 
no longer pose a danger to the public. If and when you are released you will be on 
 
life licence and liable to recall if you breach the terms of your licence or reoffend. 
 
 
You will remain subject to the sex offender notification requirements for the 
 
remainder of your life.
--------
Rolands Brize you may now stand down 
  
 
I now wish to return to the issue of delay in this case. This is the 11th occasion that 
 
 
the case has been listed. The number of adjourments has added to the victim’s 
 
distress and the objectives of an early guilty plea have not been achieved. Dealing 
 
with mentally disordered defendants often raises complex issues that take time to 
 
resolve and therefore it is not uncommon for such cases to take longer to complete 
 
than those cases without such issues. That said I consider that in this case there has 
 
been a period of delay which is unjustifiable. Up to the 29th July 2013 the case 
 
proceeded in an entirely normal fashion with necessary adjournments to obtain 
 
further psychiatric reports to comply with the provisions of the MHA 1983. 
 
Thereafter, until the Defendant’s transfer to hospital on 27th January 2014, the case 
 
has encountered problems which should not have occurred. Firstly, there was an 
 
issue as to funding. Whilst the psychiatrists were ready at the end of July there was 
 
 
no suitable bed available and before funding could be obtained for such a bed a 
 
gate‐keeping exercise had to be commenced. The Defendant was not assessed under 
 
 
this exercise until 24th October 2013 and even then there was still no bed available 
 
until a bed at Chadwick Lodge became free on 20th January 2014. It is not entirely 
 
clear why the assessment was not carried out until October although part of the 
 
reason was the unavailability of a Latvian interpreter. Another factor was the issue of 
 
 
which NHS Trust would be responsible for the Defendant’s treatment. Although the 
 
offence took place in Hull and at the time the Defendant was temporarily resident in 
 
a hostel in the city, his last permanent address was in Spalding which is governed by 
 
 
a different NHS Trust. 
 
 
 
Since 27th January, Dr Khan and his team at Chadwick Lodge have done their best to 
 
deal in a timely manner with Mr Brize who has, on any view, complex mental health 
 
 
issues. 
  
 
I do not know whether the delays encountered in this case are common. I hope that 
 
 
they are not and do not become so. It must be remembered that in cases like this 
 
the court is dealing with a victim already traumatised by a serious offence and an 
 
 
offender who requires urgent psychiatric care. There is a clear public interest in 
 
ensuring sufficient resources are available in good time in order to maintain public 
 
confidence in the treatment of mentally disordered defendants so that they and the 
 
 
victims of the crimes they commit are not further damaged by the court process.

In essence the Crown alleges that between 2008 and 2011 the defendants were 
 
involved in a land banking scheme using, variously, three limited companies. 
  
Those  companies  acquired,  or  purported  to  acquire,  sites  which  were  then 
divided into a number of sub-plots.  It is alleged that those sub-plots were then 
 
aggressively marketed to members of the public – often vulnerable members of 
the public – who were persuaded to buy based on false representations as to the 
 
nature of the company selling the sub-plots, the professionals they employed, 
 
as  to  planning  permission,  potential  purchasers  of  the  sites  for  onward 
development  and  their  previous  success.  Some  purchasers  were  given  good 
 
title, some were not, and some sub-plots were sold more than once.  Various 
 
interventions by the FSA (as it then was) to stop the practices were subverted 
 
by transferring the fraudulent scheme to a new company.

--------
The  rôles  of  the  defendants  range  from  the  directing  minds  of  the  fraud 
(Crawley  and  Daley),  the  senior  managers  (Forsyth,  Peters  and  Petrou),  the 
 
  
salesmen  (Mitchie  and  Hawkins)  to  the  conveyancing  solicitor  (Walker). 
There is to be a cutthroat defence run as between Crawley and Walker and it is 
 
likely that other defendants will seek to blame co-defendants.

BACKGROUND 
 
4.	 
 

 

 

 

 

On 10th  July 2013 the Honorary Recorder of Southwark granted representation 
 
orders for QC and junior to Crawley and Daley, and leading junior and junior 
to Forsyth and Petrou.  Walker’s legal team was privately instructed but he is 
now on legal aid and his application for extended representation has not been 
 
lodged.  On 22nd July the Legal Aid Authority (“LAA”) notified the parties that 
 
 
the case has been classified as a Very High Cost Case (“VHCC”). 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
5.	 

 
6.	 

 
7.	 

 

In  about  September  2013  the  Ministry  of  Justice  (“MoJ”)  announced  their 
 
intention  to  cut  fees  paid  to  counsel  by  30%.  The  Bar  announced  their 
 
dissatisfaction with  this decision and  their intention to undeem VHCC  cases. 
  
The Bar Standards Board was involved in this and the Code of Conduct was 
amended to undeem such work. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sensing that a number of cases might be affected, the MoJ allowed the previous 
rates to be extended to any trial which was due to start before 31st March 2014. 
  
In  all  other  cases  the  Bar  were  given  until  2nd  December  2013  to  decide 
whether to accept a VHCC contract on the new terms.  In this and every other 
 
case  which  did  not  fall  within  the  concession  provided  by  the  MoJ  they 
 
declined to accept instructions. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At  a  hearing  on  14th  November  2013  the  defence  raised  concerns  that  they 
 
would not have counsel for the trial and that there was insufficient time for any 
 
counsel who might now be instructed to be ready by April 2014.  I judged it to 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

2
--------
8.	 

 
9.	 

 

be too early to decide that a trial could not be heard in April 2014 and refused 
 
the application to vacate the trial date. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

By 27th November 2013 all counsel had returned their briefs. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

The case was listed on 23rd December for the abuse argument to be heard.  The 
defence were not united in their approach.  Mr Nicholas Brett, solicitor acting 
 
for Crawley, wrote on 18th  December submitting that it was too early to hear 
 
Mr  Lee  Adams,  acting  on  behalf  of  Forsyth  in  the  first  trial  and  all  three 
 
defendants in the second trial, who was applying to stay the proceedings.  Mr 
Brett submitted that it would not be in the interests of justice to adjourn the trial 
to accommodate this dispute (see §17 of his statement dated 7th  April 2014 and 
 
pp.23-5 of NMB/1).  The Crown also submitted that the abuse argument should 
 
be adjourned to, at the latest, the first day of trial, and I adjourned the argument 
 
which was then fixed for 28th April 2014. 
   

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

    

10.	  At  the  hearing  on  23rd  December  Robin  Heard  of  the  LAA  offered  to  de­
classify the case.  I am told that counsel considered whether to take advantage 
 
of  the  offer  and  thereby  accept  the  rates  available  under  the  Graduated  Fee 
 
Scheme.  Because  counsel  would  not  have  been  able  to  obtain  interim 
payments  and  because  any  special  preparation  claim  to  allow  for  reading 
papers exceeding 10,000 pages would only be resolved ex post facto with no 
 
guarantee  that  they  would  be  paid  for  that  additional  reading  (see  Shaffron 
 
07/04/14 Stt. §6), the offer was rejected by all counsel.  At §24 of his statement 
 
Mr Adams supports the view that counsel would be worse off if the case was 
 
de-classified. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.	  During this same period the MoJ and the Bar were negotiating over proposed 
 
reductions  in  graduated  fees.  The  Public  Defender  Service  (“PDS”),  a 
department of the LAA, began actively to recruit a pool of employed advocates 
 
to  take  on  work  that  might  otherwise  have  been  done  by  independent 
 
advocates. 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
12.	  On 22nd January 2014 the solicitors acting for the defendants contacted the PDS 
and provided details of the case.  The PDS responded on 23rd January that they 
 
 
had three QC’s and no juniors employed by the Service. 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13.	  On  17th  January  2014  I  formally  ruled  that  there  was  to  be  severance, 
 
irrespective of whether the defendants were going to be represented.  I judged 
 
that due to the size and complexity of the case, and the number of defendants to 
 
be  tried,  no  jury  could  properly  consider  the  individual  cases  of  eight 
 
defendants in one trial and that there was a real risk that the length of the trial 
 
would  exceed  three  months  and  place  an  intolerable  strain  on  the  jury  were 
   
they to be tried together. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
14.	 

 
 
I ordered that Defence Case Statements, witness requirements, admissions etc. 
should be served, and for skeleton arguments on abuse to be prepared.  It was 
agreed that no jury would be needed before 6th May 2014. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15.	  On 24th  January the Crown identified the defendants to be tried in each trial, 
 
their decision being adopted by the court. The first trial remained fixed for 28th 
 
April  2014 with  a time estimate of 2½ to 3  months  and the  second trial was 
fixed for 15th January 2015 with a time estimate of 6 to 8 weeks. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16.	  One of the reasons for requiring the defence to continue to prepare for trial was 
 
to try to ensure that, should I be persuaded that the trial could go ahead with the 
defendants unrepresented, or should advocates become available at a late stage 
 
and some further reading time was required, then the trial could start in May, or 
after a short delay but within the same time frame. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
17.	 

 

 

 

I  am  grateful  to  the  solicitors  in  this  case  for  the  work  they  have  done  to 
 
 
prepare  for  trial  and  I  judge  that,  with  perhaps  the  need  for  some  pre-trial 
 
management which would occupy a few days, this case is trial ready.

THE ABUSE ARGUMENT 28TH APRIL 2014 
 
 
18.	 

 

 

 
 
I  ordered  and  have  been  provided  with  a  joint  skeleton  argument  drafted  on 
behalf  of  all  the  defendants  and  have  had  a  separate  written  submission  and 
heard  from  Mr  Adams,  a  solicitor  with  rights  of  audience,  but  with  no 
experience of trial advocacy. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

19.	  Mr Alex Cameron QC has appeared bro bono in these proceedings to advance 
 
the  argument  on  behalf  of  the  defendants  that  I  should  stay  the  proceedings 
because they are unrepresented through no fault of their own and that I should 
 
 
not grant an adjournment because the possibility that at some unknown date in 
the future an adequately funded advocate may become available is no basis on 
 
which to grant an adjournment. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
20.	 

 
21.	 

 

The  prosecution  has  been  represented  by  Mr  Ben  Emmerson  QC,  Mr  Sean 
 
 
Larkin QC, Mr Paul Raudnitz and Ms Polly Dyer.  Mr Emmerson QC has been 
instructed by the FCA specifically to deal with legal issues arising in the course 
 
of these submissions and is not instructed as trial counsel. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Crown  accepts  that  involuntary  lack  of  representation  would  be 
 
inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights and common law 
 
rights and they accept that a fair trial cannot be held now.  It is the Crown’s 
submission that there is a reasonable prospect that advocates will be available 
 
to represent the defendants in the future and that I should adjourn the trial to a 
 
future  date  rather  than  staying  the  indictment.  I  have  also  considered  their 
latest note on choice of representation which was served on 30th April. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22.	  Mr  Tom  Little,  who  appeared  as  Amicus  Curiae  instructed  by  the  Attorney 
 
General  to  assist  the  court  has  helpfully  pointed  out  the  strengths  and 
 
weaknesses in the arguments put forward by the Crown and the defence.  He 
points to a stay as an abuse of the process being an exceptional remedy and to 
 
the need for me to consider whether an adjournment is likely to bring about an 
 
effective trial in the future. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
23.	 

It is agreed by both sides that my ruling only affects the five defendants who 
are listed for trial this week. 
 

 

 

 

 

24.	  At  previous  hearings  the  solicitors  representing  the  interests  of  their  clients 
 
 
have  been  keen  to  stress  that  they  do  not  want  their  clients  to  become  the 
victims of a dispute between the Bar and the Government.  I agree with them. 
 

    

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Similarly my decision on how to proceed in this case is taken without regard to 
the continuing dispute between the Bar and the MoJ.  I am only concerned with 
 
 
the merits of the arguments put before me and to ensure that a trial is only held 
if it can be conducted fairly in accordance with the principles long established 
 
in  this  country  and  which  are,  additionally,  enshrined  in  Article  6  of  the 
European Convention on Human Rights. 
 

 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
25.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FIRST ISSUE: CAN THE DEFENDANTS RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL NOW? 
 
26.	  Having been invited by Mr Larkin QC to strike out the last six lines of §15 of 
 
 
the Prosecution’s First Skeleton Argument, for the purposes of this application 
the  prosecution  accept  that  the  defence  took  reasonable  steps  to  find 
 
representation  up  to  mid  January  2014,  that,  presumably,  being  the  time  by 
 
which advocates would have needed to be instructed for the trial to take place 
in April.  It follows that I should approach this argument on the basis that the 
defendants  have  not  voluntarily  or  by  their  own  indolence  failed  to  obtain 
representation. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
27.	 

The  efforts  to  find  representation  included  contact  with  70  sets  of  chambers 
 
with barristers who hold themselves out as competent to undertake this sort of 
 
work in and outside London. 
   

 

28.	  By 15th  January 2014 there was one silk who put himself forward as willing to 
 

 

 

 

accept instructions.  He withdrew on 16th January. 
 

  

 

 
 

 

6
--------
29.	 

 

 

 
It  is  beyond  question  that  the  PDS  is  not  in  a  position  to  provide  sufficient 
representation  for  a  trial  beginning  in  April  2014.  Other  avenues  were 
explored which I will summarise later in this ruling. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30.	  Mr  Emmerson  QC  and  Mr  Larkin  QC,  have  in  written  and  oral  submissions 
accepted that, where through no fault of the defendants they are unrepresented, 
 
to  try  them  would  be  in  breach  of  their  common  law  rights  and  in  addition 
contrary to Article 6(3) of the Convention. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
31.	 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

 

 

 

It follows that there is common ground in respect of the First Issue: the case is 
 
ready for trial and the court has set aside the necessary time to hear this case. 
  
 
However none of the five defendants can receive a fair trial unrepresented. It 
follows that none of the five defendants can be tried now. 
 

 

 

 

That  is  not  an  end  to  the  matter.  At  the  hearing  on  23rd  December  2013  I 
 
included the following passage in my ruling: 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

“I cannot rule at this stage that it would be an abuse of the process of 
 
this court to try the defendants in four months time, nor do I know now 
 
whether in four months time an adjournment of an unknown amount of 
time may not cure the problem that the defendants now face… 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“I add… that, should any defendant fail to exploit the opportunity to get 
 
representation,  I judge that  to be  something  I could properly take  into 
 
 
account if this application to stay has to be made on 28th April 2014. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Meanwhile I will continue to manage this case for a first trial beginning 
on 28th April.” 
 

 

 

The Second Issue is, therefore, should I grant an adjournment?  First I set out 
the topics which I have considered in this regard. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
7
--------
FURTHER ENQUIRIES UNDERTAKEN TO OBTAIN REPRESENTATION 
 
34.	 

 

 

 

 

The continuing failure to secure advocates is relevant to my decision whether 
 
to grant an adjournment but I do not intend to review the painstaking enquiries 
 
to find advocates which have been undertaken jointly by the solicitors because 
 
it is sufficiently set out in the statements of Lee Adams, Ilana Hutton (7th  and 
 
24th April) and Amy Shaffron (7th, 24th and 25th April) and in their exhibits. 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
35.	 

 

 

 

 

 

The  process  was  repeated  after  27th  March  2014  when  an  agreement  was 
 
reached between the MoJ and the Bar in relation to the Graduated Fee Scheme 
(see  the  Chairman  of  the  Criminal  Bar  Association’s  statement,  ALS/14). 
  
Schedules have been prepared to show the position over time as more and more 
 
chambers confirmed that they had no counsel available and willing to work on 
 
VHCC cases.  The second statement of Ms Shaffron sets out the results of her 
latest  attempts  to  find  counsel.  She  has  responses  from  69  chambers  to  the 
 
 
effect that they are unwilling to accept this case as a VHCC. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36.	  When the prosecution identified a further 58 sets of chambers who undertook 
criminal  work  in  their  skeleton  dated  Sunday  27th  April  2014,  the  defence 
 
immediately began the task of contacting those chambers on the Monday whilst 
 
I  heard  argument.  Of  the  35  that  they  were  able  to  contact,  four  needed  to 
 
 
check with their members but the other 31 had no one available. 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 
37.	 

Enquiries  have  been  made  without  success  with  the  Bar  of  Northern  Ireland 
 
and  the  Faculty  of  Advocates  in  Edinburgh,  including  those  with  dual 
 
qualifications which allow them to appear in courts in England and Wales. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38.	  Whilst the solicitors in this case have been invaluable in the preparation of the 
 
defence cases to  the date appointed  for trial, no one suggests that  any of  the 
 
firms have Higher Court Advocates (“HCA”) capable of conducting the trial on 
 
behalf of their clients.  However they conducted enquiries with 90 other firms 
 
of solicitors to see whether they could provide HCA’s, and none were willing 
to take on the case (see Hutton Stt. §37). 
 

 
 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
8
--------
39.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  was  critical  of  the  process  undertaken  by  the  defence, 
questioning  whether  the  enquiries  addressed  whether  an  advocate  would  be 
 
 
available  for  April  or  whether  they  would  be  available  at  some  stage  in  the 
future to represent a defendant under the VHCC scheme.  He pointed to the fact 
 
that  the  hunt  for  in-house  advocates  had  tended  to  concentrate  on  the  Magic 
Circle firms rather than  the  many  smaller  firms  of solicitors who  employ in­
 
house  advocates.  He  also  points  to  whether  the  Bar’s  resolve  not  to  accept 
VHCC work at the present rates may weaken as time passes. 
  

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
40.	 

 

 
In my judgement, whilst Mr Larkin QC raises important issues in this respect, 
the effort put in by the defence to find trial advocates has been very substantial 
 
indeed and has been unsuccessful. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

41.	  Mr Larkin QC also suggests that, if there are insufficient QC’s available, the 
 
representation order could be amended to allow for two juniors or just a junior 
acting on his own.  For my part, where a certificate for a QC and junior is only 
 
 
given in exceptional circumstances and based on factors including the size and 
complexity of a case, I can see no reason why the defence should seek to alter 
 
 
the order.  I remind myself that it is the duty of the State to provide advocates 
at  the  required  level  of  competence  and  experience  pursuant  to  the  court’s 
interpretation of the government’s own legislation.  It is not for the defence to 
 
cut its just entitlement to representation to suit the State. 
  

    

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
42.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  suggested  that,  in  order  to  make  the  trial  fair  and  prevent  it 
being stopped as an abuse, were the level of representation to be reduced for 
 
the  defence  then  that  might  result  in  the  prosecution  or  the  judge  using  his 
powers  of  trial  management  to  decline,  for  instance,  to  entertain  the 
 
 
prosecution’s application to adduce bad character.  That is an issue pertinent to 
this  case  because  the  prosecution  has  served  a  full  A4  file  of  documents  in 
respect of bad character applications. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9
--------
Such a submission, whilst well intentioned, would result in a perversion of the 
trial process; the better defended a defendant is, the more likely he is to have 
 
his bad character adduced.  The overriding objective of the Criminal Procedure 
Rules to deal with criminal trials justly is, therefore, subverted by failure of the 
 
State to provide adequate representation. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Following the argument to its logical conclusion, and having in mind principles 
 
 
of equality of arms, if the defence were unable to find the QC’s to which their 
Representation Order entitles them, would the Crown be invited to reduce its 
own  representation  by  removing  Mr  Larkin  QC  from  the  prosecution  team 
which  presently  comprises  a  Silk  and  two  juniors?  Criminal  trials  of  this 
 
complexity rely on the skills of highly competent and experienced advocates on 
both  sides  to  reduce  issues,  make  matters  understandable  to  a  jury  and  keep 
 
 
trials to a reasonable length.

THE PUBLIC DEFENCE SERVICE 
 
45.	 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The  solicitors  have  been  in  regular  contact  with  the  PDS,  with  Byrne  & 
 
Partners  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  all  the  solicitors  involved  in  this  case. 
  
Moving  on  from  initial  problems  obtaining  sufficiently  detailed  CV’s  of  the 
 
QC’s who had joined the service so as to give them and their clients the ability 
 
February  2014  Mr 
to  make  an  informed  decision  as  to  choice,  on 
Marshalsay of the PDS gave the details of an HCA who had joined the service 
 
but seemed to accept that she had insufficient experience to undertake this sort 
 
of case (ILH/13). 
 

4th 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46.	  By 7th  February 2014 (ILH/15) it became clear that one silk was immediately 
 
available to be instructed and that a second would be available by the end of 
 
February  but  issues  arose  over  Paragraph  7  of  the  original  PDS  Code  of 
 
Conduct which did not permit an employee to act for a client where to do so 
would give rise to a conflict of interest including in circumstances where “…a 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10
--------
client’s  best  interests  conflicts  with  the  interests  of…another  client  of  the 
 
salaried service…”. 
 

 

 

47.	  Although the solicitors were told that the Code was under review, they judged, 
 
because the Code was binding on all parties, that where there was a potential 
conflict  between  the  defendants,  it  would  not  be  ethically  proper  to  proceed 
 
until the Code had been amended.  I do not criticise them for that decision. 
 

 
    

 

 

 

 

 

48.	  By an email dated 20th  February 2014 (ILH/19), the defence for Mr Daley set 
 

 

 

out the issues they had with instructing advocates from the PDS: 
 

 

 

It had been determined that the defendant should have a silk and a 
junior and, the PDS could only offer one silk immediately available 
and no junior. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In total they were being offered the choice between two silks from 
the entire list of silks who are able to practice in England and Wales. 
  
They would be failing in their professional duty to advise their client, 
 
as a matter of expediency, to accept one or those two silks of whom 
they have had no experience and cannot personally vouch for.  They 
 
felt bound to advise their client to wait to see whether the choice will 
 
increase and a junior counsel will become available. 
 

 
  

 

 

 

 

   

  
  
 

The  conflict  of  interest  issue  remained  unresolved.  The  solicitors 
 
discovered  for  themselves  that  the  Code  was  amended  in  March 
 
2014.  Despite the amendment to the  Code, the issue has not  gone 
 
away.  In a letter dated 17th  April 2014 (ILH/37) Byrne and Partners 
 
raised real practical issues in respect of conflict and have asked for 
 
reassurances as to how matters would be handled by the PDS.  These 
 
have  subsequently  been  addressed  in  a  letter  dated  23rd  April  from 
the PDS (ILH/41).

49.	  On 20th  March a letter was sent from the  LAA to all VHCC contract holders 
 
reminding  them  that  they  must  explore  all  possible  avenues  to  find 
 
representation, reinforcing this requirement with the sanction that failure to do 
so would amount to a fundamental breach of  the contract which  may lead to 
 
termination of the contract and such termination would be considered in respect 
of any further tender for a VHCC contract.

That same day the PDS was emailed (ILH/26) and asked what the position as to 
recruitment was.  They were told that interviews were taking place at all levels. 
  
By 3rd  April the PDS informed them that they had completed their “…first and 
 
very successful round of recruitment.”  The recruits would be joining over the 
 
“coming weeks”.  Four CV’s were attached and subsequently the solicitors for 
Mr  Daley  were  told  that  four  counsel  were  available  for  the  trial.  On  21st 
 
 
March the PDS sent an email to Petrou’s solicitors (ILH/27) which stated that, 
having reviewed  the  position  with  one  of  their  QC’s,  it  was not  thought  that 
there would be sufficient time to prepare.  Counsel would be available to apply 
 
for an adjournment of the trial to allow for preparation. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
51.	  Clarification of start dates of employed advocates was provided by the PDS on 
17th  April  (ILH/29).  The  defence  were  told  that  both  QC’s  that  were  to  be 
 
 
available  were  now  unwell.  The  juniors  could  start  with  “near-immediate 
 
effect”.  The  PDS  felt  that  the  advocates  could  assess  how  long  they  would 
 
need  to  prepare  and  support  the  defence  in  putting  this  information  before  a 
 
court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52.	  On 17th  April the PDS provided an update on availability (ILH/39) which set 
 
 
out that they had three QC’s, one of whom was preparing for a 14 week trial 
due to start on 8th September 2014, one was ill but could take instructions prior 
 
 
to his return in four weeks and one was unavailable until September.  In May 
 
two senior and one junior advocate would become available, in June a further 
 
QC, five senior and a junior advocate would come into the service and another 
 
senior advocate by  July.  There  were further  conditional offers  for two  more

--------
senior advocates who may start in May and June and two QC’s who may start 
in June and July.  The expected size of the PDS advocacy unit by the end of 
 
July is six QC’s, ten Senior HCA’s and two junior HCA’s. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 
53.	 

 

I  was  provided  with  a  further  update  during  the  proceedings  by  Ms  Clare 
 
 
Toogood: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

   
 
 

(a)	  No  QC’s  are  available  at  present.  One  will  be  available  in  four 
 
weeks, another from 2nd  July, a third from “later in the summer” but 
 
he is recouping from, I understand it, a serious health problem and he 
 
would need to be spoken to as to when he may be able to read into 
the case.  One is due to start a 12 week case in September.  Having in 
mind the time required for preparation and the burden of preparing 
and  presenting  a  defence  in  a  complex  fraud,  I  judge  that  two  of 
those  silks  are  very  unlikely  to  be  available  to  take  instructions  in 
 
this case. 
 

  
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(b)	 

 
(c)	 

 
(d)	 

Two more unnamed QC’s are due to start in June and July and would 
be available. 
 

 

  

There is a list of ten other advocates and two further advocates who 
 
are due to join the PDS who will become available.  That list does 
 
not  distinguish  between  junior  and  senior  advocates.  No  criteria 
have  been  drawn  to  my  attention  as  to  how  the  PDS  makes  that 
 
distinction but Ms Toogood has stated that all the senior advocates 
 
have  led  in  the  past.  Whilst  the  figures  do  not  entirely  coincide 
between  the  documents,  making  use  of  an  email  received  on  17th 
 
the 
April 
 
 
overwhelming  preponderance  of  the  juniors  employed  by  the  PDS 
qualify as leading juniors.

There are no plans at present to recruit any more advocates.

They are employed to work a 37 hour week but would be expected to

The PDS consider that, with the revised Code, they can manage all 
 
 
conflicts. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

54.	  A number of issues arise in respect of the use of the PDS.  Firstly, the defence 
 
accept that they are required to make use of advocates employed by the PDS if 
 
 
they  are  available.  Article  6(3)(c)  allows  everyone  charged  with  a  criminal 
offence the minimum right: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“to  defend  himself  in  person  or  through  legal  assistance  of  his  own 
 
choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to 
be given it free when the interests of justice so require.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 
55.	 

 
56.	 

 

 
I  have  been  referred  to  Croissant  v.  Germany  (1993)  16  E.H.R.R.  135  in 
 
respect of the right to a choice of representation where the state pays for legal 
assistance.  There is a difference in the emphasis put on this  decision by  Mr 
Emmerson QC for the Crown and Mr Cameron QC as to the interpretation to 
 
be given to the decision. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

In that case the court appointed Mr Hauser to represent Croissant although the 
 
court knew that he had no confidence in Mr Hauser.  At §29 the court stated 
 
that: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
“…not  withstanding  the  importance  of  a  relationship  of  confidence 
 
between lawyer and client, that right [to counsel of his own choosing] 
cannot be considered to be absolute.  It is necessarily subject to certain 
 
limitations where free legal aid is concerned  and also where, as in the 
 
present case, it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice 
  
require  that  the  accused  be  defended  by  counsel  appointed  by  them. 
 
When appointing counsel the national courts must certainly have regard 
 
to  the  defendant’s  wishes:  indeed,  German  law  contemplates  such  a 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
14
--------
57.	 

 
58.	 

 
59.	 

  

 
course.  However they can override those wishes when there are relevant 
and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests 
 
of justice” 
 

 

 

 

 
 
I have reminded myself that in that case the regional Court was of the view that 
 
Mr Hauser provided the best guarantees of an adequate defence and Croissant’s 
reasons for rejecting him were not valid. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  courts  here  have  taken  a  similar  line:  a  defendant  is  entitled  to  be 
represented  by  counsel  of  his  choice  if  that  is  reasonably  practicable.  That, 
 
 
however, will depend on the availability of counsel but also on the availability 
at the same time of a suitably equipped court, of the witnesses and a timescale 
 
 
appropriate to the case.  The overriding consideration must be the requirements 
of  justice  for  the  prosecution  and  the  defence,  see  R.  v.  De  Oliveira  [1997] 
 
 
Crim. L.R. 600. 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
In my judgment the defendants cannot hold out for independent counsel of their 
  
choice to become available and Mr Cameron QC does not seek to argue that. 
However, the solicitor acting for a defendant is under a duty to advise his client 
on  the  best  counsel  available  to  them  and  is  entitled  to  hold  off  instructing 
 
anyone until he has the best possible choice available to him, so long as that 
 
delay does not jeopardise the date set for trial and the ability of advocates to be 
 
trial ready by that date. 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60.	  Mr  Cameron  QC  has  raised  the  issue  of  the  effect  on  the  available  PDS 
   
employed  advocates  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  adjournment  of  this  trial. 
I 
have ascertained that, were I to grant an adjournment this trial could be heard 
on  15th  January  2015  with  the  second  trial  to  follow  on. 
 
   
If  that  is  not 
 
practicable then the case could not be listed until September 2015. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61.	  He suggests that other cases will become front runners for the available PDS 
advocates which will not leave sufficient advocates to prepare for and appear in 
   
a trial in January 2015. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
15
--------
62.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

Into  that equation  I have  to consider how  long would  be required  for  a PDS 
advocate to prepare for this trial.  Whilst I can see how the requirement to work 
 
until they finish a particular task might affect the hours that they work during 
trial, it would be unreasonable to expect employed advocates to work beyond 
 
 
their contracted hours week after week to prepare for a trial.  The first Junior 
counsel for the Crown has spent 1000 hours preparing this case.  That is not 
 
surprising bearing in mind the burden he has of preparing the case in respect of 
eight  defendants  and  drafting  a  substantial  volume  of  documentation.  The 
 
   
Crown has the benefit of a second junior who is instructed in the case and who, 
 
 
 
 
I suspect, is largely, but not exclusively, involved in the disclosure process. 

 
  

 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63.	  An  advocate appearing for  one defendant  will need substantially less  time to 
 
prepare, but it is hard to imagine that it would be less than, say, 450 hours. That 
 
 
would only allow him an hour to read every 100 pages without consideration of 
the 194 spreadsheets.  On the basis of a 37 hour week the advocate will need a 
minimum of twelve clear weeks out of court to prepare this case.  It means that 
the advocate must be available from early October until trial. 
 

 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64.	  Mr  Little  suggested  that  there  could  be  merit  in  all  the  current  VHCC  cases 
being listed before one judge in order to allocate resources accordingly.  There 
 
are  eight  other  trials  arising  from  six  prosecutions  which  are  due  to  begin 
between  September  2014  and  September  2015  and  which  will  require 
 
 
somewhere in excess of 21 defendants to be represented in addition to the eight 
defendants who need to have representation in this case.  Whilst the majority of 
 
the cases are listed at Southwark, there are cases listed at several other courts. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65.	  Whilst Mr Little’s submission had its attractions, apart from the improbability 
 
 
that other courts on other Circuits would release their cases, it would involve 
the nominated judge in decisions which went far outside trial management and 
 
 
which might involve him in selecting which defendants would have first choice 
of  advocate  or  in  making  other  decisions  which  would  involve  the  judge  in 
 
areas which lay outside his remit. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

16
--------
In my judgment whether there are sufficient employed advocates to cover this 
case when those same advocates may be required to prepare for and appear in 
 
other cases, is simply another matter which I have to take into account when 
deciding  whether  I  would,  in  granting  an  adjournment,  be  acting  purely 
 
speculatively as to whether the trial could ever take place. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
66.	 

 

 

 

 

 
CONFLICT AND THE USE OF PDS LAWYERS 
67.	  Mr  Cameron  QC  and  Mr  Adams  identify  that  there  is  a  conflict  between 
 
 
Crawley  and  Walker. 
I  judge  that  §7.3(b)  of  the  amended  PDS  Code  of 
 
   
 
Conduct,  which  sets  out  that  where  conflict  arises  the  PDS  lawyer  must 
“explain that the client is free to be represented by other legal representatives 
 
outside  the  PDS  Advocacy  Service”,  must  envisage  other  advocates  being 
 
available in independent practice. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68.	  Whilst  I  agree  with  Mr  Little  that  I  should  place  little  value  on  it  for  the 
 
purposes of this argument because it is unknown whether any defendant would 
 
avail  himself  of  that  opportunity  or  would  be  content  to  remain  with  a  PDS 
lawyer  and  make  use  of 
the  “enhanced  confidentiality  provisions”  I 
nevertheless  have  to  allow  for  the  views  expressed  by  Mr  Adams  that  the 
 
advice he would expect a solicitor to give to his client in such circumstances is 
 
that he should take the option provided by §7.3(b).  I should, therefore have in 
 
mind whether any legal representatives outside of the PDS will be available to 
 
 
the defendant(s) affected. 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
THE USE OF COURT TIME AND THE EFFECT OF GRANTING AN ADJOURNMENT 
 
69.	 
 

I  have  already  indicated  that  this  court  could  hear  this  trial  on  15th  January. 
 
  
The  effect  of  that  would  be  to  push  the second  trial  back to  March  2015  or, 
 
allowing the advocates, and perhaps the judge, a short break between trials, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17
--------
April.  To  accommodate  this  additional  strain  on  the  court’s  resources,  other 
 
cases will have to be delayed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

It is of note that the figures for trial receipts at this court for the year to March 
 
 
2014 shows a 58% increase over last year.  The London Courts overall have 
seen a 26% increase in trial receipts.  The sitting profile for London, that is the 
 
 
number  of  court  days  which  each  court  is  allowed  to  sit,  will  continue  to be 
 
under considerable stress for the foreseeable future.  It follows that it is highly 
unlikely  that  the  work  which  would  have  to  be  moved  to  accommodate  this 
 
trial in January will find a home in any of the other London courts. 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  no  wonder  that  §3.2.(2)(f)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Rules  requires  the 
 
court  in  furthering  the  overriding  objective  which  I  referred  to  earlier,  to 
 
 
“discourage delay, dealing with as many aspects of the case as possible on the 
 
same occasion and avoiding unnecessary hearings”.  Further, at §3.8 the court 
is required at any hearing at which the case cannot be concluded to “there and 
 
then…give directions so that it can be concluded at the next hearing or as soon 
as possible after that.”  The relevance of that paragraph to the adjournment of a 
trial is emphasised by the first entreaty that follows those words, that is for the 
trial judge to decide whether, where a defendant fails to attend, the trial should 
 
continue in his absence. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is part of my responsibility to take into account the effect on other cases of 
 
 
I  remind 
 
adjourning  the  hearing  for  which  court  time  has  been  put  aside. 
   
myself that finding another three month slot for this case is bound to delay the 
 
trials of other defendants through no fault of their own. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I also  remind  myself  that,  in  resisting severance,  Mr  Larkin  QC  drew  to  my 
attention the effect of delay on the second trial.  I did not judge that a delay to 
 
January  2015  was  so  detrimental  as  to  make  that  trial  unfair.  However  if  I 
 
grant  the  adjournment  of  the  first  trial  with  the  second  to  follow,  I  am  now

faced with that second trial going back by approximately a year from this April 
 
when it might otherwise have been tried with eight defendants. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  put  forward  during  argument  that,  if  there  are  insufficient 
 
 
resources to try five defendants together, there should be a trial of an individual 
defendant or some defendants who have managed to find an advocate and he 
 
submitted  that  this  is  a  better  solution  than  preventing  the  prosecution  from 
being brought at all.  With respect to Mr Larkin QC, his suggestion will result 
in a series of up to eight trials, each of some substantial length, clogging up this

SECOND ISSUE: SHOULD THE PROSECUTION BE GRANTED AN ADJOURNMENT? 
 
 
75.	 

 
 
I  am  invited  by  the  prosecution  to  grant  an  adjournment  to  prevent  the  case 
 
being stayed.  No party submits that a temporary stay is available in a criminal 
trial; that is simply another way of describing an adjournment. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
76.	 

 

The  prosecution  rely  on  Attorney  General’s  Reference  No.  2  of  2001  [2003] 
 
 
   
I  accept  the  principle  that  a  stay  will  never  be  an  appropriate 
UKHL  68. 
 
 
 
remedy  where  a  lesser  remedy  would  adequately  vindicate  the  defendant’s 
   
 
In  the  context  of  this  case  they  argue  that,  if  an 
Convention  rights. 
 
adjournment  to  January  2015  or  even  September  2015  would  allow  for 
 
appropriate  representation  of  the  accused,  then  that  should  be  the  course 
 
adopted rather than to stay the proceedings now. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
77.	  However in circumstances where it is accepted that the defendants cannot have 
a  fair  trial  now,  in  deciding  whether  an  adjournment  would  adequately 
 
vindicate the defendant’s Convention rights, I have to consider whether there is 
 
a realistic prospect of a fair trial in January or September.  If there is not, then 
 
an adjournment cannot cure the problem that has arisen. 

   
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
19
--------
78.	  A  “realistic  prospect”  in  these  circumstances  connotes  something  less  than 
certainty  but  which  is  a  real  and  practical  prospect  of  the  trial  proceeding 
 
within  a  reasonable  time  frame.  It  must  be  something  more  than  a  fanciful 
prospect.  The  Crown  prefers  the  wording  “reasonable  prospect”  but  I do  not 
 
 
judge that there is any material difference in meaning between the two phrases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
79.	 

 

 

In  determining whether  I should  grant  an  adjournment  at  all  and  in  deciding 
whether there is a reasonable prospect of this case being tried in the future,  I 
have considered the following factors:­

 

 

 

 

 

 
(a)	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Failure to grant an adjournment will deprive the victims of crime of 
 
  
the opportunity to see those that they judge responsible prosecuted. 
To deny them that opportunity should not be lightly taken.  Against 
 
 
that I judge that there are other  methods available to the victims to 
 
recover  their  losses  civilly  and  there  are  other  regulatory  offences 
which could be brought against the defendants which may not meet 
the gravamen of the conduct alleged but which could mark out their 
 
alleged misconduct and prevent them from being able to take a rôle 
in corporate activity in the future. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
responsibility 

(b)	  Although  the  FCA  is  answerable  to  HM  Treasury  rather  than  the 
Attorney General, it is nevertheless an arm of the State which brings 
 
 
to  provide  adequate 
this  prosecution. 
 
 
representation  at  public  expense  is  also  the  responsibility  of  the 
 
 
State. 
I  have  considered  whether  the  State  should  in  those 
 
circumstances  be  entitled  to  benefit  from  its  own  failure  by  being 
granted an adjournment. 
 

The 

   

 

 

 

 

 
(c)	 

The State also provides at public expense the court in which the case 
 
is to be tried.  An adjournment of the trial will involve an additional 
 
stress on the State’s provision of resources to try crime. 
 

  

 

 

 

20
--------
(d)	  Whilst the PDS has provided a pool of available advocates at public 
expense, it is so small so that it is insufficient to cover all the VHCC 
 
cases due to be tried unless control of listing these cases becomes no 
longer a judicial function but one effectively controlled and dictated 
 
 
by the availability of the PDS advocates.  That would be a dangerous 
precedent, see De Oliveira. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(e)	 

 

Bearing in mind availability and preparation time required I am not 
 
satisfied  that  sufficient  PDS advocates  would  be  available  to  assist 
the defendants in this trial.  It is not in the interests of justice to try 
  
each defendant separately. 
  

 

 

 

 

 
(f)	 

I have no reason to think that there is a realistic prospect that the Bar 
 
will accept contracts in VHCC cases on the present terms. 
 

 

 

 

 

(g)	  Whilst Article 6(3) does not provide the legally aided defendant with 
the right to an advocate of his choice, it still permits the solicitor to 
 
carry out his duty to assess which available advocate would best suit 
 
his client’s case.  A solicitor is entitled to delay that choice until the 
 
moment that he judges the pool from which to choose is at its height. 
  
That may be at any time between now and early October. 
 

 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CONCLUSION 
 

 
80.	 

 

I  have  reminded  myself  that  a  stay  should  only  be  granted  in  exceptional 
 
 
circumstances and that in most cases an adjournment can cure what otherwise 
 
might amount to an abuse of the process of the court. 
 

 

 

 

 
21
--------

83.	 

 

 
I have  taken  into  account  that  it  is  common  ground  between  the  parties  that 
 
where the defendant is not at fault, in a case of this complexity the defendants 
could not receive a fair trial without advocates to represent them. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I have  considered  The  Crown  Prosecution  Service  v.  Cambell;  McInerney  v. 
 
The  Financial  Services  Authority;  The  Medicines  and  Healthcare  Products 
Regulatory Agency v. Carlton [2009] EWCA Crim 997 in which the Court of 
 
Appeal dealt with applications to stay confiscation proceedings because  there 
 
was no appropriate representation.  In giving the judgment of the court, Hooper 
 
LJ said: 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“We reached the conclusion that the fact that in the future an adequately 
 
funded  advocate  may  be  available  was  no  justification  for  an 
 
adjournment. The problem identified in this case is not a new one: see 
e.g. the decision of HHJ Mole QC reported on BAILII as P [2008] EW 
 
Misc 2 (EWCC). That decision was handed down over a year ago.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I agree with Mr Little that I should not read too much into that decision where 
 
 
the issues were different from those that I face, not least in that I am dealing 
with  a  decision  whether  to  grant  an  adjournment  in  respect  of  a  serious 
 
allegation which is as yet unproven.  However it does provide some support for 
 
the care that  I should take  before  granting an  adjournment  where there is  no 
 
realistic prospect that in the future a suitable advocate will be available. 
 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84.	  Having considered all these matters I am compelled to conclude that, to allow 
 
the  State  an  adjournment  to  put  right  its  failure  to  provide  the  necessary 
 
resources to permit a fair trial to take place now amounts to a violation of the 
 
 
process of this court. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
85.	 

 

 

 

 

The knock-on effect on other trials, the waste of court resources and the need to 
disregard  the  Criminal  Procedure  Rules  designed  to  protect  the  court  system 
from abuse and to ensure that scare resources are used to best effect all, in my 
 
 
judgment, add to the reasons why an adjournment should not be granted.

87.	 

 

 

 

 

   
 

Even if I am wrong about that, I further find that there is no realistic prospect 
that sufficient advocates would be available for this case to be tried in January 
 
  
2015  from  any  of  the  sources  available  to  the  defence,  including  the  PDS. 
Whatever  reason  is  put  forward  by  the  party  applying,  the  court  does  not 
 
ordinarily grant adjournments on a speculative basis. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  be  unconscionable  to  put  this  trial  off  to  September  2015  with  the 
 
 
second trial being heard in 2016.  On what I now know, there is no basis on 
which I could find that the availability of advocates would be any different then 
 
 
than it will be in January 2015.  In addition it is likely to lead to a violation of 
the reasonable time requirement in Article 6(1). 
  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
88.	 

In those circumstances I stay the proceedings against these five defendants.

RULING ON ABUSE / ADJOURNMENT
 

 

 
 
GENERAL 
 
1.	 

 

 
 

The defendants are charged with offences of conspiracy to defraud, possessing 
criminal  property and  offences contrary to s.19 and 23(1), and s.177(4)(a) of 
 
the Financial  Services  and Markets  Act  2000.  The evidence is  complex  and 
 
substantial.  The volume of papers amounts to some 46,030 pages.  There are in 
addition  194  excel  spreadsheets  with  a  combined  total  of  864,200  lines  of 
entry.  The Case Summary covers 55 pages. 
 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
2.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

In essence the Crown alleges that between 2008 and 2011 the defendants were 
 
involved in a land banking scheme using, variously, three limited companies. 
  
Those  companies  acquired,  or  purported  to  acquire,  sites  which  were  then 
divided into a number of sub-plots.  It is alleged that those sub-plots were then 
 
aggressively marketed to members of the public – often vulnerable members of 
the public – who were persuaded to buy based on false representations as to the 
 
nature of the company selling the sub-plots, the professionals they employed, 
 
as  to  planning  permission,  potential  purchasers  of  the  sites  for  onward 
development  and  their  previous  success.  Some  purchasers  were  given  good 
 
title, some were not, and some sub-plots were sold more than once.  Various 
 
interventions by the FSA (as it then was) to stop the practices were subverted 
 
by transferring the fraudulent scheme to a new company. 
 

   
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
The  rôles  of  the  defendants  range  from  the  directing  minds  of  the  fraud 
(Crawley  and  Daley),  the  senior  managers  (Forsyth,  Peters  and  Petrou),  the 
 
  
salesmen  (Mitchie  and  Hawkins)  to  the  conveyancing  solicitor  (Walker). 
There is to be a cutthroat defence run as between Crawley and Walker and it is 
 
likely that other defendants will seek to blame co-defendants.

BACKGROUND 
 
4.	 
 

 

 

 

 

On 10th  July 2013 the Honorary Recorder of Southwark granted representation 
 
orders for QC and junior to Crawley and Daley, and leading junior and junior 
to Forsyth and Petrou.  Walker’s legal team was privately instructed but he is 
now on legal aid and his application for extended representation has not been 
 
lodged.  On 22nd July the Legal Aid Authority (“LAA”) notified the parties that 
 
 
the case has been classified as a Very High Cost Case (“VHCC”). 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
5.	 

 
6.	 

 
7.	 

 

In  about  September  2013  the  Ministry  of  Justice  (“MoJ”)  announced  their 
 
intention  to  cut  fees  paid  to  counsel  by  30%.  The  Bar  announced  their 
 
dissatisfaction with  this decision and  their intention to undeem VHCC  cases. 
  
The Bar Standards Board was involved in this and the Code of Conduct was 
amended to undeem such work. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sensing that a number of cases might be affected, the MoJ allowed the previous 
rates to be extended to any trial which was due to start before 31st March 2014. 
  
In  all  other  cases  the  Bar  were  given  until  2nd  December  2013  to  decide 
whether to accept a VHCC contract on the new terms.  In this and every other 
 
case  which  did  not  fall  within  the  concession  provided  by  the  MoJ  they 
 
declined to accept instructions. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At  a  hearing  on  14th  November  2013  the  defence  raised  concerns  that  they 
 
would not have counsel for the trial and that there was insufficient time for any 
 
counsel who might now be instructed to be ready by April 2014.  I judged it to 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

2
--------
8.	 

 
9.	 

 

be too early to decide that a trial could not be heard in April 2014 and refused 
 
the application to vacate the trial date. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

By 27th November 2013 all counsel had returned their briefs. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

The case was listed on 23rd December for the abuse argument to be heard.  The 
defence were not united in their approach.  Mr Nicholas Brett, solicitor acting 
 
for Crawley, wrote on 18th  December submitting that it was too early to hear 
 
Mr  Lee  Adams,  acting  on  behalf  of  Forsyth  in  the  first  trial  and  all  three 
 
defendants in the second trial, who was applying to stay the proceedings.  Mr 
Brett submitted that it would not be in the interests of justice to adjourn the trial 
to accommodate this dispute (see §17 of his statement dated 7th  April 2014 and 
 
pp.23-5 of NMB/1).  The Crown also submitted that the abuse argument should 
 
be adjourned to, at the latest, the first day of trial, and I adjourned the argument 
 
which was then fixed for 28th April 2014. 
   

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

    

10.	  At  the  hearing  on  23rd  December  Robin  Heard  of  the  LAA  offered  to  de­
classify the case.  I am told that counsel considered whether to take advantage 
 
of  the  offer  and  thereby  accept  the  rates  available  under  the  Graduated  Fee 
 
Scheme.  Because  counsel  would  not  have  been  able  to  obtain  interim 
payments  and  because  any  special  preparation  claim  to  allow  for  reading 
papers exceeding 10,000 pages would only be resolved ex post facto with no 
 
guarantee  that  they  would  be  paid  for  that  additional  reading  (see  Shaffron 
 
07/04/14 Stt. §6), the offer was rejected by all counsel.  At §24 of his statement 
 
Mr Adams supports the view that counsel would be worse off if the case was 
 
de-classified. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.	  During this same period the MoJ and the Bar were negotiating over proposed 
 
reductions  in  graduated  fees.  The  Public  Defender  Service  (“PDS”),  a 
department of the LAA, began actively to recruit a pool of employed advocates 
 
to  take  on  work  that  might  otherwise  have  been  done  by  independent 
 
advocates. 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
12.	  On 22nd January 2014 the solicitors acting for the defendants contacted the PDS 
and provided details of the case.  The PDS responded on 23rd January that they 
 
 
had three QC’s and no juniors employed by the Service. 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13.	  On  17th  January  2014  I  formally  ruled  that  there  was  to  be  severance, 
 
irrespective of whether the defendants were going to be represented.  I judged 
 
that due to the size and complexity of the case, and the number of defendants to 
 
be  tried,  no  jury  could  properly  consider  the  individual  cases  of  eight 
 
defendants in one trial and that there was a real risk that the length of the trial 
 
would  exceed  three  months  and  place  an  intolerable  strain  on  the  jury  were 
   
they to be tried together. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
14.	 

 
 
I ordered that Defence Case Statements, witness requirements, admissions etc. 
should be served, and for skeleton arguments on abuse to be prepared.  It was 
agreed that no jury would be needed before 6th May 2014. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15.	  On 24th  January the Crown identified the defendants to be tried in each trial, 
 
their decision being adopted by the court. The first trial remained fixed for 28th 
 
April  2014 with  a time estimate of 2½ to 3  months  and the  second trial was 
fixed for 15th January 2015 with a time estimate of 6 to 8 weeks. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16.	  One of the reasons for requiring the defence to continue to prepare for trial was 
 
to try to ensure that, should I be persuaded that the trial could go ahead with the 
defendants unrepresented, or should advocates become available at a late stage 
 
and some further reading time was required, then the trial could start in May, or 
after a short delay but within the same time frame. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
17.	 

 

 

 

I  am  grateful  to  the  solicitors  in  this  case  for  the  work  they  have  done  to 
 
 
prepare  for  trial  and  I  judge  that,  with  perhaps  the  need  for  some  pre-trial 
 
management which would occupy a few days, this case is trial ready.

--------
THE ABUSE ARGUMENT 28TH APRIL 2014 
 
 
18.	 

 

 

 
 
I  ordered  and  have  been  provided  with  a  joint  skeleton  argument  drafted  on 
behalf  of  all  the  defendants  and  have  had  a  separate  written  submission  and 
heard  from  Mr  Adams,  a  solicitor  with  rights  of  audience,  but  with  no 
experience of trial advocacy. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

19.	  Mr Alex Cameron QC has appeared bro bono in these proceedings to advance 
 
the  argument  on  behalf  of  the  defendants  that  I  should  stay  the  proceedings 
because they are unrepresented through no fault of their own and that I should 
 
 
not grant an adjournment because the possibility that at some unknown date in 
the future an adequately funded advocate may become available is no basis on 
 
which to grant an adjournment. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
20.	 

 
21.	 

 

The  prosecution  has  been  represented  by  Mr  Ben  Emmerson  QC,  Mr  Sean 
 
 
Larkin QC, Mr Paul Raudnitz and Ms Polly Dyer.  Mr Emmerson QC has been 
instructed by the FCA specifically to deal with legal issues arising in the course 
 
of these submissions and is not instructed as trial counsel. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Crown  accepts  that  involuntary  lack  of  representation  would  be 
 
inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights and common law 
 
rights and they accept that a fair trial cannot be held now.  It is the Crown’s 
submission that there is a reasonable prospect that advocates will be available 
 
to represent the defendants in the future and that I should adjourn the trial to a 
 
future  date  rather  than  staying  the  indictment.  I  have  also  considered  their 
latest note on choice of representation which was served on 30th April. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22.	  Mr  Tom  Little,  who  appeared  as  Amicus  Curiae  instructed  by  the  Attorney 
 
General  to  assist  the  court  has  helpfully  pointed  out  the  strengths  and 
 
weaknesses in the arguments put forward by the Crown and the defence.  He 
points to a stay as an abuse of the process being an exceptional remedy and to 
 
the need for me to consider whether an adjournment is likely to bring about an 
 
effective trial in the future. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
23.	 

It is agreed by both sides that my ruling only affects the five defendants who 
are listed for trial this week. 
 

 

 

 

 

24.	  At  previous  hearings  the  solicitors  representing  the  interests  of  their  clients 
 
 
have  been  keen  to  stress  that  they  do  not  want  their  clients  to  become  the 
victims of a dispute between the Bar and the Government.  I agree with them. 
 

    

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Similarly my decision on how to proceed in this case is taken without regard to 
the continuing dispute between the Bar and the MoJ.  I am only concerned with 
 
 
the merits of the arguments put before me and to ensure that a trial is only held 
if it can be conducted fairly in accordance with the principles long established 
 
in  this  country  and  which  are,  additionally,  enshrined  in  Article  6  of  the 
European Convention on Human Rights. 
 

 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
25.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FIRST ISSUE: CAN THE DEFENDANTS RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL NOW? 
 
26.	  Having been invited by Mr Larkin QC to strike out the last six lines of §15 of 
 
 
the Prosecution’s First Skeleton Argument, for the purposes of this application 
the  prosecution  accept  that  the  defence  took  reasonable  steps  to  find 
 
representation  up  to  mid  January  2014,  that,  presumably,  being  the  time  by 
 
which advocates would have needed to be instructed for the trial to take place 
in April.  It follows that I should approach this argument on the basis that the 
defendants  have  not  voluntarily  or  by  their  own  indolence  failed  to  obtain 
representation. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
27.	 

The  efforts  to  find  representation  included  contact  with  70  sets  of  chambers 
 
with barristers who hold themselves out as competent to undertake this sort of 
 
work in and outside London. 
   

 

28.	  By 15th  January 2014 there was one silk who put himself forward as willing to 
 

 

 

 

accept instructions.  He withdrew on 16th January. 
 

  

 

 
 

 

6
--------
29.	 

 

 

 
It  is  beyond  question  that  the  PDS  is  not  in  a  position  to  provide  sufficient 
representation  for  a  trial  beginning  in  April  2014.  Other  avenues  were 
explored which I will summarise later in this ruling. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30.	  Mr  Emmerson  QC  and  Mr  Larkin  QC,  have  in  written  and  oral  submissions 
accepted that, where through no fault of the defendants they are unrepresented, 
 
to  try  them  would  be  in  breach  of  their  common  law  rights  and  in  addition 
contrary to Article 6(3) of the Convention. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
31.	 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

 

 

 

It follows that there is common ground in respect of the First Issue: the case is 
 
ready for trial and the court has set aside the necessary time to hear this case. 
  
 
However none of the five defendants can receive a fair trial unrepresented. It 
follows that none of the five defendants can be tried now. 
 

 

 

 

That  is  not  an  end  to  the  matter.  At  the  hearing  on  23rd  December  2013  I 
 
included the following passage in my ruling: 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

“I cannot rule at this stage that it would be an abuse of the process of 
 
this court to try the defendants in four months time, nor do I know now 
 
whether in four months time an adjournment of an unknown amount of 
time may not cure the problem that the defendants now face… 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“I add… that, should any defendant fail to exploit the opportunity to get 
 
representation,  I judge that  to be  something  I could properly take  into 
 
 
account if this application to stay has to be made on 28th April 2014. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Meanwhile I will continue to manage this case for a first trial beginning 
on 28th April.” 
 

 

 

The Second Issue is, therefore, should I grant an adjournment?  First I set out 
the topics which I have considered in this regard. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
7
--------
FURTHER ENQUIRIES UNDERTAKEN TO OBTAIN REPRESENTATION 
 
34.	 

 

 

 

 

The continuing failure to secure advocates is relevant to my decision whether 
 
to grant an adjournment but I do not intend to review the painstaking enquiries 
 
to find advocates which have been undertaken jointly by the solicitors because 
 
it is sufficiently set out in the statements of Lee Adams, Ilana Hutton (7th  and 
 
24th April) and Amy Shaffron (7th, 24th and 25th April) and in their exhibits. 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
35.	 

 

 

 

 

 

The  process  was  repeated  after  27th  March  2014  when  an  agreement  was 
 
reached between the MoJ and the Bar in relation to the Graduated Fee Scheme 
(see  the  Chairman  of  the  Criminal  Bar  Association’s  statement,  ALS/14). 
  
Schedules have been prepared to show the position over time as more and more 
 
chambers confirmed that they had no counsel available and willing to work on 
 
VHCC cases.  The second statement of Ms Shaffron sets out the results of her 
latest  attempts  to  find  counsel.  She  has  responses  from  69  chambers  to  the 
 
 
effect that they are unwilling to accept this case as a VHCC. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36.	  When the prosecution identified a further 58 sets of chambers who undertook 
criminal  work  in  their  skeleton  dated  Sunday  27th  April  2014,  the  defence 
 
immediately began the task of contacting those chambers on the Monday whilst 
 
I  heard  argument.  Of  the  35  that  they  were  able  to  contact,  four  needed  to 
 
 
check with their members but the other 31 had no one available. 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 
37.	 

Enquiries  have  been  made  without  success  with  the  Bar  of  Northern  Ireland 
 
and  the  Faculty  of  Advocates  in  Edinburgh,  including  those  with  dual 
 
qualifications which allow them to appear in courts in England and Wales. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38.	  Whilst the solicitors in this case have been invaluable in the preparation of the 
 
defence cases to  the date appointed  for trial, no one suggests that  any of  the 
 
firms have Higher Court Advocates (“HCA”) capable of conducting the trial on 
 
behalf of their clients.  However they conducted enquiries with 90 other firms 
 
of solicitors to see whether they could provide HCA’s, and none were willing 
to take on the case (see Hutton Stt. §37). 
 

 
 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
8
--------
39.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  was  critical  of  the  process  undertaken  by  the  defence, 
questioning  whether  the  enquiries  addressed  whether  an  advocate  would  be 
 
 
available  for  April  or  whether  they  would  be  available  at  some  stage  in  the 
future to represent a defendant under the VHCC scheme.  He pointed to the fact 
 
that  the  hunt  for  in-house  advocates  had  tended  to  concentrate  on  the  Magic 
Circle firms rather than  the  many  smaller  firms  of solicitors who  employ in­
 
house  advocates.  He  also  points  to  whether  the  Bar’s  resolve  not  to  accept 
VHCC work at the present rates may weaken as time passes. 
  

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
40.	 

 

 
In my judgement, whilst Mr Larkin QC raises important issues in this respect, 
the effort put in by the defence to find trial advocates has been very substantial 
 
indeed and has been unsuccessful. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

41.	  Mr Larkin QC also suggests that, if there are insufficient QC’s available, the 
 
representation order could be amended to allow for two juniors or just a junior 
acting on his own.  For my part, where a certificate for a QC and junior is only 
 
 
given in exceptional circumstances and based on factors including the size and 
complexity of a case, I can see no reason why the defence should seek to alter 
 
 
the order.  I remind myself that it is the duty of the State to provide advocates 
at  the  required  level  of  competence  and  experience  pursuant  to  the  court’s 
interpretation of the government’s own legislation.  It is not for the defence to 
 
cut its just entitlement to representation to suit the State. 
  

    

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
42.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  suggested  that,  in  order  to  make  the  trial  fair  and  prevent  it 
being stopped as an abuse, were the level of representation to be reduced for 
 
the  defence  then  that  might  result  in  the  prosecution  or  the  judge  using  his 
powers  of  trial  management  to  decline,  for  instance,  to  entertain  the 
 
 
prosecution’s application to adduce bad character.  That is an issue pertinent to 
this  case  because  the  prosecution  has  served  a  full  A4  file  of  documents  in 
respect of bad character applications. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9
--------
Such a submission, whilst well intentioned, would result in a perversion of the 
trial process; the better defended a defendant is, the more likely he is to have 
 
his bad character adduced.  The overriding objective of the Criminal Procedure 
Rules to deal with criminal trials justly is, therefore, subverted by failure of the 
 
State to provide adequate representation. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Following the argument to its logical conclusion, and having in mind principles 
 
 
of equality of arms, if the defence were unable to find the QC’s to which their 
Representation Order entitles them, would the Crown be invited to reduce its 
own  representation  by  removing  Mr  Larkin  QC  from  the  prosecution  team 
which  presently  comprises  a  Silk  and  two  juniors?  Criminal  trials  of  this 
 
complexity rely on the skills of highly competent and experienced advocates on 
both  sides  to  reduce  issues,  make  matters  understandable  to  a  jury  and  keep 
 
 
trials to a reasonable length.

THE PUBLIC DEFENCE SERVICE 
 
45.	 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The  solicitors  have  been  in  regular  contact  with  the  PDS,  with  Byrne  & 
 
Partners  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  all  the  solicitors  involved  in  this  case. 
  
Moving  on  from  initial  problems  obtaining  sufficiently  detailed  CV’s  of  the 
 
QC’s who had joined the service so as to give them and their clients the ability 
 
February  2014  Mr 
to  make  an  informed  decision  as  to  choice,  on 
Marshalsay of the PDS gave the details of an HCA who had joined the service 
 
but seemed to accept that she had insufficient experience to undertake this sort 
 
of case (ILH/13).

46.	  By 7th  February 2014 (ILH/15) it became clear that one silk was immediately 
 
available to be instructed and that a second would be available by the end of 
 
February  but  issues  arose  over  Paragraph  7  of  the  original  PDS  Code  of 
 
Conduct which did not permit an employee to act for a client where to do so 
would give rise to a conflict of interest including in circumstances where “…a 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10
--------
client’s  best  interests  conflicts  with  the  interests  of…another  client  of  the 
 
salaried service…”. 
 

 

 

47.	  Although the solicitors were told that the Code was under review, they judged, 
 
because the Code was binding on all parties, that where there was a potential 
conflict  between  the  defendants,  it  would  not  be  ethically  proper  to  proceed 
 
until the Code had been amended.  I do not criticise them for that decision. 
 

 
    

 

 

 

 

 

48.	  By an email dated 20th  February 2014 (ILH/19), the defence for Mr Daley set 
 

 

 

out the issues they had with instructing advocates from the PDS: 
 

 

 

It had been determined that the defendant should have a silk and a 
junior and, the PDS could only offer one silk immediately available 
and no junior. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In total they were being offered the choice between two silks from 
the entire list of silks who are able to practice in England and Wales. 
  
They would be failing in their professional duty to advise their client, 
 
as a matter of expediency, to accept one or those two silks of whom 
they have had no experience and cannot personally vouch for.  They 
 
felt bound to advise their client to wait to see whether the choice will 
 
increase and a junior counsel will become available. 
 

 
  

 

 

 

 

   

  
  
 

The  conflict  of  interest  issue  remained  unresolved.  The  solicitors 
 
discovered  for  themselves  that  the  Code  was  amended  in  March 
 
2014.  Despite the amendment to the  Code, the issue has not  gone 
 
away.  In a letter dated 17th  April 2014 (ILH/37) Byrne and Partners 
 
raised real practical issues in respect of conflict and have asked for 
 
reassurances as to how matters would be handled by the PDS.  These 
 
have  subsequently  been  addressed  in  a  letter  dated  23rd  April  from 
the PDS (ILH/41).

49.	  On 20th  March a letter was sent from the  LAA to all VHCC contract holders 
 
reminding  them  that  they  must  explore  all  possible  avenues  to  find 
 
representation, reinforcing this requirement with the sanction that failure to do 
so would amount to a fundamental breach of  the contract which  may lead to 
 
termination of the contract and such termination would be considered in respect 
of any further tender for a VHCC contract. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
50.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

That same day the PDS was emailed (ILH/26) and asked what the position as to 
recruitment was.  They were told that interviews were taking place at all levels. 
  
By 3rd  April the PDS informed them that they had completed their “…first and 
 
very successful round of recruitment.”  The recruits would be joining over the 
 
“coming weeks”.  Four CV’s were attached and subsequently the solicitors for 
Mr  Daley  were  told  that  four  counsel  were  available  for  the  trial.  On  21st 
 
 
March the PDS sent an email to Petrou’s solicitors (ILH/27) which stated that, 
having reviewed  the  position  with  one  of  their  QC’s,  it  was not  thought  that 
there would be sufficient time to prepare.  Counsel would be available to apply 
 
for an adjournment of the trial to allow for preparation. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
51.	  Clarification of start dates of employed advocates was provided by the PDS on 
17th  April  (ILH/29).  The  defence  were  told  that  both  QC’s  that  were  to  be 
 
 
available  were  now  unwell.  The  juniors  could  start  with  “near-immediate 
 
effect”.  The  PDS  felt  that  the  advocates  could  assess  how  long  they  would 
 
need  to  prepare  and  support  the  defence  in  putting  this  information  before  a 
 
court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52.	  On 17th  April the PDS provided an update on availability (ILH/39) which set 
 
 
out that they had three QC’s, one of whom was preparing for a 14 week trial 
due to start on 8th September 2014, one was ill but could take instructions prior 
 
 
to his return in four weeks and one was unavailable until September.  In May 
 
two senior and one junior advocate would become available, in June a further 
 
QC, five senior and a junior advocate would come into the service and another 
 
senior advocate by  July.  There  were further  conditional offers  for two  more 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
12
--------
senior advocates who may start in May and June and two QC’s who may start 
in June and July.  The expected size of the PDS advocacy unit by the end of 
 
July is six QC’s, ten Senior HCA’s and two junior HCA’s. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 
53.	 

 

I  was  provided  with  a  further  update  during  the  proceedings  by  Ms  Clare 
 
 
Toogood: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

   
 
 

(a)	  No  QC’s  are  available  at  present.  One  will  be  available  in  four 
 
weeks, another from 2nd  July, a third from “later in the summer” but 
 
he is recouping from, I understand it, a serious health problem and he 
 
would need to be spoken to as to when he may be able to read into 
the case.  One is due to start a 12 week case in September.  Having in 
mind the time required for preparation and the burden of preparing 
and  presenting  a  defence  in  a  complex  fraud,  I  judge  that  two  of 
those  silks  are  very  unlikely  to  be  available  to  take  instructions  in 
 
this case. 
 

  
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(b)	 

 
(c)	 

 
(d)	 

Two more unnamed QC’s are due to start in June and July and would 
be available. 
 

 

  

There is a list of ten other advocates and two further advocates who 
 
are due to join the PDS who will become available.  That list does 
 
not  distinguish  between  junior  and  senior  advocates.  No  criteria 
have  been  drawn  to  my  attention  as  to  how  the  PDS  makes  that 
 
distinction but Ms Toogood has stated that all the senior advocates 
 
have  led  in  the  past.  Whilst  the  figures  do  not  entirely  coincide 
between  the  documents,  making  use  of  an  email  received  on  17th 
 
the 
April 
 
 
overwhelming  preponderance  of  the  juniors  employed  by  the  PDS 
qualify as leading juniors. 
 

from  Mr  Marshalsay, 
 

I  calculate 

(ILH/42) 
 

that 
 

   
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are no plans at present to recruit any more advocates.

(e)	  Advocates will be allotted to cases following the “cab rank rule” on a 

 

 

 

 
 

first come, first served basis.

(g)	 

They are employed to work a 37 hour week but would be expected to 
work to finish a particular task. 
   

   

 

 

The PDS consider that, with the revised Code, they can manage all 
 
 
conflicts. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

54.	  A number of issues arise in respect of the use of the PDS.  Firstly, the defence 
 
accept that they are required to make use of advocates employed by the PDS if 
 
 
they  are  available.  Article  6(3)(c)  allows  everyone  charged  with  a  criminal 
offence the minimum right: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“to  defend  himself  in  person  or  through  legal  assistance  of  his  own 
 
choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to 
be given it free when the interests of justice so require.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 
55.	 

 
56.	 

 

 
I  have  been  referred  to  Croissant  v.  Germany  (1993)  16  E.H.R.R.  135  in 
 
respect of the right to a choice of representation where the state pays for legal 
assistance.  There is a difference in the emphasis put on this  decision by  Mr 
Emmerson QC for the Crown and Mr Cameron QC as to the interpretation to 
 
be given to the decision. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

In that case the court appointed Mr Hauser to represent Croissant although the 
 
court knew that he had no confidence in Mr Hauser.  At §29 the court stated 
 
that: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
“…not  withstanding  the  importance  of  a  relationship  of  confidence 
 
between lawyer and client, that right [to counsel of his own choosing] 
cannot be considered to be absolute.  It is necessarily subject to certain 
 
limitations where free legal aid is concerned  and also where, as in the 
 
present case, it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice 
  
require  that  the  accused  be  defended  by  counsel  appointed  by  them. 
 
When appointing counsel the national courts must certainly have regard 
 
to  the  defendant’s  wishes:  indeed,  German  law  contemplates  such  a 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
14
--------
57.	 

 
58.	 

 
59.	 

  

 
course.  However they can override those wishes when there are relevant 
and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests 
 
of justice” 
 

 

 

 

 
 
I have reminded myself that in that case the regional Court was of the view that 
 
Mr Hauser provided the best guarantees of an adequate defence and Croissant’s 
reasons for rejecting him were not valid. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  courts  here  have  taken  a  similar  line:  a  defendant  is  entitled  to  be 
represented  by  counsel  of  his  choice  if  that  is  reasonably  practicable.  That, 
 
 
however, will depend on the availability of counsel but also on the availability 
at the same time of a suitably equipped court, of the witnesses and a timescale 
 
 
appropriate to the case.  The overriding consideration must be the requirements 
of  justice  for  the  prosecution  and  the  defence,  see  R.  v.  De  Oliveira  [1997] 
 
 
Crim. L.R. 600. 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
In my judgment the defendants cannot hold out for independent counsel of their 
  
choice to become available and Mr Cameron QC does not seek to argue that. 
However, the solicitor acting for a defendant is under a duty to advise his client 
on  the  best  counsel  available  to  them  and  is  entitled  to  hold  off  instructing 
 
anyone until he has the best possible choice available to him, so long as that 
 
delay does not jeopardise the date set for trial and the ability of advocates to be 
 
trial ready by that date. 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60.	  Mr  Cameron  QC  has  raised  the  issue  of  the  effect  on  the  available  PDS 
   
employed  advocates  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  adjournment  of  this  trial. 
I 
have ascertained that, were I to grant an adjournment this trial could be heard 
on  15th  January  2015  with  the  second  trial  to  follow  on. 
 
   
If  that  is  not 
 
practicable then the case could not be listed until September 2015. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61.	  He suggests that other cases will become front runners for the available PDS 
advocates which will not leave sufficient advocates to prepare for and appear in 
   
a trial in January 2015. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
15
--------
62.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

Into  that equation  I have  to consider how  long would  be required  for  a PDS 
advocate to prepare for this trial.  Whilst I can see how the requirement to work 
 
until they finish a particular task might affect the hours that they work during 
trial, it would be unreasonable to expect employed advocates to work beyond 
 
 
their contracted hours week after week to prepare for a trial.  The first Junior 
counsel for the Crown has spent 1000 hours preparing this case.  That is not 
 
surprising bearing in mind the burden he has of preparing the case in respect of 
eight  defendants  and  drafting  a  substantial  volume  of  documentation.  The 
 
   
Crown has the benefit of a second junior who is instructed in the case and who, 
 
 
 
 
I suspect, is largely, but not exclusively, involved in the disclosure process. 

 
  

 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63.	  An  advocate appearing for  one defendant  will need substantially less  time to 
 
prepare, but it is hard to imagine that it would be less than, say, 450 hours. That 
 
 
would only allow him an hour to read every 100 pages without consideration of 
the 194 spreadsheets.  On the basis of a 37 hour week the advocate will need a 
minimum of twelve clear weeks out of court to prepare this case.  It means that 
the advocate must be available from early October until trial. 
 

 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64.	  Mr  Little  suggested  that  there  could  be  merit  in  all  the  current  VHCC  cases 
being listed before one judge in order to allocate resources accordingly.  There 
 
are  eight  other  trials  arising  from  six  prosecutions  which  are  due  to  begin 
between  September  2014  and  September  2015  and  which  will  require 
 
 
somewhere in excess of 21 defendants to be represented in addition to the eight 
defendants who need to have representation in this case.  Whilst the majority of 
 
the cases are listed at Southwark, there are cases listed at several other courts. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65.	  Whilst Mr Little’s submission had its attractions, apart from the improbability 
 
 
that other courts on other Circuits would release their cases, it would involve 
the nominated judge in decisions which went far outside trial management and 
 
 
which might involve him in selecting which defendants would have first choice 
of  advocate  or  in  making  other  decisions  which  would  involve  the  judge  in 
 
areas which lay outside his remit. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

16
--------
In my judgment whether there are sufficient employed advocates to cover this 
case when those same advocates may be required to prepare for and appear in 
 
other cases, is simply another matter which I have to take into account when 
deciding  whether  I  would,  in  granting  an  adjournment,  be  acting  purely 
 
speculatively as to whether the trial could ever take place. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
66.	 

 

 

 

 

 
CONFLICT AND THE USE OF PDS LAWYERS 
67.	  Mr  Cameron  QC  and  Mr  Adams  identify  that  there  is  a  conflict  between 
 
 
Crawley  and  Walker. 
I  judge  that  §7.3(b)  of  the  amended  PDS  Code  of 
 
   
 
Conduct,  which  sets  out  that  where  conflict  arises  the  PDS  lawyer  must 
“explain that the client is free to be represented by other legal representatives 
 
outside  the  PDS  Advocacy  Service”,  must  envisage  other  advocates  being 
 
available in independent practice. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68.	  Whilst  I  agree  with  Mr  Little  that  I  should  place  little  value  on  it  for  the 
 
purposes of this argument because it is unknown whether any defendant would 
 
avail  himself  of  that  opportunity  or  would  be  content  to  remain  with  a  PDS 
lawyer  and  make  use  of 
the  “enhanced  confidentiality  provisions”  I 
nevertheless  have  to  allow  for  the  views  expressed  by  Mr  Adams  that  the 
 
advice he would expect a solicitor to give to his client in such circumstances is 
 
that he should take the option provided by §7.3(b).  I should, therefore have in 
 
mind whether any legal representatives outside of the PDS will be available to 
 
 
the defendant(s) affected. 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
THE USE OF COURT TIME AND THE EFFECT OF GRANTING AN ADJOURNMENT 
 
69.	 
 

I  have  already  indicated  that  this  court  could  hear  this  trial  on  15th  January. 
 
  
The  effect  of  that  would  be  to  push  the second  trial  back to  March  2015  or, 
 
allowing the advocates, and perhaps the judge, a short break between trials, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17
--------
April.  To  accommodate  this  additional  strain  on  the  court’s  resources,  other 
 
cases will have to be delayed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

It is of note that the figures for trial receipts at this court for the year to March 
 
 
2014 shows a 58% increase over last year.  The London Courts overall have 
seen a 26% increase in trial receipts.  The sitting profile for London, that is the 
 
 
number  of  court  days  which  each  court  is  allowed  to  sit,  will  continue  to be 
 
under considerable stress for the foreseeable future.  It follows that it is highly 
unlikely  that  the  work  which  would  have  to  be  moved  to  accommodate  this 
 
trial in January will find a home in any of the other London courts. 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  no  wonder  that  §3.2.(2)(f)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Rules  requires  the 
 
court  in  furthering  the  overriding  objective  which  I  referred  to  earlier,  to 
 
 
“discourage delay, dealing with as many aspects of the case as possible on the 
 
same occasion and avoiding unnecessary hearings”.  Further, at §3.8 the court 
is required at any hearing at which the case cannot be concluded to “there and 
 
then…give directions so that it can be concluded at the next hearing or as soon 
as possible after that.”  The relevance of that paragraph to the adjournment of a 
trial is emphasised by the first entreaty that follows those words, that is for the 
trial judge to decide whether, where a defendant fails to attend, the trial should 
 
continue in his absence. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is part of my responsibility to take into account the effect on other cases of 
 
 
I  remind 
 
adjourning  the  hearing  for  which  court  time  has  been  put  aside. 
   
myself that finding another three month slot for this case is bound to delay the 
 
trials of other defendants through no fault of their own. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I also  remind  myself  that,  in  resisting severance,  Mr  Larkin  QC  drew  to  my 
attention the effect of delay on the second trial.  I did not judge that a delay to 
 
January  2015  was  so  detrimental  as  to  make  that  trial  unfair.  However  if  I 
 
grant  the  adjournment  of  the  first  trial  with  the  second  to  follow,  I  am  now

faced with that second trial going back by approximately a year from this April 
 
when it might otherwise have been tried with eight defendants. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74.	  Mr  Larkin  QC  put  forward  during  argument  that,  if  there  are  insufficient 
 
 
resources to try five defendants together, there should be a trial of an individual 
defendant or some defendants who have managed to find an advocate and he 
 
submitted  that  this  is  a  better  solution  than  preventing  the  prosecution  from 
being brought at all.  With respect to Mr Larkin QC, his suggestion will result 
in a series of up to eight trials, each of some substantial length, clogging up this

SECOND ISSUE: SHOULD THE PROSECUTION BE GRANTED AN ADJOURNMENT? 
 
 
75.	 

 
 
I  am  invited  by  the  prosecution  to  grant  an  adjournment  to  prevent  the  case 
 
being stayed.  No party submits that a temporary stay is available in a criminal 
trial; that is simply another way of describing an adjournment. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
76.	 

 

The  prosecution  rely  on  Attorney  General’s  Reference  No.  2  of  2001  [2003] 
 
 
   
I  accept  the  principle  that  a  stay  will  never  be  an  appropriate 
UKHL  68. 
 
 
 
remedy  where  a  lesser  remedy  would  adequately  vindicate  the  defendant’s 
   
 
In  the  context  of  this  case  they  argue  that,  if  an 
Convention  rights. 
 
adjournment  to  January  2015  or  even  September  2015  would  allow  for 
 
appropriate  representation  of  the  accused,  then  that  should  be  the  course 
 
adopted rather than to stay the proceedings now. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
77.	  However in circumstances where it is accepted that the defendants cannot have 
a  fair  trial  now,  in  deciding  whether  an  adjournment  would  adequately 
 
vindicate the defendant’s Convention rights, I have to consider whether there is 
 
a realistic prospect of a fair trial in January or September.  If there is not, then 
 
an adjournment cannot cure the problem that has arisen. 

   
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
19
--------
78.	  A  “realistic  prospect”  in  these  circumstances  connotes  something  less  than 
certainty  but  which  is  a  real  and  practical  prospect  of  the  trial  proceeding 
 
within  a  reasonable  time  frame.  It  must  be  something  more  than  a  fanciful 
prospect.  The  Crown  prefers  the  wording  “reasonable  prospect”  but  I do  not 
 
 
judge that there is any material difference in meaning between the two phrases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
79.	 

 

 

In  determining whether  I should  grant  an  adjournment  at  all  and  in  deciding 
whether there is a reasonable prospect of this case being tried in the future,  I 
have considered the following factors:­

 

 

 

 

 

 
(a)	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Failure to grant an adjournment will deprive the victims of crime of 
 
  
the opportunity to see those that they judge responsible prosecuted. 
To deny them that opportunity should not be lightly taken.  Against 
 
 
that I judge that there are other  methods available to the victims to 
 
recover  their  losses  civilly  and  there  are  other  regulatory  offences 
which could be brought against the defendants which may not meet 
the gravamen of the conduct alleged but which could mark out their 
 
alleged misconduct and prevent them from being able to take a rôle 
in corporate activity in the future. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
responsibility 

(b)	  Although  the  FCA  is  answerable  to  HM  Treasury  rather  than  the 
Attorney General, it is nevertheless an arm of the State which brings 
 
 
to  provide  adequate 
this  prosecution. 
 
 
representation  at  public  expense  is  also  the  responsibility  of  the 
 
 
State. 
I  have  considered  whether  the  State  should  in  those 
 
circumstances  be  entitled  to  benefit  from  its  own  failure  by  being 
granted an adjournment. 
 

The 

   

 

 

 

 

 
(c)	 

The State also provides at public expense the court in which the case 
 
is to be tried.  An adjournment of the trial will involve an additional 
 
stress on the State’s provision of resources to try crime. 
 

  

 

 

 

20
--------
(d)	  Whilst the PDS has provided a pool of available advocates at public 
expense, it is so small so that it is insufficient to cover all the VHCC 
 
cases due to be tried unless control of listing these cases becomes no 
longer a judicial function but one effectively controlled and dictated 
 
 
by the availability of the PDS advocates.  That would be a dangerous 
precedent, see De Oliveira. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(e)	 

 

Bearing in mind availability and preparation time required I am not 
 
satisfied  that  sufficient  PDS advocates  would  be  available  to  assist 
the defendants in this trial.  It is not in the interests of justice to try 
  
each defendant separately. 
  

 

 

 

 

 
(f)	 

I have no reason to think that there is a realistic prospect that the Bar 
 
will accept contracts in VHCC cases on the present terms. 
 

 

 

 

 

(g)	  Whilst Article 6(3) does not provide the legally aided defendant with 
the right to an advocate of his choice, it still permits the solicitor to 
 
carry out his duty to assess which available advocate would best suit 
 
his client’s case.  A solicitor is entitled to delay that choice until the 
 
moment that he judges the pool from which to choose is at its height. 
  
That may be at any time between now and early October. 
 

 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CONCLUSION 
 

 
80.	 

 

I  have  reminded  myself  that  a  stay  should  only  be  granted  in  exceptional 
 
 
circumstances and that in most cases an adjournment can cure what otherwise 
 
might amount to an abuse of the process of the court.

I have  taken  into  account  that  it  is  common  ground  between  the  parties  that 
 
where the defendant is not at fault, in a case of this complexity the defendants 
could not receive a fair trial without advocates to represent them. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I have  considered  The  Crown  Prosecution  Service  v.  Cambell;  McInerney  v. 
 
The  Financial  Services  Authority;  The  Medicines  and  Healthcare  Products 
Regulatory Agency v. Carlton [2009] EWCA Crim 997 in which the Court of 
 
Appeal dealt with applications to stay confiscation proceedings because  there 
 
was no appropriate representation.  In giving the judgment of the court, Hooper 
 
LJ said: 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“We reached the conclusion that the fact that in the future an adequately 
 
funded  advocate  may  be  available  was  no  justification  for  an 
 
adjournment. The problem identified in this case is not a new one: see 
e.g. the decision of HHJ Mole QC reported on BAILII as P [2008] EW 
 
Misc 2 (EWCC). That decision was handed down over a year ago.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I agree with Mr Little that I should not read too much into that decision where 
 
 
the issues were different from those that I face, not least in that I am dealing 
with  a  decision  whether  to  grant  an  adjournment  in  respect  of  a  serious 
 
allegation which is as yet unproven.  However it does provide some support for 
 
the care that  I should take  before  granting an  adjournment  where there is  no 
 
realistic prospect that in the future a suitable advocate will be available. 
 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

84.	  Having considered all these matters I am compelled to conclude that, to allow 
 
the  State  an  adjournment  to  put  right  its  failure  to  provide  the  necessary 
 
resources to permit a fair trial to take place now amounts to a violation of the 
 
 
process of this court. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
85.	 

 

 

 

 

The knock-on effect on other trials, the waste of court resources and the need to 
disregard  the  Criminal  Procedure  Rules  designed  to  protect  the  court  system 
from abuse and to ensure that scare resources are used to best effect all, in my 
 
 
judgment, add to the reasons why an adjournment should not be granted. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22
--------
86.	 

 
87.	 

 

 

 

 

   
 

Even if I am wrong about that, I further find that there is no realistic prospect 
that sufficient advocates would be available for this case to be tried in January 
 
  
2015  from  any  of  the  sources  available  to  the  defence,  including  the  PDS. 
Whatever  reason  is  put  forward  by  the  party  applying,  the  court  does  not 
 
ordinarily grant adjournments on a speculative basis. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  be  unconscionable  to  put  this  trial  off  to  September  2015  with  the 
 
 
second trial being heard in 2016.  On what I now know, there is no basis on 
which I could find that the availability of advocates would be any different then 
 
 
than it will be in January 2015.  In addition it is likely to lead to a violation of 
the reasonable time requirement in Article 6(1). 
  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
88.	 

In those circumstances I stay the proceedings against these five defendants.

Sir Brian Leveson P : 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
1.	 

This is an application by the prosecution for leave to appeal a decision dated 1 May 
2014 of His Honour Judge Leonard Q.C. sitting in the Crown Court at Southwark in 
which he stayed a prosecution initiated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
in relation to a trial which had been due to commence with a jury on 6 May.  Notice 
of intention to appeal pursuant to s. 58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was given 
within the period allowed by the judge and it was acknowledged that the respondents 
would  be  entitled  to  be  acquitted  should  leave  not  be  obtained  or  the  appeal 
abandoned.  It has been referred to the full court by the Registrar on the basis that if 
leave is granted, the appeal will follow.  We do grant leave. 

 
2.	 

The background to the indictment has been identified by the judge in the following 
succinct way (which we gratefully adopt): 

“1. The [respondents] are charged with offences of conspiracy 
to defraud, possessing criminal property and offences contrary 
to s.19 and 23(1), and s.177(4)(a) of the Financial Services and 
Markets  Act  2000.  The  evidence  is  complex  and  substantial. 
The volume of papers amounts to some 46,030 pages. There are 
in  addition  194  excel  spreadsheets  with  a  combined  total  of 
864,200 lines of entry. The Case Summary covers 55 pages. 

2. In essence the Crown alleges that between 2008 and 2011 the 
defendants  were  involved  in  a  land  banking  scheme  using, 
variously, three limited companies. Those companies acquired, 
or  purported  to  acquire,  sites  which  were  then  divided  into  a 
number of sub-plots. It is alleged that those sub-plots were then 
aggressively  marketed  to  members  of  the  public  –  often 
vulnerable members of the public – who were persuaded to buy 
based on false representations as to the nature of the company 
selling  the  sub-plots,  the  professionals  they  employed,  as  to 
planning  permission,  potential  purchasers  of  the  sites  for 
 
onward  development  and 
their  previous  success.  Some 
 
purchasers were given good title, some were not, and some sub­
plots  were  sold  more  than  once.  Various  interventions  by  the 
 
FSA  (as  it  then  was)  to  stop  the  practices  were  subverted  by 
transferring the fraudulent scheme to a new company. ” 
 

 
3.	 

The investigation and prosecution have been in the hands of the FCA and it is clearly 
an extremely important but complex case.  Following arrests in November 2011, the 
respondents  (and  three  others)  were  subsequently  charged  in  April  2013  with  the 
offences.  Having been transferred from the City of London Magistrates Court, on 21 
May 2013 it was listed before the Recorder of Westminster when the trial was fixed 
for 28 April 2014.  On 10 July 2013, the court made appropriate representation orders 
and,  on  22  July,  the  case  was  classified  by  the  Legal  Aid  Authority  (“LAA”)  as  a 
Very High Cost Case (VHCC).  Counsel were instructed.

7.	 

Meanwhile, a review of legal aid was being undertaken and, in order to bear down on 
the  cost  of  legal  aid  in  criminal  cases,  in  September  2013  the  Ministry  of  Justice 
(“MoJ”)  announced  its  intention  to  institute  a  number  of  changes  including  a 
 
reduction in the fees payable under the Graduated Fee Scheme and a cut by 30% in 
the  rate  of  remuneration  paid  to  counsel  in  VHCC  cases.    Dissatisfied  with  this 
decision, the Bar Standards Board (which had been reviewing the position with the 
 
Legal Services Board since 2012), with effect from 6 January 2014, made clear that 
VHCC  cases  were  not  within  what  had  been  the  ‘deeming’  provision  of  Rule  604 
(dealing with reasonable remuneration).  The concept of deeming has been removed 
and as the Bar Standards Board has put it: 

“Individual barristers will have to judge for themselves whether 
 
the fee offered is a proper fee, whether the work is legally aided 
or privately funded, and if they reasonably conclude that it is 
not, objectively, a proper fee, the CRR will not oblige them to 
take the work.” 

Although the MoJ later revoked the decision in relation to trials commencing prior to 
31  March  2014,  in  all  other  cases  the  date  upon  which  members  of  the  Bar  were 
 
required to decide whether to accept a VHCC contract on the new terms was set at 2 
December 2013.   The effect was stark.  As Judge Leonard put it: 

 

“In  this  and  every  other  case  which  did  not  fall  within  the 
 
concession  provided  by  the  MoJ  [counsel]  declined  to  accept 
instructions.” 

On  14  November,  concern  was  being  expressed  by  a  defence  solicitor,  that  there 
would be insufficient time for counsel to be ready for trial but an application to vacate 
the trial date was refused:  had it been granted, there would have been no question of 
the  prosecution  being  stayed.    By  23  December,  with  no  counsel  available,  it  was 
 
submitted  that  the  prosecution  was  an  abuse  of  process.    Some  argued  that  it  was 
premature to decide that issue. In the event the application was adjourned.   

Ways forward continued to be aired.  An offer to declassify the case so that it fell 
within  the  Graduated  Fee  Scheme  was  rejected  on  the  basis  that  remuneration  for 
 
reading beyond 10,000 pages would only be resolved ex post facto without guarantee 
 
of any payment.  Meanwhile, the Public Defender Service (“PDS”), a department 
of  the  LAA  providing  criminal  defence  services,  operating  alongside  private 
 
practitioners, began actively to recruit a pool of employed advocates to take on 
work that might otherwise  have been done  by  independent  advocates.  By  23 
January, there were three Q.C.s and no juniors but, in any event, there was a 
concern  about  potential  conflicts  of  interest.    This  last  issue  has  since  been 
resolved on the basis that the approach to be adopted by those employed by the 
PDS  reflects  the  approach  taken  by  independent  members  of  chambers  (who 
frequently act in the same case for those with conflicting interests): before us, 
Alexander Cameron Q.C. for the respondents accepted that the point had little 
value.

8.	 

 
9.	 

 
10.	 

On  17  January,  Judge  Leonard  severed  the  indictment  and  on  24  January 
endorsed a decision that the five respondents should be tried on 28 April (with 
the  jury  required  on  6  May)  with  a  time  estimate  of  2½  to  3  months.    The 
remaining  three  defendants  were  to  face  trial  on  15  January  2015  with  an 
estimate of 6-8 weeks. 
 

 
In the meantime, while negotiations with the MoJ continued, members of the 
Bar took part in what were described as days of action and instituted a policy of 
refusing  to  accept  ‘returns’  (that  is,  briefs  which  the  barrister  originally 
instructed  could  no  longer  undertake).    On  27  March  2014,  after  the  Lord 
Chancellor had agreed to defer the reductions to Graduated Fees until 2015, the 
Chairman of the Criminal Bar Association publicly stated: 
 

 
“Whilst it is an individual choice for any barrister as to what 
work  they  choose  to  do,  there  is  no  objection  in  principle  to 
barristers who want to work on VHCCs undertaking such cases 
if they choose to do so.” 

In  the  event,  no  suitably  qualified  advocate  was  prepared  to  sign  a  VHCC 
 
contract in this (or indeed any other) case.  So it was, on 28 April, a month after 
the last change of approach but before the position was able to develop further, 
that  Judge  Leonard  considered  an  application  to  stay  the  prosecution  as  an 
abuse of process: at that time, none of the respondents had been able to find 
counsel to instruct.  Mr Cameron Q.C appeared pro bono to argue the point on 
the behalf of all the defendants other than Daniel Forsyth, who was represented 
by Mr Adams, although, in order to deal with the possibility that they might not 
have been represented, at the request of the judge Tom Little was instructed by 
the Attorney General as amicus curiae. 
 

The Approach of Judge Leonard 
   

 

11.	  A number of principles were broadly agreed between the parties.  These were 
 
summarised in the skeleton argument submitted by the FCA in support of this 
appeal as follows: 
 

“i. In the circumstances of this case, it would be unfair to try 
the defendants if they wished to be represented and, through no 
fault of their own, they were not represented. 

ii.  At  the  time  the  trial  was  due  to  start  (6  May  2014)  the 
defendants would not be represented by advocates who had had 
sufficient time to prepare the case. 

iii. The reason for the absence of advocates was the collective 
refusal of the self employed Bar to accept the reduction in fees 
payable to advocates under the VHCC regime (as of December
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

2013)  leading  to  advocates  returning  their  instructions  or  not 
accepting instructions. 

iv.  If a competent advocate were available, the defendant could 
not  refuse  to  instruct  him  and  claim  he  was  involuntarily 
unrepresented. 

 

v.  There was no fault on the part of the FCA.” 

 
12.	 

 
13.	 

 
14.	 

 
15.	 

The  only  difference  was  in  the  sixth  principle,  namely  the  test  to  be  applied.   The 
 
applicant articulated the test as whether there was a realistic prospect of competent 
 
advocates with sufficient time to prepare being available in the foreseeable future; the 
respondents,  on  the  other  hand,  submitted  that  in  place  of  the  words  “in  the 
foreseeable future” should be “within a reasonable time frame”.  In any event, it was 
 
agreed  that  if  there  was  such  a  prospect  (however  defined),  an  adjournment  would 
cure any unfairness.  This difference did not affect the nature of the judge’s analysis 
and could not affect the result. 

In the circumstances, the judge approached the application by considering two issues. 
 
The first was whether the then defendants could receive a fair trial at that time (based 
on the premise that no preparation by any advocate had been undertaken for such a 
 
trial).  Given that the case was ready for trial, that issue required a consideration of the 
steps  by  each  defendant  taken  to  find  counsel  (or  anyone  employed  by  the  PDS) 
 
prepared to undertake the case.  The judge reached the conclusion that proper efforts 
had been undertaken by all defence solicitors to obtain representation so that it was no 
fault of their own that they were unrepresented.  It was common ground that, in those 
circumstances,  to  try  them  would  be  a  breach  of  their  common  law  rights  and,  in 
addition,  contrary  to  Article  6(3)  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights 
(“ECHR”).  This conclusion remains agreed and is not challenged. 

The second issue was whether he should grant an adjournment (as originally had been 
sought  by  at  least  one  of  the  respondents  during  the  previous  December).    Before 
addressing the ultimate question, he analysed a number of considerations, viz. further 
enquiries to obtain representation, the PDS and the use of court time.  He accepted the 
principle that a stay will never be an appropriate remedy where a lesser remedy would 
adequately vindicate the defendant’s ECHR rights. However, in considering whether 
 
it would be appropriate to adjourn, he addressed the question of whether there was a 
 
realistic prospect of a fair trial in January or September 2015 on the basis that, if there 
was not, an adjournment would not provide an adequate remedy to the problem that 
had arisen. 

In that context, the judge found that the PDS pool of available advocates (which did, 
at least prospectively, include a number of Queen’s Counsel) was insufficient to cover 
 
all the VHCC cases due to be tried, and that the respondents were entitled to delay 
instructing an advocate until October in order to choose the best available advocate 
for their case. The judge also took account of the pressure that an adjournment would 
place  on  the  State’s  provision  of  resources  to  prosecute,  the  fact  that  the  State  is
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

responsible for providing adequate representation and the consequence of refusing an 
adjournment,  namely  that  the  victims  of  alleged  crime  would  be  deprived  of  the 
opportunity to see those that they consider responsible prosecuted. 

 
16.	 

The judge was not satisfied that sufficient PDS advocates would be available to assist 
the respondents and he did not think there was a realistic prospect that the Bar would 
accept contracts in VHCC cases on the present terms. His conclusions were that: 

“84.  I  am  compelled  to  conclude  that,  to  allow  the  State  an 
adjournment  to  put  right  its  failure  to  provide  the  necessary 
resources to permit a fair trial to take place now amounts to a 
violation of the process of this court. … 

86.  Even if I am wrong about that, I further find that there is no 
realistic  prospect  that  sufficient  advocates  would  be  available 
for  this  case  to  be  tried  in  January  2015,  from  any  of  the 
sources available to the defence, including the PDS.  Whatever 
 
reason is put forward by the party applying, the court does not 
ordinarily grant adjournments on a speculative basis.” 

 
17.	 

As  is  clear  from  decisions  such  as  Attorney  General’s  Reference  (No  2  of  2001) 
[2004] 2 AC 72, there are two categories of case in which the court has the power to 
stay proceedings for abuse of process.  These are, first, where the court concludes that 
the  accused  can  no  longer  receive  a  fair  hearing;  and,  second,  where  it  would 
otherwise be unfair to try the accused or, put another way, where a stay is necessary to 
protect the integrity of the criminal justice system.  The first limb focuses on the trial 
process  and  where  the  court  concludes  that  the  accused  would  not  receive  a  fair 
hearing  it  will  stay  the  proceedings;  no  balancing  exercise  is  required.  The  second 
 
limb concerns the integrity of the criminal justice system and applies where the Court 
 
considers  that  the  accused  should  not  be  standing  trial  at  all,  irrespective  of  the 
potential fairness of the trial itself. 

 
18.	 

Furthermore, it is clear from the authorities and beyond argument that there is a strong 
public  interest  in  the  prosecution  of  crime  and  in  ensuring  that  those  charged  with 
serious criminal offences are tried.  Ordering a stay of proceedings, which in criminal 
law  is  effectively  a  permanent  remedy,  is  thus  a  remedy  of  last  resort.    As  Lord 
Bingham observed in Attorney General’s Reference (No. 2 of 2001) supra (at para. 
24G): 

“The  public  interest  in  the  final  determination  of  criminal 
charges  requires  that  such  a  charge  should  not  be  stayed  or 
 
dismissed if any lesser remedy will be just and proportionate in 
all the circumstances.” 

 
19.	 

The threshold is, therefore, a high one.  This is all the more so where the fairness of 
the trial can be cured by expedition or adjournment or other steps, particularly where 
there may well be an opportunity as matters develop to repeat an abuse argument.
--------

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
20.	 

The judge’s primary conclusion (that a fair trial amounts to a violation of the process 
of the court) engages the second of the categories to which we have referred, namely, 
the integrity of the criminal justice system.  His alternative formulation (fair hearing) 
 
engages the first.  It is appropriate to deal with them in that order. 

Violation of the Process of the Court 

 
21.	 

 
22.	 

Elaborating upon the law in relation to this head of abuse, it has been described as 
arising “where it offends the court’s sense of justice and propriety to be asked to try 
the  accused  in  the  particular  circumstances  of  the  case”  (per  Lord  Lowry  in  R  v 
 
Horseferry  Road  Magistrates  Courts,  ex  p  Bennett  [1994]  1  AC  42,  at  74G)  and 
where to refuse a stay would lead to “the degradation of the lawful administration of 
justice” (per Rose LJ in R v Mullen [2000] QB 520, at 534 C-D).  The categories of 
cases in which it may be unfair to try the accused will include, but are not confined to, 
those cases where there has been bad faith, unlawfulness or executive misconduct. 

It has been said that “it would be unwise to attempt to describe such cases in advance” 
(per Lord Bingham in Attorney General’s Reference at para. 25D) and that “general 
guidance as to how the discretion should be exercised in particular circumstances will 
not be useful” (per Lord Steyn in R v Latif [1996] 1 WLR 104 at 113A).  Cases where 
 
the  courts  have  considered  this  type  of  abuse  of  process  to  arise  have  tended  to 
involve very serious examples of malpractice and unlawfulness: see, for example, ex p 
Bennett  (supra)  where  the  accused  had  been  brought  back  forcibly  to  the  UK  in 
 
disregard of available extradition procedures and Mullen (supra) in which the security 
 
services and police had procured M’s unlawful deportation from Zimbabwe. 

 

23.	  Where  there  has  been  alleged  bad  faith,  unlawfulness  or  executive  misconduct,  the 
court is concerned not to create the perception that it is condoning malpractice by law 
enforcement agencies or to convey the impression that it will adopt the approach that 
the  end  justifies  the  means:  the  touchstone  is  the  integrity  of  the  criminal  justice 
system.  This must be balanced against the potential criticism that the court is failing 
to protect the public from grave crimes.  This no doubt explains why cases which fall 
into this category “will be very exceptional”: see per Lord Bingham CJ in Attorney 
 
General’s Reference that (at para. 25D). 

 
24.	 

 
25.	 

Turning  to  this  case,  it  is  important  first  to  underline  that,  before  the  judge,  Mr 
Cameron Q.C did not put his application to stay the proceedings on the basis that a 
stay  was  necessary  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  criminal  justice  system:  not 
surprisingly, however, having the benefit of this finding, he sought to support it.   

Given that the judge had made clear (at para. 25) that his decision had to be taken 
“without regard to the continuing dispute between the Bar and the Ministry of Justice” 
and  that  he  was  “only  concerned  …  to  ensure  that  a  trial  is  only  held  if  it  can  be 
conducted fairly in accordance with the principles long established in this country”, it 
is  surprising  that  he  made  any  decision  attributing  fault.    Neither  is  this  the  only
--------

reference to failure and fault.  When dealing with the question of an adjournment, the 
judge said (at para. 79(b)):

27.	 

For the prosecution, Mr Sean Larkin Q.C. argues that, by statute, the FCA is not to be 
 
regarded as acting on behalf of the Crown, and its members officers and staff are not 
to  be  regarded  as  Crown  servants:  see  para.  16  of  Schedule  1ZA  of  the  Financial 
Services and Markets Act 2000.  It is funded by the financial services industry and is 
a private company performing a public function with operational independence and 
without any responsibility for legal aid policy.  There is thus no question of seeking to 
benefit from its own failure. 

On this issue, without demur from the parties, we gave leave to the Lord Chancellor 
to  intervene  and  Mr  Anthony  Peto  Q.C.,  on  his  behalf,  argued  that  the  judge  had 
correctly identified the question as whether there was a realistic prospect of securing a 
fair trial in January or September 2015, and whether present unavailability of counsel 
could be characterised as the failure of the state was irrelevant.  If it was, however, the 
judge should not have made such a finding (particularly, it might be added, where the 
respondents  were  not  contending  for  it)  without  specifically  inviting  the  Lord 
Chancellor  to  deal  with  it:  having  (at  para.  25)  accepted  that  he  should  proceed 
“without  regard  to  the  continuing  dispute  between  the  MoJ  and  the  Bar”,  he  was 
failing  to  follow  his  own  direction.    In  fact,  policy  decisions  as  to  allocation  of 
resources (and, indeed, issues of ‘fault’) involve political value judgments, subject to 
democratic oversight by Parliament and, in the case of unlawfulness, impropriety or 
 
irrationality, judicial review. 

 

28.	  Mr Cameron Q.C argued that the statutory authority of the FCA was not brought to 
the attention of the judge and, in any event, that it is not inaccurate broadly to describe 
the  FCA  as  “an  arm  of  the  state”;  it  is  the  body  charged  by  the  state  with  the 
prosecution of certain types of offences.  He pointed to the fact that the indictment is 
 
brought  in  the  name  of  The  Queen  (although  that  is  the  convention  in  relation  to 
prosecutions on indictment even if brought by private prosecutors).  Another agency 
of  the  state  must  provide  adequate  representation  for  indigent  defendants:  in  that 
context, an adjournment does allow the state to benefit from its own failure. 

 
29.	 

In our judgment, it is quite wrong, for present purposes, to seek to link, effectively as 
one, the FCA as prosecuting authority and those responsible for the provision of legal 
 
aid or to speak of “its own failure” as if there was a joint enterprise in which both 
were involved.  Some prosecutions are undeniably brought by private organisations 
(such  as  the  Federation  against  Copyright  Theft);  some  by  independent  bodies
--------

established  by  statute  (such  as  the  FCA);  others  by  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service 
 
(itself independent of government albeit answerable to the Attorney General).  None 
have any power or ability to affect the exercise by the Lord Chancellor or the Ministry 
of Justice of its statutory responsibilities for legal aid. 

Neither would we be prepared to enter into the debate about fault.  This dispute arises 
 
because  the  Lord  Chancellor  has  restricted  funding  for  VHCC  and  independent 
practitioners are not presently minded to accept contracts under that scheme: they are 
fully entitled to take that view.  It is, however, undeniably the responsibility of the 
Lord Chancellor to address the need to provide legal representation for those involved 
in  the  most  complex  of  cases  and  the  present  difficulties  clearly  flow  from  his 
decision to reduce the funding.  How the present problem has arisen and whoever is to 
blame (if that is the right word) is neither here nor there.   

As  Davis  LJ  observed  in  argument,  the  responsibility  of  the  Lord  Chancellor  to 
provide resources to permit a fair trial to take place arises irrespective of the cause of 
a problem in so doing.  It would remain if the present unwillingness of the Bar arose 
not because of his decision to reduce fees but if, say, the Bar had decided to decline 
VHCC work unless he increased the fees by 30%.  Without commenting in any way 
on the merits of the dispute as to fees or as to the very necessary requirement for its 
 
resolution, to conclude that the State has violated the process of the court or that what 
has happened jeopardises the integrity of the criminal justice system (as opposed to its 
 
effective operation) is, quite simply, wrong as a matter of principle.  To that extent, 
the primary reason given by the judge for staying the prosecution is flawed.

Delay and Fair Trial 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

It is first necessary to consider the principles engaged in relation to this limb of abuse 
 
of process.  The test is encapsulated by Lord Dyson in R v Maxwell [2011] 1 WLR 
1837 (to which he referred in Warren v Attorney General for Jersey [2012] 1 AC 22) 
 
at para. 13.  A decision to stay under this limb required the conclusion that “it will be 
 
impossible to give the accused a fair trial”. 

Neither is it sufficient for there only to have been a delay in proceedings which could 
amount  to  a  breach  of  the  reasonable  time  guarantee  in  Article  6(1)  ECHR,  if  the 
accused has not also been prejudiced as a result of the delay. Reverting to Attorney 
 
General’s  Reference  (No.  2  of  2001)  supra  Lord  Bingham  made  it  clear  (at  para. 
24H): 

“The prosecutor and the court do not act incompatibly with the 
defendant’s  Convention  right  in  continuing  to  prosecute  or 
 
entertain proceedings after a breach is established where neither 
of conditions (a) or (b) is met, since the breach consists in the 
delay which has accrued and not in the prospective hearing.”

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
34.	 

 
Furthermore, where there has been a delay in proceedings amounting to breach of the 
reasonable time guarantee in Article 6(1) ECHR, there is authority for the proposition 
that  such  delay  may  be  cured  by  a  reduction  in  sentence.  Thus,  in  Spiers  v  Ruddy 
 
[2008] 1 AC 873, having reviewed the authorities (including those emanating from 
Strasbourg), Lord Bingham observed (at para 16B): 

“The authorities relied on and considered above make clear, in 
my opinion, that such delay does not give rise to a continuing 
breach  which  cannot  be  cured  save  by  a  discontinuation  of 
 
proceedings. It gives rise to a breach which can be cured, even 
where  it  cannot  be  prevented,  by  expedition,  reduction  of 
sentence  or  compensation,  provided  always  that  the  breach, 
where it occurs, is publicly acknowledged and addressed.” 

 
35.	 

This  case  turned  on  the  prospective  availability  of  suitably  qualified  advocates  to 
conduct the defence.  We have referred to the recruitment drive by the PDS and in the 
weeks before the hearing in front of Judge Leonard the facts were constantly being 
updated.  Further, during the course of proceedings on 28 April 2014, a further update 
from the PDS confirmed that: 

 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

No QCs are currently available. One will be available in four weeks, another 
 
from 2 July and a third “later in the summer”, albeit he is recouping from a 
serious health problem. A fourth is due to start a 12 week trial in September. 

Two  more  unnamed  QCs  are  due  to  start  in  June  and  July  and  would  be 
available. 

There is a list of ten other advocates and two further advocates who are due to 
join the PDS who will become available. 

 
iv)	 

The PDS was not aware of any plans to recruit any more advocates. 

 
36.	 

 
37.	 

In an email dated 28 April 2014 from the Director of Legal Aid Commissioning and 
Strategy at the LAA, it was stated that “decisions about further expansion will be for 
the LAA and Ministers. The Government has been clear it will not expand the PDS 
beyond  that  which  is  needed”.  What  was  clear  was  that  the  position  was  being 
carefully monitored. 

The other side of the coin concerned the demand for representation.  With regard to 
other forthcoming VHCCs, investigation by the FCA revealed that there were due to 
be eight other trials arising from six prosecutions (listed to begin between September 
 
2014  and  September  2015)  which  required  in  excess  of  23  defendants  to  be 
 
represented  in  addition  to  the  five  respondents  and  three  related  defendants  in  this 
case.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
38.	 

It  is  not  surprising;  therefore,  that  the  judge  found  that  the  PDS  pool  of  available 
advocates was insufficient to cover all the VHCC cases due to be tried.  With respect, 
however, he was not concerned with (and neither did he have responsibility for) all 
the  VHCC  cases  or  with  representation  in  any  case  other  than  the  one  that  he  was 
 
concerned to try.  In relation to his case, the PDS having indicated that its advocates 
would accept instructions in the pending VHCC cases on a “first come first served” 
basis, at that time there was a potential pool of advocates (including leading counsel) 
who would be available for a trial adjourned to January 2015.   

 

 

39.	  Mr  Cameron  Q.C  rightly  did  not  argue  that  this  court  should  make  any  qualitative 
distinction between advocates recruited to the PDS and advocates in private practice; 
neither did he demur from the proposition that Article 6(3)(c) of the ECHR does not 
permit  the  legally  aided  respondents  to  hold  out  for  independent  counsel  of  their 
choice to become available. In relation to the QCs, the advocates concerned will have 
 
achieved that rank whilst in private practice, and the appointment to that rank is taken 
to carry with it the recognition that its holder is especially competent to take the lead 
 
in  criminal  cases  of  particular  gravity  and  complexity.    Further,  it  is  a  reasonable 
 
inference that, in recruiting advocates as a response to the impasse which had arisen 
between the Bar and the Lord Chancellor, the PDS was recruiting those of sufficient 
competence and experience properly to perform their roles in a VHCC case.  

 
40.	 

The judge’s finding as to availability of advocates was, however, closely linked to his 
finding at paragraph 79(g) of the judgment that: 

“Whilst  Article  6(3)  does  not  provide  the  legally  aided 
defendant  with  the  right  to  an  advocate  of  his  choice,  it  still 
permits  the  solicitor  to  carry  out  his  duty  to  assess  which 
 
available advocate would best suit his client’s case. A solicitor 
is entitled to delay that choice until the moment that he judges 
 
the pool from which to choose is at its height. That may be at 
 
any time between now and early October [2014].” 

 
41.	 

The  judge  was  thus  envisaging  that  the  respondents  in  this  case  could  legitimately 
delay  instructing  an  advocate  until  the  point  at  which  it  would  be  necessary  for 
 
preparation to begin in order for the advocates to be trial ready for a January 2015 
trial. The judge’s reasoning appears to have been that if that occurred, PDS advocates 
would not, in truth, then be available because they were likely to have been retained 
 
in  other  pending  VHCC  cases.  This,  however,  has  to  be  set  against  his  finding  at 
para. 79(f) to the effect that: 

“I have no reason to believe that there is a realistic prospect that 
the  Bar  will  accept  contracts  in  VHCC  cases  on  the  present 
 
terms.” 

 
42.	 

Leaving aside for the moment considerations which arise from the use of the phrase 
“on the present terms”, it seems that the judge was concluding that, by October 2014, 
no member of the Bar would accept a contract in a VHCC case. On that basis, then,
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

the  only  potentially  available  advocates  would  be  those  who  were  members  of  the 
PDS.  In  those  circumstances,  it  seems  to  us  wholly  illogical  that  in  the  following 
 
subparagraph,  paragraph  79(g),  the  judge  was  prepared  to  countenance  a  delay  in 
instructing advocates until October 2014.  

 
43.	 

If  (as  appears  to  be  the  case)  the  judge  had  ruled  out  the  possibility  of  the  Bar 
 
participating  in  this  case,  there  could  be  no  useful  purpose  in  countenancing  an 
entitlement of the defence to wait until October 2014 in order to be able to choose 
from a wider pool of advocates than those who were members of the PDS. It follows 
that the rationale for waiting until October 2014 is fatally undermined.  

 
44.	 

Furthermore, earlier in his judgment at paragraph 59 the judge had said: 

judgment 

the  defendants  cannot  hold  out  for 
“In  my 
 
independent  counsel  of  their  choice  to  become  available  and 
Mr  Cameron  QC  does  not  seek  to  argue  that.  However,  the 
solicitor  acting  for  a  defendant  is  under  a  duty  to  advise  his 
client  on  the  best  counsel  available  to  them  and  is  entitled  to 
hold  off  instructing  anyone  until  he  has  the  best  choice 
available to him, so long as that delay does not jeopardise the 
date set for trial and the ability of advocates to be trial ready by 
that date.” [our emphasis] 

These words represent an important (and correct) qualification to the approach taken 
by the judge which appears to have been lost sight of in his ultimate conclusions. On 
the  basis  of  the  judge’s  finding  at  paragraph  79(f)  a  delay  in  instructing  advocates 
 
until  October  2014  would  be  calculated  to  jeopardise  the  date  set  for  trial. 
Accordingly,  on  the  basis  of  the  judge’s  own  reasoning,  he  should  not  have 
contemplated such a delay and this should not have been a contributory factor to his 
conclusion that there was no realistic prospect of sufficient advocates being available 
 
for a trial to take place in January 2015.  

 
45.	 

The agreed test to be applied was “Is there a realistic prospect of competent advocates 
with sufficient time to prepare being available in the foreseeable future?” At the date 
of the hearing before the judge, on our analysis, there was a sufficient prospect of a 
 
sufficient number of PDS advocates who were then available who would enable a trial 
to proceed in January 2015. That pool included a sufficient number of advocates of 
the  rank  of  QC  and  was  available  at  the  date  of  the  hearing.    Consistent  with  the 
judge’s finding at paragraph 59 that the defence should instruct its advocates at a time 
 
which  “does  not  jeopardise  the  date  set  for  trial”,  the  obvious  obligation  on  the 
 
defence should have been to instruct advocates at that point so as to retain them for a 
January 2015 trial. 

 
46.	 

Not to do so would run counter to what the judge considered necessary, and in our 
 
view would not be a reasonable course to adopt. It had been made plain by the PDS 
that its available advocates would be assigned on a “first come first served” basis, so 
 
that prompt action on the part of the defence was necessary to secure their services.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
Failure so to act would, if any future application to stay or adjourn were made on the 
basis  of  unavailability  of  advocates,  be  likely  to  result  in  a  finding  adverse  to  the 
defendants. 

 

 
47.	 

In those circumstances, the finding of the judge that there was no realistic prospect of 
 
competent advocates with sufficient time to prepare being available in the foreseeable 
future cannot be sustained; neither was it reasonable for him to reach it.  In any event, 
it was unjustifiable to proceed on the basis that the position was fixed.  It had changed 
 
in the weeks that had elapsed and, whether or not the Bar accepted VHCC cases on 
the present terms, further discussion could not be ruled out.  Finally, although it was 
said that there were no known plans for the PDS further to recruit, the language of the 
most recent communication put before the judge was more nuanced (to the effect that 
the PDS would not be expanded “beyond that which is needed”) which did not rule 
out circumstances requiring further action to be taken.  That is not surprising given 
the statutory responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor. 

 

 

 

48.	  While analysing Judge Leonard’s reasons, moreover, there are other features of his 
judgment upon which it is appropriate to comment.   First (at paras. 69-72 and 79(c)), 
he  referred  to  the  use  of  court  time  and  the  effect  of  granting  an  adjournment:  he 
identified  the  increase  in  Crown  Court  receipts  and  the  stress  consequent  upon  the 
limited availability of court sitting days.  Having cited para. 3.2(2)(f) of the Criminal 
 
Procedure  Rules  (which,  in  pursuit  of  the  overriding  objective  require  the  court  to 
“discourage delay, dealing with as many aspects of the case as possible on the same 
occasion and avoiding unnecessary hearings”) and para. 3.8 (requiring directions so 
that the case “can be concluded at the next hearing or as soon as possible after that”) 
 
he  said  that  he  had  responsibility  to  take  account  of  the  effect  on  other  cases  of 
adjourning  the  hearing  for  which  court  time  had  been  put  aside  and  that  to  find 
 
another three month slot would delay other trials. 

 
49.	 

The  principles  to  which  the  judge  referred  are  unexceptionable  and,  of  course,  any 
delay  that  impacts  on  the  trial  of  this  case  undeniably  fails  to  accord  with  the 
 
overriding objective.  There is equally no doubt that administrative inconvenience will 
 
result if the trial has to be patterned into the schedule at some later time.  But this 
 
point cannot be taken too far: the problems that arise are clearly exceptional and result 
 
not  from  specific  failures  by  the  parties  (who  are  constrained  to  comply  with  the 
Rules) but from the breakdown of relationships between the Bar and the MoJ and an 
overarching  dispute  as  to  reasonable  remuneration  for  the  work  which  has  to  be 
 
undertaken.    Further,  the  three  month  trial  window  before  Judge  Leonard  will  not 
have been wasted and we have no doubt that other trials (which otherwise would have 
 
been brought on later) will now be listed earlier than originally anticipated.  Assuming 
this case is eventually tried, although some time will have been lost while issues such 
as this application have been argued and as further case management is undertaken, at 
the  end  of  the  day  the  resulting  shortfall  should  be  comparatively  modest.    In  the 
circumstances, it does not, of itself, require or support the taking of draconian action 
in the form of a stay.
--------

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
50.	 

The  second  feature  to  which  we  make  reference  concerns  the  effect  on  the  three 
remaining  defendants  whose  trial  had  been  severed  and  delayed  to  January  2015 
(which he had not considered unfair).  The judge observed that an adjournment of this 
 
trial  would  mean  the  second  trial  being  deferred  by  approximately  a  year  “when  it 
 
might  otherwise  have  been  tried  with  eight  defendants”.    Given  that  he  did  not 
consider a trial even in the latter part of 2015 to be unfair (which, given the fact that it 
is heavily document based is not surprising), it is difficult to see why this fact should 
have weighed with him.  As for a joint trial, that is a decision which he could revisit if 
 
he thought it appropriate.  In any event, pulling the other way is the fact that these 
 
three defendants who had not expected a trial until 2015 would now doubtless argue 
 
that it would be unfair to try them if the trial of the principals was not to take place. 
That submission might well have arguable merit for reasons of parity of treatment but 
it is hardly in the interests of justice that nobody should be held to account by trial. 

 

 

 
51.	 

That brings us to the third feature of the judgment to which we wish to refer.  At para. 
79(a), the judge turned to the victims, that is to say those who claimed that they had 
lost  very  substantial  sums  of  money  as  a  result  of  the  activities  of  those  being 
prosecuted.  He said: 

“Failure  to  grant  an  adjournment  will  deprive  the  victims  of 
crime  of  the  opportunity  to  see  those  that  they  judge 
responsible prosecuted. To deny them that opportunity should 
not  be  lightly  taken.  Against  that  I  judge  that  there  are  other 
methods available to the victims to recover their losses civilly 
and there are other regulatory offences which could be brought 
against the defendants which may not meet the gravamen of the 
conduct  alleged  but  which  could  mark  out  their  alleged 
misconduct and prevent them from being able to take a rôle in 
corporate activity in the future. ” 

 
52.	 

In our judgment, in a case such as the present, this approach is entirely misconceived. 
 
Where  the  police  or  authorised  regulators  have  determined  that  it  is  appropriate  to 
commence criminal proceedings, civil litigation and regulatory action alone will not 
normally sufficiently address the legitimate aspirations of victims that those who have 
defrauded  them  should  be  brought  before  the  criminal  courts  and,  if  convicted, 
punished accordingly.  The suggestion that, in some way, the prospect of these other 
forms  of  action  in  any  way  lessens  the  imperative  to  pursue  prosecutions  properly 
brought, or is a feature to be taken into account in this case, is wrong.  Mr Cameron 
Q.C did not himself seek to place emphasis on this part of the judge’s judgment and 
he  agreed  that  the  alternatives  identified  by  the  judge  could  not  be  taken  as  of 
themselves an acceptable substitute for criminal trials in this context. 

 
53.	 

Finally, we note that the judge derived some support for his conclusion on a decision 
of  this  court  in  CPS  v  Campbell;  McInerney  v  Financial  Services  Authority; 
Medicines  and  Healthcare  Products  Regulatory  Agency  v  Carlton  [2009]  EWCA 
 
Crim  997  dealing  with  applications  to  stay  confiscation  proceedings  because 
appropriate representation was not available.  He recognised, however, that the issues 
were  different  and  that  he  was  “dealing  with  a  decision  whether  to  grant  an
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Crawley and others 
 

 
adjournment  in  respect  of  a  serious  allegation  which  is  as  yet  unproven”.    In  our 
judgment, the circumstances are so different that no support at all can be derived from 
this decision which should be seen as confined to its facts. 

Conclusion 
   

 
54.	 

 
55.	 

Section  67  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  makes  it  clear  that  this  court  cannot 
reverse a ruling on an appeal in these circumstances unless satisfied that it was wrong 
in law, involved an error of law or principle or was not reasonable for the judge to 
have made.  We have reached the clear conclusion that this ruling does involve errors 
of law or principle and, in any event, was not reasonable in the sense that a number of 
the conclusions reached were not reasonably open to him based on the evidence and, 
 
in  any  event,  his  ultimate  finding  did  not  constitute  a  reasonable  exercise  of  the 
 
discretion  open  to  him.    Pursuant  to  section  66(1)  and  (2)  of  the  Act,  the  ruling  is 
reversed  and  we  order  that  the  proceedings  on  this  indictment  be  resumed  in  the 
Crown Court at Southwark. 

In our judgment, there is no question of a present breach of Article 6 of the ECHR 
and,  should  that  state  of  affairs  arise  in  the  future,  there  would,  in  any  event,  be 
remedies short of a stay that could be deployed.  We are not saying that there could 
not come a time when it may be appropriate to order that this indictment be stayed: 
that  time,  however,  remains  very  much  in  the  future  and  problems  about 
 
representation will have to have developed considerably before such an exceptional 
order could be justified. It would be a matter for the judge to assess on the basis of 
how matters stand at that point in time.   

 

56.	  We cannot leave this case, however, without making some further comment.  During 
the course of the hearing, we made it clear that the dispute between the Bar and the 
 
Lord Chancellor about the appropriate level of remuneration for VHCCs was not one 
 
in which we could (or should) become involved.  It involves a commercial negotiation 
in which (short of legal challenge) the judiciary can play no part.  In any event, it is 
 
not before the court and we have received neither evidence nor submissions from any 
of  the  protagonists.  That  is  not  to  say,  however,  that  we  are  unmindful  of  or 
unconcerned about the issues and the underlying impact of the dispute. 

 
57.	 

 

The criminal justice system in this country requires the highest quality advocates both 
to prosecute and to defend those accused of crime: in addition, they are the potential 
judges of the future.  The better the advocates, the easier it is to concentrate on the 
 
real issues in the case, the more expeditious the hearing and the better the prospect of 
true verdicts according to the evidence.  Poor quality advocates fail to take points of 
potential significance, or take them badly, leading to confusion and, in turn, appeals 
and,  even  more  serious,  leading  to  potential  miscarriages  of  justice.    We  have  no 
doubt  that  it  is  critical  that  there  remains  a  thriving  cadre  of  advocates  capable  of 
undertaking  all  types  of  publicly  funded  work,  developing  their  skills  from  the 
straightforward work until they are able to undertake the most complex.

In those circumstances, it is of fundamental importance that the MoJ led by the Lord 
Chancellor and the professions continue to try to resolve the impasse that presently 
stands in the way of the delivery of justice in the most complex of cases: this will 
require effort by both sides.  The maintenance of a criminal justice system of which 
we can be proud depends on a sensible resolution of the issues that have arisen.",2014-05-21 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

You have been convicted of eight offences of indecent assault.  These offences 
 
may  have  taken  place  a  long  time  ago  when  inappropriate  and  trivial  sexual 
misbehaviour was more likely to be tolerated or overlooked, but your offending 
 
is not trivial but of a very serious nature and any perception to the contrary on 
 
your part is misconceived. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
You  were  charged  with  indecent  assault  under  an  Act  passed  in  1956.  The 
 
maximum sentence for these offences was set at two years imprisonment.  By 
the  time  that  the  Sexual  Offences  Act  2003  came  into  force,  the  maximum 
 
sentence for sexual assault was increased to 10 years.  What is more, some of 
 
the  sexual  acts  of  which  you  have  now  been  found  guilty  would  now  be 
charged as rape or assault by penetration for each of which Parliament has laid 
 
down a maximum term of life imprisonment. 

    
  

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     
These are historic offences which took place between 30 and 37 years ago.  I 
 
judge that the reason why they were not brought to light sooner is because of 
 
your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment 
which  meant  that  your  victims  thought  you  were  untouchable,  something  I 
  
judge that you, too, believed and traded upon.  This features in the evidence. 
 
By  way  of  example  the  victim  of  Count  11  told  the  jury  that,  as  you  were 
 
pulling  up  your  trousers  after  a  sexual  act  and  as  she  was  leaving,  you  said 
something like “no one is going to believe you” and it was said as if to make 
   
her not tell anyone. 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
In respect  of the  victim of Counts 3-6, it was because of the trauma she had 
 
experienced at your hands and her wish not to cause grief to her parents whose 
 
confidence you had gained so as to let you take her out in the evening, that she 
delayed reporting what you had done.  It was only after protracted counselling 
and the realisation that the police would listen to a complaint against someone 
 
so firmly in the public eye that she felt able to come forward.  In light of these 
 
factors, whilst I shall make some allowance for the age of the offences, I judge 
 
that you were largely responsible for the delay in the victims coming forward 
  
and ought not to benefit from it. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I am going to set out the facts of these offences in some detail.  The victim of 
 
Counts 3-6 met you when she was on holiday.  She was 15 years old.  You told 
 
her  and  her  family  that  she  was  pretty  and  that  you  could  help  her  get 

  
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
1
--------
promotional  work.  Back  in  this  country  you  spoke  to  her  on  the  telephone 
pretending  to  be  someone  called  Terry  Miller.  You  made  her  repeat  dirty 
 
words over the telephone which you said Max Clifford would like to hear her 
say and you got her to come to your office.  You began to groom her by telling 
her that she could be the UK’s version of Jodie Foster which blew her away, 
 
and you made her show you her breasts although she did not want to. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Sometime later you went to her home which was not far from your own.  You 
 
got  the  trust  of  her  parents  who  allowed  their  daughter  to  come  out  in  the 
 
evening with you.  They thought their daughter was going to meet people who 
 
could help her with her career. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

She went out in the car with you perhaps 10 times in all between September 
 
1977  and  January  1978.  You  would  park  up  in  different  places  and  would 
persuade her that what you were doing was essential to establish a basis of trust 
 
between you. 
   

   

 

 

 

On  occasions  you  exposed  your  erect  penis  and  told  her  to  masturbate  you, 
 
having shown her  what to do.  Count 3 reflects one of about  7 occasions  on 
 
which this happened. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On one occasion you penetrated her with two of your fingers. That offending is 
 
reflected in Count 4 and, had this offence taken place after the Sexual Offences 
Act  2003  came  into  force,  it  would  have  been  charged  as  an  assault  by 
 
penetration. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
6.	 

 
7.	 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

 

10.	  On  another  occasion  you  degraded  her  by  taking  her  to  buy  a  revealing 
wonderbra and then taking her to the home of a friend of yours and telling her 
to dress in bra and pants and try to seduce the man whilst you watched. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.	  Counts 5 and 6 reflect the first and third occasions on which you told  her to 
 
perform oral  sex  on  you.  You  instructed  her how  to  do  it  and criticised  her 
performance. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

12.	  On the second time it happened, you told her that, on the last occasion she had 
 
 
given you oral sex, a photographer had taken photographs from a position so 
close in the bushes that you could see her freckles on the photograph. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
13.	 

 

  
  
 

She thought her life was over.  You told her not to worry because you had lots 
of connections with the press.  If this was your attempt to make her even more 
 
subservient to your wishes, it backfired.  The next time you met she was in a 
 
 
dreadful state and told you that she was going to kill herself.  I do not judge 
that it was an idle threat.  She gave evidence of the bridge she had chosen from 
which to commit suicide and that she knew it had been used before.  She told 
 
the court that she could not tell her parents because you had duped them into

--------
letting her go off with you and even provided her with stories to tell her parents 
 
about who you had met. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

14.	  You  did  not  contact  her  again.  Had  these  offence  been  committed  after  the 
 
2003  Act was in force, each would have resulted in a conviction  for rape. 
I 
  
would have found under the guidelines that this was in category 2 in respect of 
harm,  bearing  in  mind  the  psychological  harm  caused  to  the  victim,  her 
 
vulnerability and  potentially  her  humiliation,  and in category  A in respect  of 
 
culpability having regard to the degree of planning and grooming, and abuse of 
 
her parents’ trust in allowing you to take her away in the evening.  That would 
 
have  given  me  a  starting  point  for  a  single  offence  of  10  years.  Bearing  in 
mind  that  there  are  two  such  offences  and  the  background  of  other  sexual 
 
offending  in  relation  to  this  victim  and  taking  into  account  any  mitigating 
circumstances,  I  doubt  that  my  overall  sentence  would  have  been  below  8 
years.

It  was  only  after  she  had  told  her  sister  what  you  had  done  to  her  that  she 
decided to seek counselling.  This started in April 2011 and she attended over 
 
33 meetings to help her with the lasting effects of what you did to her. 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She gained the courage to send you the letter which was found by the police in 
 
your  bedside  cabinet  when  you  were  arrested  and  which  further  supports  the 
 
effect that your behaviour had on her. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

I have read her impact statement and additions to it.  I accept that what you did 
 
to  her  at  a  young  age  has  affected  her  early  relationships  with  men  and  has 
even had an effect on her relationship with her husband.  It also affected her 
 
relationship  with  her  own  parents.  She  sets  out  the  effect  it  has  had  on  her 
 
wider family. 
   

    

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She speaks of the trauma of the trial process and I accept that, whatever steps 
 
the courts take to make the process less stressful for complainants, it is bound 
 
to  remain  a  very  difficult  and  distressing  period  for  them. 
I  accept  the 
   
 
submissions  that  Mr  Horwell  QC  has  made  about  how  much  I  should  pay 
 
 
regard  to  what  the  effect  of  giving  evidence  has  had  on  the  victim,  but  you 
 
know  that,  by  denying  these  offences,  you  have  lost  any  benefit  you  may 
 
otherwise have obtained from a guilty plea. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19.	  Not  unnaturally,  what  she  looks  for  is  some  sort  of  apology  from you  or  an 
 
acknowledgment  as  to  what  you  have  been  responsible  for.  She  has  been 
 
extremely upset by your public denials before trial, the reports of your attitude 
 
during trial  –  laughing and  shaking your  head  in  the  dock at  the  accusations 
made against you.  For my part I would add something that since the jury have 
returned verdicts I have discovered that you appeared behind a reporter outside 
 
this court whilst he was making his report of your evidence and during which 
 

  
 

   

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
you mimicked his actions in a way that was designed to trivialise these events. 
 
 
I find your behaviour to be quite extraordinary and a further indication that you 
 
show no remorse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20.	  Whilst there is a difference in degree between your reaction to what then were 
 
allegations  of  indecent  assault  and  those  of  a  defendant  who  makes  public 
 
denials and then pleads guilty, this additional element of trauma caused by your 
contemptuous attitude is something that I shall take into account in sentence.  I 
  
can only hope that these proceedings will provide all your victims with some 
 
sort of closure. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
21.	 

 
22.	 

 
23.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

The jury heard  some compelling evidence of  other sexual  incidents in  which 
 
you were involved.  I disagree with Mr Horwell QC’s submission that on the 
 
basis of the two verdicts of not guilty and the failure of the jury to decide on 
one count I should ignore this behaviour entirely. Those three alleged offences 
 
had specific features and complexities in respect of the circumstances in which 
 
it  was  said  they  had  taken  place  which  make  the  jury’s  findings  wholly 
explicable.  I do not find in relation to the bad character evidence which they 
 
heard  any  similar  difficulties  and,  so  long  as  I  am  sure  that  the  events  took 
place, as I am, I can take them into account insofar as the evidence informs me 
 
as to the offences for which you are to be sentenced. 
 

    

 
 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pertinent  to  count  3-6  is  the  evidence  of  what  you  did  to  a  12  year  old  girl 
 
whilst she was on holiday in Puerto Cabopino.  I am satisfied so that I am sure 
on  the  evidence  which  the  jury  heard  that  this  amounted  to  another  sexual 
 
offence against a young child.  Had the offence not taken place abroad and at a 
 
 
time  when  it  was  not  justiciable  here  you  would  have  been  charged  with 
indecent assault in relation to it. 
 

    

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This girl became a holiday friend of your daughter.  Having groomed her by 
playing a tickling game with her in the swimming pool, you got her parents’ 
 
permission to take her to a Jacuzzi in the hotel complex. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24.	  Whilst your daughter was absent and you were in the Jacuzzi with the 12 year 
 
old you put your hand down her bikini and onto her pubic mound and asked if 
 
she was ticklish there.  You then got hold of her hand and moved it onto your 
 
erect  penis  and  started  moving  her  hand  up  and  down  quite  slowly.  You 
stopped when your daughter came to the Jacuzzi. 
 

 
  

   

 

 

 

 
25.	 

 

 

 
  

 
The offences reflected by Counts 3-6 are the most serious and the other matters 
 
 
I can take more shortly.  The 20 year old victim of count 8 approached you to 
assist  her  with  her  acting  career  as  a  retired  gymnast.  You  used  a  familiar 
 
technique  by  pretending  that  she  would  be  considered  for  a  new  Charles 
Bronson film for which she would be perfect. 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
4
--------
26.	  You  telephoned  her  between  meetings  pretending  to  be  Terry  Denton.  You 
told her that Max Clifford thought she was really lovely and fancied her and 
 
that if she played her cards right she would become very famous. 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27.	  When  she  came  to  your  office  for  the  second  time  you  persuaded  her  that 
Bronson needed to see photographs of her and you gave her money to go out 
 
and buy underwear which would show off her figure.  On her return you took 
pictures and tried to persuade her to put her legs apart for the camera.  When 
 
she  had  changed  you  engineered  a  telephone  conversation  between  her  and 
 
  
either you or someone who was in cahoots with you pretending to be Bronson. 
 
She was encouraged to believe that Bronson  was interested in her starring in 
his film.  When you reappeared you lunged towards her and tried to kiss her. 
  
When  she  resisted  and  you  pushed  her  down  onto  the  sofa.  She  was  really 
 
frightened and she was just screaming to leave her alone.  She had the courage 
to kick you between the legs. 
   

 
 

   

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
28.	 

 
29.	 

 
30.	 

In  her  impact  statement  she  identifies  how  it  affected  her  ability  to  pursue  a 
 
career  as  a  stunt  double  and the  distress  she was  caused  by  giving evidence. 
  
Counsel  can  only  act  on  instructions  and  it  is  therefore  you  who  bears 
 
responsibility for the distress caused to her by allegations being made that she 
 
 
had lied in order to obtain notoriety or money. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I accept that the taking of photographs, even if there was film in the camera, is 
 
 
not  an  aggravating  feature  of  this  offence,  but  it  was  a  ruse  to  make  her 
compliant with what you then went on to do. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The victim of counts 9 and 10 was 17 or 18 when she was introduced to you for 
advice on pursuing a modelling career.  You took her into your office and told 
 
her how you could help and how lucky she was to be represented by you. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

31.	  You told her to take her dress off because you needed to see her figure.  You 
 
told her that she turned you on and your hands moved over her body, chest and 
 
hips.  This is reflected in Count 9. 
 

  

  

 

 

 
32.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
 

 
   

She  put  her  dress  back  on  and,  whilst  you  took  a  call  from  your  wife,  you 
masturbated yourself.  When you  had finished the call you came over to her 
and tried to get her to take your erect penis in her mouth whilst you continued 
 
to  masturbate.  You  were  trying  to  force  your  penis  into  her  mouth,  even 
 
putting your hand round her head to force it in and you managed to achieve a 
 
partial entry.  You ejaculated over the left side of her face but mainly on her 
collar bone.  Your behaviour is reflected in Count 10.  This would now amount 
to the offence of rape.  Ejaculation amounts  to an aggravating feature of this 
offence. 
 

 
  
  

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
33.	  You caused her further degradation by telling her that she was to be invited to 
dinner with your wife and that Cubby Broccoli would be there who would get 
 
her into a Bond film.  You wanted her to masturbate you under the table whilst 
you  sat  next  to  your  wife  and  you  made  it  clear  that  she  must  come  to  the 
  
dinner.  You rang her several times after that to ask if she was going to come to 
dinner. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
34.	 

 
35.	 

 

 

 

In  her  impact  statement  she  explained  how  your  regular  appearances  on 
 
television  over  the  years  has  made  it  difficult  for  her  to  forget  what  had 
 
happened and get on with her life.  She was  upset by the hypocrisy that you 
showed in portraying yourself as someone who exposes the truth in respect of 
celebrities when you were living with your own lie.  She felt she could not tell 
 
anyone what you did because you were so good at manipulating the press.  She 
 
shows remarkable powers of forgiveness in her concern for the effect  of this 
hearing on your wife and daughter.  All she would have wanted from you is an 
 
acknowledgement of what you had done. 
 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The victim of Count 11 was 18 or 19 when she went one morning to Xenon 
 
nightclub just off Piccadilly for an audition.  You happened to be there having 
a meeting with three other men.  As she left the dance area you approached her 
 
and asked her if she would be interested in acting which she was.  You enticed 
her  by  saying  that  you  could  get  her  a  screen  test  for  a  Bond  film.  You 
 
pretended to telephone Cubby Broccoli and when the person on the other end 
 
 
of the telephone spoke to her she was told that, before she could get a screen 
test she had to do something else. 
   

  
 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36.	  He asked her if Max Clifford was circumcised and asked her to look.  He had 
to say it again and you stood beside her smiling.  You then led her by the hand 
 
to  the  gentleman’s  lavatory  and,  once  inside,  locked  the  door.  You  put  her 
 
 
hand on your erect penis and told her to masturbate you.  You pulled down the 
front of her leotard and pulled at her nipples. 
 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

 
39.	 

 

  

She told the court that she had just had her first relationship and it ruined it. 
  
They split up.  In her impact statement she explained how her experiences left 
her unable to attempt to pursue a modelling career and how you had made her 
feel worthless.  Whilst the experience of giving evidence was daunting she has 
 
felt so relieved since. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 
 
I have already explained why I feel able to take into account as context to the 
 
offences which I am to sentence you for the other matters about which the jury 
heard convincing evidence. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In particular a 19 or 20 year old who was working in fashion, was encouraged 
 
by you to think she could get a part in the series Dynasty.  She got a call from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
6
--------
you pretending to be the producer, Aaron Spelling, and spoke to her about the 
 
size of your penis. 
  

 

 

 

 

40.	  When she next saw you in your office you took your penis out and asked her to 
 

 
masturbate you.  You ejaculated onto her hand. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41.	  You took an 18 year old on as your receptionist.  You asked her to masturbate 
 
you  on  two  or  three  occasions  and  she  felt  that  she  had  no  choice  but  to 
 
comply.  You ejaculated into her hand and tissues.  You fondled her breasts. 
  
 
You asked her to give you oral sex in exchange for being taken to meet David 
 
Bowie. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
42.	 

 
43.	 

In 1986 an 18 year old dancer and part time model, having been told by you 
 
 
that  she  had  something  quite  special  for  a  career  in  films  and  mentioning  a 
particular film for which she might be suitable, was persuaded to come to your 
 
girlfriend’s flat in Kingston to have photographs taken by Barry Ryan. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She told the court that she now understood that you were grooming her.  After 
 
the session and when the two of you were on your own you exposed your penis 
 
 
and asked her to touch it to make it get bigger.  It freaked her out so she got up 
and left. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44.	  When you met a 16 turning 17 year old interested in getting into modelling, she 
 
told  you  about  sexual  abuse  she  had  suffered  at  her  father’s  hands.  You 
 
therefore  knew  she  was  vulnerable.  With  her  you  played  an  elaborate  game 
 
making  her  go  over  to  Fenwicks  to  receive  a  call  purportedly  from  a  film 
director but in fact from you.  Having asked her to discover what your Achilles 
Heel was it led to you exposing your penis to her and eventually to you taking 
her  to  the  lavatory  at  your  office  and  making  her  masturbate  you  until  you 
ejaculated over the toilet. 
 

 
 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
45.	 

 
46.	 

Later you told her that you had arranged for her to be taken by someone else, 
 
who either pretended to be or was a film director interested in her for a part in a 
film, to his home.  This other person put his arm round her and tried to kiss her. 
  
She told the court that was the only thing you ever did to further her career. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I  turn  to  your  mitigation.  You  have  had  a  very  successful  career  as  a  PR 
 
consultant, Max Clifford Associates being one of the leaders in the industry. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47.	  You are now just 71; you keep yourself fit but I do not ignore your underlying 
medical problems.  You told the jury that, from the 1960’s onwards you have 
 
 
been  in  a  privileged  position  to  assist  various  charitable  causes  helping  very 
 
sick children  through  “Dreams  Come  True”  and  becoming involved  with  the 
Royal  Marsden  and  with  Children  Hospices  UK  and  in  particular  two 
 

   
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
7
--------
children’s  hospices  in  Surrey.  You  are  the  patron  of  a  number  of  charities 
 
across a broad spectrum. 
   

   

 

 

 
48.	  A  number  of  charity  workers  have  spoken  highly  of  your  dedicated  work to 
raise funds for the charities and the real concern you showed for patients and 
 
staff alike. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49.	  Although your charitable work has gone on long after your offending ceased, I 
 
cannot ignore that for decades you were leading a double existence.  The care 
 
 
which you showed to those in the hospices and to your own daughter was not 
shown to the 15 year old, the subject of counts 3-6 or, in my judgment to the 12 
 
year old who you abused whilst on holiday. 
 

 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
50.	  Whilst at the trial you were able to rely on your good character, on the jury’s 
verdicts you lost your good character in 1977 when you were aged 34. I accept 
 
your  counsel’s  submission  that  29  years  have  passed  since  your  last  offence 
and these have been years of positive charitable conduct which you have never 
 
sought  to  publicise.  I will  make  allowance  for  the  good  that  you  have  done 
 
over the years and for the opinions of your friends and colleagues as to your 
character. 
 

     

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
51.	 

 
52.	 

 
53.	 

 

 

 

I  have  also  had  regard  to  Mr  Horwell  QC’s  submissions  that  you  bare  no 
 
responsibility for the result of other Yew Tree investigations and that I should 
 
not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  in  considering  the  use  of  maximum  sentences 
 
these were not the gravest offences of their type imaginable.  He urges me to 
 
make the sentences proportionate and that I should bear in mind that you are no 
 
longer a danger to women. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  deciding the  appropriate  sentences  I have  taken  into  account  the  guidance 
 
provided in the authorities I have been shown and the assistance given at p.155 
 
of the latest Definitive Guidelines.  I intend to impose consecutive  sentences 
 
and, in doing so, have had to consider the totality of the sentence I am to pass. 
  
As a result some of the individual sentences may be lower than I would have 
 
passed if you had not been facing eight separate counts involving four separate 
 
victims.  On the other  hand  I have  felt it right in respect of counts 3 to  6 to 
 
impose  consecutive  sentences  to  reflect  insofar  as  I  can  the  sentencing 
guidelines now applicable. 
   

   
 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  have  also  take  into  account  that  there  were  multiple  victims,  that  your 
 
 
offending extended over a period of 7 years, and that you targeted vulnerable 
women  who  you  thought  would  comply  because  they  were  desperate  to 
succeed in a career where success can be illusive. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------
54.	 

 
55.	 

 
In respect of costs, I have made a reduction in the figure applied for to reflect 
the charges of which you were acquitted.  You must pay £55,000 towards the 
prosecution’s costs and you have 28 days to pay. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

The offence is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified and the 
 
least  possible  sentence  I  can  impose  having  regard  to  the  aggravating  and 
 
 
mitigating factors of the case which I have set out together with everything that 
your counsel has said on your behalf is as follows:­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56.	  You will go to prison on count 3 for 12 months 
 

 

 

57.	  On count 4 for 18 months consecutive to the sentence on count 3 
 

 

58.	  On  counts  5  and  6  for  24  months  on  each  concurrently  but  consecutively  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

counts 3 and 4, making a total in respect of this victim of 4½ years 
 

 

 

 

 

59.	  On count 8 for 6 months consecutive to the other sentences 
 

 

60.	  On count 9 for 6 months and on count 10 for 21 months to run concurrently 
 

 

with each other but consecutively to the other sentences. 
  

61.	  On count 11 for 15 months, to run consecutively with the other sentences. 
 

 

 

 

62.	  Your total sentence is one of 8 years imprisonment 
 

 

 

 

 
63.	  You  will  serve  up  to  one  half  of  your  sentence  in  custody  before  you  are 
released on licence; you must abide by the terms of the licence and commit no 
 
further offence or you will be liable to be recalled and you will then serve the 
 
remainder of the sentence in custody. 
 

 

 

 
64.	 

The notification requirements apply indefinitely.

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Jeremy Baker 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 May 2014 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

1.	  Constance Briscoe, you are the third individual to have been convicted of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

criminal offences arising out of a saga whose origin goes back to 2003, when 
 
both Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce lied about who had driven a speeding 
 
motor vehicle, and extends to you in 2011, when you sought to hide your 
 
true motive and role in the exposure of that story. You then compounded 
 
your position by deliberately fabricating evidence when you thought that you 
 
 
might be exposed. If there is a common thread between you all, then, from 
 
the insights I have had into the character of the each of you during this case, I 
   
regret that it is one of arrogance by educated individuals who considered 
 
that respect for the law was for others. 
  

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

2.	  I am only too conscious that your convictions mark a personal tragedy for 
 
 
both you and your children. You are an individual who unsurprisingly has 
 
been something of a role model to others. Although blessed with intelligence, 
 
you did not have every advantage in life. However you worked hard at school 
 
and were the first person in your family to go to university. Having gained a 
 
degree in law, you joined the Bar and over the years established a successful 
 
criminal practice, and had the privilege of being appointed a Crown Court 
 
Recorder. You have done all of this whilst raising your two much loved 
 
 
children. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

3.	  However, over the years you have also courted a significant degree of self 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publicity, and therefore built up a familiarity with the workings of the media. 
 
I have no doubt that it was this familiarity which led you to offer to assist 
 
 
Vicky Pryce to disseminate her story about taking Chris Huhne’s penalty 
 
points. It is clear from the email and phone evidence, that you were 
 
intimately involved in the negotiations between Vicky Pryce and the press, 
 
 
both in relation to her requirement for a confidentiality clause and, for the
--------
corroboration and dissemination of her story that she had been subjected to 
 
pressure; motivated, as was Vicky Pryce, by a joint desire to ensure the 
 
downfall of Chris Huhne. In contrast to the true position, when you came to 
 
provide your two witness statements to the police, you painted a wholly 
 
misleading picture of impartiality and lack of involvement with the press, in 
 
 
order to enhance your credibility as a witness in the criminal proceedings 
 
involving them.

disclosure of the emails from the Mail on Sunday, you sought to cover your 
 
tracks by manufacturing a false witness statement, which admitted to a 
 
limited amount of contact with that newspaper. Unfortunately the matter did 
 
 
not stop there, because after this deception had been uncovered, and you 
 
had been charged with the offences at counts 1 and 2 on the indictment, you 
 
proceeded to manufacture a second false statement, which you provided to a 
 
 
defence expert in order to obtain an innocent explanation for the existence 
 
of the first one. It was only after that expert opinion had been served on the 
 
Crown Prosecution Service, and they had in turn obtained their own expert 
 
evidence, that this further deception was exposed. 
  

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
   

5.	  I am sure that you realise only too well that such conduct strikes at the heart 
 

 
of our much cherished system of criminal justice, which is integral and 
 
invaluable to the good order of society. In those circumstances I regret that I 
 
   
do not consider that any other sentence can be justified, but one involving 
 
the deprivation of your liberty. I of course take into account, amongst other 
 
matters, your good character, and the devastating effect that these 
 
convictions will have upon your career at the Bar. However, your conduct not 
 
 
only involved deliberately seeking to paint a false picture of your role and 
 
attitude for the purposes of enhancing your credibility in the Chris Huhne and 
 
 
Vicky Pryce prosecution, but was compounded by the deliberate 
 
manufacturing of evidence so as to avoid your own detection. The last of 
 
these deceptions taking place during the period leading towards your own 
 
trial. In those circumstances, and having regard to the principle of totality, I 
   
consider that the least sentence which can properly be passed upon you is 
 
one of 16 months imprisonment. That total will be reached by consecutive 
 
sentences of 4, 5 and 7 months custody respectively, upon counts 1, 2 and 3. 
 
 
 
You know that you will be released half way through that term, but will 
 
remain on licence for the full term and liable to recall if you were to commit 
 
any further offence or otherwise breach the conditions of your licence.

Crown Court at Liverpool 
 

 

 

 

Introduction 
 

2 May 2014 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

You have now pleaded guilty to the murder of Sharon Hayter and Stephanie Owen.  You 
 
killed these 2 innocent women in the home in Home Farm Road, Knowsley Village that you 
 
shared with them.  Sharon Hayter was aged 54 years and your long‐term partner of over 30 
 
years and Stephanie Owen was your 29 year old daughter. She was a vulnerable young 
 
 
woman who suffered from diabetes and some learning and physical difficulties. 
   

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Facts 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

For reasons best known to yourself, in the morning of Saturday 28th November 2013 you 
 
carried out a vicious attack on these two women with some sort of heavy instrument.  You 
 
caused fatal head injuries to each. Neighbours heard screaming from the house at around 
 
7.30am. You were seen to leave the house at around 10am carrying a bag, returning a short 
 
while later.  You disposed of the instrument used in the attack which, despite searches, has 
 
never been found. You told the police shortly after the attack that you had used a hammer, 
 
which would be consistent with the medical evidence available as to the injuries inflicted. 
      

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

At around midday on the same day you approached a community police officer and 
 
indicated that you had just killed your wife and daughter.  You appeared calm and still, 
 
without obvious reaction to what you were you saying. You gave the police your house keys 
 
 
and your address. 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Ms Hayter was found dead and naked on a chair in the living room, partially covered by a 
 
quilt.  It is not clear from the forensic evidence exactly where Ms Hayter was when she was 
 
assaulted. She had suffered major blunt force head injuries, with 2 scalp lacerations, one 
 
measuring 8cms and one 7.5cms in length.  Both lacerations resulted in significant 
 
underlying skull damage and were the result of an attack of considerable force. The injuries

were consistent with a hammer either inflicting glancing blows or from the use of the shaft 
 
 
of a hammer. The cause of her death was blunt force head injury. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Ms Owen was found in her bedroom, also essentially naked.  It is clear from forensic 
 
evidence that she was killed on the floor of her bedroom before being moved onto her bed. 
 
 
She had 8 lacerations to the vertex scalp, together with bruising and abrasions.  The 
 
lacerations were consistent with being struck by the claw of a hammer.  Again the cause of 
 
 
her death was blunt force head injuries. They had been inflicted with severe force. 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

In police interviews and when being medically examined, you admitted to killing the women. 
  
You stated that you could not take any more, had killed them and had cleaned up the house 
 
 
afterwards.  You referred to the existence of a pact with Ms Hayter to the effect that if 
 
anything happened to her, Ms Hayter, Ms Hayter wanted Ms Owen to go with her. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

No‐one but yourself can say what was going on in your mind that morning. But nothing that 
 
the Court has been told about you and your circumstances, whether because of your 
 
relationship with Ms Hayter or because you were simply frustrated by your environment or 
 
stressed by your daughter’s physical difficulties, could possibly justify your actions that day. 
  
That applies both to Ms Hayter and Ms Owen but all the more so to Ms Owen. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am quite satisfied that you intended to kill both these women, however much you may 
 
 
have regretted it later and however much you regret it now. 
   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

There is a moving victim impact statement from Ms Hayter’s brother expressing the views 
 
and despair of the whole family.  He describes how his sister was his confidante, someone to 
 
 
whom he turned when he needed her and who was always on the end of the telephone to 
 
talk.  He talks of his time with his niece and the pleasure of shopping with her, buying her 
 
collections of things that she liked, like money boxes.  He describes how the lives of his 
 
 
family will never be the same again, and how difficult they find it not to know why you acted 
 
 
 
as you did. 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

As to aggravating factors, this was a double murder carried out on two women in their 
 
home, where they were entitled to feel and should have been safe.  Your attack on each of 
 
them involved the use of a weapon of which you essentially accept you disposed, even 
 
though you cannot remember doing it.  Ms Owen was vulnerable, suffering from diabetes 
 
(as in fact did Ms Hayter) but also mild or moderate learning difficulties and a spinal 
 
condition which required her to wear special footwear and night splints.  She had attended a 
 
special school until the age of 19, could read and write but had a younger mental age than 
 
average.  That said, it is right not to overstate the position.  Ms Owen did not need full time 
 
 
physical supervision. She was able to use a computer and telephone and to go out and 
 
 
about, albeit on a restricted basis. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
  

  
 

  
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I turn to your personal circumstances.  You come from a large family.  You did well at school. 
 
 
  
You went on to have various jobs. You worked in a hospital, as a nursery nurse and in 
 
security. You met Ms Hayter when you were both about 22 years old.  At the time of the 
 
 
attack you were not under any medical treatment or prescription.  Indeed, you have no 
 
 
relevant medical history. Your life at the time was a relatively isolated one.  You were the 
 

 
  

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
designated and paid carer for Ms Owen for the last 8 years of her life. I accept that you were 
 
a doting and loving father to Ms Owen, as was Ms Hayter a doting and loving mother to her. 
 
 
  
Your life revolved around looking after Ms Owen and the house and garden.  You made 
 
sacrifices to care and feed her properly, going without yourself as a result. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

   
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By way of mitigation, I take into account the following factors : 
    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a) you are a 55 year old man of positive good character with no previous convictions and 
 
 
who was a dedicated carer of your daughter; 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b) there is no evidence of any premeditation; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

c) your family circumstances suggest prolonged stress in your life arising out of what was a 
 
 
stormy relationship with Ms Hayter and the pressures of caring for Ms Owen; 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

d) finally, your age.  Any sentence that I can properly impose for offences of this nature will 
 
mean that you leave prison, if you do, an elderly man.  But it is suggested that in the 
 
circumstances of this case I should not remove all hope of you leaving prison one day. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also take into account the fact you turned yourself into police very shortly after the attacks 
 
 
and effectively confessed.  You gave accurate information to the police, enabling them to 
 
find the women. 
   

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Finally, you pleaded guilty, albeit only on the first day of trial.  Mr McDermott QC presses 
 
upon me the submission that this was not a cynical last‐minute plea.  He refers to the fact 
 
that this is a case where, given your lack of memory, a decision could only be taken after 
 
 
detailed consideration of complex medical evidence relating to possible psychiatric 
 
defences.  Your lawyers were still considering that evidence and advising you until very late 
 
 
in the day.  It is said that there is no suggestion that your lack of memory is a ploy and there 
 
 
is expert forensic psychiatric evidence which indicates that there may be genuine, conscious 
 
 
or unconscious, reasons for memory loss. 
 

  
  

 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

I accept that this was not a cynical last minute plea. But the fact nevertheless remains that 
 
 
 
you maintained a full denial to these charges until the start of trial.  You did not at any 
 
earlier stage offer a plea of guilty to manslaughter.  Following a defence statement in March 
 
 
2014 which essentially put the prosecution to proof of all matters and raised possible issues 
 
 
of loss of control and diminished responsibility, as recently as 7th April 2014 you put in a full 
 
 
supplemental defence statement.  That statement was lodged following what you said was 
 
an improvement in your memory of the details in respect of the deaths. In that statement 
 
 
you positively denied killing Ms Owen, stating that you believed that Ms Hayter had done so 
 
instead.  That positive denial makes your assertion that you had no meaningful memory a 
 
difficult one. 

 
 
 

  
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
In those circumstances, whilst I will give you some credit for your guilty plea, it will be for 
 
7.5%, which would equate to a discount of 15% if this were a determinate sentence. That 
 
discount takes into account what has been said in relation to your difficulties in recollection 
 
and the fact that a full analysis of the possibly psychiatric issues arising was required. 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
Sentence 
 

 

 

 

I am obliged by law to sentence you to imprisonment for life on each count of murder of 
 
 
which you now stand convicted.  I then have regard to Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice 
 
 
Act 2003 and to the Sentencing Guidelines for a reduction for a guilty plea. 
   

 
    

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Given that this was the murder of 2 persons involving the use of a weapon, I have no doubt 
 
that the seriousness of this offence is particularly high.  This produces a starting point of 30 
 
years.  The fact that this was a double murder leads me to adopt that higher starting point.  I 
    
therefore do not apply this factor again when adjusting the starting point for the other 
 
aggravating and mitigating factors identified above. 
 

  
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Having regard to all the aggravating features (other than double murder) and all the 
 
mitigating features in your case, I consider an appropriate minimum term on each count of 
 
 
murder to be 25 years. Although there may be differences on the facts between the two 
 
 
counts, the same term on each is appropriate to reflect your overall criminality. 
  

   
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I consider it appropriate to make a reduction for your guilty plea. I apply a 7.5%  discount by 
 
 
way of credit for your guilty plea.  I also give credit for the time spent in custody on remand. 
  

 
 
    

  
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

I therefore fix the minimum term which you will serve in custody, before the Parole board 
 
 
may consider your possible release, on each count at 23 years and 1 ½ months to run 
 
concurrently.  But for your plea of guilty I would have fixed the minimum term at 25 years. 
 
  
Time spent on remand in custody, which is now 154 days, will be deducted from this 
 
 
minimum term, producing the final minimum term. 
  

 
 
  
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In my judgment this minimum term accurately reflects the seriousness of the offences taking 
 
account of the statutory starting point, all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors and 
 
your guilty plea.  It means that you will be more than 75 years old before you can be 
 
considered for release. This is something that I have taken into account in reducing the 
 
 
 
minimum term. 
  

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

It is important that you – and everyone concerned with this case – should understand what 
 
this in fact means.  The minimum term is not a fixed term after which you will automatically 
 
be released but the minimum time that you will spend in custody before your case can be 
 
considered by the Parole Board.  It will be for the Parole Board to say at that time whether 
 
or not you will be released.  If it remains necessary for public protection, you will continue 
 
to be detained after that date.  If and when you are released you will be subject to licence 
 
and this will remain the case for the rest of your life.  If for any reason your licence were to 
 
be revoked, you would be recalled to prison to continue to serve your life sentence in 
 
custody. 
  

 
 
 

 
  

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the surcharge provisions apply to this case and the order will be drawn up 
 
 
accordingly.

JAMES STUART HALL
 
 

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE TURNER
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

23 MAY 2014
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 

 

1.	  Stuart Hall, you fall to be sentenced on two counts in the indictment upon 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  were  tried  having  been  acquitted  of  the  remaining  nineteen 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counts. 
 

 

 

2.	  You have pleaded guilty to Count 21 which relates to an occasion upon which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you indecently assaulted a young girl. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  Under Count 19, you have been found guilty by the jury of later indecently 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assaulting the same girl 
  

 

 

 

 

4.	  I will say at the outset that these offences are so serious that no sentence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other than one of immediate imprisonment could be justified in respect of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either of them. 
  

 

 

 

5.	  I propose to deal with each count in turn. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
COUNT 21 
 

 

 

 

6.	  Count  21  relates  to  an  occasion  the  precise  date  of  which  was  in  issue 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the prosecution and the defence. The prosecution alleged that your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim was between the ages of ten to twelve at the time of this offence but 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed  to  satisfy  the  jury  so  that  they  were  sure  that  this  was  the  case.  I 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honour  the  verdict  of  the  jury.  Nevertheless,  I  am  sure,  on  the  evidence  I 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have heard, that she was no more than thirteen at the relevant time and I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence on this basis. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.	  The facts are these. For many years, you and your wife had been very friendly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with another married couple. This couple had two daughters one of whom, a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

young teenager, was destined to join your lengthening list of female victims. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As we know from the details of the offences to which you pleaded guilty last 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year, your sexual offending against girls had started in 1967 which was about 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten years earlier than the events to which this count relates. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.	  One evening about 35 years ago, you, your wife and your teenage son went 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  your  friends’  house  having  been  invited  over  to  supper.  Also  there  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  young  girl  who  was  their  daughter’s  friend.  Unhappily,  while  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  with  the  other  adults,  the  two  girls  and  your  son  found  a  bottle  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spirits and proceeded to consume the contents while listening to music. In 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due course they all became very intoxicated. They began to feel ill and were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physically sick. 
 

 

 

9.	  You volunteered to help clean them up. Your real intentions, however, were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far darker. You saw their condition not as a cause for concern but as an ideal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  carry  out  acts  of  gross  sexual  molestation  on  the  two  girls 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while they were at least partly incapacitated by drink. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10. You went into your victim’s bedroom while she was drowsy or unconscious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  quantity  of  alcohol  she  had  taken.  You  came  to  her  bed.  You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
molested her by touching her intimately and putting a finger in her vagina. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She woke up during this ordeal and you continued until at one point you tried 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get on  top  of  her. Eventually,  you  desisted and  left  the  room. As  if  this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behaviour were not grotesque enough, on the same evening you molested 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your victim’s friend in the very same way while purporting to give her a bath. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11. The	  vileness  of  your  conduct  on  that  evening  would  be  difficult  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exaggerate. The element of breach of trust was of the utmost gravity. Your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim was well below the age of consent. You carried out your depredations 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the roof of her parents and under the camouflage of synthetic concern 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the welfare of the children. You repaid your close friends’ hospitality by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cynically defiling their daughter. 
  

 

 

 

12. You have already been sentenced last year for the indecent assault which you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrated  on  your  victim’s  friend  in  the  bathroom.  For  that  offence  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received  an  immediate  custodial  sentence  of  15  months  which  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequently left unchanged by the Court of Appeal. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13. In this day and age, some might well consider that such a sentence was not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long enough but, under the law as it stood when you were committing these 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indecent assaults, the maximum sentence laid down by Parliament was one 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  two  years  imprisonment.  In  approaching  the  task  of  determining  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate level of sentence on this count, I bear in mind the principles laid 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down in by the Court of Appeal in H and others [2012] 2 Cr. App. R (S) 21 in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context of so‐called “historic” offending.  The sentence for each offence 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be limited to the maximum sentence at the date when the offence was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed.  This,  therefore,  is  a  ceiling  beyond  which  this  court  is  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted to go. It is a longstanding principle both of the English common law 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights that no‐

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one may be punished more severely for an offence than the extent to which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he or she could have been punished under the law that prevailed at the time 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
the offence was committed. In that regard, therefore, the hands of this court 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are tied. 
 

 

14. Furthermore,  the  court  is  required  by  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Definitive Guideline – “Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea” to discount, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where a guilty plea is entered, the level of sentence which would otherwise 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been appropriate after a trial. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

15. Within  these	  parameters,  sentencing  is  to  be  in  accordance  with  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing regime which applies at the date of the sentencing hearing and in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance  with  a  measured  application  of  the  Definitive  Sentencing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline. 
  

16. In  this  case,  had  you  committed  this  offence  in  more  recent  years,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Definitive  Guideline  with  respect  to  your  conduct  would  have  been  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating to Assault by Penetration the appropriate sentence for which would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been considerably greater than this court can accommodate within the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory maximum of two years imprisonment laid down by Parliament in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sexual Offences Act 1956 which applies to your offending. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17. However, it is right that I should look at the generic factors both aggravating 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  mitigating  as  identified  in  the  Definitive  Guideline  to  assist  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balancing  act  which  this  sentencing  exercise  involves  but  still  acting  within 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the constraints of the sentencing powers imposed by the provisions  of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1956 Act. 
 

 

18. The most significant aggravating features on this count are: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(i)	 

 
(ii)	 

The serious nature of the assault itself which involved a sustained 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act of molestation involving full digital penetration of your victim’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagina; 
 

The gross disparity between your respective ages; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
(iii)	 

 
(iv)	 

 
(v)	 
 
(vi)	 

 
(vii)	 

The  impact  which  the  assault  had  on  your  young  victim.  I  have 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carefully  read  her  personal  statement  and  bear  in  mind  such  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  effects  upon  her  which  can  safely  and  properly  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associated  with  the  level  of  offending  for  which  you  fall  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced; 
 

The uninvited intrusion into what ought to have been the privacy 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your victim’s bedroom; 
 

 

 

 

The gross element of breach of trust; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  particular  vulnerability  of  your  victim  arising  through  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination of her age and state of intoxication; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  lack  of  candour  and  remorse  evidenced  in  your  prepared 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement to the police in which you expressed confected surprise 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all the allegations made against you when you knew full well, in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case of this victim, that you had sexually molested her. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19. There are also mitigating features: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(i)	 

 
(ii)	 

 
(iii)	 

 
(iv)	 

 
(v)	 

The relevant offending took place over 35 years ago; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At the time of the offence, you had no criminal record; although 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you were later to acquire one as a result of both earlier and later 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offending; 
 

There  are  positive  aspects  of  your  character  which  are  to  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit.  There  are  number  of  occasions  upon  which  you  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed  unambiguously  brave  and  selfless  deeds.  Your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

television  and  charity  work  as  surely  merited  your  OBE  as  your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminality justified its subsequent removal; 
 

 

 

 

 

You are of relatively advanced years and this should be reflected 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in your sentence; 
 

 

 

The  process  under  which  the  matters  alleged  against  you  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  to  light,  and  for  which  you  have  been  and  remain  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
sentenced, has been a protracted one that has been the source of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerable stress as have the repeated court appearances which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have ensued and the risk that the jury might have found you guilty 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of offences of rape even more serious than those which you now 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face; 
 

I  have  the  medical  report  which  was  prepared  by  your  general 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practitioner  for  use  when  you  fell  to  be  sentenced  on  the  first

many of the infirmities which can be expected to accrue in later 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years. The criminal proceedings have undoubtedly and predictably 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken their toll. 
 

 

 

 
(vi)	 

 

 

20. I take these factors into account but must bear in mind the guidance given in 
 

   
Attorney‐General’s References (Nos. 37, 38, 44, 54, 51, 53, 35, 40, 43, 45, 41

mitigating impact which age and infirmity will usually have in “historic” sex 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 
 

 

21. Your counsel contends that if the matters for which you fall to be sentenced 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today had been dealt with when the first tranche of allegations came before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this court last year then they may not have made any difference to the total 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  you  would  then  have  received.  However,  this  point  is  of  limited 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance to you. In this regard, reference can be made to the case of R v 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Smith  [2013]  EWCA  Crim  2091.  When  the  offences  for  which  you  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced last year came to light, it was open to you to reveal to the court 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you had abused another child. You did not do so. You did not wipe the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slate  clean.  You  therefore  denied  yourself  the  freedom  from  subsequent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution and punishment which a full confession would have given you. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To  this  extent,  you  are  therefore  the  author  of  your  present  situation. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Accordingly,  although  I  do  not  lose  sight  of  the  principle  of  totality  it  is  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6
--------
significantly  less  relevance  than  if  you  had  admitted  this  offence  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of your last prosecution. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22. It has also been hypothesised on your behalf that the prosecution may not 
 

   
have  brought  fresh  proceedings  against  you  if  the  later  allegations  relied 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon had been  limited to the two matters upon which you now fall to be 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced. I very much doubt that such conjecture is well founded and I am 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not prepared to entertain the level of speculation which would be involved in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  this  line  of  argument.  The  offences  for  which  you  fall  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  today  are  far  more  than  mere  postscripts  to  the  offending  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which you have already been punished. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23. Furthermore, I take the view that the fact that you molested two girls in such 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quick  succession  sheds  an  even  more  sinister  light  on  your  offending  than 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was evidenced by the one related offence to which you pleaded guilty last 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that it must have been with a sense 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of arrogant and contemptible immunity that you defiled each of these young 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

girls one in the immediate wake of the other. It was an act of vile bravado 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and horrible betrayal. 
 

 

 

24. To reflect the residual element of totality and the other mitigating features, I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take as the starting point for this offence a sentence of eighteen months from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  appropriate  discount  for  a  guilty  plea  at  the  first  available 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity is, under the relevant Guideline, one third. It would have been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open to me to give a lower discount because you failed to admit this offence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during your police interview but I have already identified your lack of candour 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and remorse at this stage as an aggravating feature and it would be wrong to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

double count this element against you. This appraoch gives rise to a sentence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  twelve months on  this count  which  is to be served consecutively to the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total period of imprisonment to which you are already subject. A consecutive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence is justified not least by the fact that there were two victims of your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7
--------
egregiously  predatory  behaviour  on  the  evening  in  question.  Each  has 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered the individual consequences of your offending and so must you. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

COUNT 19 
 

 

 

 

 

 

25. Count  19,  of  which  you  were  convicted  by  the  jury,  relates  to  oral  sex 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurring before your victim’s sixteenth birthday. About two years after your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assault upon her in her bedroom, your victim began to spend time with you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the BBC studios at Piccadilly and Oxford Road. She would go with you to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

football matches upon which you were commentating. You would pick her up 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  bring  food  and  champagne.  Throughout  this  period  you  had  frequent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual intercourse. This occurred at the studios, at a flat in Sale and, on one 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasion, at a flat near St John Street, Manchester. The jury was sure that on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one occasion, at least, oral sex took place. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26. At  this  point  I  must  say  something  about  the  curious  legal  position  which 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to this aspect of your offending. Under the provisions of the Sexual 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Offences  Act  1956,  a  victim  under  the  age  of  sixteen  cannot  consent  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indecent assault. Accordingly, once the jury was sure that, for example, oral 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sex  had  taken  place  between  you  and  your  victim  before  her  sixteenth 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

birthday  then  conviction  was  inevitable.  It  was  also  an  offence  under  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  Act  to  have  sexual  intercourse  with  a  girl  under  the  age  of  sixteen. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, for historical reasons, the Act imposed a one year time limit on the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commencement  of  proceedings  for  unlawful  sexual  intercourse.  This  time 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit does not apply where the offence charged is rape but this offence will 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only be made out where a jury is sure that there was no consent or concludes 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the perpetrator may have had a genuine belief that such consent was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given. 
  

27. The  anomalous  result  is  that  under  the  1956  Act  the  lesser  offence	  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indecent  assault  can  be  charged  at  any  time  whereas  the  more  serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------
offence of unlawful sexual intercourse is subject to a limitation period of one 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year. 
  

28. It follows that, notwithstanding that fact that you had unlawful sex with your 
 

   
victim on numerous occasions, you fall to be sentenced only in respect of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oral sex which amounted to indecent assault the maximum total sentence in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect of which is two years. In deference to the verdicts on the counts of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rape, I must sentence you on the basis that the jury concluded that, despite 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that your victim was under the age of sixteen, the prosecution had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not proved that the assault was non‐consensual. This is a matter of mitigation 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not a defence. 
 

 

 

 

29. Had you had oral sex with an underage girl more recently, you would have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  guilty  of  the  offence  of  sexual  activity  with  a  child  and,  again,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  sentence  would  have  comfortably  exceeded  the  maximum  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  years  laid  down  by  Parliament  back  in  1956.  Nevertheless,  for  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons I have already given with respect to Count 21, this court is simply not 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted to exceed that ceiling. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

30. The aggravating features under this count are: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(i)	 

 
(ii)	 

 
(iii)	 
 
(iv)	 
 
(v)	 

 

This was a gross breach of trust. You had known your victim for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  years and  she  was  entrusted  to  your  care  when  you  took 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage of her; 
 

 

 

There was an element of grooming involving the combined use of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flattery and the disinhibiting effects of alcohol; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There was a significant disparity in age between you; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The level of indecency was serious; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

You showed no remorse in your prepared statement to the police 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which you clearly implied that no such conduct had taken place. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9
--------
31. The mitigating features are the same as those which I identified under Count 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 but, by your plea of not guilty, you lost your right to a discount on your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence. 
 

  

32. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appropriate sentence under this 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Count 
 

is  one  of  eighteen  months 
 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment  which  should  run 
 

 

 

 

consecutively  to  the  sentence  of  twelve  months  under  Count  21  and  also 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutively to the total period of imprisonment to which you are already 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  making  a  total  of  a  further  two  years  and  six  months.  Consecutive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences  are  merited  to  reflect  the  fact  that  the  offending  on  the  two 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counts relates to very different occasions in time and in nature. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33. I	  am  not  persuaded  that  the  principle  of  totality  justifies  any  further 
 

   
reduction either with reference to the sentence you are presently serving or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as between the two counts upon which you fall to be sentenced today. This 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, in my view, the shortest term I can pass which is commensurate with the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriousness  of  your  offending.  I  wish  to  make  it  plain  that  the  levels  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence I have adopted and their consecutive application is based upon the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles set out in H and others and is uninfluenced by any perception that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  impact  of  my  sentencing  should  be  somehow  artificially  augmented  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counterbalance the advantages you have enjoyed as a result of the two year 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  maximum  or  the  operation  of  the  limitation  period  in  respect  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  intercourse  with  children.  Unpalatable  as  the  result  may  appear  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some,  you  are  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  protection  which  Parliament 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought fit to provide and it would undermine the rule of law to attempt to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumvent the consequences of this by collateral means. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

OTHER MATTERS 
 

 

 

 

34. You  will  serve  up  to  one  half  of  your  sentence  in  custody  before  you  are 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released on licence. You must abide by the terms of the licence and commit 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10
--------
no further offence or you will be liable to be recalled and you may then serve 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the remainder of the sentence in custody. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

35. This is not a suitable case for a compensation order. I do not have sufficient 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information to make one. If a claim for compensation is to be made then the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate jurisdiction is that of the civil courts. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36. I do not consider it is necessary to make a Sexual Offences Prevention Order 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

for the protection of the public to whom I accept you pose no perceptible 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuing risk. 
 

 

 

37. You will, in addition, pay the appropriate victim surcharge.

SENTENCING REMARKS  

OF THE HON. MR JUSTICE HADDON-CAVE 
___________________________________________ 

 
THE BACKGROUND 
1.  On 1st April 2007, Mrs Gillian Astbury, aged 66, was admitted to the Accident & 
Emergency Department of Stafford Hospital having suffered a fall at home.  She 
had  sustained  fractures  to  her  arm  and  pelvis.    She  was  a  Type  1  diabetic  and 
suffered from mild dementia.  She required daily insulin to control her condition.  
On admission, Mrs Astbury’s friend and carer, Mr Ronald Street, made it clear 
that she suffered from ‘brittle’ diabetes which required regular monitoring.     

 
2.  People with diabetes have been said to occupy 16% of hospital beds in the UK 
and diabetes-related treatment to consume 9% of hospital costs.1 Accordingly,  the 
admission of a patient with an underlying diabetic condition was not an unusual 
scenario. 

 
3.  The doctor who admitted Mrs Astbury directed that if her blood sugar rose above 
18mmols blood sugar at any of the four blood tests to be conducted daily, she was 
to receive a fast acting insulin called Actrapid.  A daily dose of slow acting insulin 
was also to be given.  He entered her prescriptions on her drug chart.  He also 
required Mrs Astbury to be seen by a dietician, to ensure she received appropriate 
nourishment whilst in hospital. 

 
4.  Ten days later, on the evening of 10th April 2007, Mrs Astbury was found in a 
collapsed  state  in  her  bed  on  the  Trauma  and  Orthopaedic  Ward.    A  blood  test 
showed a blood sugar reading of 27.8mmols.  She died in the early hours of 11th 
April due to diabetic ketoacidosis (insulin deficiency). 

 
5.  This  was  a  wholly  avoidable  and  tragic  death  of  a  vulnerable  patient  who  was 
admitted to hospital for care, but who died because of the lack of it.  This fatality 
was not simply due to error and omissions by an individual nurse or nurses. The 
underlying  causes  were  far  more  fundamental.    As  repeated  investigations  have 

                                                 
1 Audit Commission 2000 

 

 

1
--------
revealed, there was a systemic failure at Stafford Hospital in relation to two of the 
most basic (and simple) tenets of patient care: proper handovers between nursing 
shifts  and  proper  record-keeping.  The  hospital  management  failed  to  prescribe, 
monitor  and  enforce  a  proper,  structured  and  rigorous  system  of  work  for 
handovers between nursing shifts and to devise and ensure the proper marshalling, 
updating and checking of medical records and notes. 

 
6.  These failures of organisation and management, meant that nursing and medical 
staff were working within a lax and poorly run system from the start.  There was 
an absence of effective management, oversight or control.  There was little or no 
accountability.  There was a chronic shortage of nurses throughout the hospital.  It 
was a system that was set to fail.  It is precisely when individuals are expected to 
work within such a system that professional standards drop, mistakes multiply and 
a  general  lassitude  takes  over.      Some  of  some  the  nursing  staff  at  Stafford 
Hospital  charged  with  nursing  Mrs  Astbury  habitually  ignored  basic  nursing 
standards  and  principles.    This  was  because  of  an  underlying  unsafe  system  of 
work. As the Trust have openly acknowledged from the start, responsibility for the 
poor  state  of  affairs  at  Stafford  Hospital  in  2007  lay  firmly  at  the  door  of 
management at the highest level.  

 
7.  These failures put legions of patients at Stafford Hospital at serious risk. Proper 
systems of handovers and record-keeping in hospitals are obviously vital to ensure 
the correct and timely marshalling and passing on of patient information to enable 
the continuous delivery of appropriate medical care to patients and the carrying 
out  of  patient  care  plans.  In  Mrs  Astbury’s  case,  this  included  the  need  to 
administer a basic diabetes care plan. 

 
8.  There  is  no  doubt  that  these  failures  were  directly  causative  of  Mrs  Astbury’s 
death.  The simple fact is that Mrs Astbury died in Stafford Hospital because she 
was not given the insulin that she needed.  The disturbing fact is that there was a 
systemic failure to implement her care plan, despite the involvement of numerous 
medical staff in the days leading up to her death.  A proper system of handover 
between  shifts  and  record-keeping  is  axiomatic  for  proper  patient  care.    It  is 
especially important if patients are not able to speak for themselves. It was vital 
for Mrs Astbury in view of her ‘brittle’ diabetes.  The absence of a proper system 
meant  that  there  were  numerous  failures  properly  to  record  and  communicate 
critical  information  regarding  her  condition.    The  system  of  patient  care  at 
Stafford Hospital in 2007 was effectively broken. 

 
THE FACTS 
 
9.  Following her admission to Stafford Hospital on 1st April 2007 as aforesaid, Mrs 
Asbury was allocated to a vascular ward, Ward 7.  A Senior Staff Nurse on Ward 
7 noted during the night shift that Mrs Astbury appeared to be eating very little.  
However, no referral to a Dietician was made.  

 
10. On  the  4th,  6th  and  7th  April,  Mrs  Astbury’s  blood  sugar  levels  exceeded  the 
18mmols  threshold  and  Actrapid  was  duly  administered.  However,  there  is  no 
evidence, however, of the Diabetes Nurse having being contacted at any stage.  

 

 

2
--------
11. In the early evening of 8th April, Mrs Astbury was transferred from Ward 7 to the 
Trauma  and  Orthopaedic  Ward,  which  was  housed  in  temporary  premises  and 
shared  facilities  and  space  with  other  wards.    She  was  placed  in  a  relatively 
isolated bay, with two beds. It was not possible to observe her directly from the 
main ward.  The Ward Manager stated that this created difficulties in operating the 
ward,  exacerbated  by  staff  shortages  and  no  extra  nursing  cover.    The  Ward 
Manager  Ward  7  and  the  Trauma  and  Orthopaedic  Ward  used  different 
documentation  for  patient  notes,  and  the  Ward  7  notes  would  not  have  been 
continued or updated after the transfer. The fact that Mrs Astbury suffered from 
‘brittle’ diabetes was not passed on from one ward to the next.   Mrs Astbury was 
in the care of the ‘Blue’ team of nurses on the Trauma and Orthopaedic Ward.  
The Staff Nurse in charge of the shift did not perform the shift handover because 
she went off duty prior to the next shift start time.    

 
12. On 9th April, a Staff Nurse conducted the lunchtime and teatime blood sugar tests, 
but was concerned that Mrs Astbury had not been given a Diabetic Menu for her 
meal.  It is not clear, however, whether she informed the Ward Manager of this.  
At 15:00 hours on 9th April, she handed over to another Staff Nurse from the in-
coming  shift.    There  was  a  dispute  as  to  whether  the  fact  of  Mrs  Astbury’s 
diabetes  was  communicated.    There  was  no  written  record  of  the  passing  on  of 
information.  At 23:00 hours on 9th April, the Ward patients were handed over to 
another  Staff  Nurse  and  an  “Adaptation  Nurse”  (a  nurse  from  abroad  in 
familiarisation training), who stayed on shift until 07:15 hours on 10th April. 

 
13. Blood sugar tests were carried out on Mrs Astbury on 9th and 10th April, showing 
results of 14.6mmols and 19.7mmols respectively.  A Staff Nurse stated, however, 
that he misheard the second of these results as “9.7”, and so he had no concerns, 
as  the  threshold  point  for  administering  fast  acting  insulin  was  18mmols  blood 
sugar. 

 
14. At 07:15 hours on 10th April, a Staff Nurse handed over to a Senior Staff Nurse 
but, again, there is a dispute as to whether the fact of Mrs Astbury’s diabetes was 
communicated.  At 8:00 hours, a Staff Nurse arrived on duty but confusion arose 
as to whether the incoming or outgoing Staff Nurse would carry out the medicines 
round.    The  incoming  Staff  Nurse  stated  that  she  was  unaware  of  the  diabetes 
issue.  At lunchtime, a Healthcare Support Worker who was aware of the diabetes 
issue, noted that Mrs Astbury did not have a diabetic menu.  A lunchtime blood 
sugar  test  was  not  conducted.  Nor  did  the  drugs  round  reach  Mrs  Astbury.  
Consequently,  she  went  without  her  08:00am  slow  release  insulin.    At  13:45 
hours,  a  further  handover  took  place  during  which  the  diabetes  issue  was  not 
mentioned.  It is also clear that the patient notes were not read at this time. At 
15:00  hours,  Mrs  Astbury  was  given  her  evening  medication  but  the  nurse  in 
question failed to notice that she had not been given her morning medication.  At 
teatime,  on  10th  April,  no  blood  sugar  test  was  undertaken.  Mrs  Astbury  was 
given an ordinary menu. 

 
15. At 21:15 hours on 10th April, a further shift handover took place at which time 
Mrs Astbury was found in a collapsed state.  A blood test showed a blood sugar 
reading  of  27.8mmols.    She  died  at  01:20  hours  on  11th  April  due  to  insulin 
deficiency as aforesaid.   I repeat, this was a wholly avoidable death.

THE REPORTS 
 
The Trust’s internal Report 
16. The  Defendant,  the  Mid  Staffordshire  NHS  Foundation  Trust  (“the  Trust”) 
conducted its own internal investigation into Mrs Astbury’s death.  The Trust’s 
Report  characterised  the  system  of  the  handover  between  nursing  staff  as 
“inconsistent and sometimes non existent”.  It found that the nursing records for 
Mrs Astbury were “almost non existent”. 

 
The HSE Wood/ Halliday-Bell Report  
17. The Health & Safety Executive (“HSE”)’s Report2 found that the various aspects 
of Mrs Astbury’s nursing care and communication of her care “fell significantly 
short of what would be expected, not just over one shift but eight shifts, possibly 
eleven drug rounds by a series of nurses.” 

The Nicholls Report 
18. A Report by a nursing expert, Ms Lorraine Nicholls, comprising a helpful ‘Plain 
English’ analysis of Mrs Astbury’s medical records, revealed numerous failures.  
There  was  a  plethora  of  different,  overlapping  forms  in  use  at  the  Trust,  some 
outdated,  many  incomplete.    The  basic  Multi-Disciplinary  Care  Pathway  for 
Emergency  Admission  (Adult)  Form  was  hardly  filled  in.    Between  5th  and  7th 
April, there was an absence of any medical notes being made at all.  There were 
no entries in the Diabetes Care Plan after 7th April.  There was a failure to record 
any observations of Mrs Astbury after 9th April. There were failures to notice Mrs 
Astbury’s  blood  sugar  level  rising  above  the  threshold  of  18mmols  and  to 
administer Actrapid when needed.  There was a failure to move Mrs Astbury even 
when she was at risk from C Difficile.  There was a failure to call a doctor even 
when Mrs Asbury was displaying signs of distress.   

 
The Francis Report  
19. The death of Mrs Astbury case must be also viewed against the background of the 

 

detailed and damning findings of the Report of the Mid Staffordshire NHS 
Foundation Trust Public Inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC which was 
published to Parliament on 6th February 2013.  Mr Francis QC’s magisterial 
Report spoke of “…an engrained culture of tolerance of poor standards, a focus 
on finance and targets, denial of concerns, and an isolation from practice 
elsewhere.”  The Trust’s culture was characterised as one of “self promotion” 
rather than critical analysis and openness.  The Trust management ignored 
numerous warning signs.  The Trust lacked a sufficient sense of collective 
responsibility or engagement for ensuring that quality care was delivered at every 
level.  The Trust management had no culture of listening to patients and 
inadequate processes for dealing with complaints or serious untoward incidents.  
The Board had failed “to get a grip” on its accountability and governance 
structure despite these being issues that were apparent to the incoming Chair and 

                                                 
2 Prepared by the HSE’s two in-house specialists, Ms Julie Wood, (Principal Specialist Inspector 
Occupational Health) and Dr J. Halliday-Bell (Medical Inspector, Corporate Medical Unit) dated 13th 
February 2009.

--------
Chief Executive in 2004 and 2005.  The evidence fully supported the description 
of the Trust’s clinical governance process as “vestigal”.  There was a focus on 
financial issues at the expense of the quality of service delivered.  The economies 
imposed by the Board, year after year, had a “profound” effect on the 
organisation’s ability to deliver a safe and effective service.  There was an 
“unacceptable delay” in addressing the issue of shortage of skilled nursing staff.  
The system as a whole paid “lip service” to the need not to compromise services 
and their quality, and it was “remarkable” how little attention was paid to the 
potential impact of proposed savings on quality and service. As a result of poor 
leadership and staffing policies, a “completely inadequate” standard of nursing 
was offered in some wards in Stafford.   The Trust prioritised its finances and its 
Foundation Trust status application over its quality of care and “failed to put 
patients at the centre of its work”.  The Board at the time must bear collective 
responsibility for allowing the “mismatch” between resources and needs to 
persist, without protest or warning of the consequences.  (See generally, the 
Executive Summary to the Report, especially paragraphs 1-1.16) 

 
20. Staff  shortages  also  compromised  time  available  for  handovers.  The  Public 
Inquiry Report3 described “a chronic staffing deficiency exacerbated by the need 
to meet financial targets” in 2006.  An internal review in 2007 showed that the 
Trust was some 120 WTE nurses short of what was required, nearly 13% of the 
total  nursing  establishment.4    The  Trust  Board  was  made  aware  of  this  at  its 
meeting  July  2007  meeting.5  Band  7  nurses  were  expected  to  be  responsible 
simultaneously for three wards, i.e. 74 beds. 

21. Whilst the Francis Report addressed wider issues than those raised in this 

prosecution, there is a clear relationship between lack of proper governance, 
leadership, management and supervision, laid bare in the Francis Report, and the 
poor care, record-keeping and handover regimes which led to Mrs Astbury’s 
death.   

 
THE PROSECUTION 
 
22. The Trust were prosecuted by the HSE under the Health and Safety at Work etc 

Act 1974 (“the Act”) in respect of the death of Mrs Astbury. 

 
Trust’s admission - 2010 
23. In 2010, the Trust made a formal admission accepting responsibility for the death 
of Mrs Astbury as a result of inappropriate treatment during her admission to the 
Trauma and Orthopaedic Ward in 2007. 

 
HSE prosecution - 2013 
24. On 19th April 2013, Mr Stephen Flanagan, Her Majesty’s Principal Inspector of 
Factories,  wrote  on  behalf  of  the  HSE  inviting  the  Trust  to  put  forward  a 
representative for interview under caution.   The Trust nominated Ms Julie Hendy, 
the Trust’s new Director of Quality and Patient Experience, to appear at interview.  

                                                 
3 Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry Final Report (Volume 1, page 211) 
4 Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry Final Report (Volume 1, para 2.284) 
5 Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry Final Report (Volume 1 Para 2.283) 

 

5
--------
At interview, Ms Hendy read a statement making full and frank admissions as to 
the Trust’s responsibility for the death of Mrs Astbury: 

(1)  The  Trust  accepted  the  HSE’s  factual  summary  was  a  broadly  accurate 

account of the events leading to the hospitalisation of Mrs Astbury. 

 
(2)  The Trust accepted the findings of its own internal investigation into the 

death of Mrs Astbury and its failures. 

 
(3)  The  Trust  accepted  that  it  had  failed  to  deliver  the  diabetes  treatment 
regime which it had determined was necessary for Mrs Astbury, which the 
led to her death.   

 

 

25. On  4th  September  2013,  a  Summons  was  issued,  returnable  on  9th  September 
2013.  When the matter came before the Stafford Magistrates on 9th September 
2013, the Trust formally entered a plea of guilty.  The Magistrates committed the 
matter  to  the  Crown  Court  because  they  considered  their  sentencing  powers 
insufficient. 

 
26. The  Trust,  therefore,  pleaded  guilty  at  the  earliest  possible  opportunity,  having 
previously volunteered a formal admission of responsibility for the death of Mrs 
Astbury. 

 
THE LAW 
 
Health & Safety at Work Act  
27. The Trust owed duties under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (“the 
Act”),  to  conduct  its  undertaking  in  such  a  way  as  to  protect  patients  from 
exposure to risk.  By section 3(1) of the Act every employer has a duty to conduct 
its undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that 
persons  not  in  its  employment  who  may  be  affected  by  the  conduct  of  its 
undertaking, are not as a result exposed to risks to their health or safety. 

 
28. An employer fails to ensure the health and safety of such persons if there can be 
shown to exist “a risk to safety”.  This bears its ordinary meaning, i.e. denoting 
the  possibility  of  danger  rather  than  actual  danger.  The  section  imposes  a  strict 
liability,  subject  only  to  the  qualification  of  “reasonable  practicability”,  i.e. 
requiring  an  employer  to  do  all  that  is  reasonably  practicable  to  prevent  or 
minimise material risk. 

 
29. Patients  at  Stafford  Hospital  were  clearly  exposed  to  risks  to  their  health  and 
safety  arising  from  inadequate  handover  and  record-keeping  procedures.  The 
Trust clearly failed to take every reasonably practicable step to minimise or reduce 
that risk.  

 
Sentencing - general principles 
30. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd (sitting in the Court of 
Appeal Criminal Division with Mitting and Thirlwall JJ) has recently given 
definitive guidance as to the correct approach when sentencing large organisations 

 

6
--------
for breach of health and safety legislation in the conjoined appeals R v. Sellafield 
and R v. Network Rail Infrastructure Limited [2014] EWCA Crim 49. 

31. Given the importance of this guidance to the present case, it is appropriate to cite 

paragraphs 3-7 in full: 

It is important at the outset to recall the provisions which Parliament 

“3. 
has enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (CJA 2003) in relation to the 
duty of the courts in sentencing, as these principles are applicable to all 
offenders, including companies:  

The courts must have regard in dealing with offenders to the purposes 
i)  
of sentencing which Parliament specified as (a) the punishment of offenders 
(b) the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence), (c) the 
reform and rehabilitation of offenders, (d) the protection of the public, and (e) 
the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences 
(s.142 of the CJA 2003).  

In considering the seriousness of the offence the court must have 

ii)  
regard to the culpability of the offender and the harm caused or which might 
foreseeably be caused (s.143 of the CJA 2003). 

If a court decides on a fine it must approach the fixing of fines having 

iii)  
regard not only to the purposes of sentencing and the seriousness of the 
offence, but must also take into account the criteria set out in s.164 of the CJA 
2003:6 

(1)  

(2)  

(3)  

Before fixing the amount of any fine to be imposed on an offender who 
is an individual, a court must inquire into his financial circumstances. 

The amount of any fine fixed by a court must be such as, in the opinion 
of the court, reflects the seriousness of the offence. 

In fixing the amount of any fine to be imposed on an offender (whether 
an individual or other person), a court must take into account the 
circumstances of the case including, among other things, the financial 
circumstances of the offender so far as they are known, or appear, to 
the court. 

(4)  

Subsection (3) applies whether taking into account the financial 
circumstances of the offender has the effect of increasing or reducing 
the amount of the fine. 

There can be no doubt as to the objective in applying these principles 

4. 
when sentencing a company for offences against health and safety and 
environmental legislation. As Scott Baker J stated in giving the judgment of 
this court R v F Howe & Son (Engineers) Ltd [1999] 2 All ER 249 at 255, 
[1999] 2 Cr App R (S) 37 at 44:  

                                                 
6   Section 164 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was in force in 2007. 
 

 

7
--------
""The objective of prosecutions for health and safety offences in the 
work place is to achieve a safe environment for those who work there 
and for other members of the public who may be affected. A fine needs 
to be large enough to bring that message home where the defendant is 
a company not only to those who manage it but also to its 
shareholders."" 

Where a fine is to be imposed a court will therefore first consider the 

5. 
seriousness of the offence and then the financial circumstances of the offender. 
The fact that the defendant to a criminal charge is a company with a turnover 
in excess of £1 billion makes no difference to that basic approach.  

The fine must be fixed to meet the statutory purposes with the 

6. 
objective of ensuring that the message is brought home to the directors and 
members of the company (usually the shareholders). The importance of the 
application of s.164 in relation to corporate defendants was reinforced in the 
Definitive Guideline of the Sentencing Guidelines Council Corporate 
Manslaughter & Health and Safety Offences Causing Death, published in 
2010. It has been reflected in more recent decisions of this court: see for 
example: R v Tufnells Park Express Ltd [2012] EWCA Crim 222 at para 43 
(the fine after trial on a company with a turnover of £100m and profitability of 
£7.7m was £225,000; this represented, as the court noted, 2.9% of its 
operating profit).  

7. 
It will therefore always be necessary in the case of companies with a 
turnover in excess of £1 billion to examine with great care and in some detail 
the structure of the company, its turnover and profitability as well as the 
remuneration of the directors.  …”.  

32. The Court of Appeal upheld fines of £700,000 against Sellafield Ltd for offences 

arising out of the disposal of radioactive waste and £500,000 against Network Rail 
for an offence arising out of a collision at an unmanned level crossing, causing 
very serious injuries to a child.   

 
Accountability of public bodies  
33. HSE prosecutions of public bodies involve a philosophical conundrum: What is 

the point of fines when they are paid out of public funds?  

34. The answer lies in accountability.  All organisations, public or private, are 

accountable under the criminal law following Parliament’s removal of Crown 
immunity. This means that Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 apply to all responsible public bodies, just as they do to 
private organisations.  Accordingly, public bodies are to be held equally 
accountable under the criminal law for acts and omissions in breach of Health and 
Safety legislation and punished accordingly.  Accountability is the reciprocal of 
responsibility. 

35. The fact that a fine will have to be met from public funds or in a reduction in 
investment by a public body is, however, a factor which a court must take into 
account when assessing the level of fine (R v Milford Haven Port Authority [2002] 

 

8
--------
2 Cr App R 423; R v Network Rail [2011] Cr App R (S) 44, [2010] EWCA Crim 
1225 at para 24). 

36. The Court of Appeal in R v. Sellafield (supra) pointed out that a fine will, 

nonetheless, serve three other purpose of sentencing if (a) it reduces criminal 
offences of the kind committed, (b) reforms and rehabilitates the defendant as an 
offender and (c) protects the public. The Court of Appeal went on to say that, to 
ensure that a fine will achieve these statutory purposes of sentencing, “the fine 
must be such that it will bring home to the directors and members of [the 
organisation] these three purposes of sentencing” (paragraph 70).  

 
Further sentencing authorities 
37. Mr Climie, Counsel for the Defence, cited R v. Southampton University Hospital 

NHS Trust [2006] EWCA Crim 2971 which he submitted was a useful 
comparable.  In that case, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed a fine of 
£100,000 imposed on Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust for failures to 
supervise doctors, and substituted a fine of £40,000.  In my judgment, however, 
this case is clearly distinguishable for three reasons: (a) the Trust failures were 
held to be non-causative of the patient’s death, (b) two Senior House Officers 
were prosecuted and found guilty of manslaughter and (c) the case was a pre-
Sentencing Guideline case. 

38. Mr Thorogood, Counsel for the Prosecution, cited a number of recent cases 

involving deaths where the following fines had been imposed following Health & 
Safety Executive prosecutions:  a fine of £100,000 imposed by HHJ Eccles QC in 
R v. Lifeways Community Care Ltd (22nd January 2010 at Oxford Crown Court); a 
fine of £150,000 imposed by HHJ Jukes QC in R v. BUPA (19th January 2011 at 
Birmingham Crown Court); a fine of £80,000  imposed by HHJ Davies QC in R v. 
Midland Heart Ltd (5th October 2011 at Birmingham Crown Court); and a fine of 
£125,000 imposed by HHJ Milmo QC in R v. UK Coal Mining Ltd (15th April 
2013, Nottingham Crown Court).  However, none are comparable in seriousness 
to the present case. 

 
THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES  

39. In 2010, the Sentencing Guidelines Council published is Definitive Guideline on 

Corporate Manslaughter & Health & Safety Offences Causing Death. The 
guideline applies in cases, such as the present, where it is proved that the offence 
was a significant cause of death, not simply that death occurred (paragraph 4(c)). 

40. As the Court of Appeal Criminal Division noted in R v Marble City Ltd [2010] 

EWCA Crim 1872, no starting point is provided in the guidelines themselves and 
no specific bracket or figures are given.  The guidelines simply provide that fines 
must be punitive and sufficient to have an impact on the defendant, having regard 
to its means.  General guidance is, however, given in paragraph 25, where it is 
said that where the Health and Safety Offences are shown to have caused death, 
“the appropriate fine will seldom be less than £100,000 and may be measured in 
hundreds of thousands of pounds or more”. 

41. I direct myself in accordance with paragraph 37 of the Sentencing Guidelines. 

 

9
--------
Factors likely to affect seriousness 
42. I take full account of all the guidance as to the “Factors likely to affect 

seriousness” in Section B of the Definitive Guidance.  In summary: death or 
serious injury was plainly foreseeable in this case; the Trust fell far short of 
appropriate standards of care, handover and record-keeping; these failures were 
serious and systemic; responsibility for the breaches went to the very top of the 
organisation; there was a failure to heed warnings; the victim in this case was 
particularly vulnerable; there was, however, a prompt acceptance of responsibility, 
a high level of co-operation with the investigation, beyond that which will always 
be expected and a genuine effort to rectify the defects  (See futher below). 

 
Aggravating factors 
43. There are five striking features of this case which distinguish it from other cases 

and render it far more serious than any of the cases cited: 

(1) 

It involved serious systemic breaches which were directly causative of the 
death of Mrs Astbury. 

(2)  The breaches related to core skills and functions of any hospital operation, 

namely basic handover procedures and medical record keeping. 

(3)  The breaches were symptomatic of a general malaise as to culture, 

standards and priorities which existed between 2004 and 2007 at Stafford 
Hospital. 

(4)  The underlying causes of the breaches and the malaise were fundamental 
organisational and managerial failures, which can be traced to the very top 
of the organisation.  

(5)  These failures included ignoring warning signs that there was serious 

systemic issues at the Trust which required urgent and effective action. 

 
Mitigating factors 
44. This is also case which a number of powerful mitigating factors.  
45. First, the Trust made an early voluntary admission of culpability for the death of 
Mrs Astbury and entered a plea of guilty at the first opportunity.   Further, at all 
material times, the Trust has shown a high degree of co-operation with the 
authorities, and has been entirely candid about its failures and accepted full 
responsibility for the death of Mrs Astbury.   

46. Second, the events in question and the death of Mrs Astbury took place over seven 

years ago.  The lengthy delay in bringing the prosecution has been for entirely 
understandable reasons:  the HSE sensibly wished to allow the various other 
processes (i.e.  the inquest, internal inquiry and public inquiry) to take their course 
before reaching a final conclusion on whether a prosecution under the Act was 
justified.  But lengthy delay there has been; and in the intervening years, radical 
change has taken place in relation to (a) the senior managerial staff at the Trust, 
(b) the clinical and managerial practices and standards at the Trust, and (c) the 
financial health and structure of the Trust (see further below). 

 

10
--------
47. Third, the entire senior management layer of the Trust in post at the time of Mrs 

Astbury’s death has been replaced and the majority of the individuals whose 
shortcomings may have had some bearing upon the unfortunate events leading to 
Mrs Astbury’s death are no longer with the Trust.  There were also disciplinary 
proceedings against several of the staff. 

48. Fourth, the Trust has been the subject of the most rigorous and thorough public 

inquiries ever to have been conducted in relation to a hospital (chaired by Robert 
Francis QC) and has been the subject of intense public and press scrutiny, which 
has taken its toll. 

49. Fifth, since 2009 standards of care at the Trust have steadily improved, year-on-
year.   In 2012 and 2013, the Trust was the subject of 14 separate Care Quality 
Commission reports which signalled very significant improvements in the 
provision of care and standards at the Trust and progress in the restoration of 
public confidence.   Three Improvement Notices served in November 2013 have 
been complied with. 

50. Sixth, the pressures engendered by the well-publicised difficulties of the Trust, 

has had an adverse effect on morale, particularly amongst the front-line staff, and 
recruitment, making staffing levels impossible to maintain. In December, the 
special administrators appointed by Monitor declared the Trust no longer 
financially or clinically viable and recommended the Trust be wound up as soon 
as practicable.  Whilst 30% of NHS Trusts were expected to find themselves in 
deficit in the financial year 2013/2014, the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust is the 
only NHS Trust to have been placed in administration.  

51. Seventh, on 26th February 2014, the Secretary of State for Health, the Rt Hon. Mr 

Jeremy Hunt MP, accepted Monitor’s recommendation and announced that the 
Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust would be dissolved, some services removed and the 
remainder divided between the neighbouring health authorities, the Royal 
Wolverhampton Trust and the University Hospitals of North Stafford Trust.   I 
understand that the dissolution will be effected in September or October 2014. 

 
The Trust’s Financial situation  
52. I have considered the helpful statement of Ms Sarah Preston, the Trust’s Director 

of Finance.  The Trust has made a financial deficit in the last four accounting 
years and is forecast to make a deficit in the current financial year: 

 
2009-2010: 
2010-2011: 
2011-2012: 
2012-2013: 
2013-2014: 

£  4,478,000 deficit 
£13,967,000 deficit 
£19,911,000 deficit 
£14,739,000 deficit 
£21,200,000 deficit (forecast) 

53. Ms Preston explains that the Trust has only been able to continue to provide 

healthcare services to the people of Stafford and Cannock by receiving additional 
funding directly from the Department of Health.  She summarises the stark 
financial position of the Trust as follows: 

 

11
--------
“The Trust is not currently, or in the near future, going to be in a 
financial position to be able to pay a fine as we have no ability to earn 
any money that could cover our deficit and go towards the payment of the 
fine nor do we have any reserves which could be called upon.” 

54. I accept Ms Preston’s evidence in its entirely. 
 
Consequences of the fine  
55. Mr Climie submitted that that the Trust had already learned its lessons and been 
punished enough in the past seven years; and given the Trust’s financial situation 
the results of the prosecution would be primarily visited on innocent employees of 
the Trust who had nothing to do with the events in question and the public who 
used the hospital.   He did not, however, give any details of how this might be the 
case.  He further submitted that whilst there was a need for a punitive element to 
sentencing under the legislation and the need to mark loss of life in many cases, in 
the unique circumstances of the present case there was no need to send out a 
‘message’.  He accepted, however, that the imposition of a mere nominal fine 
would not be justified; but somewhat bravely suggested that a fine in the region of 
the magistrates’ limit of £20,000 would be appropriate.   In my judgment, a fine at 
that level would be nominal in the context of this case. 

 
Decision on level of fine 
56. I start by considering the level of fine which would have been appropriate if the 
defendant had been a private company.   Given the gravity of the situation which 
existed at the Trust between 2004 and 2007, and in particular the systemic nature 
of the serious failures which gave rise to the death of Mrs Astbury, if the 
defendant had been a profitable commercial organisation, I would have imposed a 
fine in the region of £1 million.  The failures here lay at the very heart of hospital 
work; responsibility for them went to the very top of the organisation; and, as 
elucidated in the Francis Report, amounted to a fundamental breakdown of the 
care system at Stafford Hospital. 

57. The Trust is, however, a public body. It is in serious financial difficulty.  It is, 

moreover, due to be broken up in the near future.  Even Mr Climie did not 
suggest, however, that in the circumstances, a nil or nominal fine should be 
imposed.  This would not give effect to the will of Parliament or punish the 
organisation in question.  In my judgment, a significant fine is called for to reflect 
the gravity of the offence, the loss of a life and in order to send out a strong 
message to all organisations, public or private, responsible for the care and 
welfare of members of the public.  There is a wider public interest at stake here, 
beyond that of the instant case, namely ensuring that public and private bodies are 
held properly accountable in respect of their responsibilities to the public under 
the Health and Safety Legislation. 

Starting point 
58. Taking all the above circumstances above fully into account, in my judgment, the 

proper starting level of fine for the Trust in this case would be £400,000.   

 

 

12
--------
Plea of guilty 
59. There must be a substantial reduction, however, for the early plea of guilty, for the 

early admission of responsibility and for the unprecedented level of co-operation 
by the Trust with the various inquiries.  The reduction should be greater than the 
normal.  In my judgment, a reduction of 50% is called for in all the circumstances 
of this case.   

60. Accordingly, the net fine which I impose is £200,000. 
61. In my judgment, the imposition of a fine of £200,000 is the minimum which 

would achieve the aims of Parliament encapsulated in section 164 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 2003 and the Health and Safety legislation,  If, as Mr Climie 
intimated, the fine has ultimately to be paid by the Department of Health itself, 
then sobeit.  That is a matter for the authorities. 

 
Costs  
62. The Guideline provides (in paragraph 29):  

 
“29. The defendant ought ordinarily (subject to means) to be ordered to pay 
the properly incurred costs of the prosecution” 

 
63. The HSE have put forward a costs estimate of £27, 049.74. This seems to me to be 

a moderate amount and well within the range of costs for this type of work.   
Accordingly, I order the Trust to pay prosecution costs in the sum of £27, 049.74, 
in addition to the £200,000 fine which I have imposed. 

Postscript 
64. Finally, it must be remembered that this case involves the death of a much-love 

person, Mrs Gillian Astbury.  I wish to add my condolences to her family and 
friends to those that have already been expressed.   No financial penalty can 
adequately equilibrate loss of life.  What the Court seeks to do is simply to punish 
the organisation responsible in accordance with the relevant Legislation and 
Sentencing Guidelines. 

65. As Mr Street observed, this prosecution affords “a small measure of justice to 

Gillian [Astbury]”. 

66. I am grateful to both Mr Thorogood and Mr Climie and their legal teams for their 

able assistance in this case.

Pierre Lewis, Isaac Boateng, Jemmikai Orlebar-Forbes 8; Rachel Kenehan
In the Crown Court at Winchester
3 March 2014
Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Keith
Lewis, Boateng and Forbes, will you stand up please. Thejury saw through your claim that
Jahmel Jones was accidentally shot in the course of a tussle when you, Forbes, were trying to
stop him pointing the gun at you which you claim he had brought with him. The fact is that
you brought the gun to Derek Saunders' and Sue Moran's flat in St Mary Street, that you
shot him and that you did so deliberately. You did not wound him fatally with your first
shot, but you did with the second. Jahmel Jones may have been a drug—dealer himself, but
he did not deserve to die. The law allows only one punishment for the crime of murder, and
the sentence which I pass on you, Boateng, on count 1 of the indictment for the murder of
Jahmel Jones is imprisonment for life. Since you, Lewis, and you, Forbes, are not yet 21, the
sentence which I pass on each of you on count 1 for the murder of Jahmel Jones is custody
for life.
These are indeterminate sentences, and that means that I must specify the minimum time
you must remain in prison or custody for before your release on licence can be considered
by the Parole Board. Since this was a murder involving the use of a firearm, it was the sort
of case whose seriousness the law says should normally be regarded as particularly high.
That is because carrying a loaded firearm is an exceptionally dangerous thing to do, and the
usual reason why someone has a loaded firearm with them is to kill or at least to cause really
serious injury. It cannot be said that the seriousness of your killing of Jones was anything
other than particularly high, and the law therefore requires me to take 30 years as my
starting point, increasing or decreasing that by any relevant aggravated or mitigating factors.
The prosecution cannot say definitively why the three of you decided to take Jones out, but
the fact that you were all drug—dealers suggests that this may have been a turf war of some
kind. Perhaps Jones resented the three of you muscling in on his patch. Perhaps he
damaged your operation in some way. Whatever it was, you decided that he had to be
dealt with in such a way as to show that the three of you were a force to be reckoned with.
The only reason for your panic after Jones was shot was that you had not been expecting an
eye—witness to be there. Thejury must have believed Hoitt's evidence, and the speed with
which Jones was shot— so soon after he had arrived at the flat — shows that this was an
execution, nothing more, nothing less.
1
--------
The fact that it was both planned and premeditated is an important aggravating factor, to
the extent that it has not already been factored into the starting point. I acknowledge, of
course, that the starting point of 30 years proceeds on the assumption that you intended to
kill Jones, rather than to cause him really serious injury, so the fact that you intended to kill
him, as lam sure you did, does not of itself amount to an additional aggravating factor.
What does mitigate what you did, though, was your age. You, Lewis, were only 20 at the
time ofJones’ murder, and you, Forbes, were only 19. You, Boateng, were 21, and my
impression of you is that you are the most mature of the three of you. But you all seemed
older than your actual age to me, and having had the chance to see each of you in the
witness box for quite a while, you all had, I believe, the levels of awareness, understanding
and insight which might be expected of people who were older than you. Your previous
convictions show the life of crime you were leading, and that together with the time you
spent in detention may well have made you older than your years. But you were still young
in terms of years at the time, and the idea of spending the next 30 years at least in prison
must fill you with horror. I shall reflect your relatively young ages in the minimum periods I
set.
Having said all that, I think that there is some basis for distinguishing between the three of
you in the roles you played in the plan to kill Jones. In one sense, you, Lewis, and you,
Boateng, were as much to blame for what happened as Forbes, as the three of you were in
on things together, but the disconnection from even the most basic standards of human
behaviour when you deliberately shoot someone in the head is profound, and as the man
who actually pulled the trigger, I must regard your culpability, Forbes, as higher than that of
Lewis and Boateng. It takes a man without the slightest humanity to do what you did.
I must also sentence the three of you for conspiring to supply heroin and crack cocaine.
You, Lewis, were the prime mover in these conspiracies, because it was you who acquired
the Jumbo drug line to establish the Jumbo network, and you recruited Boateng and then
Forbes to the operation. It was you who sourced the drugs from your supplier in Hounslow,
and it was through you that transport was made available for the drugs to be taken to
Southampton. You played the leading role in the operation, which went on for four weeks
and was making you very good money indeed. In addition, you were on licence at the time.
But you, Boateng and Forbes, were more than willing to become Lewis' sidekicks. The role
which the two of you played in this operation was at the very least a significant one. You
each had important functions within the operation, whether it was accompanying Lewis on
his trips to his supplier, or cutting the drugs up and bagging them into wraps, or supplying
them to users. You were not doing it to feed a habit. You were doing it to make money. If
the amount of drugs you say you took to Southampton on the night before Jones was shot is
anything to go by, perhaps a little more than halfa kilo of heroin and crack cocaine would
have been taken to Southampton in the four weeks during which your operation was up and
running. So although you were selling to users on the street, these were closer to category
2 offences rather than category 3 offences in terms of the harm they caused, to use the
classification adopted by the Sentencing Council in its Definitive Guideline on Drug Offences.
In addition, you, Boateng, and you, Forbes, were, like Lewis, on licence at the time. You,
Boateng, only pleaded guilty to the conspiracies on the first day of the trial, and the discount
to which you are entitled for your pleas of guilty is therefore minimal. Your solicitors, Lewis,
indicated your intention to plead guilty to the conspiracies on 4 October, and your solicitors,
Forbes, gave a similar indication early in December, some time after a date for the trial had
been set, but nevertheless before it began. The discount to which the two of you are
entitled for your pleas of guilty to counts 2 and 3 is more than that to which Boateng is
entitled, and again the relative youth of the three of you is something which I take into
account.

2
--------
Had I not been passing indeterminate sentences on each of you for the murder ofJones, I
would have passed determinate sentences on you for conspiring to supply heroin and crack
cocaine. You would have been required to serve only half those sentences, because that is
what the law requires. But since I have passed indeterminate sentences on each of you for
the murder ofJones, the appropriate course for me to take is to factor half the determinate
sentences which I would otherwise have passed on you for the conspiracies to supply heroin
and crack cocaine into the length of the minimum term, and then pass concurrent sentences
for the conspiracies to supply heroin and crack cocaine. I must, of course, ensure that the
minimum term which I set does not exceed what is appropriate for the totality of your
offending. Balancing all these factors, and subject to any credit for the time you have spent
on remand in custody, I have concluded that your release should not be considered by the
Parole Board until you, Lewis, have spent 29 years in custody, until you, Boateng, have spent
30 years in prison, and until you, Forbes, have spent 31 years in custody. You. Lewis, have
spent 309 days in custody on remand, but since your licence was revoked on 30 April and
you were recalled to detention then, you spent only 1 day in custody on remand for these
offences. You, Boateng, have spent 308 days in custody on remand, but since you received
a sentence of imprisonment on 17 December, you spent only 231 days in custody on remand
for these offences. And you, Forbes, have spent 305 days in custody on remand, but since
your licence was revoked on 1 May and you were recalled to detention then, none of the
time you have been in custody on remand has been attributable to these offences.
Accordingly, the minimum term which I set in your case, Lewis, is 28 years and 364 days.
The minimum term which I set in your case, Boateng, is 29 years and 134 days. And the
minimum term which I set in your case, Forbes, is 31 years. The sentences which I pass on
counts 2 and 3 of the indictment for the conspiracy to supply heroin and the conspiracy to
supply crack cocaine are 9 years' detention on each count in your case, Lewis, 8 years’
imprisonment on each count in your case, Boateng, and 7 years’ detention on each count in
your case, Forbes, those terms to be served concurrently with each other, and concurrently
with the sentences of imprisonment or custody for life which I have already passed. You
will all have to pay the appropriate victim surcharge which will be deducted for your
earnings in prison. The three of them may be taken away.
Ms Kenehan, would you go into the dock please. I don't propose to keep you in suspense.
You are going to prison for 3% years. If one was looking for stereotypes, you would be the
gangster’s moll. But that would be too facile a description of you. You are a woman of
many talents, hugely gifted with intellect, ambition and drive, with qualities of generosity
and kindness which have so impressed the many people who spoke so highly of you in the
course of the trial. You became infatuated with Lewis, and I am sure that Mr Lawrie was
right to describe you as having a blind spot when it came to him. It was your infatuation
with him which made you do things which Mr Bruce described as ”so spectacularly out of
character"", and made you risk throwing away everything when you were on the brink of
achieving your academic goals. The fact is that had you not met Lewis, you would not be
where you are now. Whether you will be able to pursue your career in the future is now
highly questionable. That is the real punishment for you, and although you must, of course,
go to prison, you would, I think, have been punished twice over if| did not significantly
reduce the sentences I would otherwise have passed to reflect your spectacular fall from
grace, and the indignity of being at the receiving end of the system which you studied and
taught with such conspicuous success.
Assessing the level of your role in these conspiracies is not easy. I reject the suggestion that
you were the ""brains” behind the operation, and for my part I have not bought the link
between what you and Lewis were discussing at the beginning of January and what went on
3
--------
in Southampton. There is the world of a difference between supplying cocaine to the
gentrified classes of Shoreditch and supplying heroin and crack to smackheads and
crackheads in Southampton. But what you and Lewis were discussing in January provides
an insight into what you might even then have been prepared to do for him, since I have no
doubt that that exchange of texts shows that you were going along with what he had in
mind, and you were not trying to put him off. You wanted to show your love for him, and
that was why later on you were prepared, albeit reluctantly, to provide him with the means
to go to Southampton with the regularity with which he did. By driving him down to
Southampton yourself, and allowing him to drive the cars you hired and your own car, you
were providing a measure of logistical support to the operation. I doubt that you knew the
details of the operation, because there is nothing to suggest that your role in it was anything
else, or that you had any influence on how the operation was carried on, but I think you
must have had some idea of its scale. Having said that, I have no doubt that Lewis exploited
to his own advantage how you felt about him, and I am prepared to accept that you
withdrew from the operation either on the day your car was impounded or when you heard
that Boateng had been arrested on suspicion ofsupplying class A drugs. The Sentencing
Council’s Guideline distinguishes between those whose role in an operation such as this was
a significant one and those whose role was a lesser one, and in the light of everything I
know, I assess your role to have been more of a lesser one than a significant one.
I must also sentence you for the offences of assisting an offender. You drove Lewis,
Boateng and Forbes back to London following Jones’ murder and put them up for the night
at your home. The jury’s verdict on count 4 means that you knew that they were wanted in
connection with the murder of someone in Southampton, and that you did what you did to
put the police off finding them. Thejury's verdict on count 5 means that you knew that
Lewis might be prosecuted for the murder of whoever had been killed in Southampton, and
that you poured white spirit into his trainers to destroy any forensic evidence which might
link Lewis to wherever in Southampton that had happened. In addition, you perverted the
course ofjustice by telling the authorities that you had been driving your car in
Southampton when you knew you had not been in order to conceal the fact that Lewis had
been in Southampton at the time, because you did not know at that stage what evidence the
police had which might link Lewis to Southampton on dates other than those which the
police might have known about.
These are serious offences — not least because the crimes which you knew the police wanted
the defendants in connection with included murder. But each of the things you did were
one—offs, and what you did had little effect, if any, on the investigation. Lewis, Boateng and
Forbes were still found by the police, and Lewis’ acceptance that he was in the flat when
Jones was shot meant that the prosecution of Lewis was not affected by your attempts
either to conceal that he had been in Southampton or to destroy any forensic evidence
linking him to the flat. And again, these were offences which were committed only because
of your infatuation with Lewis, and your wish that the two of you would not be parted. It is
important that the overall sentence which I pass does not exceed what is appropriate for the
totality of your offending, and balancing all these factors, I have concluded that the
appropriate sentences to pass on you are sentences totalling 3% years' imprisonment. On
counts 2 and 3, you will go to prison for 3 years on each count, to be served concurrently
with each other. On counts 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, you will go to prison for 6 months on each
count, to be served concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the sentences of 3
years' imprisonment on counts 2 and 3. You will serve half those sentences, but after your
release, you will remain on licence for the rest of your sentences, and if you commit another
offence during that time or break the conditions of your licence, you may be required to
serve the rest of your sentences. You too will have to pay the appropriate victim surcharge
4
--------
which will be deducted from your earnings in prison. All of this, of course, will have a
profound effect on your career, but I conclude by expressing the hope that you can one day
return to the field of criminology in which you have so much to contribute, with the
advantage of the new perspective you will have having seen the system in operation from
the inside. She may be taken away.
There are two other things Iwant to say. First, this was plainly a very thorough and
comprehensive investigation on the part of the police, and the police should be
congratulated on their successful attempts to bring the defendants to justice. I should like
my own acknowledgement of their efforts to be passed to the Chief Constable of the
Hampshire Constabulary.
Secondly, I want to say something to the family ofJahmel Jones. Whatever else can be said
of him, he did not deserve to die. I was greatly moved by the victim impact statement from
his mother, and I want his family to know that I have taken into account the terrible effect
that his death has had on their lives. |wish to express to them my own condolences for
their loss.

Mr Justice Lewis: 
  

INTRODUCTION 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

The  Claimant,  Mr  John  Lu,  is  a  consultant  cardiac  surgeon  employed  by  the 
Defendant,  the  Nottingham  University  Hospitals  NHS  Trust  (“the  Trust”)  at  a 
specialist unit for the treatment of heart disorders at the Trent Cardiac Centre (“the 
 
Centre”).  In  July  2009,  a  cluster  of  cases  of  infection,  known  as  prothestic  valve 
 
endocarditis  or  PVE,  was  identified.  The  source  of  the  infection  was  ultimately 
 
identified as being Mr Lu. A strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria had, unknowingly 
and without any negligence on Mr Lu’s part, embedded itself in Mr Lu’s skin. That 
bacteria  was  transferred  to  patients  undergoing  surgery  to  replace  a  heart  valve. 
Tragically,  11  patients  became  infected.  Five  died  and  others  required  further 
operations  or  medical  treatment.  Mr  Lu  ceased  practising  heart  valve  surgery 
 
immediately and, in October 2009, ceased all surgery. There have been investigations 
 
into  the  outbreak.  The  Trust  decided  in  August  2012  that  Mr  Lu  could  return  to 
surgical practice subject to certain conditions. Mr Lu has not yet been able to return to 
surgical practice.  

This claim concerns the arrangements relating to his return. It is agreed that, given Mr 
Lu’s absence from surgery for some time, there will need to be a programme devised 
to enable him to begin to resume surgical duties in collaboration with others prior to 
commencing independent practice. Mr Lu contends, in summary, that the Trust agreed 
a  suitable  programme  in  September  2012  which  would  enable  him  to  recommence 
 
surgical practice but subsequently resiled from that. He contends that the programme 
now proposed by the Trust is inappropriate in terms of its content, the lack of a clear 
timetable  and  the  fact  that  the  refamiliarisation  process  in  relation  to  one  type  of 
 
surgical  procedure  will  have  to  be  undertaken  at  a  different  hospital  not  within  the 
Centre.  He  contends  that  there  has  been  delay  on  the  part  of  the  Trust  in  making 
appropriate arrangements to facilitate his return to surgical practice. He also contends 
 
that the process devised by the Trust to obtain consent by patients to his involvement 
 
in, or performance of, surgery is not required by law and is unjustified. He contends 
that these, and other matters, are either breaches of express terms of his contract of 
 
employment or are breaches of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence. He 
has  affirmed  the  contract  and  wishes  to  return  to  practice.  He  seeks  declaratory  or 
injunctive relief aimed, in essence, at enabling him to resume surgical practice. The 
Trust denies that it has acted in breach of Mr Lu’s contract of employment. The Trust 
contends that the steps taken are appropriate steps, in what it describes as the unique 
 
and challenging circumstances of this outbreak, to enable Mr Lu to return safely to 
surgical  practice.    The  Trust  counterclaims  for  a  declaration  in  relation  to  the 
provision of certain information to patients. Both Mr Lu and the Trust are anxious to 
work together for the future to ensure that Mr Lu can return to surgical duties. They 
 
seek  by  this  litigation  to  resolve  certain  outstanding  issues  that  may  currently  be 
 
impeding progress in achieving that aim. 
  

 

 

By  way  of  background,  I  heard  evidence  from  Mr  Lu  himself,  Mr  Surendra  Naik, 
 
who is a consultant cardiac surgeon also employed by the Trust and Mr Brian Fabri

who was a consultant cardiac surgeon in Liverpool from 1986 until his retirement on 
31 December 2012. Mr Lu had been one of his trainees prior to being appointed a 
consultant cardiac surgeon himself. I also heard evidence from Dr Peter Homa who is 
 
the Chief Executive of the Trust, Dr Stephen Fowlie who is the Medical Director of 
 
the Trust and Mr David Richens who is a consultant cardiac surgeon and has been 
employed by the Trust since 1982.

This judgment firstly deals with the material facts. In many instances, facts are not in 
dispute or are evidenced by the contemporaneous record. In some instances, however, 
there are factual issues in dispute and I set out my conclusions on those factual issues. 
Secondly,  the  judgment  deals  briefly  with  the  law.  The  legal  principles  are  not  in 
dispute. It is their application to the facts that is in issue. Thirdly, this judgment then 
deals with the question of whether or not any of the alleged breaches of contract are 
 
established. 
 

THE FACTS 
 

The Centre and Its Work 
 

The  Centre  undertakes  most  types  of  adult  cardiac  surgery.  There  are  five  cardiac 
surgeons employed to work at the Centre. They include Mr David Richens, Mr Ian 
 
Mitchell,  Mr  Surendra  Naik  and  Mr  Lu.  Mr  Lu  qualified  as  a  doctor  in  1995.  He 
subsequently  specialised  in  cardiac  surgery.  He  was  one  of  the  trainees  on  a  seven 
year higher surgical training course at Liverpool which he undertook between 2000 
and 2007. He worked as a locum consultant in Liverpool for his final three months 
there.  He  took  up  the  post  of  consultant  cardiac  surgeon  at  the  Centre  in  October 
2007. 

The surgery undertaken at the Centre includes coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
and also heart valve replacement surgery. The bypass surgery occurs when an artery is 
blocked  or  damaged  or  restricted.  The  surgery,  broadly,  involves  one  of  two 
procedures. The procedure used by the majority of cardiac surgeons involves stopping 
the heart and using a cardiopulmonary bypass machine or “pump”. Blood is diverted 
to  the  pump,  oxygenated  in  the  pump  and  then  pumped  into  the  aorta  in  order  to 
circulate  around  the  body.  This  means  that  the  patient’s  heart  is  excluded  from  the 
process of circulating the blood whilst the patient is being operated upon. Sections of 
vein, taken from elsewhere in the body, are then grafted on to the artery to bypass the 
blockage. This is referred to as “on pump-surgery”. An alternative procedure used by 
a  smaller  group  of  cardiac  surgeons  is  known  as  “off-pump  surgery”.  In  this 
technique, the heart is not stopped and continues to circulate blood around the body. 
A section of artery (or, in some instances, venous material) is then grafted on to the 
artery to bypass the blockage. In the Centre, only Mr Naik and Mr Lu perform off-
pump surgery. In the case of heart valve surgery, valves controlling the flow of blood 
become diseased or malfunction and need to be replaced. A prosthetic valve is then 
inserted in place of the original valve. Antibiotics are used at the start of the process 
to prevent infection of the prosthetic valve. Again, a cardiopulmonary bypass machine 

 
5.	 

 
6.

MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

is used in heart valve surgery. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery may need to be 
combined with heart valve surgery (and approximately 50% of cardiac operations at 
the  Centre  involved  such  combined  surgery).  Such  combined  operations  are  done 
 
using the cardiopulmonary bypass machine and so involve on-pump surgery. There 
are  also  occasions  when  on-pump  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  surgery  (rather  than 
off-pump surgery) is clinically indicated for a particular patient or on-pump surgery 
may  become  required  during  an  operation  which  began  using  off-pump  surgery. 
Consequently, any cardiac surgeon performing off-pump surgery must also be able to 
perform on-pump surgery. 

The Outbreak 
 

 
7.	 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

Prosthetic valve endocarditis or PVE is an infection of the prosthetic or replacement 
heart valve. It is usually caused by a bacterial agent. The infection usually, but not 
 
always, occurs during the operation to replace a diseased  heart valve with a prosthetic 
valve. Between 2 November 2007 and 25 November 2008, Mr Lu had carried out 43 
heart valve replacement operations. There were no cases of PVE infection.  

In July 2009, however, a cluster of cases of PVE were identified in patients operated 
upon  by  Mr  Lu.  Mr  Lu  immediately  decided  to  cease  carrying  out  heart  valve 
replacement surgery. In October 2009, Mr Lu also agreed to cease carrying out other 
surgery.  Mr  Lu  remains  employed  by  the  Trust.  He  continues  to  receive  his  usual 
salary  and  other  entitlements.  He  undertakes  other  responsibilities.  He  does  not, 
however, carry out any surgical duties. 

The  outbreak  had  tragic  consequences.  In  total,  11  patients  operated  on  by  Mr  Lu 
between  December  2008  and  July  2009  were  infected  with  PVE.  Five  of  those 
 
patients  died  as  a  result  of  the  infection  (two  after  undergoing  further  surgery).  A 
further five underwent further surgery (involving seven operations in total). It was the 
 
worst recorded outbreak of PVE to have occurred anywhere in the world.

There were investigations carried out into the outbreak. Mr Lu co-operated fully with 
those  investigations  which  included  microbiological  testing  and  examination  of  his 
surgical procedures. Mr Lu is a consultant who is, clearly, dedicated to the care of his 
patients and to his profession. He wished to do all he could to identify the source of 
the outbreak. 

The Serious Untoward Incident Inquiry 

 

An investigation, known as a Serious Untoward Incident Inquiry, was carried out by a 
panel. The panel’s initial report (“the SUI report”) was completed in about May 2010. 
In summary, it found that the cases were caused by the same strain of bacteria, a strain 
of  Staphylococcus  epidermis,  which  had  been  resistant  to  the  antibiotics  given 
routinely  to  protect  against  infection  before  heart  valve  surgery  at  the  Centre.  The 
 
outbreak strain was on Mr Lu’s skin and had become embedded in the skin or, as it

was described had “colonised” Mr Lu. That was not known to Mr Lu. The SUI report 
found  that  the  cause  of  the  outbreak  was  the transmission  of  that  strain  of  bacteria 
from Mr Lu to patients. Among the conclusions were the following:  

“Despite extensive investigation, neither the mechanism nor the 
time  of  transmission  has  been  firmly  established.  There  is 
however compelling microbiological evidence that the infection 
 
was acquired in the operating theatre.” 

The SUI report considered that, whilst there was no compelling evidence to define the 
precise mode of transmission, the two most likely mechanisms were either dispersal 
of  the  organisms  from  the  surgeon’s  skin  to  elsewhere  during  surgery  or 
 
contamination  of  the  surgical  site  (that  is,  the  area  of  the  patient’s  body  where  the 
operation  was  being  carried  out)  after  micro-puncture  of  surgical  gloves  or  after 
changing surgical gloves. 

The SUI report concluded that Mr Lu’s technical abilities were not in doubt, that his 
statistics for outcomes prior to the outbreak were good and included the following, 
among other, conclusions in relation to Mr Lu (who is indentified in the extract only 
as Surgeon D): 

“18.6.1  Surgeon  D’s  technical  abilities  have  not  been  called 
into  doubt  his  outcome  statistics  prior  to  this  outbreak  were 
entirely satisfactory, and his cardiac revascularisation outcomes 
are good, with not infective complications. 

 

18.6.2  Surgeon  D’s  practice  differs  somewhat  from  his 
colleagues,  but  is,  if  anything,  more  consultant-delivered  and 
more  thorough,  almost  to  the  point  of  single-handed  practice, 
with limited input by junior staff. 

18.6.3  While  Surgeon  D’s  practice  differs  in  some  elements 
from  that  of  his  colleagues,  each  element  is  well  within  the 
range of acceptable and ‘standard’ UK cardiac surgery practice. 

18.6.4  The  Panel  neither  heard  nor  found  evidence  of 
shortcomings in Surgeon D’s infection, prevention and control 
techniques  and  practices.  Indeed  there  is  much  evidence  that 
these were robust. 

18.6.5 Surgeon D’s approach to clinical care is exemplary, but 
even if his reputation is unharmed, his confidence is damaged 
and  his  clinical  skills  are  unused  at  a  time  when  he  is  still 
gaining experience and confidence for more complicated cases. 

18.6.6  Surgeon  D  has  dissected  his  own  practice,  sought 
assurance  from  other  units,  co-operated  fully  with 
the 
 
investigation, and subjected himself to detailed microbiological

scrutiny,  occupational  health  assessment  and  attempts  at 
decolonisation. 

18.6.7  At  some  point  Surgeon  D  became  colonised  by  the 
antibiotic-resistant, outbreak Staphylococcus epidermidis. 

18.6.8 Surgeon D remains colonised with this organism, despite 
attempts to eradicate it from him. While such eradication may 
be achieved, he might be recolonisation with this organism (or 
other  flora).  For  this  reason  physical  and  microbiological 
barriers  to  the  transmission  of  infection  will  remain  the 
 
mainstay of measures to prevent this and similar infections in 
 
future.” 

 

 
14.	 

 
15.	 

The SUI report recommended that certain specific, practical infection prevention and 
 
control measures be adopted by all theatre staff in the Centre. These included the use 
 
of two sets of gloves (known as double gloving) or thicker gloves or both. That would 
minimise  the  possibility  of  perforation  of  the  gloves  leading  to  transmission  of 
infection  from  the  hand  of  one  of  the  surgical  team  to  the  patient.  The  SUI  report 
recommended that Mr Lu did not return to heart valve surgery until any identifiable 
risks of PVE were reduced to levels acceptable to patients, clinicians and the wider 
 
National  Health  Service  community.  The  SUI  report  considered  that  there  was  no 
 
evidence that Mr Lu’s cardiac revascularisation procedures (that is, the off-pump and 
on-pump  bypass  surgery)  carried  any  greater  risks  for  patients  than  any  other  UK 
 
cardiac surgeon, including the other cardiac surgeons at the Centre. The SUI report 
therefore recommended a phased return to this part of his practice.  

 

 

Dr  Fowlie  suggested  amendments  to  drafts  of  the  SUI  report.  Some  of  his 
recommended  changes  were  accepted,  some  were  not.  Mr  Lu,  in  his  evidence, 
indicated that he understood that Dr Fowlie had amended the report and that the SUI 
panel were not content with the report in its final form. Dr Fowlie gave evidence. He 
explained that he was the Medical Director at the Trust and given the gravity of the 
outbreak and the nature of the inquiry, he considered that it was appropriate for him to 
make suggestions and he had done so on other occasions. I found Dr Fowlie to be an 
honest  and  truthful  witness.  In  my  judgment,  his  actions  in  response  to  the  draft 
reports  were  appropriate.  Furthermore,  I  am  satisfied  from  the  contemporaneous 
evidence (see, for example, the e-mail of Mr White, chairman of the panel dated 12 
May 2010) and the evidence of Mr White to Professor Finch on 24 August 2011, that 
Dr Fowlie was only making suggestions and comments on the draft report. The panel 
determined whether or not to accept any proposed amendment. The SUI report was 
the report of the panel and the panel was satisfied that the SUI report reflected their 
views. 

The Period Following the SUI Report 

 
16.	 

Following the completion of the SUI report, internal meetings were held to discuss the 
report. Advice was taken from the National Clinical Assessment Service, known as
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 

NCAS. That is part of the National Health Service and advises on clinical matters. By 
letter dated 19 May 2010, NCAS indicated that the Trust should consider a gradual, 
heavily-supervised  return  to  surgery  starting  with  the  least  risk  surgery  first.  There 
was  correspondence  and  meetings  between  Mr  Lu  and  his  adviser  and  various 
employees of the Trust, including Dr Fowlie, as to the best way forward. There was a 
meeting  on  9  September  2010  between  Mr  Lu  and  Dr  Fowlie  to  discuss  the 
continuation  of  limitations  on  Mr  Lu’s  practice.  The  discussion  at  the  meeting  is 
summarised in a letter from Dr Fowlie to Mr Lu dated 9 September 2010. That letter 
noted that Mr Lu wished to return to clinical practice and the Trust’s view that, in 
 
order to maintain the confidence of patients and the public in Mr Lu, the Centre and 
the  NHS,  a  return  could  not  reasonably  take  place  until  after  the  conclusion  of  the 
coroner’s inquests into the deaths of the patients and the supplementary SUI report. 
 
The letter noted that the Trust’s view at the time was that a return to coronary artery 
 
bypass surgery was feasible but that a return to heart valve surgery was not given the 
continuing  uncertainty  about  the  method  of  transmission  from  Mr  Lu’s  skin  to  the 
 
patients’ heart valves. Similar exchanges occurred at a meeting between Mr Lu and 
 
Dr Fowlie in late October 2010 and in a letter dated 4 November 2010. 

 

17.	  Mr  Lu  continued  to  undergo  microbiological  testing  to  determine  whether  he 
 
remained contaminated or “colonised” with the outbreak strain of bacteria. On 5 July 
2010, it was confirmed that the outbreak strain of the bacteria had been completely 
eradicated. On 18 October 2010, it was confirmed that Mr Lu had not tested positive 
for the outbreak strain of the bacteria since April 2010.   

In  October  2010,  the  supplementary  SUI  report  was  completed  dealing  with  an 
investigation into whether or not the outbreak of PVE had been detected at the earliest 
 
opportunity or whether there had been delay. On 30 November and 1 December 2010, 
 
a  coroner’s  inquest  was  held.  The  coroner  concluded  that  micro-perforation  of  the 
gloves  used  during  surgery  was  unlikely  to  be  the  route  of  transmission  of  the 
 
infection from surgeon to patient. The coroner did not have available expert reports 
and views that become available later including a report dated 24 March from Mr J.A. 
Hutter  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  surgical  practices  used  by  Mr  Lu  which 
considered the evidence on micro-perforations in gloves. 

A  further  meeting  was  held  on  26  January  2011  between  Mr  Lu,  his  advisers,  Dr 
 
Fowlie and Mr Mortimer, the Director of Human Resources at the Trust to discuss the 
restrictions on Mr Lu’s surgical practice. The meeting discussed a number of possible 
options in an attempt to determine whether it was possible to agree a way forward, the 
 
alternative being the instigation of the process for assessing capability for ill-health 
under  the  Trust’s  Disciplinary  Procedure:  Medical  and  Dental  Employees  (“the 
Procedure”). It was agreed that Dr Fowlie would contact NCAS and brief the Chief 
Executive.  He did. NCAS advised that the Trust may wish to consider an independent 
report into the risks of Mr Lu returning to his previous practice.  

 

The  process  of  identifying  an  independent  investigator  was  put  in  train.  On  25 
February 2011 (the letter is wrongly dated 2010), Mr Mortimer wrote to Dr Lu. He 
explained that the Trust were proposing appointing an independent case investigator.

There was also a proposal that Dr Fowlie cease to act as the case manager under the 
Trust’s Maintaining High Professional Standards policy and that Mr Mortimer act in 
 
that  capacity.  Mr  Lu’s  representative  replied  on  14  March  2011  agreeing  to  the 
obtaining of independent expert advice. For reasons that Mr Lu was not familiar with, 
 
the legal representative objected to Mr Mortimer taking on the role of case manager 
 
and, in fact, Dr Ryder was appointed to that role. The letter of 14 March 2011 also 
requested that Mr Lu be allowed to re-integrate to non-valve surgery. The substantive 
reply  came  by  letter  dated  21  April  2011,  indicating  that  the  assessment  of  risk  in 
relation  to  valve  surgery  should  also  be  applied  to  coronary  artery  bypass  graft 
surgery. 

The Finch Report 

 
21.	 

Professor  Roger  Finch  was  appointed  as  an  independent  expert.  He  was,  until 
retirement,  a  professor  of  infectious  diseases  at  the  University  of  Nottingham. 
 
Professor Finch began his investigation in about mid-May 2011. He had hoped to be 
able to deal with the inquiry fairly speedily over the summer period. He interviewed a 
 
number of individuals including Mr Lu. He also received evidence from other experts 
in the field of microbiology. These included reports that he requested be prepared and 
a report by Professor Eykyn which had been commissioned on Mr Lu’s behalf.  

 
22.	 

Professor  Finch  reported  on  29  November  2011.  The  terms  of  reference  were  as 
follows: 

“Consider  whether  Mr  Lu  can  continue  to  practise  invasive 
cardiac surgery without risk to patients. The investigation will 
involve  the  participation  of  the  Trust’s  Occupational  Health 
Service and an independent microbiological report to determine 
the  level  of  that  risk  and  the  Trust  will,  with  advice  from 
National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS), then determine 
whether  that  risk  is  acceptable  and  decide  upon  the  position 
going forward.” 

 
23.	 

Section 8 of the report proceeds by identifying a series of critical questions, providing 
 
answers  and  further  comments.  The  report  noted  that  bacteria,  Staphylococcus 
epidermidis,  was  present  in  the  Centre  prior  to  the  appointment  of  Mr  Lu  and  17 
individuals were found to be carrying antibiotic resistant strains but none, other than 
 
Mr Lu, was found to be carrying the exact outbreak strain. The report noted that: 

“John Lu acquired the outbreak strain between his appointment 
in October 2007 and recognition of the first cases of prosthetic 
valve endocarditis (PVE) in July 2009.  The organism had been 
present in the Trust, notably the TCC and CICU for some time 
 
before  his  appointment.  Strains  similar  to  the  outbreak  strain 
have  also  been  isolated  from  patients  since  the  outbreak  was 
recognised.

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
In  conclusion  the  evidence  suggests  that  John  Lu  became 
colonised  with  the  outbreak  strain  following  his  appointment. 
At the time of the outbreak there was clearly something unique 
about the biology of the organism, John Lu and his insertion of 
prosthetic heart valve material that conspired to cause infection 
in  so  many  patients.  The  exact  nature  of  this  biological 
interaction  between  John  Lu  and  the  host  valve  material 
remains uncertain.” 

 
24.	 

The report considered the evidence in relation to the mechanism of transmission to 
 
patients undergoing heart valve surgery. It commented that: 

“Despite  the  exemplary  thoroughness  of  the  investigation  the 
exact mechanism whereby the outbreak strain contaminated the 
inserted  cardiac  valve  remains  uncertain.  However,  the  most 
likely  route  of  transmission  would  be  from  John  Lu’s  hands, 
which were shown to be colonised with the outbreak strain, to 
the operative site as a result of unrecognised perforation of the 
thinner (Biogel ® Super-Sensitive TM) gloves occurring during 
an operation which takes some 3-4 hours.” 

 
25.	 

The report also considered the possibility of Mr Lu retraining in another speciality. In 
that context, the report referred to the fact whatever Mr Lu’s decision on retraining, 
there  would  be  an  ever  present  requirement  for  him  to  explain  his  historical 
association  with  the  outbreak  to  patients  under  his  care.    The  report  made  15 
 
recommendations, the first three of which were: 

 

“1.  John  Lu  should  return  to  full  operative  practice  including 
prosthetic valve surgery. This should be managed as a staged 
 
process  that  will  need  to  be  planned  and  supervised  by  the 
cardiac  surgical  team  and  a  mutually  agreed  mentor  to  allow 
John Lu to retrain and re-skill after a significant absence from 
operative practice. This process should be agreed and supported 
by  Trust  management  and  NCAS  and  proceed  in  accordance 
with  recommended  practice  and  with  all  necessary  support. 
 
Allied  to  this  will  be  the  need  to  develop  an  appropriate 
communications and publicity management strategy to support 
this return to work. 

2.  This  return  of  John  Lu  to  surgical  practice  should  initially 
exclude  prosthetic  valve  surgery  in  order  to  monitor  skin 
samples at monthly intervals to check for the possibility of his 
 
acquisition  of  the  outbreak  strain,  recognising  that  this 
 
organism  continues  to  circulate  within  the  Trust.  It  is 
recommended that this period of monitoring be for 6 months. 
This monthly screening might most conveniently be completed 
during the period of retraining and before he commences valve 
surgery. He should then be screened at 3 monthly intervals for a 
further  18  months.  It  is  recognised  that  screening  John  Lu  at
--------

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
such  intervals  will  provide  only  partial  reassurance  hence  the 
importance that all practical and effective barrier precautions be 
adopted,  in  conjunction  with  other  sound  surgical  practices 
within the theatre suite in order to provide optimal safeguards 
against post-operative infection. 

3.  The  barrier  precautions  recommended  by  the  SUI  Report 
should  be  implemented  and  adopted  by  John  Lu  as  far  as  is 
practical. In particular this applies to the use of thicker gloves, 
 
double  gloving  and  down  gloving  during  glove  changing 
procedures.” 

 
26.	 

 
27.	 

 
28.	 

The report recommended that in the unlikely event that Mr Lu was linked to a further 
 
outbreak of PVE, which was said to involve two or more cases, then he should cease 
valve surgery. The report considered that, in that situation, continued conduct of heart 
 
valve surgery of any sort would be an unacceptable risk to patients and the Trust. 

 

On 30 January 2012, Professor Finch provided further responses to three points that 
had been raised. In brief, he indicated that, on the balance of probabilities, the chance 
 
of Mr Lu becoming recolonised by the outbreak strain of bacteria was low. In relation 
 
to obtaining consent of patients to particular operation, he indicated that patients be 
informed of general risks of the operation and risks specific to that patient and that 
 
operation. He also recommended that Mr Lu should address his historical association 
with the outbreak strain in 2009 and 2010 and indicated how that might be done. He 
 
also addressed the communications and publicity strategy that he recommended the 
 
Trust to adopt. 

There  was  a  meeting  between  Dr  Ryder  (who  was  now  the  case  manager),  Mr 
Mortimer,  and  Mr  Lu  and  his  advisers  on  8  February  2012.  The  discussion  at  the 
meeting is summarised in the letter of 15 February 2012 from Dr Ryder. The letter 
records agreement that any programme for a return to practice would be most likely to 
 
require an initial period of support at a different unit, not the Centre, whilst having 
regard  to  Mr  Lu’s  personal  and  family  commitments,  followed  by  a  period  of 
transition to the Centre. Subsequently, the Trust contacted Mr Cooper, the secretary of 
the  Society  of  Cardio-Thoracic  Medicine  regarding  potential  arrangements  for  the 
programme.  The  question  of  the  appropriate  approach  to  obtaining  the  consent  of 
patients was also discussed at the meeting and Dr Ryder indicated that advice would 
be sought on this matter. In fact, counsel was instructed in relation to the question of 
patient consent on 24 February 2012. The meeting also noted the view of Dr Homa, 
the Trust’s Chief Executive, and Dr Ryder that they doubted that it would be possible 
for Mr Lu to carry out heart valve surgery as the risk of PVE could not be quantified. 
Mr Lu took the view that the most likely transmission route was micro-perforation of 
gloves and he would now double glove and that other preventative measures had been 
taken. 

 

 

 

29.	  Mr Lu’s advisers replied by letter dated 23 February 2012 setting out Mr Lu’s views. 
The  letter  made  a  number  of  points,  including,  in  particular  that  Mr  Lu  wished  to
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

return to full duties, including heart valve surgery, after an appropriate programme. 
Mr  Lu  now  took  the  position  that  he  did  not  wish  to  commence  re-training  in  a 
 
different establishment. He referred to the fact that off-pump coronary artery bypass 
 
surgery was not widely practised in the United Kingdom but was performed by Mr 
Naik at the Centre. Mr Naik had agreed to act as a mentor and supervisor. Dr Ryder 
replied on 5 March 2012, noting his disappointment that Mr Lu had altered his view 
 
that commencement of the retraining would take place at another unit. 

The Quality Assurance Sub-Committee and the Trust 

 
30.	 

 
31.	 

The  Trust  then  considered  its  response  to  the  report  of  Professor  Finch.  The  Trust 
Board met on 1 March 2012 and agreed that a particular sub-committee the Quality 
Assurance  Committee,  would  consider  the  matter.  For  convenience,  I  refer  to  that 
sub-committee as QuAC. A meeting of QuAC was held to discuss the position of Mr 
Lu. They had a number of documents before them including the SUI report, the Finch 
report, the report from Professor Eykyn commissioned by Mr Lu and a commentary 
written by Dr Fowlie on behalf of Dr Homa. That commentary set out the view that 
 
Dr Fowlie had previously expressed, namely that a return to heart valve surgery was 
 
not feasible as the risk posed by Mr Lu was too great. Dr Fowlie considered that the 
level of risk that Professor Finch was prepared to accept was greater than that which 
 
 
would be considerable acceptable by most professionals, patients and the public. 

Complaint has been made that Dr Ryder had given an undertaking in his letter of 15 
 
February 2012 that Dr Fowlie, Dr Homa and Mr Mortimer (who were members of 
QuAC)  would  not  take  any  part  in  the  discussion  at  QuAC  and  the  written 
commentary breached that undertaking. In fact, the three individuals did not attend the 
meetings of QuAC and did not participate in the discussions at QuAC. Dr Homa gave 
evidence, which I accept, that he was asked by the chair of QuAC to submit views and 
he asked Dr Fowlie to prepare the commentary. In my judgment, it is understandable 
that the QuAC would wish to know the position of the Trust’s Chief Executive. The 
 
submission of a written document does not, in my judgment, amount to a participation 
in the discussions and does not breach the undertaking given. Even if did, it is quite 
clear  that  the  QuAC  considered  the  matter  independently  and,  as  will  ultimately 
 
appear, did not accept the view expressed in the commentary written by Dr Fowlie on 
 
behalf of Dr Homa. Further, the ultimate-decision maker was the Trust Board itself 
(on which Dr Homa and Dr Fowlie did sit and where there was no undertaking not to 
participate and where the Board again did not accept the views of Dr Fowlie). I do not 
consider therefore that there was a breach of the undertaking, or if there was, that it 
was material to the consideration of the matter. In my judgment, the submission of the 
commentary did not amount to a breach of the undertaking or a breach of any express 
 
or implied term in Mr Lu’s contract of employment. 

 
32.	 

 
The note of the discussion at the QuAC includes the following comments: 

“3.1 Of particular concern to the committee, articulated first by 
Mrs Tabreham, was that none of the reports supplied had given 
a definitive answer on the risk of Mr Lu infecting patients if he
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

returned  to  prosthetic  valve  surgery.  It  was  unclear  to 
committee  members  whether  a  definitive  answer  could  be 
given,  but  it  was  felt  that  the  experts  should  be  pushed  to 
quantify 
the  risks  as  patient  safety  was  of  paramount 
importance. 

3.2  The  committee  acknowledged  the  uniqueness  of  the 
situation that had arisen and the enormity of the decision it was 
being  asked  to  make,  both  in  relation  to  Mr  Lu’s  career  as  a 
cardiac surgeon and for the safety of patients to which the Trust 
owed  a  duty  of  care.  The  Committee,  through  the  Chairman, 
expressed enormous sympathy for Mr Lu and the very difficult 
situation being faced by a highly skilled surgeon that was not of 
his making. 

3.3 None of the investigations to date had been able to give a 
concrete  answer  as  to  how  the  outbreak  occurred  and  what 
mitigating  actions  would  ensure  no  recurrence  in  the  future. 
 
This made it doubly important to have some quantifiable risks 
to guide the committee’s decision making.” 

 
33.	 

Against that background, the QuAC decided that it wished to procure more detailed 
information on a number of specific topics. It noted its wish to work with the Medical 
and Dental Defence Union of Scotland who were advising Mr Lu. The notes of the 
 
meeting concluded as follows that: 

“The committee was anxious not to introduce further delay in 
 
reaching its decision, but unanimously felt that in order to reach 
the correct decision for the safety of the patients in the care of 
 
NUH, it should seek to have its specific concerns addressed.” 

The  QuAC  received  further  information.  This  included  further  responses  from 
 
Professor Finch in relation to the points raised by the chairman of QuAc on 17 April 
2012. Dr Ryder had also contacted Mr Lu’s advisers to ask if Professor Eykyn, the 
expert commissioned by Mr Lu to prepare a report for Professor Finch’s investigation, 
could assist with the matters raised. A response was made to QuAC by advisers on 
behalf of Mr Lu in relation to the topics referred to in the note of the discussion of the 
 
 
QuAC meeting after they had consulted Professor Eykyn. 

The  QuAc  met  on  7  July  2012.  There  were  four  members,  Dr  Barrett  (the  then 
chairman of the Trust), a non-executive director, the deputy chief executive of nursing 
and midwifery, and the director of finance. There were others in attendance, including 
a  representative  of  Mr  Lu,  Professor  Eykyn,  Professor  Finch,  and  Dr  Boswell,  the 
Trust’s consultant microbiologist. The minutes identify the key issue as “whether the 
Trust  could  support  the  return  of  Mr  Lu  to  prosthetic  cardiac  valve  surgery,  after 
considering the principal risk to patient safety of him doing so”. The minutes record 
 
the information that was before the QuAc. The QuAC heard from a number of those 
attending, including Professor Eykyn, Dr Boswell and Professor Finch. There was an 

 
34.	 

 
35.
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

extensive discussion on the possibility of Mr Lu being recolonised by the outbreak 
strain,  the  mode  of  transmission  of  the  bacteria  from  Mr  Lu  to  patients  and  the 
 
 
safeguards that would be needed. The QuAC’s view was: 

“The evidence received by the committee from the three expert 
microbiologists  suggests  that  the  risk  to  patients  of  Mr  Lu 
returning  to  cardiac  surgery,  including  valve  surgery,  is 
minimal, provided he agrees to adhere to all practical measures 
 
recommended  by  the  expert  microbiologists,  including  the 
testing regime to ensure he remains free of the outbreak strain 
 
of Staphylococcus Epidermidis. 
 

The  risk  to  patients  with  the  control  measures  in  place  is 
estimated to be the same as for all the other cardiac surgeons in 
the TCC. 

The Committee members unanimously agree that based on the 
expert evidence received, there was no clinical reason why Mr 
Lu  should  not  be  allowed  a  phased  return  to  cardiac  surgery, 
subject to all practical recommendations being implemented. 

Before returning to work, the committee would require Mr Lu 
to  be  rescreened,  in  order  to  ensure  that  he  currently  remains 
free  of  the  outbreak  strain  of  Staphylococcus  Epidermidis. 
 
Also, as recommended in Professor Finch’s report (para 9.2.2), 
following  return  to  non-valve  surgery,  Mr  Lu’s  skin  samples 
 
should  be  monitored  at  monthly  intervals  to  check  for  the 
possibility  of  his  acquisition  of  the  outbreak  strain  and  this 
should continue for a period of six months. 

After returning to work, the committee would require a report 
at  the  end  of  six  months,  and  three  monthly  thereafter  for  a 
period  of  18  months,  of  Mr  Lu’s  colonisation  status  (the 
screening  intervals  recommended  by  Professor  Finch).  In  the 
remote  possibility  that  Mr  Lu  becomes  recolonised  by  the 
 
outbreak strain, the committee would be urgently reconvened to 
agree an appropriate course of action to ensure patient safety.” 
 

The matter was then considered by the Trust Board on 30 August 2012. Present on 
that occasion were the four members of QuAc, Dr Fowlie, Dr Homa, and 3 other non-
executive directors. There was a lengthy discussion. The Board were informed that 
good progress had been made regarding a training programme. Dr Homa stated that 
he had been persuaded by the expert evidence and that Mr Lu should be allowed to 
return to duties in due course and it would be important to give careful thought to all 
aspects of the transition plan. Dr Fowlie made clear that he took a different view from 
the experts. He considered that the mode of transmission had not been established and 
he considered that it was not possible to say that Mr Lu posed no greater risk than his 
 
colleagues. Following discussion, the Trust Board decided that it was not necessary to 
 
take a formal vote but noted Dr Fowlie’s dissent. The minutes record that,

“The Board then formally resolved that Mr Lu should be allowed to undertake a 
transitional return to full-duties, subject to his agreement to, and compliance with, 
 
the prerequisites and on-going requirements advocated by Professor Finch.” 

 
37.	 

In my judgment, it is clear that the Trust Board determined that Mr Lu should be able 
to return to full surgical duties in due course. Given the background, in that Mr Lu 
had been away from all surgery for almost 3 years, the references in the minutes to the 
 
retraining  programme  and  a  need  for  a  transition  plan,  and  the  reference  to  “a 
 
transitional return to full duties”, the Board, in my judgment, contemplated that there 
would be a programme to enable Mr Lu to return gradually and safely to full surgical 
duties  by  enabling  him  to  re-familiarise  himself  with  the  necessary  skills,  and  to 
demonstrate that he had done so.  The minutes, read as a whole, indicate that the Trust 
Board had accepted the view that Mr Lu did not present a greater risk than any other 
 
colleague provided that the recommendations of Professor Finch were implemented. 

 

 
38.	 

That reading of the Trust Board’s decision and minutes is confirmed by the letter sent 
by Dr Ryder to Mr Lu on 3 September 2012. The material parts of the letter read as 
 
follows: 

“I write to confirm that the Trust Board received at its meeting 
on  30th  August  2012  the  view  of  the  special  committee 
convened  in  March  to  consider  the  clinical  risk  of  your 
 
returning  to  valve  surgery.  You  are  aware  of  the  rigorous 
process  the  committee  followed:  four  meetings  were  held, 
advice  and  assistance  was  received  from  counsel,  all  relevant 
 
reports  were  reviewed  and  the  committee  met  directly  with 
Professor R Finch, Professor S Eykyn and Dr T Boswell. 

The  Board  received  and  accepted  the  view  reached  by  the 
committee that the evidence they received from the three expert 
microbiologists  suggests  that  the  risk  to  patients  of  your 
returning  to  Cardiac  Surgery,  including  valve  surgery,  is 
minimal,  provided  you  adhere  to  all  practical  measures 
recommended  by  the  expert  microbiologists,  including  the 
testing regime to ensure you remain free of the outbreak strain 
of  Staphylococcus  Epidermis.  The  risk  to  patients,  the  Board 
heard, with the control measures in place, is estimated to be the 
same for you as for all the other cardiac surgeons in the TCC. 
Based, therefore, on the expert evidence received, there was no 
clinical reason why you should not be allowed a phased return 
 
to  cardiac  surgery,  subject  to  all  practical  recommendations 
being implemented. 

To  be  clear  therefore  the  Board  accepted  that  you  should  be 
 
able  to  return  to  the  full  range  of  cardiac  surgical  practice, 
subject  to  the  recommendations set  out  by  Professor  Finch  in 
his original report – certain of these were stressed by the Board 
in its conclusion. I recognise that this is an outcome which you 
 
have  sought  for  some  time  but  it  is  one  which  should,  for  a

short time, be treated as confidential by both the Trust and you. 
The Board stressed that the planning of your return to practice 
must proceed with proper care and attention, particularly with 
regards to the need to carefully communicate the circumstances 
and  way  forward  to  commissioners,  other  units,  fellow 
clinicians,  patients  and  the  public.  They  also  noted  the 
importance of the completion of the agreement of your return to 
work  programme  and  our  discussions  regarding  informed 
consent. 

It  is  important  therefore  that  we  work  together  with  you  to 
 
agree  the  way  forward  before  any  wider  announcements  are 
made by either you or the Trust. I am meeting your Consultant 
colleagues on Tuesday 4th September and I would ask that you 
allow them to be briefed via this forum: the same requirements 
 
requiring  discretion  and  confidentiality  will  be  placed  upon 
them. 

I  have  arranged  for  us  to  meet  on  Tuesday  4th  September  at 
3pm in the Trust HQ, City Hospital. Daniel Morimer, Director 
of  Workforce  will  be  present  as  will  Dr  K  Girling,  Clinical 
Director  –  DIRC.  Mr  R  Mohammed,  MDDUS  Advisor  has 
confirmed that he is able to phone in to join the discussion.” 

 
39.	 

Dr Homa had indicated at the Trust Board meeting on 30 August 2012 that officers 
would provide periodic updates to the QuAC. On 23 April 2013, QuAC established a 
committee, referred to as the task and finish committee, to determine when what it 
 
called the cardiac surgeon re-entry committee had completed its work. The documents 
envisage  there  would  be  arrangements  in  place  to  implement  the  Trust  Board 
decision. These minutes refer to these arrangements as the re-entry committee. The 
task  and  finish  committee  would  ensure  that  the  Trust  Board  decision  had  been 
implemented.  That  accords  with  the  evidence  given  by  Mr  Richens  as  to  how  the 
arrangements were envisaged to work. He was to be the assignment director and there 
 
would  be  a  re-entry  programme  in  place.  He  would  determine  if  the  re-entry 
programme  had  been  completed  satisfactorily.  That  would  be  confirmed  by  an 
 
external  reviewer.  The  task  and  finish  committee  (or  group  as  it  became  known) 
the  arrangements,  when  completed,  had  satisfactorily 
would  confirm 
implemented the Trust Board decision,

Mr Lu’s Proposed Re-entry Programme 

 
Solicitors  for  Mr  Lu  wrote  a  letter before  action  on  18  May  2012  stating,  amongst 
other  things,  that  Mr  Lu  did  not  voluntarily  agree  to  any  further  restriction  on  his 
practice other than as part of an agreed, staged and supervised return to full clinical 
practice which he wished to commence immediately. Solicitors for the Trust replied. 
Dr Ryder also replied on 8 June 2012, indicating that he would now wish to meet with 
 
Mr  Lu  in  his  role  as  case  manager  to  discuss  the  next  steps  in  relation  to  current 
working arrangements. The letter indicated that this meeting would build on earlier

discussions including the approach made by Mr Mortimer, to Mr Cooper, who was 
the secretary of Society of Cardio-Thoracic Surgeons. (Mr Mortimer had e-mailed Mr 
Cooper in February 2011 asking if he and Dr Ryder could discuss with Mr Cooper the 
matter of how the Trust might devise a structured programme of training and support 
to facilitate Mr Lu’s return.) There was further correspondence between solicitors for 
Mr Lu and the Trust dealing with this proposed meeting and with the QuAC meeting 
scheduled to take place in July 2012. The correspondence confirmed that the meeting 
with Dr Ryder would give Mr Lu and his representative a full opportunity to provide 
input into the proposed programme and that it was hoped that, wherever possible a 
 
jointly agreed programme would be decided upon. 

 
41.	 

In fact, on 27 July 2012, Mr Lu sent Mr Cooper a copy of certain documents for Mr 
Cooper’s  consideration.  These  documents  included  a  draft  programme  prepared  by 
Mr Lu. The proposals involved Mr Naik acting as a mentor in weekly activities. It 
envisaged that this would continue for one year. Other documents were also included. 
The Trust were not involved in the preparation of these proposals or documents. In 
August 2012, Mr Lu sent the proposals to Mr Livesey who was the chairman of the 
Carodio-Thoracic Special Advisory Committee. Mr Lu copied in Mr Mortimer (the 
 
director of human resources at the Trust). 

 

 

42.	  Mr Livesey e-mailed Mr Lu on 23 August 2012 stating that he thought the timescale 
Mr Lu proposed (one year) was reasonable and stating that he was delighted that Mr 
Lu  had  found  a  colleague  (Mr  Naik)  who  was  able  to  help  Mr  Lu  re-familiarise 
 
himself. Mr Livesey expressed the view that Mr Lu would have to be in a position to 
show evidence of progression through retraining and achievements of the standards 
commensurate  with  a  new  cardiac  constultant.  He  suggested  using  the  workplace 
based assessment on the Intercollegiate Curriculum Surgical Programme (“ICSP). Mr 
 
Livesey said that he thought those measures would be appropriate but, however “it is 
 
 
your employers who need to be satisfied that you are ready to return”. 

 
43.	 

On  22  August  2012,  Mr  Mortimer  e-mailed  NCAS  sending  them  correspondence 
from  Mr  Lu  and  noting  that  Mr  Lu  had  sought  the  advice  of  the  Society  and  an 
 
external mentor. Mr Mortimer said that the Trust: 

“would  be  grateful  for  any  comments  from  NCAS  on  the 
attached,  and 
the 
effectiveness of the proposals in supporting a return to practice. 

in  particular  any  advice 

regarding 

We  expect  a  decision  on  valve  surgery  by  the  end  of  the 
month.” 

On 22 August 2012, Dr Rothery replied indicating that she could not comment on the 
 
timetables and considered that it may be advisable, given the time away from clinical 
 
practice,  to  have  a  fuller  action  plan.  In  particular,  she  considered  that  it  would  be 
sensible  to  have  more  clearly  defined  objectives  and  a  description  of  the  evidence

which  would  be  accepted  as  demonstrating  those  objectives  had  been  reached.  She 
offered to send examples of return to work plans. Those examples were sent to Mr 
 
Mortimer on 30 August 2012 and forwarded to Mr Lu on 4 September 2012. 

On 30 August 2012, as indicated above, the Trust Board resolved that Mr Lu should 
be allowed to undertake a transitional return to full duties subject to agreement to and 
compliance  with  Professor  Finch’s  recommendations.  On  3  September  2012,  Dr 
Ryder wrote to Mr Lu to confirm that decision. 

 

On  4  September  2012,  there  was  a  meeting  between  Mr  Lu  and  Dr  Ryder.  Others 
were  present  or  joined  the  meeting  by  telephone.  A  follow-up  letter  was  sent 
 
indicating  that  there  had  been  discussion  on  four  areas  including  a  retraining 
programme.  Various  actions  were  agreed  for  the  coming  weeks,  including  Mr  Lu 
doing further work on the retaining proposals and sharing that with Mr Livesey and 
Mr  Naik  who  had  agreed  to  act  as  trainer/mentor.  A  further  meeting  was  to  be 
 
arranged for 24 September 2012. 

Also on 4 September 2012, there was a meeting later in the day attended by Dr Ryder, 
Mr Mortimer, Mr Lu, and some of Mr Lu’s consultant colleagues from the Centre, 
namely  Mr  Richens  and  Mr  Naik  and  one  other.  Mr  Richens  questioned  the 
robustness of the re-training programme and the appropriateness of Mr Naik being the 
 
supervisor and whether the retraining should be done outside the unit. 

 

48.	  Mr Lu continued work on his version of the proposals. He e-mailed Mr Livesey on 19 
September  2012,  and  Mr  Livesey  replied  on  20  September  2012  and  said  that  the 
 
proposals looked comprehensive to him, and addressed the areas that Mr Lu would 
need  to  demonstrate  competence  in  before  returning  to  full  practice  and  suggested 
 
“you forward it to the Trust (and NCAS) for final approval”. 

Also on 20 September 2012, Mr Naik sent Mr Mortimer a copy of a letter dated 20 
September 2012 to Mr Cooper. That indicated that Mr Naik was pleased to see that 
Mr  Cooper  had  agreed  to  be  the  external  reviewer.  Mr  Naik  noted  that  “the  re­
familiarisation  programme  has  been  guided  and  approved  by  Steve  Livesey  (SAC 
 
chairman) and forwarded to the Trust for approval”. 

On 26 September 2012, a further meeting took place between Dr Ryder and Mr Lu. 
Also  in  attendance  were  Mr  Mortimer,  Mr  Lu’s  representative  and  Dr  Girling,  the 
 
Clinical  Director.  The  discussion  at  that  meeting  was  summarised  in  a  letter  of  9 
November 2012 from Dr Ryder to Mr Lu. The letter said, in part, the following: 

“Our discussion focused on two particular areas relating to your 
return to work: consent of patients and your re-entry to surgical 
practice  programme  (‘re-familiarisation’).  These  factors  were 
 
discussed in the context of an acceptance by all parties referred 
to  in  this  letter  of  the  conclusion  were  reached  by  the  Trust 
Board regarding your return to surgical practice.

In  relation  to  the  area  of  consent,  we  agreed  that  the  Trust 
would  agree  an  instruction  to  Mr  Michael  Mylonas  QC,  with 
the  input  of  your  advisors  (Mr  Mitchell  provided  this  on  12th 
 
October). This would comment on the approach to consent that 
you  had  set  down,  following  discussions  with  colleagues 
including  Mr  Ian  Robertson,  Chair  of  the  Trust’s  Consent 
Committee. Mr Mylonas’ response would of course be shared 
with you. 

that 

We  discussed  the  response  of  your  colleagues  to  your 
programme  of  re-familiarisation.  I  noted 
they  had 
welcomed  the  resolution  of  matters,  particularly  for  you  and 
your family, at our meeting with them on 4th September. There 
was however a discussion which pointed out the need for the 
re-entry programme to withstand any future scrutiny. Concerns 
were raised by two of your colleagues that Mr Naik was not an 
accredited  trainer;  that  the  mentorship  arrangments  were  the 
same as the time of the outbreak: and that re-training elsewhere 
might be desirable. In relation to the last of these points I had 
explained to your colleagues (an am happy to confirm again to 
you) that the Trust accepted that it would not only be difficult 
for  you  to  work  elsewhere,  but  that  Professor  Finch’s 
recommendations required for you to be working in the Trent 
Cardiac  Centre.  We  also  noted  that  the  involvement  of  Mr  G 
 
Cooper  from  Sheffield  Teaching  Hospitals  FT  ensured  that 
there was a different mentorship arrangement than in 2009. 

Whilst  a  number  of  elements  of  the  concerns  raised  by  your 
colleagues  had  been  addressed  we  did  agree  that  it  was 
important  for  the  programme  to  command  their  confidence 
involvement and support. We agreed, therefore, that a meeting 
of  the  consultant  cardiac  surgeons  would  be  convened  to 
discuss  the  programme  and  to  seek  consensus  as  to  the  way 
 
forward. Mr Cooper would be invited to attend the meeting as 
would Dr Girling as Head of Service. Mr Mohammed and you 
supported  the  step  of  meeting  with  your  colleagues,  and  Mr 
Mohammed  reminded  us  that  the  MDDUS  would  vigorously 
challenge  any  steps  which  sought  to  prevent  your  return  to 
work. 

 

to  Mr  Cooper 
Subsequently,  Mr  Mortimer  has  written 
confirming the Trust’s approach to his indemnity (you received 
a copy of this letter).” 

 
51.	 

On 17 October 2012, Mr Mortimer wrote to Mr Cooper thanking him for agreeing to 
provide external review and support to the re-entry to practice programme for Mr Lu. 
The letter notes that the “commencement of this programme of re-entry has received 
approval from the Trust Board”. An indemnity was also provided to Mr Cooper.

On 19 November 2012, Mr Lu, Mr Naik and Mr Cooper met and produced what were 
described as notes of the meeting with the external reviewer. The meeting appeared to 
 
have discussed Mr Lu’s proposals. The note refers to Mr Naik as the Trust Mentor. 
 
The note referred to the next meeting to be held between month 2 and month 3 of the 
re-familiarisation programme. In fact, at that stage, Mr Lu had been told that Mr Naik 
would  not  be  acceptable  as  he  did  not  have  the  requisite  approvals  to  be  a  trainer. 
 
Furthermore,  the  Trust  had  not  approved  the  re-familiarisation  programme  at  that 
stage. It is not easy to understand the basis or the purpose of this meeting between Mr 
Lu, the colleague that he preferred to have oversight of the re-entry programme, and 
the external reviewer. 

 
53.	 

A further meeting took place on 19 December 2012 between Dr Ryder and Mr Lu. 
Also  in  attendance  was  Mr  Lu’s  representative  and  Dr  Girling.  The  meeting  is 
summarised in the letter from 2 January 2013 from Dr Ryder to Mr Lu. The meeting 
confirmed that Mr Lu had received a copy of the advice from leading counsel which 
had been provided on 29 November 2012 in relation to the information that would 
need  to  be  provided  to  patients  in  order  to  ensure  that  they  had  given  informed 
 
consent to any surgical procedure. The letter confirms that at the meeting the concern 
had been raised that Mr Naik was not an accredited trainer. The letter also said the 
following: 

“Having reviewed all the information available, it is clear that 
the recent history in relation to training for the Trent Cardiac 
 
Centre  has  been  difficult.  Indeed,  there  was  some  risk  that 
training accreditation could be withdrawn entirely three to four 
years  ago.  This  was  averted,  but  recognition  of  status  as  a 
trainer  was  withdrawn  from  all  consultants  apart  from  Mr 
Richens.  Other  consultants  have  had  this  position  reversed 
 
subsequently, but not Mr Naik. To be clear: Mr Naik may have 
attended  the  relevant  courses  but  he  is  not  recognised  by  the 
regional medical educational system as a trainer. 

My  primary  concern  remains  to  ensure  that  your  re-entry 
programme  is  resilient  both  now,  and  in  any  future  scenario 
where  it  might  be  reviewed.  There  are  several  factors  in 
 
supporting this resilience: 

 
	  The content of the programme: this appears of suitable 
breadth  and  depth,  and  confirmation  of  this  has  been 
given by your professional society and NCAS. 

 
	  The availability of external mentorship and review: Mr 
 
G  Cooper  of  Sheffield  Teaching  Hospitals  has  kindly 
 
committed to provide this input to you and the Trust. 

 
	  The assessment of your progress: I remain of the view 
 
that  this  must  be  done  by  an  individual  who  is 
 
recognised as a proficient and competent trainer. Such 
qualities  are  evidenced  not  merely  by  completion  of

study  but  by  sustained  practical  activity  over  many 
years and by recognition by external parties. 

Accordingly,  I  confirm  that  your  re-entry  programme  will 
commence  in  the  week  of  14th  January  2013.  You  will 
necessarily work alongside all your colleagues – including Mr 
Naik  –  during  this  programme.  Your  assessor  for  the  various 
components  of  the  programme  must,  I  am  clear,  be  therefore 
Mr David Richens, Consultant Cardiac Surgeon. I have asked 
 
Mr Richens to contact you to make the necessary arrangements 
to take this forward.” 

The September 2012 Proposed Re-Entry Programme 
 

There  are  a  number  of  factual  issues  that  arise  in  relation  to  Mr  Lu’s  proposed  re­
entry programme. The first is whether the Trust agreed or approved that programme. 
Mr Sutton, on behalf of Mr Lu, explained that it was not said that the September 2012 
re-familiarisation programme constituted a formal agreement in the sense of a binding 
collateral contract or contractual variation. However, he submitted that, as a matter of 
fact, the September 2012 programme had been approved by the Trust or did represent 
the  settled  understanding  of  both  Mr  Lu  and  the  Trust  and  that  that  fact  would  be 
relevant to the assessment of whether there had been a breach of the implied term of 
mutual  trust  and  confidence  or  the  express  term  of  co-operation  in  the  contract  of 
employment. Mr Sutton relied upon the fact that the programme had been prepared 
using templates supplied by NCAS, approved by Mr Livesey and Mr Cooper, that Mr 
Mortimer had been sent the documents and had agreed with Mr Cooper that he would 
be the external reviewer and Mr Mortimer had arranged an indemnity. The alternative 
submission  was  that,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  the  September  2012  proposed  re-entry 
programme  had  been  approved  at  the  meeting  of  19  December  2012  with  the  sole 
change  that  Mr  Richens,  not  Mr  Naik,  would  be  person  responsible  for  confirming 
that  Mr  Lu  had  demonstrated  that  the  requirements  in  the  programme  had  been 
achieved. 

The  practical  significance  to  Mr  Lu  of  establishing  these  facts  would  include  the 
following. First, if the September 2012 agreement had been agreed by the Trust, then 
Mr Naik would be the person responsible for supervising the re-entry and confirming 
that  the  arrangements  had  been  satisfactorily  completed  by  Mr  Lu.  Secondly,  the 
September 2012 (or that arrangement as allegedly modified in December 2012 by the 
substitution of Mr Richens for Mr Naik) would include the programme as set out in 
those  documents  (rather  than  the  more  detailed  draft  subsequently  prepared  by  the 
Trust) and would provide for a specified time for completion, i.e. it would take 12 
months. 

First,  I  find  as  a  fact,  that  the  September  2012  proposals  were  not  agreed  to  or 
approved by the Trust. They did not represent a common understanding between the 
parties as to the content, and personnel responsible for, the re-entry programme. They 
were proposals that Mr Lu wished to be adopted or agreed to by the Trust but they

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
were  not  in  fact  adopted  by  the  Trust.  I  reach  that  conclusion  for  the  following 
reasons.  No  person  from  the  Trust  approved  the  arrangements.  It  is  true  that  Mr 
Livesey indicated that he was content with them but he was not the person responsible 
for approving them on behalf or the Trust and he expressly indicated that the Trust 
would  have  to  approve  them.  Similarly,  Mr  Cooper  was  appointed  as  an  external 
reviewer. His role would be to provide external validation of the programme. He was 
not  able  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  Trust  in  approving  the  terms  of  the  re-entry 
programme. NCAS would offer advice and guidance, but they could not approve the 
programme on behalf of the Trust. The fact that they provided templates to serve as 
 
examples of possible versions of a re-entry programme did not amount to approval on 
behalf  of  the  Trust.  The  fact  that  Mr  Lu  copied  Mr  Mortimer  into  some  of  the 
 
correspondence,  that  Mr  Mortimer  made  arrangements  for  the  appointment  of  Mr 
 
Cooper as external reviewer and had dealings with NCAS did not confer authority on 
Mr Mortimer to approve the arrangements.  In relation to the last point, Mr Cooper 
was  be  the  external  reviewer.  That  did  not  mean  that  the  Trust  had  approved  the 
September 2012 arrangements. Indeed, in the letter of 18 October 2012, Mr Mortimer 
 
expressly says that the Trust Board had agreed to the commencement of Mr Lu’s re­
entry programme. That must be a reference to the decision of the Trust Board to allow 
re-entry  of  30  August  2012  not  the  re-entry  programme  proposed  by  Mr  Lu  in 
September 2012. 

Furthermore,  the  Trust  Board  decided  on  30  August  2012  to  support  Mr  Lu’s 
transition  into  full  time  duties.  Mr  Lu  was  sent  a  letter  on  3  September  2012 
 
confirming that that would happen. A meeting took place on the 4 September 2012 
indicating  that  further  work  would  need  to  be  undertaken  on  the  proposed  re-entry 
programme. A further meeting took place later that date at which colleagues of Mr Lu 
made it clear that the person responsible for confirming that the re-entry arrangements 
 
had been satisfactorily completed had to be an accredited trainer and Mr Naik could 
 
not fulfil that role as he was not an accredited trainer. It was, in my judgment,  clear to 
Mr Lu that the arrangements had not been approved as at 4 September 2012 and it 
was clear that there were difficulties over Mr Naik being the person responsible for 
confirming that the arrangements had been satisfactorily complied with. Further, that 
 
point was made clear again at the meeting on 26 September 2012. It was also made 
clear  that  the  re-entry  programme  needed  to  be  able  to  withstand  scrutiny  and 
command the confidence of colleagues. There was to be further meetings attended by 
Trust representatives and others, including Mr Cooper (as the external reviewer). All 
of  this  is,  in  my  judgment,  inconsistent  with  the  suggestion  that  the  proposals 
prepared  by  Mr  Lu  were  agreed  or  formed  the  basis  of  a  settled,  common 
 
understanding  between  Mr  Lu  and  the  Trust  as  to  the  basis  upon  which  he  would 
begin the transition to work.   

 

Secondly, in my judgment, the Trust did not agree those proposals in December 2012 
with  the  sole  modification  that  Mr  Richens  replaced  Mr  Naik.  Mr  Lu  relies  in 
 
particular on the phrase in the letter of 2 January 2012 that in relation to the content of 
this  programme  “this  appears  of  suitable  breadth  and  depth,    and  confirmation  has 
been given by your professional society and NCAS”. That, it is suggested on behalf of 
 
Mr Lu, means that the content of the programme had been agreed with the change of 
Mr Richens for Mr Naik. In my judgment, the letter must be read in context and as a 
whole.  The  letter  makes  it  clear  that  the  re-entry  programme  had  to  be  resilient.  It

made certain observations about the content of the programme, the external reviewer 
and the assessment of progress. It made it clear that Mr Richens would be the assessor 
and that Mr Richens would contact Mr Lu to make the necessary arrangements to take 
this forward. Read as a whole, and in context, the meeting of the 19 December 2012 
did not amount to an acceptance of the content of Mr Lu’s programme. Mr Richens 
would be the assessor. He would meet Mr Lu and make the necessary arrangements. 
 
That  may  necessarily  involve  clarification  or  changes  in  the  re-entry  programme. 
Whilst it appeared to Dr Ryder to be of suitable breadth and depth, no one could have 
contemplated that Mr Richens would have to work with the proposal as set out in Mr 
Lu’s  documents  if  he  was  not  content  with  it.  In  any  event,  for  reasons  that  will 
become apparent, the content of the programme (as refined by Mr Richens) contains 
 
requirements that Mr Lu accepted in evidence that he was content to work with and 
set out the competencies that Mr Lu would have to demonstrate that he possessed in 
 
order to return to full-time practice. 
  

 

In  my  judgment,  the  attitude  of  the  Trust  between  September  and  early  December 
2012 is best summarised in the evidence of Dr Fowlie and Dr Homa. As Dr Fowlie 
said  in  evidence,  he  now  appreciates,  that  is  with  the  benefit  of  hindsight,  that  the 
Trust should have been more assertive in describing to Mr Lu that the Trust would 
need to be the principal architect of the re-entry programme and that the programme 
would have to involve consideration of a number of interested persons both internal 
and external. Similarly, Dr Homa said that, with hindsight, he believed that the Trust 
did  not  necessarily  approach  the  issue  the  of  re-entry  programme  correctly  at  this 
 
initial stage. Mr Lu was asked to draft his re-entry programme (albeit with support 
from  Mr  Livesey).  As  the  Trust’s  management  team  considered  the  re-entry 
programme,  they  realised  that  they  could  not  delegate  these  tasks  to  Mr  Lu.  I  am 
satisfied that this evidence demonstrates the reality of what happened. In the initial 
period, Mr Lu did begin the process of preparing a re-entry programme. The Trust, 
however, did not approve or agree that re-entry programme and, in particular, came 
 
quickly to the view that Mr Naik could not be the person to assess whether or not Mr 
Lu had demonstrated that he possessed the relevant competencies. Furthermore, Mr 
Lu knew, or ought to have known that, the Trust had not accepted his draft proposals. 

The third factual issue concerns the reasons why the Trust were not prepared to accept 
a re-entry programme where Mr Naik was the assessor. Mr Sutton, on behalf of Mr 
 
Lu, submitted that the real reason for this change in approach was not ultimately to do 
 
with the fact Mr Naik was not an accredited trainer. Rather, he submits that the real 
reason  was  a  disagreement  on  the  part  of  some  of  those  who  were  involved  in 
implementing the Trust Board decision of 30 August 2012, with the view that Mr Lu 
 
presented  no  greater  risk  of  infection  to  patients  than  any  other  colleague  in  the 
Centre. Mr Sutton submitted that the reasons for the change in approach were that Dr 
Fowlie and Mr Richens in particular did not accept that the basis for the Trust Board 
 
decision was evidentially or logically sound and that they considered that Mr Lu did, 
or  may,  present  a  greater  risk  to  patients.  That  was  in  large  part,  it  was  submitted, 
because they did not accept that the mode of transmission of the bacteria from Mr Lu 
 
to  patients  had  been  firmly  established  and,  given  that  uncertainty,  they  did  not 
consider that the return of Mr Lu to surgical practice would be consistent with patient 
safety.

trainer.  I  reach 

that  conclusion  for 

In my judgment, it is clear from the contemporaneous evidence and the evidence of 
Dr  Fowlie,  Mr  Richens  and  Dr  Homa,  that  the  reasons  for  not  accepting  Mr  Lu’s 
 
proposals  that  Mr  Naik  be  his  assessor  was  the  fact  that  Mr  Naik  was  not  an 
accredited 
the  following  reasons.  The 
contemporaneous evidence demonstrates, in my judgment, that the background was 
 
that  all  those  involved  on  the  part  of  the  Trust  were  concerned  that  any  re-entry 
programme  was  robust  and  could  withstand  public  scrutiny.  All  those  persons 
considered  that  that  was  in  the  best  interests  of  Mr  Lu  and  the  Trust.  It  would 
 
contribute towards ensuring that if there were any questions about the resumption by 
Mr  Lu  of  surgical  duties,  the  Trust  would  be  able  to  show  that  Mr  Lu  had  
 
demonstrated that he possessed the relevant competencies to enable him to perform 
the duties of a cardiac surgeon. Having heard the evidence of Mr Richens, Dr Fowlie 
and Dr Homa, I consider that they were honest, reliable witnesses who were fairly and 
accurately explaining why they considered that a proposed re-entry programme with 
Mr Naik as the person acting as assessor and responsible for confirming that Mr Lu 
had satisfied the re-entry programme was not suitable. That reason was that they did 
 
not  consider  that  Mr  Naik  was  suitable  for  that  task  as  he  was  not  an  accredited 
 
trainer. Dr Homa confirmed that that was the unanimous view of Dr Ryder, Dr Fowlie 
and himself. Dr Fowlie confirmed that that was his view. Mr Richens confirmed that 
that was his view also. 

 
62.	 

Their evidence is also consistent with the contemporaneous correspondence and the 
context.  In terms of the contemporaneous evidence, Mr Richens wrote a letter on 6 
 
September 2012. The material part is as follows: 

“As  a  new  consultant  who  has  been  unable  to  operate  for 
around 3 years (twice as long as his experience as a practicing 
consultant surgeon) John will surely now require an exceptional 
retraining programme which is sensitive to his particular set of 
 
circumstances. This will be a very stressful time for him and he 
will  be  exposed  to  unprecedented  levels  of  scrutiny.  I  would 
 
hope  therefore  that  the  retraining  would  require,  at  the  very 
least, mentoring and training from an experienced, credible and 
accredited trainer(s). We do have a range of training experience 
amongst the consultant surgeons here, as in most units. At one 
end of this training spectrum is a surgeon who is not, and has 
never  been,  an  accredited  trainer  and  who  has  a  local  and 
national profile as a surgeon who does not train. In my opinion 
it would not therefore be appropriate to ask this individual to 
have a role in the retraining programme.” 

That letter, in my judgment, confirms that Mr Richens was concerned at the outset 
with ensuring that the re-entry programme be under the supervision of an experienced 
and  credible  trainer.    The  letter  continues  by  explaining  that,  whilst  Mr  Naik  is  a 
 
surgeon with a national and local profile, he has no experience of training. Mr Lu has 
focussed on other parts of the letter which he considers indicates that Mr Richens does 
not accept the validity of the technique of off-pump surgery and Mr Lu believes that 
in some way Mr Richens wishes to reconstruct Mr Lu’s surgical techniques. In my 
judgment, read as a whole, the letter is not intended to convey that message. The letter 

 
63.
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

is  primarily  concerned  with  indicating  that  any  re-entry  programme  should  be 
conducted  by  an  experienced  and  accredited  trainer  and  that  when  Mr  Lu 
 
recommences  surgical  duties,  he  should  begin  with  the  less  complex  surgery  rather 
 
 
than the more complex off-pump surgery. That last point, incidentally, was also the 
 
view of NCAS earlier in the process.  Mr Richens e-mailed Mr Lu on 27 September 
2012 indicating his view that a return to work plan with Mr Naik named as mentor, 
supervisor  or  with  responsibilities  for  monitoring  and  signing  off  would  not  be 
 
credible because Mr Naik had no experience of this in 20 years as a consultant and Mr 
Richens  considered  that  Mr  Lu  would  need  a  person  with  recognised  and  highly 
developed  skills  as  a  trainer.  The  letter  from  Dr  Ryder  dated  9  November  2012 
(summarising  the  meeting  of  26  September  2012)  also  referred  to  the  concerns  of 
colleagues that “Mr Naik was not an accredited trainer”. 

In terms of the context, the importance of having an accredited trainer appears also 
from the evidence of Mr Fabri. He had been a programme director previously. He had 
trained Mr Lu in Liverpool. He had agreed to become Mr Lu’s external mentor. He 
gave evidence on behalf of Mr Lu. He gave evidence that an accredited trainer would 
have  to  fulfil  certain  criteria  and  complete  certain  courses  and  demonstrate 
satisfactory results in those courses. Then the person could gain approval as a person 
suitable, and qualified, in determining whether others had demonstrated the necessary 
 
competencies to act as a surgeon. 

The Trust had had difficulties in relation to training in 2009 when cardiac training in 
the  Trust  was  considered  to  be  inadequate  in  terms  of  trainee  surgical  activity  and 
levels of educational supervision in the Centre. There had been concerns that approval 
for training would be withdrawn. Eventually, it appears, that Mr Richens was left in 
place  as  the  only  accredited  trainer  at  the  Centre.  It  is,  in  my  judgment,  inherently 
likely that the motivation of those involved was concern over allowing Mr Naik to 
have  responsibility  for  this  task  rather  than  having  the  task  carried  out  by  an 
 
accredited  trainer  given  the  difficulties  the  Trust  had  already  experienced  over 
training, and given the circumstances of Mr Lu’s case, where the Trust would want to 
be  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  re-entry  programme  was  overseen  by  a  suitably 
qualified person. 

Finally, all those who gave evidence testified to the skills of Mr Naik as a surgeon. He 
 
is highly regarded by his colleagues. His work involves highly complex surgery. All 
those who gave evidence on behalf of the Trust were at pains to emphasise that they 
 
regarded  Mr  Naik  very  highly  as  a  cardiac  surgeon  and  a  colleague.  However,  Mr 
Naik has not indicated any interest in training. He has not obtained any of the relevant 
 
approvals or accreditation from relevant professional bodies. Mr Naik confirmed in 
 
his evidence that he believed that he has trained only three, or possibly fewer, students 
since 1995. That is confirmed by the figures produced by the Trust. Furthermore, Mr 
Naik confirmed that he has not applied to any relevant body for accreditation. 

For all those reasons, in my judgment, the decision not to accept Mr Lu’s proposal 
that  Mr  Naik  would  be  the  assessor  was,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  based  on  the  view  of 
those involved that Mr Naik was not an accredited or approved trainer and so was not

suitable for that role. I recognise that Mr Livesey had indicated that, for him, the fact 
that Mr Naik was not accredited would not be a problem. But Mr Livesey was not the 
person responsible for deciding who should be the assessor. He was not the person 
who would bear the responsibility of being able to ensure that the re-entry programme 
 
could  be  shown  to  be  robust.  The  decisions  fell  to  the  Trust  and  its  appropriate 
officers. As a matter of fact, in my judgment, all those involved on behalf of the Trust 
in  the  process  in  September  2012  onwards  considered  that  the  person  acting  as 
assessor should be an accredited trainer and Mr Naik was not an accredited trainer and 
 
so, for that reason, could not act as the person responsible for assessing that Mr Lu 
 
had satisfied the requirements of any re-entry programme.  

 
68.	 

It is the case, as will appear from the discussion below on what information must be 
provided to obtain informed consent from patients, that Dr Fowlie and Mr Richens do 
 
not  accept  the  logic  of  the  Trust  Board’s  decision.  That  has  affected  the  patient 
 
consent  issue.  Those  views  have  not  however  affected  the  question  of  whether  Mr 
Naik was suitable to carry out the duties of assessor of any re-entry programme for 
Mr Lu. The views of Mr Richens has not influenced the remainder of the content of 
the re-entry programme, save in one respect. That one respect concerns the practical 
arrangements  for  implementing  the  resumption  of  duties  in  relation  to  heart  valve 
surgery. Mr Richens anticipates that he would wish Mr Lu to follow his procedures if 
he,  Mr  Richens,  has  any  doubts  about  Mr  Lu’s  existing  surgical  practices  in  this 
regard. I return to this topic later in assessing whether or not this amounts to a breach 
of any express or implied term of Mr Lu’s contract of employment.  

Subsequent Events 
 

 
69.	 

Following Mr Richens’ appointment as assessor, the intention was that Mr Lu be able 
to commence a return to surgical duties in the week beginning 14 January 2013. On 8 
January 2013, there was a meeting between Mr Mortimer and Mr Lu. The meeting 
was to discuss the Trust’s plans to communicate the commencement of Mr Lu’s re­
entry to surgical duties with other interested parties including patients and the public. 
Mr Mortimer indicated that re-entry would be postponed to the week beginning 28 
January 2013 to allow time for communication with other interested persons. In view 
of  the  fact  that  the  report  of  Mr  Francis  Q.C.  was  due  to  be  published  shortly,  the 
 
Trust also subsequently decided to postpone the recommencement of surgical duties 
to the week beginning the 25 February 2013. Dr Homa explained in evidence that the 
aim was to ensure that the re-entry programme would be consistent with anything that 
the Francis report might recommended. Furthermore, part of the concern was that the 
return to practice of Mr Lu would be likely to generate further interest. If the Francis 
report was published after that date, there might be a second round of media coverage 
which might generate adverse publicity for Mr Lu. The aim was to ensure the best 
possible chance for the re-entry programme to succeed and that was best achieved by 
 
delaying the re-entry until after the Francis report rather than having re-entry first, and 
then the Francis report. 

 
70.	 

Considerable work was undertaken on the process of how Mr Lu’s re-commencement 
of  surgical  duties  would  be  communicated  to  the  wider  public  and  patients.  On  14

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

February  2013,  Dr  Homa  wrote  to  Mr  Lu  to  ask  for  another  meeting  to  discuss 
delaying re-commencing surgical duties. Dr Homa, in his evidence, explained that a 
detailed communication strategy had been prepared and further time was needed to 
communicate with interested parties both within the Trust and externally. Mr Lu in his 
evidence confirms that Dr Homa outlined the communications strategy and provided a 
copy  to  him  at  the  meeting.  Mr  Lu  confirms  that  Dr  Homa’s  view  was  that  by 
meticulously  preparing  the  ground  work,  the  Trust  would  be  in  a  good  position  to 
defend the Trust’s decision to implement the recommendation that Mr Lu be allowed 
to re-commence surgical duties. I accept this evidence as indicating the content of the 
meeting. Dr Homa gave evidence that Mr Lu agreed that his return would begin in the 
 
week  beginning  15  April  2013.  Mr  Lu  did  not,  in  his  evidence,  express  a  different 
view. I accept Dr Homa’s evidence in this regard and I find as a fact that Mr Lu and 
 
Dr Homa agreed to defer Mr Lu’s re-commencement on surgical duties to the week 
 
beginning 15 April 2103. Further meetings took place on the communication strategy. 
 

On 21 March 2013, Mr Lu met Dr Homa and Mr Mortimer to hold a final discussion 
on the re-entry programme prior to a meeting with Mr Lu’s colleagues at the Centre 
scheduled for the next day. Mr Lu’s representative was away on leave so he did not 
attend. At this meeting, Mr Lu expressed his concerns about Mr Richens’ role in the 
re-entry  programme  primarily  in  relation  to  off-pump  coronary  artery  bypass  graft 
surgery  (which  Mr  Richens  did  not  perform).  Dr  Homa  confirmed  that  a  suitable 
assessor  would  be  identified  for  this  aspect  of  the  programme.  Dr  Homa  gave 
evidence that Mr Lu agreed at this meeting that Mr Richens would undertake the role 
of internal mentor and assessor with external support from Mr Cooper. 

Shortly after that meeting, Mr Lu e-mailed Dr Homa. Mr Lu stated that he wished to 
record  again  his  concerns  about  Mr  Richens  undertaking  the  role  of  mentor  and 
assessor. Those two concerns were again the fact that Mr Richens did not undertake 
 
off-pump surgery and Mr Lu did not consider that Mr Richens could be his mentor 
and assessor. In relation to an external assessor, Mr Lu indicated he would not object 
to  that  but  he  would  still  need  to  be  able  operate  with  a  colleague  who  was 
comfortable  with  off-pump  surgery.  Secondly,  Mr  Lu  indicated  that  he  wished  to 
work in an environment where all members of the team wore double gloves but that 
Mr Richens wore a single pair of thicker gloves. The e-mail ends in bold by saying: 

“In these circumstances, and given my concerns, I must please 
ask that my colleagues should not be told tomorrow that David 
Richens is going to be my mentor and assessor” 

In my judgment, Mr Lu’s stance at this stage is clear. He was not prepared to accept 
Mr Richens as his assessor despite the fact that he had agreed to that earlier in the day 
 
and despite the fact that the Trust had made it clear that Mr Richens would have to be 
the assessor as he was the only accredited trainer in the Centre. In my judgment, Mr 
Lu is in reality insisting on Mr Naik as his assessor. Mr Naik is the only colleague that 
performs off-pump surgery at the Trust. He is the only cardiac surgeon who follows 
the practice of double gloving.

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

As a result of Mr Lu’s refusal to accept Mr Richens, Mr Lu could not recommence 
surgical duties in April 2013. As Dr Homa said in a letter of 22 May 2013, he had no 
choice  in  the  circumstances  but  to  suspend  re-commencement  of  Mr  Lu’s  re-entry 
programme and the planned communication strategy.  

 
75.	 

Finally, on 22 May 2013, there was a further meeting between Dr Homa and Mr Lu. 
Also in attendance were Mr Mortimer and Mr Lu’s representative. The letter of 31 
May 2013 summarises that meeting. The letter explains that Dr Homa wished to avoid 
any ambiguity about the respective roles of  Mr Naik and Mr Richens. It was accepted 
that Mr Naik would play some supporting role but “plainly, Mr Richens will be in 
charge  of  the  re-entry  programme  and  the  allocation  of  duties  to  support  that 
programme”. The letter made it clear that any role played by Mr Naik or any other 
 
colleague  would  be  at  the  direction  of  Mr  Richens.  A  suitably  qualified  individual 
would be sought by Mr Richens to complete the assessment of the off-pump surgery 
aspects of the re-entry programme. The letter says this in part: 

“Following  an  adjournment,  when  you  consulted  with  Mr 
 
Mohammed, you confirmed your agreement as follows (and I 
quote your words as indicated): 

1.	  The need for a ‘robust’ re-entry programme 
2.	  Mr Richens would be ‘in charge’ of all aspects of your 

 
 

re-entry programme 

3.	  Mr  Naik  would  have  ‘no  formal  role’,  and  would 

 

provide ‘help only’ 

4.	  An  external  expert  would  be  identified  to  address  off-

 

pump specific assessments.” 

 
76.	 

The letter also noted that a number of practical issues had been discussed regarding 
the  re-entry  programme.  These  included  describing  the  progress  of  the  re-entry 
programmes in terms of the completion of competencies rather than being in two six 
 
month parts and Mr Richens would outline that to Mr Lu. The letter records that Mr 
 
Lu’s representative specifically welcomed that approach. The letter confirmed that Mr 
 
Richens would now be appointed as Assignment Director and a list of his main duties 
were  attached  to  the  letter.  The  duties  included  development  of  the  re-entry 
programme, allocation of surgical and other duties to Mr Lu, regular discussion with 
 
Mr  Lu  regarding  his  progress,  and  observation,  assessment  and  certification  of  the 
satisfactory completion of competencies described in the programme. They included 
other  duties  such  as  identification  of  a  suitably  qualified  individual  to  confirm  the 
 
assessment of Mr Lu’s competence in off-pump surgery and facilitating the quarterly 
review of Mr Lu’s programme. 

 

77.	  Mr Richens was then appointed as the Assignment Director. He undertook the task of 
reviewing the documents prepared by Mr Lu in September 2012 and developing the 
re-entry  programme.  He  had  been  provided  with  those  documents  by  Mr  Lu  in 
February 2013. There were various drafts prepared and circulated internally but not 
provided to Mr Lu.

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

On 17 September 2013, a draft re-entry programme was sent to Mr Lu. A meeting 
was arranged between Mr Richens, Dr Girling and Mr Lu. Further, Mr Lu was also to 
have the opportunity to provide a written commentary on the draft programme. There 
 
would also be a further meeting on or around 15 October 2013 between Mr Lu and Dr 
 
Homa. Mr Lu was told that if he required more time to consider the draft he should 
inform the relevant person. 

 

79.	  Mr  Richens  has  explained  the  reasoning  behind  the  revised  draft  programme  in 
evidence. The draft re-entry programme refers to the competencies identified in the 
 
ICSP that cardiac surgeons are expected to demonstrate they possess as they progress 
through  their  training  and  before  they  begin  independent  surgical  practice  (and  Mr 
Lu’s draft had also drawn on ICSP). Mr Richens’ draft is more specific in a number of 
respects  than  Mr  Lu’s  proposed  draft.  By  way  of  example,  Mr  Lu’s  objective  2 
referred to good clinical care, operative and technical skills without identifying what 
 
that  meant  in  practice.  Mr  Richens’s  draft  programme  provided  more  detail. 
Furthermore, Mr Lu’s programme was time-based comprising two six month blocks. 
 
Mr Richens explained that modern training was now more competency based. Mr Lu 
 
may  take  less  (or  more)  time  to  re-familiarise  himself  with,  and  demonstrate 
possession of, certain skills and competencies. Mr Richens’ programme therefore did 
not  include  a  time  element.    As  Mr  Richens  explained  in  evidence,  Mr  Lu  was  a 
relatively  junior  colleague  having  practised  as  a  cardiac  consultant  surgeon  for 
 
approximately  18  months  or  so  prior  to  ceasing  surgical  duties.  He  had  not  been 
 
undertaking surgical duties for, at that time, about 4 years. It was not clear where Mr 
Lu would be on the spectrum of competencies. It may be that, given his level of skill 
and  competencies,  he  would  move  much  quicker  through  the  process  of  re­
familiarising himself with and demonstrating the relevant competencies than someone 
who was an ordinary trainee. Mr Richens considered that this was the best framework 
for re-integrating Mr Lu into surgical duties.  There were also two appendices dealing 
with patient consent which I deal with below. 

 

80.	  Mr Lu was contacted to ask to confirm arrangements for the meeting to discuss the 
 
draft re-entry programme and he indicated that he was discussing the draft with his 
 
legal advisers, that he hoped to be able to respond shortly and asked that any further 
steps or meetings await that reply. On 24 October 2013, he indicated that he thought 
he would be in a position to respond by 29 October 2103 and probably sooner than 
that. 

On  28  October  2013,  solicitors  acting  for  Mr  Lu  sent  a  letter  before  action.  They 
contended  that  the  Trust  was  in  breach  of  express  or  implied  terms  of  Mr  Lu’s 
contract of employment. They set out the alleged breaches and indicated that they fell 
into four areas (1) alleged delay and procrastination in facilitating the return of Mr Lu 
to surgical practice (2) the departure without good reason from Mr Lu’s September 
2012 re-familiarisation process alleged to have been approved by the Trust and the 
proposed  replacement  with  a  new  draft  which  was  alleged  to  be  unreasonable  and 
irrational  (3)  the  proposed  arrangements  for  seeking  patient  consent  and  (4)  the 
communication strategy. On 19 November 2013, a claim was issued against the Trust 
on behalf of Mr Lu. That claim was heard over 5 days in late February and 3 March 
2014.

The Issue of Patient Consent 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
82.	 

 
83.	 

One of the issues that has arisen during consideration of the re-entry programme is the 
question of what information needs to be provided to patients to obtain their informed 
consent to Mr Lu participating in surgery concerning them. The issue is particularly 
acute  in  relation  to  heart  valve  surgery  as  opposed  to  coronary  artery  bypass  graft 
surgery. The infection was transmitted during heart valve surgery onto the prosthetic 
 
heart valve.  

By way of background, the Trust had obtained legal advice from leading counsel in 
 
November 2012 and disclosed that advice to Mr Lu. The advice was that the need to 
inform a patient of the risks of undergoing a procedure includes an obligation only to 
inform of the present risks of the procedure. The advice was that the courts had not 
held  that  there  was  an  obligation  to  inform  a  patient  of  historical  issues.  Counsel 
advised that if the evidence of all three experts were that the Mr Lu posed no greater 
risk to patients than his colleagues, then there would be no justification for requiring 
the disclosure of any additional information. If the experts were not unanimous, then 
 
it  may  be  necessary  to  consider  an  alternative  way  forward.  Counsel  advised  on 
obtaining  certain  specific  information  from  Professor  Finch  (on  risk  if  his 
recommended control measures were adopted) and Dr Boswell if surgical hoods were 
not worn during surgery. 

 
84.	 

The  Trust’s  consent  committee  met  on  4  January  2013  to  discuss  the  matter.  The 
discussion noted the following: 

“Discussion was had about these issues in some depth. Based 
on the evidence presented to them and the resulting discussion, 
the committee felt that Mr L should not have to specifically tell 
patients  about  his  part  in  the  outbreak  as  external  advisors  to 
the Trust had concluded that the risk to patients undergoing this 
type  of  surgery  was  now  estimated  to  be  same  for  whichever 
cardiac surgeon was performing the procedure, given that Mr L 
was  no  longer  carrying  the  outbreak  strain  and  had  agreed  to 
adhere  to  all  the  recommendations  made  by  the  external 
advisors.”

The committee reached a number of conclusions, including the following: 

 

“It was reasonable for Mr Lu not to identify himself as the surgeon responsible 
for  the  PVE  outbreak  each  time  that  he  consented  a  patient  for  valve  surgery, 
 
noting his agreed intention of disclosing this information if asked directly by a 
patient. “ 

The consent committee also considered that it would be sensible to seek patient views 
through the national or royal college panels available on the materiality of disclosing 
the role of an individual surgeon in an outbreak such as the one at the Centre in 2009.

Approved Judgment 
 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

The QuAC considered the question of risk. The view of the QuAC in July 2012 was 
that the evidence of the experts was that the risk to patients of Mr Lu returning all 
cardiac  surgery,  including  heart  valve  surgery,  was  minimal  assuming  that  Mr  Lu 
adhered  to  the  practical  measures  recommended  by  the  expert  microbiologists.  The 
risk to patients with the control measures in place was estimated to be the same as for 
all other cardiac surgeons in the Centre.  

The Trust Board decided on 30 August 2013 to accept that view. The minutes of that 
meeting record that the QuAC was specifically charged with considering the clinical 
 
risk if Mr Lu returned to cardiac surgery and reproduced the views of the committee 
 
summarised in the previous paragraph. The chairman noted that the committee wished 
 
to  raise  broader  issues,  including  the  reputation  of  the  Trust,  the  views  of  surgical 
colleagues and external bodies and individuals who referred patients to the Trust, the 
views  of  patients  and  the  public  (including  relatives  of  those  who  had  died)  and 
informed consent, in particular, whether it would be reasonable for Mr Lu to declare 
his history when seeking consent from future patients or whether a generic approach 
was  required.  There  was  a  discussion.  Dr  Fowlie  took  a  different  view  from  the 
experts and disagreed with the conclusion that Mr Lu presented no greater risk than 
other  surgeons  in  the  Centre.  He  considered  that  there  was  uncertainty  over  the 
 
position, and, while it may be that any risk might not be a lot greater, it was difficult 
to argue that there was no greater risk. The Trust Board did not accept Dr Fowlie’s 
views  and  recorded  that  he  dissented  from  the  decision.  The  Trust  Board  then 
resolved  to  allow  Mr  Lu  to  undertake  a  transitional  return  to  full  duties  subject  to 
compliance with Professor Finch’s recommendations. Dr Fowlie again raised the need 
to resolve the consent issue. The Board agreed that this was to be progressed as an 
 
employment issue. 

In my judgment, the Trust Board accepted that Mr Lu was no greater risk than any 
other cardiac surgeon in the Centre. That is clear from the fact that the contrary view, 
expressed  by  Dr  Fowlie,  was  not  the  view  of  the  Board  and  he  was  recorded  as 
 
dissenting. Furthermore, in my judgment, the Trust Board did not consider from the 
Trust’s  perspective,  that  any  greater  or  enhanced  consent  process  was  necessary  in 
relation  to  Mr  Lu.  The  Trust  Board  did  not,  for  example,  resolve  that  the  re-entry 
 
programme was to be conditional on surgeons with whom Mr Lu would be working 
during the re-entry period (or Mr Lu himself) volunteering the history as part of the 
process of obtaining consent. The logic of the Trust Board decision is that, from the 
Trust’s perspective, the information that needed to be provided to patients would be 
the same in Mr Lu’s case as in the case of other cardiac surgeons. That is the logic of 
the decision that Mr Lu, so far as the Trust Board is concerned, presents no greater 
risk than any other cardiac surgeon. 

That view is confirmed, in my judgment, by the letter of 3 September 2012. set out 
above. That letter records that the Board received and “accepted the view” reached by 
QuAC that, in the light of the expert evidence, the risk to patients of Mr Lu returning 
 
to cardiac surgery, including valve surgery, was minimal provided that he adhered to 
measures  recommended  by  the  expert  microbiologists.  The  letter  records  that  the 
Board heard that, with control measures in place, the risk presented by Mr Lu was the 
 
same as for all other cardiac surgeons in the Centre. The letter then confirms that the

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

Board  accepted  that  Mr  Lu  should  be  able  to  return  to  the  full  range  of  cardiac 
surgical  practice  subject  to  the  recommendations  set  out  in  the  original  report  by 
Professor Finch. That is a clear acceptance, in my judgment, of the view that, so far as 
 
the Trust is concerned, Mr Lu presents no greater risk than any other cardiac surgeon 
in  the  Centre.  The  letter  does  not  suggest  that  the  Trust  considers  that,  from  its 
 
perspective, there is to be any different or enhanced process for obtaining the consent 
of  patients  to  surgery  in  relation  to  Mr  Lu.  There  is  a  reference  to  the 
 
recommendations of Professor Finch. That reference is phrased to refer to the original 
 
report (not the supplementary response to questions given by Professor Finch) and to 
the recommendations in that report. The recommendations in the report do not include 
 
any suggestion that an enhanced consent procedure is necessary. The body of the text 
records  Professor  Finch’s  view  that  there  would  be  an  ever  present  requirement  to 
 
explain  his  historical  association.  Professor  Finch  does  not  elaborate  on  that  in  the 
original report. A requirement for disclosure of Mr Lu’s historical association was not 
a formal recommendation made by him. In my judgment, the letter of 3 September 
2012  is  a  carefully  drafted  letter  which  is  consistent  with  the  minutes.  The  Trust 
Board  is  satisfied  that  Mr  Lu  presents  no  greater  risk  than  any  other  surgeon.  The 
Trust  Board  does  not  require,  from  the  Trust’s  perspective,  that  the  re-entry 
 
programme needs to be conditional on an enhanced or different consent process for 
Mr Lu as compared with other cardiac surgeons. 

Notwithstanding  the  decision  of  the  Trust  Board,  on  25  January  2013  (the  letter  is 
dated 2012 but must have been written in 2013), Dr Ryder wrote to Mr Lu. He stated 
that the Trust had received further advice from leading counsel and the benefit of the 
views  of  the  consent  committee.  The  letter  continued  that  Dr  Ryder,  in  agreement 
with  Dr  Homa,  had  decided  that  Mr  Lu  would  adopt  an  approach  to  seeking  the 
consent  to  patients  undergoing  valve  surgery  which  made  clear  Mr  Lu’s  particular 
history  with  regards  to  the  fact  and  consequences  of  the  PVE  outbreak  in  2008  to 
2009.  The  position  of  Dr  Ryder,  Dr  Homa  and    Dr  Fowlie  has  remained  the  same 
 
thereafter  in  relation  to  the  process  of  obtaining  patient  consent  to  valve  surgery 
although Dr Homa in evidence indicated that the position could be reviewed at some 
 
stage in the future. Mr Lu’s position also remains the same. He considers that it would 
 
be  necessary  to  inform  patients  generally  about  the  risk  of  contracting  PVE  during 
heart  valve  surgery  and  any  specific  risks  relating  to  that  patient.  It  would  not  be 
 
necessary  for  him  to  volunteer  the  historical  information  about  the  2008  to  2009 
outbreak or his association within it as that is not necessary as it does not reflect any 
current risk arising from such surgery. Mr Lu will provide full information about the 
outbreak and his involvement in it to any patient who asks about the outbreak.  

 

Following  the  consent  committee  meeting,  steps  were  not  taken  to  obtain  views 
through  the  national  bodies  referred  to  by  the  consent  committee.  Instead, 
 
representatives  of  the  Trust  decided  that  patient  forums  would  be  established.  The 
first of these took place on 21 March 2013. The individuals who agreed to participate 
were  given  information  about  the  2009  outbreak.  Other  such  meetings  took  place. 
Views were expressed by those attending the various meetings including views that 
patients should be told at certain stages about the outbreak and Mr Lu’s association 
with it. On 6 September 2013, the Trust’s consent committee considered the patient 
forums.  The  committee  noted,  amongst  other  things,  that  they  considered  that  the 
repeated mention of Mr Lu by name was unfair and leading, and that mention should

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
also be made of investigations and external opinions sought and given to the Trust 
that  Mr  Lu  was  fit  to  operate  and  an  emphasis  on  what  has  been  done  to  protect 
patients  when  he  returned.  The  information  sheets  used  for  patient  forum  meetings 
after this date were amended in an attempt to respond to the criticisms made. 

The  draft  re-entry  programme  prepared  by  Mr  Richens  and  sent  to  Mr  Lu  in 
September 2013 has two appendices, Appendix 3 and 4, dealing with patient consent. 
These  appendices  apply  both  to  valve  surgery  and  coronary  artery  bypass  graft 
surgery.  Appendix  3  includes  a  section  headed  additional  consent  measures  for 
patients  involved  in  the  re-entry  programme.  There  will  be  a  consultant  cardiac 
surgeon responsible for the surgery. Mr Lu will be participating in that surgery. The 
 
patient is to be given an information pack and required to sign an additional consent 
form.  Appendix  4  sets  out  the  information  to  be  provided  in  the  form  of  an 
information  sheet.  It  explains  that  eleven  patients  contracted  PVE  in  2009  and  five 
 
died. It states that all relevant patients were operated on by one surgeon and names 
 
that  surgeon  as  Mr  Lu.  Further  information  is  then  given  about  the  infection,  the 
findings of the investigations and other matters. A special consent form is included.  

In addition, patients may have to undertake additional blood tests and microbiology 
swabs. The swabs are intended to be swabs of the operative site in valve surgery, that 
 
is,  in  practice,  swabs  of  the  prosthetic  heart  valve.  The  blood  tests  are  tests  to  be 
carried out on a number of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 

The  Trust  Board,  when  deciding  to  allow  Mr  Lu  to  undertake  a  transition  to  full 
surgery,  did  not  indicate  that  it  considered  it  necessary  or  appropriate  to  require 
surgeons  working  with  Mr  Lu  to  require  patients  to  undergo  further  blood  tests  or 
 
microbiological swab tests. None of the external experts who gave their opinions to 
the  Trust  or  QuAC  recommended  these  tests.  The  reason  for  requiring  additional 
blood  and  swab  tests  was  explained  in  evidence  by  Mr  Richens.  Dr  Boswell,  the 
 
Trust’s microbiological expert, it seems thought there would be merit in carrying out 
these  additional  tests.  They  were  therefore  incorporated  into  the  draft  re-entry 
programme.  The  consent  obtained  from  patients  would  include  consent  to  these 
additional procedures. They were not considered to be research but part of the normal 
 
clinical audit following surgery. 

The reasons underlying the requirement that patients be given information about the 
outbreak and Mr Lu’s involvement with it were as follows. Dr Homa considered that 
there was a moral duty on the Trust to provide the information. He said that, in his 
view,  describing  the  existing  risk  –  that  Mr  Lu  was  not  a  greater  risk  –  would  not 
comply  with  the  Trust’s  moral  duty.  He  said  that  he  had  taken  notice  of  what  he 
thought patients would want and the Trust would not be discharging its moral duty if 
it  did  not  refer  to  the  background.  He  considered  that  patients  would  view  the 
provision  of  this  information  as  necessary  and  it  should  be  provided  to  respect  the 
trust placed in doctors by patients.

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

Dr Fowlie considers that the information should be provided as he does not accept the 
logic underlying the Trust Board’s decision that Mr Lu does not present a greater risk 
 
than any other cardiac surgeon in relation to heart valve surgery. That has been his 
consistent  view.  He  therefore  considers  that  the  provision  of  information  about  the 
outbreak and Mr Lu’s involvement is necessary in order to enable patients properly to 
judge risk. In relation to coronary artery bypass graft surgery, his evidence is that the 
 
rationale  for  requiring  the  provision  of  this  information  is  that  it  is  what  he  feels 
 
patients would want to know and that he considers that it would be wrong to conceal 
information about the outbreak period. 

 

98.	  Mr Richens accepts and agrees with the Board’s decision that Mr Lu should be able to 
return to full time surgical duties. He accepts that it is the Trust Board’s view that Mr 
 
Lu presents no greater risk in relation to heart valve surgery. However, he, personally, 
cannot  accept  that  in  relation  to  heart  valve  surgery  there  is  necessarily  no  greater 
risk. He considers that there is an element of uncertainty and he does not accept the 
logic of the Trust Board’s view in the light of his reading of the expert opinions that 
have  been  provided.  Mr  Richens  had  read  the  expert  opinions  of  Mr  Hutter, 
Professors Finch and Eykyn and the coroner’s inquest and the SUI report. He had not 
been provided with the minutes of the QuAC committee. Mr Richens’ evidence was 
that,  in  relation  to  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  surgery  (as  opposed  to  heart  valve 
 
surgery) his view, and he understood, the view of Dr Boswell, was that any risk of 
PVE was very low indeed.  

 

THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
 

The Contract of Employment 
 

 
99.	 

The relevant legal principles are agreed between the parties and can be summarised 
relatively  briefly.  Clauses  3  and  17  of  Mr  Lu’s    contract  of  employment  are  the 
material provisions and provide the following: 

“3 General Mutual Obligations 

it 

is  necessary 

to  set  out  formal  employment 
Whilst 
arrangements in this contract, we also recognise that you are a 
 
senior  and  professional  employee  who  will  usually  work 
unsupervised and frequently have the responsibility for making 
important judgments and decisions. It is essential therefore that 
you  and  we  work  in  a  spirit  of  mutual  trust  and  confidence. 
You and we agree to the following mutual obligations in order 
to  achieve  the  best  for  patients  and  to  ensure  the  efficient 
running of the service: 

 
  To co-operate with each other; 

 
  To maintain goodwill;

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
	  To carry out our respective obligations and operating a 

Job Plan; 

 
	  To  carry  out  our  respective  obligations  in  accordance 

with appraisal arrangements; 

 
	  To  carry  out  our  respective  obligations  in  devising, 
reviewing,  revising  and  following  the  organisation’s 
policies,  objectives,  rules,  working  practices  and 
protocols.” 

And 

“17 Disciplinary Matters 

Wherever possible, any issues relating to conduct, competence and behaviour 
should  be  identified  and  resolved  without  recourse  to  formal  procedures. 
However, should we consider that your conduct or behaviour may be in breach 
of our code of conduct, or that your professional competence has been called 
into question, the matter will be resolved through our disciplinary or capability 
 
procedures (which will be consistent with the ‘Maintaining High Professional 
Standards 
the  appeal 
arrangements set out in those procedures.” 

the  Modern  NHS’  Framework),  subject 

to

100.	 

In relation to clause 17, the Trust had adopted the Procedure. It is common ground 
that that Procedure is the applicable procedure which is being followed in the present 
case  and  that  that  procedure  reflects,  accurately,  the  Maintaining  High  Professional 
Standards in the Modern NHS document referred to in clause 17. 

 

 
101.	  Section 1 of the Procedure indicates that it outlines the process for handling concerns 
about  doctors’  and  others  conduct  and  capability.  Section  2.1  provides  that  all 
employees,  and  others,  should  be  treated  fairly.  Section  3.1  provides  that  where 
 
concerns about a practitioner’s performance can be identified, that must be reported to 
the  Chief  Executive  and  a  case  manager  appointed.  In  the  case  of  consultants,  the 
 
Medical Director is to be the case manager and is to be responsible for appointing a 
 
case investigator. In the present case, Dr Fowlie was the case manager and then was 
replaced in that role by Dr Ryder. The case investigator was Professor Finch. Section 
3  deals  with  the  action  to  be  taken  in  identifying  the  problem  and  the  case 
investigation.  There  is  provision  for  the  involvement  of  NCAS  at  various  stages. 
Section  4  deals  with  temporary  restrictions  on  a  practitioner’s  practice.  Mr  Lu  is 
subject  to  restrictions  at  present  in  that  he  cannot  undertake  surgical  duties.  He 
continues  to  perform  other  duties.  Section  6  sets  out  a  procedure  for  dealing  with 
issues  of  capability.  Section  6.4.1  provides  that  the  practitioner  must  be  given  the 
opportunity to comment in writing upon the report of the case investigator. Here, Mr 
Lu was given the opportunity to comment upon Professor Finch’s report.
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 
102.	  Section 6.4.2 provides as follows: 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

“The  case  manager  should  decide  what  further  action  is 
necessary,  taking  into  account  the  findings  of  the  report,  any 
comments that the practitioner has made and the advice of the 
NCAS. The case manager will need to consider urgently: 

 
	  Whether  action  under  part  3  of  the  procedure  is 

necessary to exclude the practitioner; or 

 
	  To place temporary restrictions on their clinical duties. 

The case manager will also need to consider with the Medical 
Director and Director of Human Resources whether the issues 
of  capability  can  be  resolved  through  local  action  (such  as 
retraining,  counselling,  performance  review).  If  this  action  is 
not practicable for any reason the matter must be referred to the 
 
NCAS  for  it  to  consider  whether  an  assessment  should  be 
carried  out  and  to  provide  assistance  in  drawing  up  an  action 
 
plan. The case manager will inform the practitioner concerned 
 
of  the  decision  immediately  and  normally  within  10  working 
days of receiving the practitioner’s comments.” 

 

103.	  That is the stage of the process which has currently been reached. The Trust and Mr 
 
Lu are seeking to resolve capability issues by local action, in this case, by a return to 
surgical duties under a re-entry programme. That stage of the process has not yet been 
concluded. In the event that this local action does not resolve the problem, the matter 
must be referred to NCAS for it to consider whether to carry out an assessment and 
provide assistance in drawing up an action plan. In certain circumstances, NCAS may 
 
not be able to provide that assistance and then a capability hearing may be conducted. 
Furthermore, if the practitioner does not consent to the referral of the matter to NCAS, 
a  capability  hearing  may  be  held:  see  section  6.4.3  of  the  Procedure.  There  is  a 
prescribed  procedure  for  capability  hearings  involving,  amongst  other  things, 
notification of the hearing date, exchange of documents, calling of witnesses, and the 
hearing itself. 

 
104.	 

It is an implied term of Mr Lu’s contract of employment that the employer will not, 
 
without  reasonable  cause,  act  in  a  way  that  is  calculated  or  likely  to  destroy  or 
 
seriously  damage  the  relationship  of  trust  and  confidence  between  employer  and 
 
employee. The position is summarised in the following two passages of the judgment 
 
of  Lord  Nicholls  of  Birkenhead  in  Malik  v  Bank  of  Credit  and  Commerce 
International S.A [1997] A.C. 606 at pages 610F-G and 610H-611A: 

“This implied obligation is no more than one particular aspect 
of the portmanteau general obligation not to engage in conduct 
likely  to  undermine  the  trust  and  confidence  required  if  the 
 
employment  relationship  is  to  continue  in  the  manner  the 
employment contract implicitly envisages”
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

and 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

“The  conduct  must,  of  course,  impinge  on  the  relationship  in 
the  sense  that  looked  at  objectively,  it  is  likely  to  destroy  or 
seriously  damage  the  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  the 
 
employee is reasonably entitled to have in his employer. That 
requires one to look at all the circumstances”. 

 

 

105.	  The test for determining whether there has been a breach is objective. The obligation 
may be breached whether or not the employer subjectively intends to undermine the 
relationship. It is common ground that the court must look at all the circumstances, 
including the context, the conduct of the employer and, in appropriate circumstances, 
the  employee’s  own  conduct.  Breach  of  the  implied  term  may  occur  by  way  of  a 
single act or through the cumulative effect of a series of acts: see Lewis v Motorworld 
Garages Ltd. [1986] ICR 157 at 169F-G. The court should not in general intervene to 
remedy minor failures and its role is not to seek to manage in detail the employment 
 
relationship. As Lord Hodge expressed it, in the context of failures in relation to the 
conduct of a disciplinary procedure, at paragraph 39 of his judgment in West London 
Mental Health NHS Trust v Chhabra [2013] UKSC 80: 

“As a general rule it is not appropriate for the courts to intervene to remedy minor 
 
irregularities  in  the  course  of  disciplinary  proceedings  between  employer  and 
employee – its role is not the ‘micro-management’ of such proceedings: Kulkarni 
v Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust [2010] ICR 101, para. 22”. 

 

106.	  Further, section  2.1 of the Procedure provides that employees are to be treated fairly. 
The  requirements  of  fairness  will  depend  on  all  the  circumstances,  including  the 
nature  of  the  decision  or  decision-making  process  in  question.  As  Cranston  J. 
observed  at  paragraph  82  of  his  judgment  in  Yapp  v  Foreign  and  Commonwealth 
Office [2013] EWHC 1098 (QB) fair treatment is “fact sensitive and its requirements 
turn very much on context”. 

Patient Consent 
 

 

107.	  The  position  in  relation  to  the  information  to  be  provided  to  a  patient  in  order  to 
obtain the patient’s consent to surgery is also common ground between the parties. 
The  position,  for  present  purposes,  can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  Surgery 
 
performed without the informed consent of the patient is unlawful. A surgeon owes a 
duty  to  a  patient  to  warn  him  or  her  in  general  terms  of  possible  significant  risks 
 
involved in the surgical procedure in question. The duty is concerned with the current 
risks  involved  in  the  procedure:  see  generally  Chester  v  Afshar  [2005]  1  AC  134, 
especially  Lord  Steyn  at  paragraphs  14  to  16  and  Lord  Walker  of  Gestinthorpe  at 
 
paragraphs 91 to 92. For present purposes, it is sufficient to record the observation of 
Lord  Woolf  M.R.  at  paragraph  21  of  his  judgment  in  Pearce  v  United  Bristol 
Healthcare NHS Trust [199] E.C.C. 167:
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

“In  a  case  where  it  is  being  alleged  that  a  plaintiff  has  been 
deprived  of  the  opportunity  to  make  a  proper  decision  as  to 
what  course  he  or  she  should  take  in  relation  to  treatment,  it 
seems to me to be the law, as indicated in the cases to which  I 
 
have just referred, that if there is a significant risk which would 
 
affect the judgment of a reasonable patient, then in the normal 
course it is the responsibility of the doctor to inform the patient 
of that significant risk, if the information is needed so that the 
patient can determine for him or herself as to what  course he or 
 
she should adopt.” 

THE ISSUES 
 

108.	  Against  that  background,  the  principal  issues  that  arise,  in  my  judgment  are  as 
 

 

follows: 

 

(1) Did the Trust approve Mr Lu’s proposed re-entry programme in September 

2012 and then, in breach of contract, fail to implement that programme? 
 

(2) Is the Trust acting in breach of express or implied terms of Mr Lu’s contract 

 

of employment by 

 
(a)	 

 
(b)	 

 
(c)	 

 
(d)	 

 
(e)	 

 

proposing  a  draft  re-entry  programme  in  the  terms 
 
contained  in  the  draft  prepared  by  Mr  Richens  in 
 
September 2013 rather than the draft prepared by Mr Lu 
in September 2012? 
 

acting  in  a  way  which  constituted  delay  either  (a)  in 
respect of Mr Lu’s return to coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery after May 2010 or (b) the return to that surgery 
and  heart  valve  surgery  between  January  2013  and 
September 2013? 
 

by failing to consult Mr Lu, or NCAS, or other bodies, 
or by establishing a  task and finish group, including as 
 
members Dr Fowlie, Dr Homa and Mr Mortimer? 
  

by  acting  in  the  way  it  did  in  respect  of  the  proposed 
communication strategy? and 

by requiring (a) surgeons during the re-entry programme 
period 
the  historical 
association  of Mr Lu with the outbreak of PVE in 2008 

to  provide 

information 

to

respect of heart valve surgery. 

THE FIRST ISSUE - MR LU’S SEPTEMBER 2012 PROPOSED PROGRAMME 
 

 

109.	  The Trust and Mr Lu both accept that there will need to be a re-entry programme to 
facilitate  Mr  Lu’  return  to  full  cardiac  surgery.  He  has  been  absent  from  surgical 
duties for a number of years. He was, in fact, a relatively junior consultant at the time 
 
he  ceased  surgery,  having  been  a  consultant  for  approximately  2  years.  One  of  the 
principal practical problems for the Trust and Mr Lu has been the identification of an 
appropriate re-entry programme.

In  relation  to  the  first  issue,  I  have  already  found  as  a  fact  that  the  Trust  did  not 
approve,  agree  or  accept  that  the  draft  re-entry  programme  proposed  by  Mr  Lu  in 
September  2012  was  an  appropriate  programme.  Those  reasons  are  set  out  at 
 
paragraphs 56 to 57 above. Furthermore, I have already found as a fact that the Trust 
did not accept or agree in December 2012 or subsequently that  Mr Lu’s proposed re­
entry programme was acceptable save for the substitution of Mr Richens as assessor 
 
in place of  Mr Naik. Those reasons are set out at paragraphs 58-59  above. 

In  those  circumstances,  in  my  judgment,  the  Trust  did  not  fail  to  implement  the 
September 2012 programme or resile from any agreement that the September 2012 
programme was suitable. There was simply no agreement and no acceptance by the 
 
Trust that the September 2012 programme was suitable or acceptable. Consequently, 
the fact that Mr Lu’s proposed programme was not implemented did not involve any 
breach  of  clause  3  of  Mr  Lu’s  contract  and  did  not  involve  any  actions  likely  to 
destroy or seriously damage the trust and confidence of the employment relationship. 

 
THE SECOND ISSUE – THE TRUST’S PROPOSED RE-ENTRY PROGRAMME 

 

112.	  The second issue concerns the arrangements that have been proposed for securing the 
 
return of Mr Lu to full time surgical duties. At one level, there is a difference of view 
 
between the Trust and Mr Lu. The Trust envisages a re-entry programme whereby Mr 
 
Richens is the assessor. He will be responsible for arranging Mr Lu’s participation in 
 
on-pump  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  surgery,  and,  in  due  course  the  heart  valve 
surgery,  and  assessing  whether  Mr  Lu  demonstrates  the  relevant  skills  and 
competencies in relation to those areas of surgery. Another suitable individual from 
outside the Centre will be identified to perform the same task in relation to off-pump 
 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery. An external reviewer, Mr Cooper, will provide 
external validation that Mr Lu possesses the relevant skills and competencies.

113.	  Mr Lu would prefer Mr Naik to be the person responsible for facilitating his return to 
full-time practice. In particular, he wished Mr Naik to be responsible for the process 
of him resuming off-pump surgery.  

 

114.	  At another level, there are a series of practical issues that arise. These concern, firstly 
whether  the  re-entry  programme  should  stipulate  a  time-frame  within  which  the 
programme would be completed. Secondly, there is the issue of whether the contents 
of  the  Trust’s  proposed  programme  are  suitable  for  facilitating  re-entry  (with  the 
exception of appendices 3 and 4 dealing with additional testing of patients and patient 
 
consent which I deal with separately in a later section of this judgment). The third is 
the arrangements for resumption of off-pump surgery.  

The Trust’s General Approach 
 

 

115.	  Dealing with the main issue, the Trust has determined that the re-entry programme 
should be carried out under the supervision of an experienced, accredited trainer. Mr 
Lu has been absent from surgery for some years. He was a relatively junior consultant 
with relatively little experience of independent practice in surgery. The Trust’s view 
is  that  the  re-entry  programme  would  need  to  be  under  the  supervision  of  an 
accredited  trainer.  Mr  Richens  was  an  experienced,  accredited  trainer  and,  indeed, 
was the only such trainer at the Centre. Mr Richens did not practise off-pump surgery 
but that could be dealt with by identifying a suitable, qualified person to undertake 
supervision  in  relation  to  the  resumption  of  that  aspect  of  Mr  Lu’s  practice. 
Furthermore, the Trust was concerned to ensure not only was the re-entry programme 
robust, it would be demonstrably so. Ensuring the re-entry programme was supervised 
and implemented by experienced, accredited trainers would contribute to the Trust’s 
 
ability to demonstrate that the programme was robust. It would assist the Trust to deal 
 
with any questions about the suitability of Mr Lu returning to practice. I have set out 
my findings of fact, and the reasons for them, on this issue at  paragraphs 60 to 67 
above.  In  my  judgment,  the  Trust  were  acting  properly  and  appropriately  in 
approaching the re-entry programme in this way. Viewed objectively, the Trust are 
not  acting  in  a  way  which  would  be  likely  to  undermine  or  seriously  damage  the 
employment  relationship.  In  my  judgment,  the  reverse  is  true.  Viewed  objectively, 
 
approaching the proposed re-entry programme in this way should facilitate Mr Lu’s 
presumption  of  surgical  duties  and  should  contribute  to  the  mutual  trust  and 
confidence of employer and employee. Similarly, the Trust’s decision to proceed in 
this  way  does  not  involve  any  breach  of  any  express  obligation,  including  the 
 
obligations in clause 3, of Mr Lu’s contract of employment.  

 

 

 

116.	  By contrast, I regard the proposal by Mr Lu that Mr Naik be the person responsible 
for  facilitating  his  resumption  to  surgery  as  hopelessly  naïve  and  unrealistic.  I 
 
understand Mr Lu’s wish to have a supportive and confidence building environment 
in  which  to  resume  his  surgical  duties.  I  understand  the  fact  that  he  has  always 
enjoyed  a  good  relationship  with  Mr  Naik  who,  as  an  experienced  and  senior 
colleague, has acted as a source of advice and guidance to Mr Lu. I recognise the fact 
that they both perform the complex off-pump surgery. Everyone who gave evidence 
has paid tribute to Mr Naik’s skill as a surgeon. He is clearly very highly regarded in
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

this complex and demanding field of cardiac surgery. However, the fact of the matter 
is  that  Mr  Naik  has  very  little  experience  of  training.  He  has  never  undertaken  the 
 
relevant courses to equip him with the skills (very different from surgical skills alone) 
 
 
to train and supervise colleagues. He had not demonstrated that he has the skills or 
meets the criteria of persons who act as trainers. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to 
hear Mr Naik giving evidence at first hand. In terms of cardiac surgery, Mr Naik was 
 
an impressive witness with a full grasp of what is obviously a difficult and demanding 
field of surgery. But in my judgment, he demonstrated little or no idea of the demands 
or  requirements  of  training  or  the  way  in  which  a  process  of  facilitating  the 
 
resumption  of  surgical  duties  could  be  carried  out.  The  preferred  option  of  Mr  Lu 
would involve a relativly junior consultant resuming surgical duties, after a number of 
years’  absence  from  surgery  under  the  supervision  of  a  consultant  who,  although  a 
highly skilled surgeon, has little or no experience of the kind of demands or training 
that that process would involve. Viewed objectively, in my judgment, the Trust has 
not acted inappropriately or improperly by declining to follow Mr Lu’s proposal, and 
has not acted in a way which would be likely to destroy or seriously undermine the 
trust and confidence necessary in an employment relationship. Nor does the Trust’s 
refusal to accept this proposal involve a breach of the express obligation in clause 3 of 
Mr Lu’s contract of employment.  

 
117.	 

I  also  bear  in  mind  that  Mr  Lu  wishes  to  commence  his  return  to  work  in  an 
 
environment where he, and all others in the surgical team adopt the practice of double 
gloving, that is wearing two sets of gloves so that if the upper set has to be removed 
during surgery, the underlying second set of gloves will remain in place and act as a 
barrier to transmission. But, contrary to what Mr Lu said in evidence, Professor Finch 
did  not  recommend  that  cardiac  surgeons  adopt  the  practice  of  double  gloving.  He 
recommended surgeons either adopt a practice of double gloving or wearing a single 
set  of  thicker  gloves.  All  the  relevant  clinicians  in  the  Centre  comply  with  the 
recommendations of Professor Finch and either double glove or wear thicker gloves. 
The Trust is not, in my judgment, acting in breach of contract by taking the view that 
 
the need to ensure that the re-entry programme is undertaken under the supervision of 
an experienced and accredited trainer outweighs Mr Lu’s preference that others with 
whom he will be working adopt the practice of double gloving. 

The Details 
 

I turn next to the detailed concerns expressed by Mr Lu. First, he said in evidence that 
the absence of a timeframe in the re-entry programme for completion was “crucial”. 
First, the reason for the change from two six month periods (as envisaged by Mr Lu’s 
 
programme)  was  that  modern  training  and  assessment  is  expressed  in  terms  of 
competencies.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  that  the  person  concerned  demonstrates  the 
relevant skills and competencies required rather than imposing a time frame within 
 
which those must be acquired. Secondly, the change may well be beneficial to Mr Lu. 
If  he  is  able  to  demonstrate  that  he  continues  to  possess  the  relevant  skills  and 
 
competencies more quickly, he will complete the programme and be able to resume 
 
independent surgery more quickly. Thirdly, Mr Fabri also gave evidence that it was 
preferable if the re-entry programme was not time limited. Mr Lu may need more, or 
he may need less, time and the key question was whether he had demonstrated that he 

 
118.
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
possessed  the  relevant  competencies.  In  my  judgment,  the  switch  to  competencies 
instead of a fixed timetable does not involve any breach of any express or implied 
term of the contract of employment. 

 

119.	  Secondly,  Mr  Lu  complains  that  the  draft  re-entry  programme  does  not  permit  Mr 
Naik  to  perform  the  task  of  facilitating  his  resumption  of  off-pump  surgery.  In  my 
 
judgment, that position follows from the fact that the Trust, for perfectly good and 
valid  reasons,  has  determined  that  the  relevant  surgeon  with  whom  Mr  Lu  will  be 
 
working is an experienced and accredited trainer. Mr Naik is not an experienced and 
accredited trainer and consequently is not suitable for this task. Mr Richens is suitable 
for performing the relevant tasks in relation to heart valve and on pump-surgery. He is 
not  suitable  in  relation  to  off-pump  surgery  as  he  does  not  practise  that  technique. 
Consequently, he will need to identify a suitably qualified individual to perform the 
 
task  of  facilitating  Mr  Lu’s  return  to  off-pump  surgery,  at  a  suitable  time,  and 
assessing Mr Lu’s competence. That involves no breach of contract. 

 

120.	  Thirdly,  there  was  initially  criticism  of  the  content  of  the  Trust’s  proposed 
programme.  This  criticism,  however,  needs  to  be  analysed  carefully.  The  evidence 
was that the aims of the programme and the competencies described in the draft re­
entry programme prepared by Mr Richens and sent to Mr Lu on 17 September 2013 
were (subject to certain qualifications, and also the appendices dealing with patient 
consent)  suitable  aims  and  competencies.  Mr  Richens  gave  evidence  that  the 
 
competencies themselves were derived from the ICSP and were the ones that surgeons 
 
would need to possess. Mr Lu himself gave evidence that the aims and competencies 
 
were ones that he was content that he would need to demonstrate. He gave evidence 
that  his  draft  re-entry  programme  and  that  of  Mr  Richens  both  dealt  with  what  he 
called  the  patient  journey,  that  is  pre-operative,  intra-operative,  post-operative  and 
follow-up  stages.  He  accepted  that,  whichever  programme  he  followed,  he  would 
have to demonstrate these competencies. In my judgment, therefore, the Trust has not 
acted in breach of contract by describing the aims in the way that is set out in section 
1  of,  and  the  competencies  as  described  in  appendix  1  to,  the  draft  re-programme 
 
prepared  by  Mr  Richens.  Similarly,  the  supervision  process  and  the  assessment 
process is, in my judgment, unobjectionable (save that I consider that bullet points 3 
and 4 under the heading of individual assessment potentially misdescribe the role of 
the task and finish group, a topic I deal with below). Similarly, there is no evidence to 
suggest that the stages of the re-entry programme are inappropriately described.  

 

In part, any disagreement appears to be about the use of language and tone. Mr Lu and 
Mr  Fabri  were  concerned  that  the  tone  of  the  document  could  be  seen  as  more 
redolent of training a junior person whereas Mr Lu is a consultant who needs a re­
entry programme to facilitate his resumption of surgical duties. They emphasise that 
in their view there should be a supportive environment provided whereby Mr Lu can 
rebuild  his  confidence.  I  understand  that  the  use  of  language  is  important.  I 
understand that perceptions of status may also be very important in the work place. 
However, having heard and considered all the evidence, the concerns expressed are, 
 
in my judgment, misplaced. The draft re-entry programme sets out the programme for 
re-entry, that is the aims, the means of supervision, the method of assessment and the 
competencies.  Its  content  in  relation  to  those  matters  is,  in  my  judgment, 
 

 

 

 
121.
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

unobjectionable  and  does  not  amount  to  a  breach  of  any  express  or  implied 
contractual term. The day to day environment in which the re-entry programme will 
be  carried  out  is  the  Centre.  The  evidence  that  I  have  heard  indicates  that  those 
involved do wish to provide a supportive, confidence building environment for Mr Lu 
 
and do wish him to be able to return to surgical duties. There is nothing in the draft re­
entry programme which prevents that. Viewed objectively, there is nothing in any of 
 
the evidence to suggest that the Trust has conducted itself in a way which will prevent 
that. In terms of language, all parties, including Mr Lu, have used different words to 
describe the process that Mr Lu will need to undergo. Mr Lu’s representatives have 
themselves referred to training in some of the correspondence. The substance of the 
situation is clearly recognised by both Mr Lu and the Trust. Mr Lu is a consultant. He 
has been away from surgery for some years now. He has to undergo a process which, 
in substantive terms, is that described in sections 1 to 4 and appendix 1 of the draft re­
entry  programme.  Whilst  different  words  have  been  used  at  different  times  by 
different persons to describe that process, there is no doubt, in my judgment, that all 
parties  fully  understand  what  the  Trust  is  proposing.  What  it  is  proposing,  in  my 
 
judgment, is entirely appropriate for the situation in this case and does not involve a 
breach of any contractual term.  

 

122.	  There is one further issue. Mr Richens in his evidence indicated that he fully accepted 
that  the  Trust  Board’s  decision  was  that  Mr  Lu  return  to  surgical  duties  and  he 
supported  and  accepted  that  aim.  He  understood  that  the  Trust  Board  decision  was 
 
based on the view that Mr Lu presented no greater risk than any other surgeon. Mr 
 
Richens, fairly and honestly, admitted that he could not accept the logic of that view 
 
so far as heart valve surgery was concerned. He considered that the uncertainty over 
 
the  means  of  transmission  meant  that  he  could  not  be  sure  that  Mr  Lu  was  not  a 
greater risk. He may not be, but Mr Richens could not be sure of that. He had that fact 
in mind when he drafted the programme. However, it is also clear from his evidence 
 
that  that  fact  does  not  affect  the  way  in  which  the  draft  re-entry  programme  is 
described (leaving aside appendices 2, 3 and 4) and does not affect the substance of 
the competencies that Mr Lu would have to demonstrate.  

 

123.	  The one area where Mr Richens felt that the actual implementation of the draft re­
entry  programme  would  differ  because  of  his  view  was  this.  In  relation  to  valve 
surgery, if Mr Richens was responsible for a patient undergoing heart valve surgery, 
and  if  Mr  Lu  was  assisting  him,  he  would  require  Mr  Lu  to  carry  out  the  relevant 
surgical tasks in his, Mr Richens’, preferred way. I have considered carefully whether 
 
that difference means that the Trust, through those engaged in implementing the re­
entry programme, would be in breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence. I 
recognise  that  the  Trust  Board  has  accepted  that  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  Mr 
Lu’s surgical techniques when he was practising independently. I recognise that the 
Trust Board has accepted that Mr Lu presents no greater risk. However, it seems to 
me  that  the  process  of  re-entry  will  necessarily  involve  Mr  Lu  working  with  and 
assisting  other  surgeons.  In  that  context,  I  consider  that  the  Trust  Board  implicitly 
recognises that there will be situations where the supervising or responsible surgeon 
will require Mr Lu, when he is assisting, to perform tasks in a way that the responsible 
surgeon  prefers.  That,  in  my  judgment,  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  Trust  Board 
decision in relation to this particular matter. Furthermore, and most importantly, Mr 
Lu himself gave evidence to Professor Finch in which he said that he felt one of the
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
four steps that he had to undertake was to mirror the surgical techniques used by the 
other surgeons. He also gave evidence to Professor Finch as to the conditions that he 
 
thought  he  would  need  to  put  in  place  before  he  could  return  to  surgery.  One 
condition was “to return to surgery under the mentorship of my surgical colleagues 
 
and to adopt their surgical practice”. Viewed objectively, therefore, and considering 
all  the  available  evidence,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  way  that  the  Trust  proposes  to 
implement  the  re-entry  programme  is  not  in  any  way  likely  to  destroy  or  seriously 
damage the mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship.  

 
124.	 

I should add that I am relieved that that is the case. It does not appear to me to be 
appropriate for a court of law to express views on the ways in which serious, complex 
surgery is to be carried out in the operating theatre. A court is neither equipped nor 
experienced to make the kind of judgements that that situation calls for. Further, that 
 
would in my judgment be an attempt to micro- manage the employment relationship 
in  the  way  that  the  case  law  deprecates.  Given  that  the  parties  had  instituted 
proceedings, and given their view that the issues, so far as they raised issues of law, 
had  to  be  resolved,  it  has  been  necessary  to  deal  with  these  issues.  As  I  have 
indicated, the general approach of the Trust, and the details discussed above, do not, 
in any event, in my judgment, involve any breach of any express or contractual term 
on the part of the Trust. 

THE FOURTH ISSUE – THE ALLEGED DELAY 
 

 

 

125.	  The fourth issue concerns the question of whether there has been any delay in relation 
to either the recommencement of coronary artery bypass graft surgery or heart valve 
 
surgery or both such as to amount to a breach of an express term of the contract of 
 
employment or the implied term of trust and confidence. 

 
126.	 

In relation to coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the factual position is this. Mr Lu 
 
voluntarily agreed to a restriction on his activities and to cease performing such duties 
in October 2009. That occurred against a background where there had been a number 
 
of deaths in patients upon which he had carried out heart valve surgery (not coronary 
artery bypass graft surgery). The circumstances were such that both Mr Lu and the 
Trust  recognised  that  he  could  not  realistically  carry  out  surgical  duties  whilst  the 
causes of the PVE outbreak in heart valve patients needed to be investigated. 

 

127.	  The SUI report was published in May 2010. That recommended that Mr Lu did not 
return to valve surgery until any identifiable risk of PVE were reduced to acceptable 
 
levels  but  did  recommend  a  phased  return  to  cardiac  revascularisation  surgery  (the 
coronary artery bypass graft surgery) under close mentorship. The SUI panel were, 
however,  continuing  with  their  investigation  in  order  to  prepare  a  supplementary 
report on the apparent delay in detecting the outbreak. The case manager at the time 
(Dr Fowlie, the Medical Director of the Trust) considered that it was not feasible to 
facilitate a return to work on the basis of the May 2010 report when the SUI panel had 
indicated that its work was not, in fact, finished and it was carrying on its work with a 
view to preparing a supplementary report. He considered that it would place Mr Lu
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
and  the  Trust  in  a  very  difficult  position  to  arrange  a  return  to  work,  given  the 
outbreak,  before  the  SUI  had  completed  its  work.  He  considered  that  a  continued 
restriction  would  be  reasonable  and  proportionate  at  that  stage.  Mr  Lu  did  not 
 
specifically request a return to coronary artery bypass graft surgery in May 2010. In 
my judgment, in the circumstances, there was no breach of any express provision in 
 
Mr Lu’s contract of employment and, viewed objectively, the decision of the Trust to 
maintain the restriction on surgical practice while awaiting the final SUI report was 
not  conduct  likely  to  destroy  or  seriously  damage  trust  and  confidence  in  the 
employment relationship.  

 

128.	  The SUI supplementary report was finalised in October 2010. Following that, it was 
decided  to  appoint  a  case  investigator  and  Professor  Finch  was  appointed.  Mr  Lu 
 
agreed  to  the  obtaining  of  a  further  expert  independent  advice  (as  proposed  by 
NCAS). In March 2011, Mr Lu’s advisers did request that Mr Lu be allowed to return 
to cardiac surgery save for heart valve surgery. The case manager Dr Ryder, having 
taken advice from Dr Fowlie, decided that the assessment of the reduction of the risk 
to acceptable levels should be carried out not only in relation to heart valve surgery 
but  other  cardiac  surgery.  At  that  stage,  it  would  not  have  been  envisaged  that 
Professor Finch, who was appointed to perform that role, would not be in a position to 
finalise  his  investigation  report  until  late  November  2011.  Indeed,  there  can  be  no 
criticism of the way in which Professor Finch went about his report. He necessarily 
had to interview a number of people and receive expert evidence including awaiting a 
report  from  Professor  Eykyn  on  behalf  of  Mr  Lu  which  was  provided  in  late 
September 2011. In my judgment, in the unique circumstances of this case with an 
unprecedented outbreak causing a number of patient deaths, and in a situation where 
 
all were agreed that independent expert advice was required, there was no breach of 
any express provision in Mr Lu’s contract of employment and, viewed objectively, the 
decision of the Trust to maintain the restriction on surgical practice while awaiting the 
 
report from Professor Finch was not conduct likely to destroy or seriously damage the 
 
employment relationship.  

 

129.	  The period after the report of Professor Finch relates both to heart valve surgery and 
other  cardiac  surgery  as  Professor  Finch  recommended  a  return  to  full  operative 
practice. Professor Finch’s report was first to be considered by the QuAC. They met 
and obtained legal training. They received evidence from Professor Finch, Dr Boswell 
 
and from Professor Eykyn as they were anxious to ensure a full opportunity for Mr Lu 
to put forward his evidence. The QuAC made their recommendation on 3 July 2012. 
The Trust Board met and reached its decision on 30 August 2012. Given the gravity 
 
of the decision both for Mr Lu and for patients, as well as for the Trust as a corporate 
body,  the  way  in  which  the  Trust  approached  this  decision  was,  in  my  judgment, 
beyond reproach. There was no breach of any express provision in Mr Lu’s contract 
of  employment  and,  viewed  objectively,  the  decision  of  the  Trust  to  maintain  the 
restriction  on  surgical  practice  while  awaiting  the  report  from  Professor  Finch  and 
taking a considered view on the risks of Mr Lu returning to surgery was not conduct 
likely to destroy or seriously damage the employment relationship.  

 

130.	  There is, in my judgment, no realistic criticism that can be made of the Trust’s action 
 
between August 2012 and March 2013. There were a number of meetings with Mr Lu
--------

Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
and his representatives. The Trust also arranged to meet with the colleagues that Mr 
Lu  would  be  working  with  on  his  resumption  of  duties.  The  Trust  recognises  that, 
with hindsight, they should not have let Mr Lu assume the task of drafting the re-entry 
 
programme. But, in my judgment, the Trust made it clear relatively quickly that the 
 
person responsible for the re-entry programme would have to be an accredited trainer 
not  Mr  Naik.  Thereafter,  the  Trust  identified  the  relevant  person,  Mr  Richens,  and 
began  the  task  of  preparing  a  communication  strategy.  The  Trust  deferred  the 
commencement  of  the  re-entry  programme  in  order  to  enable  work  to  continue  on 
that.  They  deferred  re-entry  for  a  short  time  given  the  imminent  publication  of  the 
Francis Report, in the circumstances described above. In my judgment, the steps the 
Trust took were, viewed objectively, eminently reasonable in the circumstances and 
did not involved a breach of any express or implied contractual term.  

 

 

 

131.	  On 21 March 2013 Mr Lu refused to agree the appointment of Mr Richens. He did not 
agree to Mr Richens’ appointment until 22 May 2013. In my judgment, any delay in 
this period was due to Mr Lu’s unduly rigid and inflexible desire to have the re-entry 
 
programme based on Mr Naik being the person responsible for facilitating his re-entry 
programme. There is no basis for attributing any blame to the Trust for this period. 
There is no basis for any finding of a breach of contract in relation to the period 21 
 
March 2013 to 22 May 2013. 

 

 

132.	  Thereafter, Mr Richens prepared a draft re-entry programme. That took a little time. 
But it was sent to Mr Lu on 17 September 2013. The aim was to meet with Mr Lu on 
or  about  1  October  2013,  then  receive  written  comments,  and  then  have  a  final 
meeting on or around 15 October 2013. Mr Lu, however, spent more time considering 
matters with his advisers. In the event, he did not meet to discuss the draft re-entry 
 
programme  but  issued  proceedings  on  19  November  2013.  In  my  judgment,  it  was 
appropriate for the Trust to ensure that the draft re-entry programme covered all the 
relevant  areas  and  was  in  a  position  where  it  could  be  the  subject  of  meaningful 
discussion. The Trust did not act in breach of its express contractual obligations and it 
did not act in a way which was likely to destroy or seriously damage the trust and 
confidence necessary for a continuation of the employment relationship in the time it 
took  between  22  May  and  17  September  2013  in  preparing  the  draft  re-entry 
programme. 

 

133.	  Mr  Sutton,  on  behalf  of  Mr  Lu,  invited  me  to  accept  the  characterisation  of  the 
process  in  paragraph  228  of  the  witness  statement  of  Mr  Lu.  Mr  Lu  says  that  it 
appears to him that every time a committee or individual investigates the position and 
recommends a return to surgery, the Trust’s response is to set up another committee. 
In my judgment, Mr Lu does not accurately reflect and does not properly characterise 
the situation. The situation here is, as the Trust has said, uniquely challenging. Five 
patients had died and six others were infected with PVE. It is inevitable, given the 
concerns for patient safety, that an SUI report would need to be obtained. NCAS, the 
 
Trust  and  Mr  Lu  agreed  that  there  needed  to  be  further  independent  advice  which 
came  in  the  form  of  the  report  from  Professor  Finch.  Thereafter,  the  Trust  had  to 
consider the SUI report, Professor Finch’s report and the views of the experts. They 
 
did  so  properly  first  in  a  special  sub-committee,  the  QuAC,  established  for  that 
purpose. That committee reported to the Trust Board which was the proper body to
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 
take  a  decision  on  behalf  of  the  Trust.  That  Board  took  its  decision  on  30  August 
2012. Since that date, the Trust has been seeking to implement that decision. In so 
doing, in my judgment, the Trust has not breached any express or implied term of Mr 
 
Lu’s contract of employment. 

 
134.	 

I add one further observation. Both parties were anxious to stress that their primary 
concern was to seek to work together to facilitate Mr Lu’s return to surgery. Mr Lu 
 
has affirmed the contract of employment. Damages, although claimed, appear not to 
be an issue as Mr Lu has received full salary throughout this period and no other loss 
has  been  identified.  The  parties  recognised  that  retrospective  analysis  of  alleged 
periods  of  delay  would  not  assist  the  parties  in  their  primary  aim  of  facilitating  a 
return to surgical duties. Both parties insisted, however, that the allegations of delay 
 
giving rise to a breach of contract had to be ruled upon. I have done so and I find that 
the matters alleged to amount to delay do not amount to a breach of any express or 
implied  term  of  the  contract  of  employment.  In  my  judgment,  further  analysis,  and 
further recriminations, over the details of each and every step taken, or not taken, over 
the past 4 and ½ years would serve no useful purpose.  

THE FIFTH ISSUE – THE PROCEDURES 
 

 

135.	  The fifth issue concerns a series of alleged failures to consult Mr Lu or enable him to 
participate in the process or to consult NCAS or others. I have set out the principal 
factual  events  above.  I  have  considered  in  detail  all  the  other  material  and  all  the 
evidence put forward by all of the parties. I am satisfied that Mr Lu has been given 
every opportunity to participate in all the steps taken to deal with the investigation of 
the outbreak and the question of how Mr Lu’s return to surgery can be facilitated. Mr 
Lu  was  able  to  give  his  own  evidence  to  the  SUI  panel,  Professor  Finch  and  the 
QuAC.  He  was  able  to  commission  expert  evidence  from  Professor  Eykyn.  There 
have been numerous meetings between Mr Lu and representatives, at all levels, of the 
Trust dealing with all the principal issues. Even now, the Trust are seeking to involve 
Mr Lu fully in the finalisation of the re-entry programme. They provided him with a 
draft,  they  arranged  meetings  to  discuss  and  provided  an  opportunity  for  him  to 
 
comment  in  writing,  they  deferred  matters  to  allow  him  to  take  legal  advice.  Even 
though  he  commenced  legal  action  instead,  the  Trust  has  made  it  clear  that  the 
opportunity  remains  for  Mr  Lu  to  comment  on  the  draft  re-entry  programme.  The 
 
Trust, in my judgment, has acted fairly as required by the terms of its contract. 

 

136.	  The second procedural concern relates to the task and finish group. Mr Lu does not 
 
object in principle to the existence of such a group. In my judgment, Mr Lu is correct 
to accept that there needs to be a task and finish group. The Trust Board has decided 
that there should be a transitional return to full duties. That will involve ensuring that 
its  decision  is  implemented.  There  can  be  no  objection  to  a  body  charged  with 
ensuring  that.  The  existence  of  such  a  body  is  also  fully  compatible  with  the 
Procedure.  It  is  part  of  the  process  of  seeing  if  the  issues  can  be  resolved  by  local 
action as envisaged by section 6.4.2. In this case, it is part of the machinery of taking 
local  action  in  the  form  of  ensuring  implementation  of  the  decision  of  the  Trust 
Board.
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 

 
 
137.	  Mr Lu’s objections are firstly to the description of the task and finish group in the 
subsection  in  section  3,  headed  assessment,  of  the  draft  re-entry  programme.  That 
draft says that the determination to allow Mr Lu to progress through each stage of the 
programme and the decision to permit Mr Lu to return to full practice rests with the 
task and finish group. In my judgment, the concerns raised by Mr Lu would have been 
far better raised directly with the Trust at a meeting rather than by the institution of 
 
legal proceedings. There is a real danger that this court is being asked by Mr Lu to 
micro-manage not just the employment relationship but the drafts of programmes that 
should  properly  be  the  subject  of  discussion  by  the  parties.  As  I  understand  the 
 
position of the Trust from the evidence given, the Trust Board has decided that Mr Lu 
can  undertake  a  transitional  return  to  full  duties  subject  to  his  agreement  and 
compliance  with  recommendations  of  Professor  Finch.  The  transition  necessarily 
needs to be done on the basis of a re-entry programme and the Trust and Mr Lu agree 
on that. The draft programme is based on the methods of assessment contained within 
 
it  and  the  Assignment  Director  will  determine    Mr  Lu’s  progress  and  certify 
satisfactory completion. There will also be an external reviewer. The task and finish 
group will ensure that the Assignment Director and external reviewer have completed 
 
their tasks. It is not, as I understand it, intended that there be any substantive decision 
by  the  task  and  finish  group  as  to  whether  or  not  Mr  Lu  has  satisfied  the  re-entry 
programme.  The process that is arranged will not in my judgment involve any failure 
 
to  implement  the  decision  of  the  Trust  Board  or  any  pre-empting  of  any  capability 
hearing  should  such  a  hearing  prove  necessary  in  future.  There  is  no  basis  for 
concluding on the evidence before me that the Trust is acting in a way that breaches 
any express contractual term and there is no evidence that it is acting in a way likely 
to destroy or seriously damage trust and confidence. 

 

138.	  Mr Lu also objects to the presence of Dr Fowlie, Dr Homa and Mr Mortimer on the 
task and finish group. He says that Dr Fowlie and Mr Mortimer agreed that they could 
not  perform  the  role  of  case  manager  under  the  Procedure  because  their  prior 
involvement gave rise to a perception of bias. He says that that means they should not 
be part of the group taking the decision on progression and return to work. As I have 
indicated, Mr Lu’s view appears to be based on the view that the task and finish group 
will decide whether or not he can return to surgery. On the evidence before me, that is 
 
a  misunderstanding  of  the  position.  The  Trust  Board  has  already  decided  that  he 
should undertake a transition to full duties. There will be a re-entry programme as all 
agree that Mr Lu must demonstrate certain competencies. That will be assessed by the 
Assignment  Director  and  validated  by  the  external  reviewer.  The  task  and  finish 
group will confirm that that task has been completed. There is no basis for objecting 
to  the  presence  of  the  Medical  Director,  the  Chief  Executive  and  the  Director  of 
Human Resources on the committee charged with confirming that the Trust Board’s 
 
decision has been implemented.  

 
THE SIXTH ISSUE – THE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 

 

139.	  The complaints about the communication strategy have not played a large part in this 
hearing  and  it  would  not  be  sensible  to  lengthen  this  judgment  unnecessarily  by  a 
detailed consideration of the issue. Suffice it to say that, on the evidence that I have 
seen, the Trust has been working very sensibly towards a strategy which will inform
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

the potential patients, the public, and other bodies, such as those who refer patients to 
the  Centre,  about  the  return  of  Mr  Lu  to  surgical  duties.  In  my  judgment,  that  is 
 
sensible and does not involve a breach of any express or implied contractual term for 
 
at least the following reasons. First and foremost, patients and potential patients who 
may  learn  about  Mr  Lu’s  return  to  work  need  to  be  reassured  that  that  creates  no 
unacceptable risk and that the arrangements for re-integration are robust. Given the 
severity of the 2008 and 2009 outbreak, and the deaths that followed, that is sensible. 
Secondly, the families of those who died and those who were infected but survived 
 
also  have  an  interest  in  knowing  that  Mr  Lu  is  to  return  to  surgery  and  the 
circumstances  in  which  that  is  to  take  place.  Thirdly,  it  is  sensible  from  Mr  Lu’s 
 
perspective.  His  return  to  surgical  duties,  given  the  circumstances  of  the  outbreak, 
may be expected to generate media and public interest. It is better that the Trust is 
prepared to deal, so far as it can, with such interest. Fourthly, those who refer patients 
to the Centre, or who have other connections with it, may legitimately have an interest 
 
in Mr Lu’s return to work. 

 

140.	  Furthermore, from the evidence that I have seen, Mr Lu has been fully informed and 
been  able  to  participate  in  the  discussions  relating  to  the  development  of  the 
communications strategy. Ultimately, the communication strategy is a matter for the 
 
Trust to determine. It must take responsibility for explaining its decision to allow Mr 
Lu  to  undertake  a  transition  to  full  duties  subject  to  compliance  with  the 
 
recommendations of Professor Finch. I am satisfied, however, that Mr Lu has been 
given appropriate opportunities to express any views that he may have on the matter. 

 

 

141.	  Finally, I was informed at the hearing by counsel for the parties that the likelihood is 
that the parties would, in fact, be agreed on the appropriate communications strategy.  

 
142.	 

In the circumstances, given the evidence before me, there is no basis for finding any 
breach  of  contract  in  relation  to  the  development  of  the  communication  strategy. 
There  is  no  basis  for  granting  any  of  the  declaratory  or  injunctive  relief  sought  in 
relation to the development or adoption of the communications strategy. 

 
THE SEVENTH ISSUE – PATIENT CONSENT 

 

 

 
143.	  The seventh issue concerns the question of the information that should be provided to 
 
patients undertaking cardiac surgery in order to obtain their informed consent to such 
surgery.  It is common ground that patients will be informed about the general risks 
involved  in  such  surgery,  including,  in  the  case  of  heart  valve  surgery,  the  risks 
associated with PVE. The issue is a narrower one. The substantive question in broad 
terms  is  whether  Mr  Lu’s  historical  association  and  role  in  the  2008  and  2009 
outbreak should be volunteered to patients contemplating cardiac surgery or whether 
it is sufficient if that information is provided in a suitable form to patients who raise 
that question with the responsible clinician. 

 

144.	  This question, in my judgment, needs to be considered from the perspective of (1) the 
Trust  as  employer  of  Mr  Lu  (2)  individual  consultants  who  are  responsible  for
--------
MR JUSTICE LEWIS 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

patients and in whose surgery Mr Lu will assist and (3) Mr Lu when he ultimately 
returns to independent practice and he is the responsible consultant cardiac surgeon 
for individual patients. 

 

145.	  The starting point is the decision of the Trust Board on 30 August 2012. The Board 
accepted that Mr Lu presented no greater risk than any other surgeon as explained in 
paragraphs  89-90  above.  The  Trust  Board  did  not  impose  any  requirement  that  Mr 
Lu’s re-entry programme be conditional upon the surgeon whom Mr Lu is assisting 
during the re-entry programme providing to their patients any information additional 
to that which they the surgeon considered should be provided in the exercise of the 
surgeon’s clinical judgment. The Trust Board did not seek to lay down conditions as 
 
to  what  Mr  Lu  would  need  to  provide  by  way  of  information  to  patients  when  he 
 
ultimately returned to practice. 

 

146.	  The case manager has, however, consistently made it clear since December 2012 that, 
when obtaining consent from patients undergoing heart valve surgery, Mr Lu would 
have to describe the outbreak in 2008 and 2009 and his involvement in that outbreak. 

 

147.	  The  draft  re-rentry  programme  prepared  by  Mr  Richens  and  sent  to  Mr  Lu  in 
 
September  2013  goes  further.  That  will  require  surgeons  whom  Mr  Lu  is  assisting 
during  the  re-entry  programme  to  provide  their  patients  with  an  information  pack 
 
containing  information  relating  to  the  outbreak  and  Mr  Lu’s  involvement  to  it. 
Furthermore,  that  will  be  required  for  patients  undergoing  heart  valve  surgery  and 
other cardiac surgery such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  In addition, the 
draft re-entry programme envisages that surgeons carrying out coronary artery bypass 
 
graft  surgery  will  require  their  patients  to  take  additional  blood  tests.  Patients 
undergoing  heart  valve  surgery  will  be 
to  undertake  additional 
microbiological  swab  tests  of  the  prosthetic  valve.  Patients  will  need  to  consent  to 
those additional blood and microbiological swab tests. 

required 

 

148.	  Viewed from the perspective of the Trust as employer, there is, in my judgment, no 
basis for requiring the provision of additional information, over and above that which 
the  responsible  consultant  surgeon  considers  should  be  provided,  to  patients 
undergoing either heart valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft surgery during 
Mr Lu’s re-entry period. The Trust Board simply did not require that as part of the 
 
process of Mr Lu undertaking a transition to full duties. Similarly, there is no basis for 
 
requiring  Mr  Lu  to  confirm  that  when  he  returns  to  independent  practice  he  will 
volunteer,  as  part  of  the  consent  process,  information  about  the  outbreak  and  his 
involvement  in  it  which  he,  as  the  responsible  clinician  would  not  consider  was 
necessary information. The Trust Board did not seek to require consultant surgeons to 
require  patients  to  undergo  additional  blood  or  microbiological  tests.  Difficult 
questions arise as to whether a trust, as a corporate body, could require clinicians to 
carry out such tests. Those questions do not, however, arise, in this case. The Trust 
simply, as a matter of fact, has never required the carrying out of the additional tests 
envisaged by the September 2103 draft re-entry programme.

MR JUSTICE LEWIS

149.	 

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 

In those circumstances, and viewed purely from the Trust’s perspective as employer, 
there would be a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence if those 
responsible for implementing the Trust Board decision insisted on surgeons or Mr Lu 
 
providing  information  additional  to  that  which  they  considered  necessary  and 
 
appropriate to the patient in order to obtain the patient’s consent to surgery. Requiring 
the provision of that additional information as part of the process of obtaining patient 
consent to surgery would run counter to the Trust Board decision of 30 August 2012. 
It would be likely, in my judgment, to destroy or seriously damage the employment 
relationship.  Instead  of  the  decision  of  the  employer  of  30  August  2012  being 
implemented, additional conditions would have been added. To that extent therefore, 
the insistence by the case manager or other Trust officers that Mr Lu agree to provide 
information to patients about the outbreak even if he did not, clinically, consider it 
necessary  to  do  so  would  be  a  breach  of  the  implied  term  of  trust  and  confidence. 
Similarly,  including  as  a  requirement  of  the  re-entry  programme,  that  surgeons 
provide additional information to patients about the outbreak, and that their patients 
undergo  additional  procedures  by  way  of  additional  blood  or  microbiological  tests, 
even  if  the  surgeons  did  not,  clinically,  consider  it  necessary  to  do  so,  would  be  a 
breach of the implied term of trust and confidence. 

 
150.	 

I  make  it  clear  that  this  judgment  is  not  dealing  with  the  position  of  individual 
clinicians such as the consultant cardiac surgeons who will be responsible for patients 
during the re-entry programme and whom Mr Lu will be assisting in the care of such 
 
patients. Individual clinicians owe a legal duty to a patient to warn the patient of a 
 
significant risk which would affect the judgment of a reasonable patient in the way 
that  is  described  above.  Individual  clinicians  will  therefore  have  to  determine  what 
 
information,  in  respect  of  which  types  of  surgery,  they  should  provide  to  their 
patients.  This  judgment  does  not,  and  is  not  intended  to,  influence  the  exercise  of 
clinical  judgment  by  any  surgeon  during  the  re-entry  programme  as  to  what 
information should be provided as part of the process of obtaining patients’ consent to 
surgery. 

 

151.	  Mr  Sutton,  for  Mr  Lu,  sought  to  persuade  me  that  any  surgeon  participating  in  Mr 
 
Lu’s re-entry programme would be conducting an employment process on behalf of 
the  Trust  as  Mr  Lu’s  employer.  He  submitted  that  if  they  provided  additional 
information  on  the  outbreak  that  would  amount  to  a  breach  of  the  implied  term  of 
 
trust and confidence. In my judgment, that is not correct. The surgeons are employees 
but they are also carrying out surgery on patients for whom they are responsible. They 
each owe a legal duty to their patients. They will be responsible for determining what 
information should be provided to their patients to obtain their consent to the surgery 
to be performed. It is not correct to say that the way they carry out their own legal 
duties owed as surgeons in respect of their own patients is constrained or affected by 
 
the fact that they may agree to allow Mr Lu to participate in the surgery. I recognise 
that  this  may  well  lead  to  practical  difficulties.  Different  surgeons,  including  Mr 
Richens, may (or may not) take a different view of risk from the Trust Board. Any 
future  difficulties  cannot,  however,  be  resolved  in  the  context  of  the  current 
proceedings.
--------

Lu v Nottingham University Hospitals 

 

 

 
 
152.	  Finally, the claim raises the position of Mr Lu. The legal principles governing what is 
necessary to obtain informed consent are agreed and are summarised above. There is 
no dispute as to those principles. If Mr Lu returns to independent practice, Mr Lu will 
need to fulfil his legal duties. He has made it clear that he fully intends to do so. The 
 
Trust  Board  has  not  required  him  to  do  more  than  fulfil  his  legal  duties.  So  far  as 
Trust officers seek to impose additional requirements upon him, there is no basis for 
doing so. 

 
OVERVIEW 

 
153.	 

 
154.	 

 
In terms of the pleadings, and the relief sought, the position is as follows. There is, in 
my  judgment,  no  breach  of  contract  in  connection  with  the  issues  of  delay,  the  re­
entry programme or the communication strategy as alleged in paragraphs 88(i), (ii), 
(iii), (vi) (vii) and (viii) of the particulars of claim. Consequently, no question of any 
declaratory or injunctive relief arises in relation to those matters. 

In relation to the process of obtaining patient consent, it would, in my judgment, be a 
 
breach of contract to impose additional requirements on Mr Lu, when he ultimately 
returns to independent practice, to provide information additional to that which, in his 
clinical  judgment,  is  required  to  obtain  a  patient’s  informed  consent  to  proposed 
surgery.  I  make  it  clear  again  that  this  judgment  does  not,  and  is  not  intended  to, 
influence the different and separate question of the exercise of clinical judgment by 
any  surgeon  during  the  re-entry  programme  as  to  what  information  should  be 
provided. My provisional view is that declaratory relief in relation to these issues is 
 
unnecessary, and injunctive relief inappropriate as this judgment sets out the relevant 
legal  position  but  I  will,  if  necessary,  hear  further  argument  on  the  question  of 
remedy. The declaratory relief sought at paragraph 93 and 94(iii) of the particulars of 
claim, in particular, do not appear to be appropriate. The Trust’s counterclaim for the 
declarations  in  paragraph  106  of  the  defence  and  counterclaim,  that  the  consent 
process set out in appendices 3 and 4 to the draft re-entry programme provided on 17 
September  2013  are  lawful  and  that  Mr  Lu  must  volunteer  to  all  and  any  future 
patients  details  of  his  connection  with  the  2008  and  2009  outbreak  in  the  terms 
specified in those appendices, cannot be sustained in the light of this judgment.  

 

155.	  For completeness, I note that a large number of documents were adduced in evidence 
and  I  received  evidence  on  a  large  number  of  matters.  A  number  of  points  were 
referred  to  by  counsel  in  their  skeleton  arguments,  oral  submissions  and  closing 
 
submissions.  I  have  sought  in this  judgment  to  deal  with  what  I  consider  to  be  the 
 
principal points raised, and the principal evidence relating to those matters. Mr Lu and 
the Trust can be assured however, that I have carefully considered all the other points 
and all the evidence given and all the documents relied upon.  

CONCLUSION 
 

 

156.	  As indicated above, on 30 August 2012 the Trust decided in August 2012 that Mr Lu 
could  commence  a  return  to  surgical  practice  subject  to  certain  conditions.  Those
--------

conditions concern ensuring that there is a re-entry programme to enable Mr Lu to 
resume surgical duties after a period of absence and to demonstrate that he continues 
 
to possess the competencies and skills necessary for the practice of cardiac surgery. 
 
This  claim  concerns  the  arrangements  relating  to  his  return  to  surgery  and,  in 
particular, whether or not certain requirements of the Trust amount to a breach of any 
 
express or implied term in Mr Lu’s contract of employment.  

In summary, and for the reasons set out in detail above, the approach of the Trust to 
the draft re-entry programme proposed in September 2013 is appropriate in terms of 
the  aims,  the  description  of  the  relevant  competencies  and  arrangements  for 
assessment  and  do  not  involve  any  breach  of  contract  on  the  part  of  the  Trust.  In 
particular, the Trust did not agree or approve the re-entry programme proposed by Mr 
Lu in September 2012. The Trust has not unreasonably delayed the return of Mr Lu to 
 
surgical duties and the fact that there has been considerable time taken in seeking to 
 
achieve a satisfactory return to surgical duties by Mr Lu does not involve any breach 
of  any  contractual  term.  The  relevant  procedures  have  been  followed  correctly  and 
fairly.  The  steps  taken  by  the  Trust  in  relation  to  the  preparation  of  a  proposed 
 
communication  strategy  to  inform  the  public  and  others  of  Mr  Lu’s  resumption  to 
strategy are appropriate and do not involve any breach of contract.  

 

In terms of the information to be provided to patients in respect of proposed surgical 
treatment, the responsible individual surgeon owes a legal duty to inform a patient of 
 
any  significant  risks  involved  in  the  procedure,  that  is,  any  significant  risk  which 
would affect the judgement of a reasonable patient so that the patient can determine 
whether to proceed with the treatment. The Trust, as employer, considers that Mr Lu 
 
presents no greater risk of infection than any other cardiac surgeon and there is no 
requirement,  from  the  employer’s  perspective,  to  require  any  individual  surgeon  or 
clinician to provide additional information over and above that which the individual 
clinician  considers,  in  the  exercise  of  his  clinical  judgment,  should  be  provided  to 
enable  the  patient  to  give  informed  consent  to  any  proposed  surgery.  Individual 
 
surgeons and clinicians will therefore have to determine what information, in respect 
of which types of surgery, they can or should provide to their patients. This judgment 
does not, and is not intended to, influence the exercise of clinical judgment by any 
surgeon as to what information should be provided to patients.

The court ordered these six appeals and applications to be heard together so that it 
could review whether the guidance given in R v Povey [2008] EWCA Crim 1261 by 
Sir  Igor  Judge  CJ  (as  he  then  was)  was  being  followed  and  applied,  and  so  that  it 
could decide whether any further guidance was required.  We are very grateful to the 
Ministry of Justice and Mr John Price QC for the very considerable assistance they 
have given in obtaining the information to enable us to do this. 

The offences

3.	 

The  principal  offences  in  relation  to  offensive  weapons  are  those  under  s.1  of  the 
Prevention of Crime Act 1953 (as amended) (the 1953 Act) and s.139 and s.139A of 
the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (CJA 1988). 

In addition on 3 December 2012 amendments to the 1953 Act to add s.1A and to the 
CJA 1988 to add s.139AA came into force.  S.139AA of the CJA 1988 provides for a 
mandatory  minimum  sentence  on  those  over  18  of  six  months  imprisonment  (save 
 
where it was unjust to do so) for using a knife to threaten in a public place or school. 
Provision is also made for a similar minimum sentence of four months for those aged 
16  and  17.  S.1A  of  the  1953  Act  makes  broadly  similar  provision  in  relation  to 
offensive weapons. 

 

The guidance in R v Povey 

In R v Povey, Sir Igor Judge made clear the dangers caused by carrying knives and the 
escalation  that  had  occurred  in  the  number  of  offences  involving  knives  and  in 
particular  the  carrying  of  knives  in  public  places.    He  made  clear  that  sentences 
passed  by  courts  must  focus  on  the  reduction  of  crime,  including  its  reduction  by 
deterrence and the protection of the public.  This court in further judgments and the 
subsequent  guidelines  issued  by  the  Sentencing  Council  have  made  clear  the 
seriousness  with  which  the  use  of  a  knife  or  similar  weapon  in  any  crime  must  be 
treated. 

It is evident, from appeals before this court from the Crown Court and in the appeals 
before us, that in the Crown Court the guidance given by Sir Igor Judge and repeated 
by him in other cases is being followed.  No further guidance is required. 

However  for  offences  that  either  do  not  come  to  court  where  cautions  are 
administered or are dealt with in the Magistrates’ Court and Youth Court, the position 
is more complex, particularly in relation to those between 10 and 15 and those aged 
16 and 17. 

This  is  illustrated  by  some  of  the  matters  that  arose  in  the  appeals  before  us.    For 
example,  a  caution  was  given  to  one  of  the  appellants  (Gomes  Monteiro)  for 
 
possession  of  a  flick  knife  at  a  school  when  he  was  15  –  see  paragraph  31  below. 
 
Another  appellant  (RAB)  had  at  the  age  of  14  received  in  accordance  with  the 

 
4.	 

 
5.	 

 
6.	 

 
7.
--------
statutory regime a nine month referral order for possession of a lock knife in a public 
street – see paragraph 84 below.  A co-defendant of another appellant (Smith) who 
was nine months younger than Smith had received a youth supervision order for the 
offence  for  which  Smith  received  a  sentence  of  30  months  imprisonment    -  see 
 
paragraphs 56 to 59 below.  A Magistrates’ court had imposed a community order on 
 
another appellant (Varey) for a second offence of carrying a knife whilst stealing from 
 
shops - see paragraphs 66 and following below. 

 
8.	 

We therefore asked for information about the way in which the police, the Magistrates 
and  the  Youth  Court  approached  the  imposition  of  cautions  and  sentencing 
respectively. 

ACPO Guidance on the use of cautions 

 
9.	 

Cautions  in  relation  to  knife  crimes  are  issued  by  the  police  in  accordance  with 
Guidelines issued by ACPO entitled Guidelines on the investigating, cautioning and 
charging of Knife Crime Offences issued in July 2009.  It states: 

“The starting point for police will be an expectation to charge 
16  and  17  year  olds 
there  are  exceptional 
circumstances) in all cases. 

(unless 

In the case of any young person aged 15 or under in the cases 
of  simple  possession  with  no  aggravating  factors,  the  starting 
point will be the issuing of a warning” 

 
10.	 

Account is also taken of the ACPO Youth Offender Case Disposal Gravity Matrix;  its 
guidance is: 

“It is recommended that forces follow a national agreement to 
interpret Knife-Crime offences as follows: 

The first arrest of a youth under 16 for simple possession of an 
Offensive Weapon or Sharp Pointed Blade, with no aggravating 
factors, will result in the first instance with a youth conditional 
caution.  This  must  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  YOT 
intervention,  preferably  with  elements  focussed  on  anti-knife 
crime  education.  A  youth  aged  16  or  over  will  normally  be 
charged. 

The second arrest of a youth under 16 for simple possession of 
an  Offensive  Weapon  or  Sharp  Pointed  Blade  will  result  in  a 
charge  (unless,  in  exceptional  circumstances,  2  years  have 
passed  and  it  is  considered  appropriate  to  give  another  youth 
conditional caution).
--------
11.	 

The first arrest of a youth of any age for simple possession of 
an Offensive Weapon or Sharp Pointed Blade, with aggravating 
factors, will result in the first instance with a charge.”  

The most recent version of this matrix was issued in March 2013.  It is essentially 
unchanged  (save  to  make  reference  to  youth  conditional  cautions  in  place  of 
warnings).  It makes clear, however, that an offence under s.139A or s.139AA of the 
 
CJA  1988  or  under  s.1A  of  the  1953  Act  committed  by  a  youth  aged  16  or  over 
should normally result in a charge and should not be dealt with by an out of court 
disposal. 

The Magistrates Courts and the Youth Court 

 
12.	 

 
13.	 

 

The Guidance for Magistrates was revised in August 2008.  Although that Guidance 
referred to the earlier decision which R v Povey followed, the timing meant Povey had 
not been handed down and the original guidance did not refer to the increase in knife 
crime  as  set  out  by  Sir  Igor  Judge  in  that  judgment.  However,  the  Sentencing 
Guidelines  Council  issued  a  Note  (with  effect  from  4  August  2008)  headed 
“Sentencing for possession of a weapon – knife crime”, which specifically sets out the 
effect  of  the  decision  in  Povey  on  the  guideline.  It  is  therefore  essential  that 
Magistrates’ Courts strictly apply the guideline as explained in this Note  in relation to 
 
knife crime and the starting point of 12 weeks custody for the lowest level of offence 
 
involving the use of knives. 

In  the  Youth  Court  the  principles  are  set  out  in  the  Guideline  of  the  Sentencing 
Guidelines  Council  dated  November  2009  entitled:  “Overarching  Principles: 
Sentencing Youths”.  There are also a number of statutory restrictions; for example a 
 
first time offender under 15 who pleads guilty to one of the offences relating to knives 
 
or  offensive  weapons  can  only  be  made  subject  to  a  referral  order  (as  we  have 
 
mentioned at paragraph 7 above). 

The statistics 

 
14.	 

In the first nine months of 2013 there were 12,132 offences under s.1 of the 1953 Act 
and s.139 and s.139A of the CJA 1988 Act.  18% resulted in a caution, 28% resulted 
in  immediate  custody.    The  results  have  been  broadly  consistent  for  the  past  5 
quarters; the 28% of cases resulting in custody can be seen as an increase from 18% 
 
current before Povey, whereas the number of cautions is falling.  

 

 
15.	 

813 offences were committed by those between 10 and 15.  43% were given a police 
caution and 47% a community sentence.  Only 4% were given an immediate custodial 
sentence.
--------
16.	  We were provided with statistics for 2013 that showed that out of the 89 over 18s who 
had pleaded guilty or been convicted of offences under s.139AA of the CJA 1988 or 
s.1A  of  the  1953  Act,  49  had  been  given  sentences  of  immediate  custody;  3  had 
received a caution; 7 community service and 19 a suspended sentence.  Three were 
 
18, 16 and 17 year olds; 10 had been sent to immediate custody. 

Conclusion 

 
17.	 

 
18.	 

As  we  have  stated,  no  further  guidance  is  needed  in  relation  to  the  Crown  Court 
 
pending the issue of a guideline by the Sentencing Council.  However there are two 
observations we make. 

 

First, it is important that the Youth Court plays the closest attention to the guidance 
given in Povey.  Given the prevalence of knife crime among young persons, the Youth 
Court  must  keep  a  very  sharp  focus,  if  necessary  through  the  use  of  more  severe 
 
sentences,  on  preventing  further  offending  by  anyone  apprehended  for  carrying  a 
knife in a public place and to securing a reduction in the carrying of knives.  Such 
sentences fulfil the principles applicable to the sentencing of such persons as set out in 
s.142A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Sentencing Council Guidelines.  The 
 
appeals of NT and RAB illustrate the very serious consequences that can follow from 
the carrying of knives by young persons and why it is of great importance that the 
Youth Court maintains the sharp focus called for in Povey by imposing appropriate 
 
sentences  that  will  contribute  to  preventing  further  offending  and  to  a  reduction  in 
knife crime. 

 
19.	 

Second, it is important particularly in relation to knife crime that the guidance given 
in respect of cautions is aligned to the sentencing practice (as it should be in the light 
of our observation) in the Youth Court, the Magistrates’ Court and the Crown Court. 
 
There is an urgent need for this to be done. 

20.	  We turn to the six cases. 
 

 

JURANIR SILVETERE GOMES-MONTEIRO 

The background 

On 27 October 2012 there was a party to celebrate a birthday in Hackney.  Many of 
those who attended were of the Guinea Bissau community in London.  Amongst those 
 
was Jason Dos Santos. 

Through various social networking sites others who had not been invited came to the 
party.  Some  belonged  to  a  gang  called  “the  Portuguese  Mafia”.    At  the  party, 
probably as a result of a previous incident at an earlier party, members of the gang set 

 
21.	 

 
22.
--------
23.	 

about  one  of  the  others.  There  was  a  serious  and  violent  fight  within  the  house 
between a number on both sides.  Knives were used and at least one was seriously 
stabbed.  Jason  Dos  Santos  escaped  from  the  house,  most  likely  through  the  back 
garden, and ran down the street with others, being pursued by members of the gang. 
 
He was caught by eight members of the gang who attacked him with at least one knife 
and  a  belt,  kicked  and  punched  him.  He  received  serious  injuries  which  we  shall 
 
describe.  The incident was caught on CCTV. 

A woollen hat belonging to the appellant, then aged 18, was recovered from the scene 
of the stabbing.  Of all the participants in this serious violence he was the only one to 
be arrested and tried.  On 17 May 2013 at the Crown Court at Snaresbrook before Mr 
Recorder Holborn and a jury he was convicted of wounding with intent contrary to 
s.18  of  the  Offences  against  the  Person  Act  1861  (the  1861  Act)  and  having  an 
offensive weapon.  He was subsequently sentenced by the judge on 21 June 2013 to 
nine years detention in a young offender institution for the offence contrary to s.18 of 
the 1861 Act with a concurrent sentence of one year for having an offensive weapon. 
 
He appeals against sentence by leave of the Single Judge. 

The seriousness of the offence 

 

24.	  We consider first the seriousness of the offence.  The judge found that the appellant, 
although he might not have been a member of the Portuguese Mafia gang, had joined 
in with that gang on that night at the party and involved himself in the culture of that 
 
gang.  It is clear that he had had a substantial quantity of drink.  He then joined in the 
pursuit of Jason Dos Santos down the road. 

 
25.	 

It  is  common  ground  on  the  appeal  that  the  appellant  approached  the  scene  of  the 
attack  approximately  30  seconds  after  the  main  group  chased  the  victim  along  the 
street.  It is clear on the judge’s finding and the jury’s verdict that he joined in the 
attack at that stage whilst another gang member stabbed Jason Dos Santos and others 
 
subjected  him  to  a  vicious  and  brutal  beating.    The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the 
appellant  used  a  belt  in  the  attack  on  Jason  Dos  Santos  and  stamped  on  him.   The 
judge was satisfied that the jury convicted  the appellant on a joint enterprise basis 
because, apart from using the belt and stamping on Jason Dos Santos, he was fully 
aware that Jason Dos Santos was being stabbed.   

 
26.	 

It has been submitted that those findings are open to criticism.  We cannot see any 
basis for criticising them.  The judge found first that he was a, but not the, leading 
member of the group that attacked Jason Dos Santos; second that he most certainly 
did not have a subordinate role in the attack.  We again do not see how those findings 
can be criticised given the fact that the judge heard the evidence at the trial.
--------
The harm caused 

 

27.	  We next turn to the harm caused.  The judge obtained for the purposes of sentencing 
 
statements from the doctors at the hospital about the injuries sustained by Jason Dos 
Santos.  He also had statements from two police officers who had tended him at the 
scene and taken him to the hospital.  We see no reason to criticise the judge for taking 
 
into account all of that evidence. 

 
28.	 

There were a total of eleven wounds inflicted on Mr Dos Santos, three on the torso 
(one of which was to the chest), six on the legs and two on the scalp.  They required 
stitching in theatre.  They had a lasting physical and emotional effect on him.  One of 
the wounds passed deeply behind the right femur.  He was in hospital for two to three 
days. 
It  is  quite  clear  from  the  statement  of  the  police  officers  that  there  was 
significant  bleeding  at  the  scene  and  on  the  way  to  hospital  and  the  victim  was 
 
veering in and out of consciousness. 

 

29.	  Mr  Dos  Santos  also  made  a  victim  personal  statement  in  which  he  described  the 
longer  term  effect  of  the  attack  on  him;  although  he  had  made  a  good  physical 
recovery (apart from the scarring and difficulty in bending and moving his leg) he did 
not go out to parties and did not trust people. 

The sentence 

 
30.	 

 
31.	 

The  judge  placed  the  offence  into  category  1/category  2  of  the  Guideline;  it  was 
submitted  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the  judge  should  have  concluded  the 
offending  behaviour  fell  within  category  2,  principally  on  the  ground  of  his  lesser 
role;  as  we  have  set  out  we  cannot  accept  this.    This  was,  in  our  view,  an  offence 
within category 1.  A person who has caused the injury of the type caused in this case 
 
and has the culpability of participating in an attack of this type in a leadership role, is 
plainly  within  category  1.  The  use  of  a  knife  in  a  public  street  is  a  very  serious 
aggravating factor. 

The appellant was only 18 both at the time of the attack on Jason Dos Santos and his 
conviction.  Nonetheless he had a caution imposed by the Cambridgeshire Police for 
carrying a flick knife on school premises imposed on 29 March 2010 (when he was 
15) in accordance with the guidance to which we have referred at paragraphs 9 to 11 
above  and  a  conviction  for  common  assault  on  17  January  2012  for  which  he  had 
received  a  referral  order.    We  take  the  view  that  a  previous  conviction  for  the 
possession  of  any  bladed  article,  but  particularly  a  knife  such  as  a  flick  knife,  is  a 
seriously aggravating factor in a subsequent offence involving a knife for the reasons 
we have given. 

 
32. 

The only mitigating factors were his age and his working on a part-time basis whilst 
 
also  engaging  in  full-time  education;  he  spoke  a  number  of  languages.    He  had
--------
33.	 

NT 

obtained eight GCSEs with good grades and had gone on to study art as well as travel 
and tourism. 
 

In  the  light  of  the  factors  we  have  set  out,  particularly  his  use  of  the  belt,  his 
knowledge of the use of the knife in the attack and his previous caution for possession 
of a flick knife, there is no proper ground for criticising the sentence imposed by the 
judge.  The appeal is dismissed. 

The background 

 
34.	 

On the evening of Monday 18 February 2013 KW (the victim) who was then aged 14, 
had been at McDonald’s in Lewisham with friends.  The appellant, who was born on 
10 November 1999 and then aged 13, and another youth, SB, confronted the victim 
wanting a battery for a mobile phone.  Nothing came of that but the victim and his 
friends went to the Ladywell Youth Club to roller skate.  The appellant and his friends 
also went to the same club.   

 

35.	  When  the  youth  club  closed  at  9.15  p.m.  the  youths  congregated  outside.  An 
argument developed between another of the appellant’s friends, TM, and a girl.  TM 
 
turned  on  the  victim.    That  fight  descended  into  insults  and  violence  between  a 
number of those present, including the appellant.  The victim hit back at TM and the 
appellant.  The victim who was still on roller skates, then calmed down and skated a 
 
short distance away.  The appellant ran after him, produced a knife and stabbed the 
victim twice in the chest and abdomen.  The victim described the knife as a fat knife 
with  a  long  blade;  one  witness  described  it  as  2.5  inches  wide,  but  not  that  long. 
 
Another as a kitchen knife.  It was never found.  TM ran off.  The victim collapsed. 
 
He  was  taken  to  hospital  by  helicopter  and  underwent  emergency  surgery.    The 
appellant was interviewed the following day and made no comment on the advice of 
his solicitors. 

 
36.	 

On 2 July 2013 the appellant was convicted at the Crown Court at Woolwich before 
His Honour Judge Moss QC and a jury of attempted murder.  He was subsequently 
sentenced  on  26  July  2013  to  a  13  year  extended  sentence  under  s.226B  of  the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003, comprising a custodial term of ten years and three years 
extended licence.  His application for permission to appeal had been referred to the 
court by the Registrar.  We grant leave.
--------
The seriousness of the offence 

 

37.	  We consider first the seriousness of the offence.  On the jury’s verdict the appellant 
had attempted to kill the victim.  The judge who had had the benefit of hearing the 
evidence found that the appellant had come to the youth club on that evening armed 
with a knife; the judge expressly rejected the applicant’s evidence that he had been 
given a knife at the scene. 

The harm caused 

 
38.	 

It is clear that the harm was of a very serious level.  The wound was so deep that the 
knife entered through the chest and penetrated the kidney.  He was found to have a 
 
collapsed lung, a penetrating gastric injury, a shattered spleen and very serious renal 
injury.  He underwent emergency surgery, including the removal of the spleen.  He 
 
was in the high dependency unit for two days; his wounds have healed, but he will 
require life-long antibiotic medication.  The judge was satisfied that he was lucky to 
have survived. 

The aggravating and mitigating features 

 
39.	 

An aggravating feature of the case was that the applicant, despite the fact that he was 
then only 13, had a number of previous convictions. 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

On 7 July 2011 he had been convicted of common assault at the Youth Court 
 
and received a six month referral order.  He had been part of a group that had 
surrounded a 14 year old girl in a park; he was said to have held a knife to her 
throat and demanded her phone.  Although he pleaded guilty to the assault he 
denied possession of a knife. 

On 10 May 2012 he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm 
and received a nine month rehabilitation order.  The case against him was that 
he  had  taken  a  magazine  from  the  victim,  and  then  assaulted  the  victim 
punching him in the face. 

 
iii)	 

On 20 December 2012 he was convicted of disorderly behaviour and received 
a conditional discharge.  He had used threatening and abusive language to a 
bus driver. 

As the judge rightly commented, he had a pattern of offending behaviour that was of 
great concern.
--------
40.	 

It is clear from the pre-sentence report that the applicant had had a difficult home life, 
living first with his mother and then for some years with his father with little contact 
with his mother.  He developed emotional and behavioural difficulties at school and 
 
was transferred to a school to cater for children with those needs.  At that school and 
at the secure children’s home at which he had been placed after his remand for the 
purposes of these proceedings, reports showed his ability to do very well at subjects 
 
but to have serious behavioural problems.  An assessment carried out showed that he 
had  suspected  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  and  Oppositional  Defiant 
 
Disorder;  he  had  then  been  assessed  as  having  moderate  to  high  Attention  Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiance Disorder.  He 
was  being  placed  on  medication.    The  judge  also  had  a  report  from  the  secure 
children’s home. 

 
41.	 

The appellant accepted that he had stabbed the victim.  Although he continued to deny 
that  he  intended  to  cause  serious  injury  or  to  kill  the  victim,  the  writer  of  the  pre-
sentence report accepted that the appellant showed genuine remorse for what he had 
done.  The  writer  of  the  pre-sentence  report  was  nonetheless  of  the  view  that  the 
applicant presented as a high risk of causing serious harm. 

The finding of dangerousness 

 
42.	 

43.	

 

The  judge  concluded  that  he  was  a  youth  who  met  the  dangerousness  criteria  of 
s.226B of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO 
2012).  He  considered  that  an  extended  determinate  sentence  was  the  appropriate 
 
sentence. 

 In R v Burinskas [2014] EWCA Crim 334 this court set out at paragraphs 24-30 the 
main  features  of  the  operation  of  the  provisions  of  LASPO  relating  to  extended 
sentences (s.226A) and at paragraphs 41-44 the approach that a court should follow 
when applying the dangerousness provisions of the Act.  It is not necessary to make 
 
any separate observations in relation to s.226B in relation to this appeal. 

 
44.	 

On  the  appellant’s  behalf  it  has  been  contended  that  the  judge  was  not  entitled  to 
make the finding of dangerousness and should not have done so without obtaining a 
full psychiatric report. 

 

45.	  We were provided with a more recent report from the secure children’s home at which 
the  appellant  was  held.  His  medication  had  been  changed  and  his  behaviour  had 
improved  significantly;  he  had  also  shown  more  commitment  to  his  learning  and 
engagement with the staff; there has been a vast improvement in his school reports. 
He was responding well to the offending behaviour programmes. 

 

 

46.	  We  have  carefully  considered  the  further  material  before  us.    It  does  not  cast  any 
doubt on the basis on which the judge proceeded.  On all the evidence the judge was 
entitled to make a finding of dangerousness.  He had heard the evidence at the trial;
--------
the  pre-sentence  report  and  the  report  from  the  secure  children’s  home  provided 
considerable information about his mental state.  It was not necessary for the judge to 
have a psychiatric report. 

The length of the sentence 

 
47.	 

 
48.	 

 
49.	 

It was also contended that a custodial sentence of ten years was manifestly excessive.   

In Attorney General’s Reference 127 of 2010 [2011] EWCA Crim 760, [2011] Cr App 
R (S) 99 this court, drawing on the Sentencing Guidelines Council’s youth sentencing 
guidance,  set  out  at  paragraph  17  a  guide  to  the  proportion  of  the  sentence  of 
imprisonment  for  an  adult  prisoner  a  sentencing  court  should  impose  when 
 
considering such a sentence for a person of the age 15, 16 and 17, having regard to 
both his chronological age and his maturity.  For a person of 13 that proportion will 
be even lower. 

It seems to us in the light of the further information before us, particularly the effect 
of the medication, his real engagement with the staff at the secure children’s home 
 
and  the  youth  of  the  appellant,  the  custodial  term  of  ten  years  for  a  person  of  the 
appellant’s youth was too long.  We propose therefore to quash the custodial term of 
ten  years,  but  substitute  for  it  a  custodial term  of  seven  years,  leaving  in  place  the 
extension  period.  We  therefore  allow  the  appeal  to  that  extent;  his  sentence  will 
therefore be an extended sentence of ten years, comprising a custodial term of seven 
 
years and an extension period of three years.  

RHYS SMITH 

The background 

On 10 November 2011 the appellant (born on 4 May 1994 and then aged 17) and a 
co-defendant, Willis (born on 9 February 1995 and then aged 16), approached a group 
of young males and females aged about 16 at a bonfire and firework night in a park in 
Rye.  After speaking amicably, Willis and the appellant began shouting and swearing 
at the group, claiming to be from a gang in London.  Willis pulled out a knife and held 
it  to  the  throat  of  one  of  the  young  people.    When  another  of  the  group  of  young 
people  intervened,  Willis  held  the  knife  to  his  throat.    Willis  then  waved  the  knife 
around at the faces of the young group, saying that he was going “to do” all of them. 
  
 
Willis was challenged by one of the group and then backed off shouting and swearing. 

The  appellant  then  asked  Willis  for  the  knife,  took  it  from  him  and  shouted  at  the 
group holding the knife outstretched: “Do you think I’m a prick?”  He then held the 
knife to the face of one of the group saying “Do you think I’m a dickhead? Do you 
not think I will stab all of you including you two girls?”  It was clear that the group of 
 
young persons was very frightened. 

 
50.	 

 
51.
--------
52.	 

The  police  were  called  and  the  appellant  and  Willis  were  detained.    The  knife  had 
been thrown away.  The appellant told the police it was in the bin.  It was a kitchen 
 
 
knife with a serrated blade about four inches long. 

 
53.	 

At  his  interview  the  appellant  gave  a  prepared  statement  saying  he  was  in  drink, 
 
apologising for his behaviour and saying he would not do so again. 

The procedural history: the sentences passed on the appellant and Willis 

 

54.	  Willis and the appellant were bailed to attend the Hastings Magistrates’ Court on 20 
November 2011.  Willis attended and entered a plea of not guilty; the appellant did 
not attend.  A warrant was issued and the matter was adjourned for two weeks to 4 
December 2012.  At the hearing on 4 December 2012 Willis was committed for trial 
at the Youth Court, as the warrant against the appellant had not been executed and 
 
Willis, though only nine months younger than the appellant, was still only 17. 

 
55.	 

On  6  December  2012  the  appellant  was  arrested.    He  was  then  sentenced  at  the 
Canterbury Magistrates’ Court to a period of imprisonment for other matters.  On 20 
December 2012, when he was 18, he pleaded guilty at Hastings Magistrates’ Court to 
possession of a bladed article and was committed for sentence.  On 31 January 2013 
in relation to the events we have described he was sentenced at the Crown Court at 
Lewes  by  His  Honour  Judge  Kemp  to  30  months  detention  at  a  Young  Offender 
 
Institution. 

 

56.	  Willis changed his plea on 23 April 2013 shortly before his trial that had been fixed in 
the Youth Court for 1 May 2013.  He had convictions for malicious damage in 2007, 
robbery  in  2009,  battery  in  2010,  and  racially  aggravated  intentional  harassment  in 
2011.  He was sentenced by the Youth Court at Eastbourne on 4 June 2013 to a Youth 
 
Rehabilitation Order with programme and supervision requirements. 

 

57.	  We asked for enquires to be made as to whether the Youth Court at Eastbourne was 
 
aware  of  the  sentence  passed  on  the  appellant.    There  was  no  record  and  no 
 
recollection that the matter had been drawn to the attention of the Youth Court.  We 
 
infer that it is highly unlikely that the Youth Court was told.  The CPS accepts that it 
was at fault in failing to draw the sentence imposed on the appellant to the attention of 
 
 
the Youth Court.  It has resulted in serious injustice. 

The basis of the appeal 

The appellant had a history of offending behaviour.  In April 2009 he was given a 
 
four month referral order for theft and possession of cannabis.  In March 2010 he was 
given a further six month referral order for battery.  In November 2010 he was given 
an 18 month referral order for theft, but that was revoked in April 2011 when he was 
 
sentenced to a four month detention and training order.  He had further convictions 

 
58.
--------
59.	 

 
60.	 

 
for theft and other dishonesty in 2012.  In September 2012 he was given a conditional 
discharge  by  Magistrates  for  possession  of  a  prohibited  weapon  –  a  device  for  the 
discharge of CS gas.  At the time of sentence he had unpaid fines and other orders 
totalling  £810.10  and  was  subject  to  an  18  month  suspended  sentence;  he  had  not 
complied  with  the  conditions;  he  had  breached  them  twice  and  committed  two 
 
offences during its operation. 

 

The appellant appeals by leave of the Single Judge solely on the grounds of disparity 
with the sentence imposed in the Youth Court on Willis.  He did not seek leave on the 
grounds  that  the  sentence  was  either  wrong  in  principle  or  manifestly  excessive 
viewed  on  its  own,  given  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  and  his  past  offending 
behaviour.  As the Single Judge rightly observed in granting leave to appeal, though 
the sentence was severe, it was not manifestly excessive in the light of the offence and 
 
the previous convictions.  An extension of time was granted by the Single Judge. 

The  sentence  passed  by  the  Youth  Court  is  inexplicable  given  the  gravity  of  the 
 
offence  committed  by  Willis.    He  should  have  received  a  significant  custodial 
sentence  in  the  form  of  a  Detention  and  Training  Order.    The  disparity  in  their 
punishment, even taking into account the more serious prior offending behaviour of 
the appellant and the fact he was older by nine months, was unjust: see the discussion 
at paragraphs 7 and 8 of R v Coleman [2007] EWCA Crim 2318.  Accordingly we 
quash the sentence of 30 months youth custody (though entirely merited) and pass in 
 
its place a sentence of 20 months youth custody.

The background 

In the early afternoon of 3 November 2013 the applicant was shopping at an ASDA 
supermarket.  He was seen to put an item into his pocket, discard the other items and 
 
make to leave.  When he was stopped by security guards, he produced a Stanley knife 
from his pocket and threatened the guards.  They backed away and he ran from the 
 
 
store. 

 

On the following day, 4 November 2013 the applicant entered Millets where he stole 
 
a North Face jacket. 

 

Some  days  later  on  26  November  2013  the  applicant  was  seen  to  be  acting 
suspiciously in Boots.  He was searched and found to be in possession of a Stanley 
 
knife.  He was arrested 

On  12  December  2013  at  the  Crown  Court  at  Bradford  he  pleaded  guilty  to  three 
offences.  He was sentenced by the Recorder of Bradford, His Honour Judge Roger 
Thomas QC, to 15 months imprisonment for threatening with a bladed article on 3

November contrary to s 139AA of the CJA 1988, to six months consecutive for the 
theft on 14 November and to 15 months consecutive for possession of a bladed article 
on 26 November contrary to s.139 of the CJA 1988, making a total of three years.  His 
 
application for leave to appeal was referred to the court by the Registrar. 

The application for leave to appeal 

 
65.	 

The applicant was some 41 years of age.  He had a very lengthy record of previous 
offending commencing in 1994.  The offences were largely theft, but there were also 
offences  of  resisting  arrest  and  breaching  non-custodial  orders.    Much  of  the 
offending was due to his significant drug habit.  It is important to note that in July 
2012 he had been sentenced to six months imprisonment for being in possession of a 
 
craft knife.  In March 2013 he was given a community order for theft from shops and 
being in possession of a craft knife.  He continued to steal from shops.  On 25 October 
 
2013,  shortly  before  the  first  of  the  present  offences,  the  magistrates  had  deferred 
 
sentence on offences of theft until January 2014. 

 
66.	 

Although it was accepted that no complaint could be made for the sentence in respect 
of the offence of threatening with the knife on 13 November 2013, it was contended 
that the sentence for possession of a knife on 26 November 2013 was too long, as he 
had not then threatened anyone with it; that the sentence for theft was too long; that 
 
the sentences in total were too long. 

 

67.	  We do not agree.  The judge rightly identified the gravity of the offences for which 
the appellant was sentenced and the escalation from theft to committing such offences 
as carrying a Stanley knife.  He had been given a short sentence of imprisonment by 
the  Crown  Court  at  Bradford  for  carrying  a  knife  in  July  2012;  he  had  been  given 
another  chance  in  March  2013  when  the  wholly  exceptional  course  was  taken  by 
magistrates  in  giving  him  a  community  order  and  a  drug  rehabilitation  order  for 
possession of a craft knife when stealing.  He had not desisted.  Nor, as the evidence 
from the probation officer made clear, had he cooperated with the probation service. 
A very lengthy sentence was inevitable; the total of three years cannot in any way be 
 
 
criticised.  There is no merit in the application.  It is therefore refused. 

 

HARRY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 

The background 

In the early hours of 15 June 2013 the victim and a friend went to meet the applicant, 
then aged 22, to buy some cocaine.  The victim approached the applicant in his car 
and  handed  him  £40.    The  applicant  did  not  hand  over  any  drugs  but  showed  the 
victim a large knife.  He accused the victim of trying to set him up for a robbery.  He 
 
got  out  of  his  car,  but  did  not  take  the  knife  with  him.    He  assaulted  the  victim, 
punching him numerous times about his face and head and kneeing him in the left 
eye.  The attack caused the victim bruising and swelling to the left eye, bumps to the

71.	 

left side of his head and forehead and a minor cut to his nose.  The applicant then got 
back into the vehicle. 

The  victim,  fearing  that  the  knife  would  be  produced  and  used,  ran  back  to  his 
friend’s car.  The friend drove off.  The applicant who was in drink followed at high 
speed; he had no licence and no insurance.  He rammed the car.  The friend was able 
 
to continue to a police station, although followed by the applicant at high speed most 
of the way. 

On 28 June 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty before the Magistrates to threatening 
with a bladed article in a public place, dangerous driving, theft and assault.  He was 
 
committed to the Crown Court for sentence. 

On 8 August 2013 at the Crown Court at Chelmsford before His Honour Judge Turner 
 
QC, he was sentenced to a total of 21 months imprisonment.  A six month sentence 
was passed for threatening with a bladed article contrary to s.139AA of the CJA 1988 
and  consecutive  sentences  of  12  months,  one  month  and  two  months  respectively 
were passed for dangerous driving, theft and assault.  The Single Judge refused leave 
to appeal.  The applicant renews his application to this court. 

The application for leave to appeal 

 
72.	 

 
73.	 

 
74.	 

Although the applicant was 23 at the time of the sentencing hearing, he had appeared 
before the courts on nine previous occasions largely for drugs offences, but including 
 
one  offence  of  possessing  an  air  gun  in  a  public  place.    In  March  2010  he  was 
 
sentenced to 30 months for robbery and on 13 August 2010 to a consecutive sentence 
 
of  12  months  for  assault  occasioning  actual  bodily  harm.  He  was  on  licence  at  the 
time of these offences.  

Although it was accepted that it was permissible to pass a consecutive sentence for the 
offence  of  dangerous  driving,  it  was  argued  that  it  was  wrong  to  pass  consecutive 
sentences for the other offences; they should have been made concurrent.  

In our view no criticism can properly be made of the total sentence of 21 months.  The 
 
sentence of 12 months for the dangerous driving was entirely justified.  There was no 
 
basis  for  departing  from  the  minimum  sentence  of  six  months  for  the  offence  of 
 
threatening with a bladed article under s.139AA of the CJA 1988.  It would have been 
 
permissible  for  the  judge  to  have  passed  a  longer  sentence  for  the  offence  under 
 
s.139AA  to  reflect  the  theft  and  the  assault,  but  the  way  the  judge  sentenced  the 
 
applicant  made  clear  that  he  received  the  statutory  minimum  for  the  offence  under 
 
s.139AA and received a further three months for the assault and theft.

The application is refused.

The background 

 
76.	 

 
77.	 

 
78.	 

On the afternoon of Wednesday 26 December 2012 two youths bullied a 14 year old 
 
schoolboy who, after leaving the Walworth Academy in his school uniform, was in a 
street near the Old Kent Road.  Others joined in the bullying including the applicant, 
then aged 16, who lashed out at him.  A knife was seen tucked into the waistband of 
 
one of them.  A truancy officer intervened. Before the incident escalated further the 
14 year old ran off and the youths dispersed as they saw a police van.  The 14 year old 
telephoned  a  friend,  Huy  Pham  (18  years  old),  and  told  him  what  had  happened. 
 
Pham told the 14 year old to wait.  Pham then arrived in a motor vehicle driven by 
Ayodele (who was 20) and Chambers (aged 21) as a passenger.  The 14 year old got 
 
into the vehicle.  They drove to an estate in Walworth.   

 

The 14 year old recognised a group of youths standing on a balcony as those who had 
confronted him.  The group included the applicant.  Pham, Chambers and Ayodele 
went up to the balcony and spoke to the group about bullying their 14 year old friend. 
 
They wore hoods and their faces were masked.   

The  applicant  was  unable  to  get  away.  There  was  a  confrontation.    Pham  hit  the 
applicant  with  a  belt  buckle.    Chambers  pushed  the  applicant.  The  applicant  then 
 
produced a knife and stabbed Chambers in the chest, penetrating his heart.  Chambers 
 
collapsed and died.  The applicant then threatened Ayodele with a knife.  Pham tried 
to run away.  The applicant caught him but Pham curled up in an attempt to protect 
himself.  The applicant lent over and stabbed Pham in the leg.  Ayodele then punched 
the applicant who turned and swung the knife, cutting Ayodele’s neck in such a way 
that the wound required five stitches. 

 
79.	 

The applicant was identified from YouTube footage and tried at the Crown Court at 
Southwark before His Honour Judge Pitts and a jury for three offences : 

 
i)	 

The murder of Sean Chambers. 

ii)	  Wounding with intent of Ayodele. 

 

iii)	  Wounding with intent of Pham. 

 

He was acquitted of the murder of Sean Chambers and wounding Ayodele with intent.  
He was convicted of wounding Pham with intent.  It is clear that by the acquittals in 
respect of the count of murder and the s.18 offence in respect of Ayodele, the jury 
accepted the defence of self defence.  The judge sentenced the applicant to six years 
detention under s.91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act; he stated that 
 

 
80.
--------
if the applicant had been over 18, he would have received a sentence of 8-10 years. 
 
Leave to appeal was refused by the Single Judge.  He renews his application to the 
 
full court. 

The seriousness of the offence and the harm caused 

 

81.	  We  first  consider  the  seriousness  of  the  offence.    The  judge  who  had  heard  the 
evidence was entitled to find that the applicant was carrying the knife, not because he 
 
was  expecting  particular  trouble  nor  because  of  threats;  he  was  carrying  it  for 
protection  as  part  of  his  ordinary  daily  clothing,  because  it  made  him  feel  safer  or 
perhaps because it added to his aura with other young people.  That cannot be any 
justification  for  carrying  a  knife  or  bladed  weapon.    The  judge  found  there  was 
 
absolutely  no  need  for  him  to  have  taken  out  his  knife  when  he  tried  to  get  away. 
 
There was no need for him to have used the knife on Pham.  The judge concluded that 
he was under no threat from Pham as he lay curled on the floor.  The evidence was 
clear that the applicant leant over and deliberately stabbed him.   

The application for leave to appeal 

There can be no doubt, as the judge was plainly entitled to find, that the very serious 
aggravating factor in this case was the fact that the appellant carried a knife on him as 
an ordinary part of his everyday appearance.  He had deliberately used the knife on 
Pham when he was on the ground.  It was very serious criminality.   

As to the harm caused, the wound was a 1-2 cms long wound to the left thigh.  It was 
closed with three stitches. 

The applicant had had a difficult upbringing, going to Jamaica and then returning to 
the UK.  On 22 September 2010 when was just 14 he pleaded guilty to possessing a 
lock knife in a public place.  This related to an incident three months earlier when he 
 
was 13.  He had been with a group of other youths when the police stopped them; he 
attempted to dispose of it, but was noticed.  His sentence was a nine month referral 
order 

The judge was entitled to conclude that there was little provocation in relation to the 
applicant’s stabbing of Pham.  It was an offence which fell at the top end of category 
2.  His  previous  conviction  for  carrying  a  lock  knife  was  a  seriously  aggravating 
factor.  In our judgment, the sentence of six years, taking account of the applicant’s 
 
age, cannot be faulted.  The application is refused.

Background 

 
86.	 

 
On 31 October 2012 the complainant, a youth then aged 15, was at a party in Hitchin. 
 
The  applicant,  who  was  born  on  22  June  1996  and  then  aged  16,  and  some  of  his 
friends were also at the same party.  The complainant had been associating with a girl 
whom  the  applicant  had  hoped  would  become  his  girlfriend.    The  applicant  felt 
slighted as a result of a previous incident and that he had been shown disrespect.   

 

87.	  Whilst the applicant and his friends were in the kitchen he enlisted their help, put on 
 
some gloves, picked up a knife and lunged towards the complainant, aiming for his 
 
abdomen.  The complainant managed to move out of the way a little but was stabbed 
in the inner thigh.  The complainant kicked out, managed to free himself and ran out 
of the kitchen whilst one of his friends grabbed the applicant’s wrist to prevent him 
using the knife again.  The complainant made his way outside and was found bleeding 
profusely.  An ambulance attended and he was taken to hospital where his wound was 
stitched; the judge commented that it was good fortune that the femoral artery was not 
severed.  The victim personal statement made clear that, although he did not have any 
residual  pain  or  any  other  physical  effects,  he  was  still  affected  by  the  incident  at 
home and at school; he did not go out at all. 

 
88.	 

The  applicant  was  arrested  some  days  later.    He  was  tried  at  the  Crown  Court  at 
Cambridge before His Honour Judge Hawkesworth and a jury on a count of wounding 
with intent.  He was convicted of that offence on 3 May 2013.  On 7 June 2013, when 
 
aged  16,  he  was  sentenced  to  an  extended  sentence  of  ten  years  imprisonment, 
comprising a custodial term of six years and an extension period of four years.  His 
application for leave to appeal was refused by the Single Judge.  He renews it to this 
court. 

 

The application for leave to appeal 

It is accepted on behalf of the applicant that when the judge placed the offence within 
 
category 2 of the sentencing guideline, he was correct in doing so.  Greater culpability 
existed in view of the use of the weapon, the intention to commit more serious harm 
than actually resulted from the offence and the circumstances in which the crime was 
committed. 

It  was  also  accepted  that  the  judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  the  applicant  was 
 
dangerous.  There  were  ample  grounds  for  doing  so  given  his  record  of  previous 
offending  to  which  we  will  refer,  the  judge’s  own  assessment  and  the  careful  pre-
sentence report. 

 
89.	 

 
90.
--------
91.	 

 
92.	 

 
The ground of appeal is that the custodial term was too long.  It is premised upon the 
submission that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the age of the applicant 
and to take into account his background circumstances.  As was set out in the pre-
sentence report, his family background was chaotic, he was beyond the control of his 
mother  and  used  to  getting  his  own  way  for  a  long  time,  associating  with  other 
criminals of his age and acting as a leader.  

Although he was only 16, he had a significant criminal record.  On 9 January 2008 
when he was not yet 11 he was convicted of using threatening words or behaviour. 
  
He  was  given  a  referral  order  a  few  months  later.    On  13  August  2008  he  was 
convicted of another similar offence and given a supervision order with a curfew and 
electronic tagging.  Encompassed within those sentences were two further offences of 
malicious damage and common assault.  In February 2008 he was convicted of arson, 
two offences of malicious damage and two offences of battery.  On 13 August 2008 
he was convicted of burglary and theft.  On 19 November 2008 he was convicted of 
two offences of battery.  On 5 February 2009 he was found in breach of his curfew 
 
order.  On 26 March 2009 he was found guilty of theft, malicious damage and battery. 
 
On 5 January 2010 he was convicted of common assault and given his first custodial 
sentence of detention and training for four months.  On 11 March 2010 he was found 
guilty  of  failing  to  comply  with  that  order.    On  1  July  2010  there  were  numerous 
further failures to comply with that order.  On 1 August 2010 he was found guilty of 
malicious  damage.    He  was  convicted  of  a  similar  offence  on  9  December  2010. 
 
There were subsequent further convictions on 20 January 2011 for malicious damage. 
 
On 13 June 2011 he was involved in aggravated vehicle taking and given a further 
detention and training order for four months.  On 15 July 2011 there was theft from a 
dwelling and on 15 December 2011 theft from a person.  On 30 August 2012 there 
 
were two offences of battery on two females and further offences of failing to comply 
 
with  orders  imposed  upon  him.    On  27  September  2012  he  was  made  subject  to  a 
youth rehabilitation order which was in force at the time of this offence; despite his 
 
arrest and remand for this offence he was given a four month detention and training 
 
order on 10 January 2013 by magistrates for breach of the youth rehabilitation order 
imposed on 27 September 2012. 

 
93.	 

The  pre-sentence  report  recorded  that,  although  he  had  been  under  statutory 
supervision for the past five years, he had always re-offended and failed to comply 
 
with requirements.  He had been placed in custody seven times.  He had made no real 
use  of  the  help  offered,  except  for  short  periods.    In  his  period  of  remand  after 
 
October 2012 he had been highly disruptive and involved in violent incidents though 
he  had  in  the  six  weeks  prior  to  sentence  been  better  behaved.    He  refused  to 
cooperate with the writer of this pre-sentence report.  He expressed no remorse. 

 
94.	 

In our judgment the judge’s approach to sentencing this applicant cannot be faulted. 
 
He had regard to all the relevant matters and properly discounted the sentence that 
 
would have been applicable to an adult.  This application is therefore refused.",2014-04-16 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

SIR JAMES MUNBY PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY DIVISION 


This judgment was delivered in open court, but the reporting of this case is subject to a 
reporting restriction order the terms of which are annexed to the earlier judgment 

handed down on 17 December 2013: Re P (A Child) [2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam) 

 

 

SIR JAMES MUNBY PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY 
DIVISION 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 
Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division : 
  

Re P (A Child) 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

This  is  the  final  chapter  in  the  litigation  relating  to  Alessandra  Pacchieri  and  her 
daughter  P.  The  case  has  been  the  subject  of  much  reporting  and  comment  in  the 
media, in this country, in Italy (of which the mother is a national) and indeed around 
the world. For that reason I am giving this judgment in open court. 

 

On 17 December 2013 I gave a judgment, also in open court, in which I described 
 
events down to that date in some detail: Re P (A Child) [2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam), 
paras 2-32. There is no need for me to repeat it here. It suffices to recall that P was 
born in this country on 24 August 2012; that on 1 February 2013 His Honour Judge 
Newton  sitting  in  the  Chelmsford  County  Court  made  both  a  care  order  and  a 
placement order in respect of P; that the mother’s last contact with P was on 22 May 
2013;  that  on  25  October  2013  Judge  Newton  made  an  order  giving  the  local 
authority,  Essex  County  Council,  leave  to  place  P  for  adoption;  and  that  not  long 
after, in fact on 19 November 2013, P was placed with prospective adopters. She has 
remained with them ever since. I shall refer to them as Mr and Mrs X. 

 
3.	 

Before  moving  on  there  is  one  other  matter  I  should  refer  to.  I  can  best  do  so  by 
repeating what I said in my earlier judgment (paras 19-20): 

instructed  by 

“According  to  reports  in  the  media  the  mother  has  English 
solicitors  acting  for  her.  It  is  also  a  fact  that  other  solicitors, 
Dawson  Cornwell,  have  been 
the  Italian 
government … Be all that as it may, the fact is that, as at the 
date  of  the  hearing  before  me  on  13  December  2013,  no 
application of any kind had been made on behalf of either the 
mother  or  the  Italian  authorities,  whether  to  the  Court  of 
Protection,  the  Chelmsford  County  Court  or  the  Family

I went on (para 29) to refer to letters dated 6 and 13 December 2013 written to the 
court by Dawson Cornwell. I commented (para 30) that “The Italian authorities must 
take such steps (if any) as they may be advised.”

On  23  December  2013  a  firm  of  solicitors,  Brendan  Fleming,  wrote  the  following 
letter to my clerk: 
 

 

“We  confirm  that  we  are  instructed  to  act  for  Alessandra 
Pacchieri in respect of the above matter. 

We  have  instructions  to  prepare  and  lodge  an  Appeal  in  this

SIR JAMES MUNBY PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY

Approved Judgment 
 

Re P (A Child) 

We  confirm  that  we  have  corresponded  with  the  Local 
Authority 
this  matter  and  have  sent  copies  of  our 
correspondence  to  …  at  Dawson  Cornwell  who  has  been 
instructed by the Italian Government.” 

in 

I  am  not  privy  to  whatever  correspondence  there  may  have  been  between  Brendan 
Fleming  and  Dawson  Cornwell,  but  at  the hearing  before  me  on  1  April  2014  (see 
 
below) Essex County Council showed me certain correspondence it had had with both 
firms in December 2013. The most recent letter from Dawson Cornwell was dated 9 
 
December  2013.  The  most  recent  letter  from  Brendan  Fleming  was  dated  13 
December 2013. It said that the writer had spoken “at length” with the mother on 11 
 
and  12  December  2013.  It  enclosed  what  was  described  as  a  notice  of  acting  “in 
 
respect of proposed proceedings concerning” P, though without elaborating further. I 
am  told  that  Essex  County  Council  has  received  no  further  correspondence  from 
either firm since.   

On 3 February 2014 Mr and Mrs X applied for an adoption order in respect of P. The 
 
matter has since proceeded as a serial number case. On 13 February 2014 a District 
Judge  of  the  Principal  Registry  of  the  Family  Division  directed  that  the  matter  be 
listed before me on 1 April 2014. In accordance with directions given by the District 
Judge,  both  the  mother  and  P’s  father  (who  does  not  have  parental  responsibility) 
 
were sent written notice by the court and, on 7 March 2014, emailed notice by Essex 
County  Council  of  the  hearing  fixed  for  1  April  2014.  The  notice,  dated  5  March 
2014, contained the warning, drawn to their attention, that “Failure to attend my result 
in an order being made in your absence.” There has been no response from P’s father 
who, it should be noted, has never seen P. 

The confidential Annex A report is dated 26 March 2014. 

At the hearing before me on 1 April 2014 Mr and Mrs X were represented by their 
solicitor.  Social  workers  from  Essex  County  Council  were  present.  P’s  mother  and 
father were neither present nor represented. 

It is appropriate at this point to set out in some detail certain email exchanges between 
the mother and Essex County Council. (I set out the exact text of the emails, without 
seeking to correct either the spelling or punctuation.)  

 
10.	 

I start with an email the mother sent to Essex County Council on 8 November 2013: 

“Hello Sue, 
 

I would like to know how my daughter is doing first and than if 
you  have  any  outcome  of  the  court  hearing.  you  know  they 
emailed me the evening before the court hearing sending me an 
attachment  with  the  details  of  the  hearing  with  a  password. 
when they sent me the password it was not correct therefore i 
could  not  open  the  document  till  the  next  day  when  they 
informed  me  that  was  not  a  capitol  a  as  they  wrote.  i  am  so 
 
disappointed.  i  informed  my  attorney  in  italy  about  all  that 
cause  i  wanted  to  attend  the  hearing  but  they  made  it 
impossible for me. Do you know anything about all that?

Thank you” 

 

The social worker replied by email on 11 November 2013: 


“Hi Alessandra, 


Re P (A Child) 

I understand that [P] is continuing to do well and she is making 

good progress. 


The court has now given permission for the Local Authority to 

place [P], in line with her Care Plan, with the adoptive family 

identified and introductions are starting today. 


There will be a further application for an Adoption Order and 

therefore you must ensure that the Local Authority has an up to 
date  address  for  you  so  that  you  are  notified  and  have  an 
opportunity to respond. 

There  may  be  an  opportunity  for  you  to  meet  with  [P]’s 
 
adoptive parents however this will be explored at a later date. 

Please continue to liaise with your legal representative who will 
be able to explain the process to you. 

Please  accept  my  best  regards  to  you  and  your  family  during  

this difficult time. 


Kind regards, 


Sue” 


The mother responded by email on 14 November 2013: 


“Hello Sue, 
 

It  s  really  sad  for  me  but  i  pray  God  everyday  that  she  will 
gonna be fine and that i will see her again. I would love to meet 
with her adoptive parents and have a chat with them so please 
make that happen for us.  

i am moving therefore use this address [address] 


thank you 


Kind Regards

11.	 

On 11 December 2013 a social worker spoke to the mother by telephone. The mother 
is reported as having said she “wishes my daughter the best” and asked how she was 
 
doing “with her new family.” 

 

Re P (A Child) 

The email notifying the mother of the hearing was sent to her on 7 March 2014. A 
follow up email was sent on 12 March 2014. The mother responded by email later the 
same day: 

“Dear Lynne thank you for your email I don’t have an advocate 
and unfortunately I will not able to attend Court, I received all 
the paperwork that you mailed to the adresse. Thank you very 
much” 

Essex County Council replied by email on 13 March 2014: 

“Many thanks Allesandra. 

Would you wish to express your view via an email which we 
 
can present to the Court on your behalf? 
 

Lynne” 

There was no response, so Essex County Council emailed again on 27 March 2014: 

“Alessandra  –  I  just  wish  to  remind  you  that  the  hearing  in 
respect of [P] will be on Tuesday 1st April. 

I  know  that  you  are  unable  to  attend  the  hearing,  but  as 
previously stated, if there is anything that you wish the Court to 
know about your views on the proposed adoption then please 
email  me  by  Monday  3  p.m.  so  I  can  ensure  your  views  are 
available to the Court.”” 

The final email from the mother arrived on 28 March 2014: 

“Dear Lynne 

I wish for my daughter the best. Me personally I am trying to 
forget this bad experience I had in England. I love my daughter 
with all my heart and I pray to see her one day again.” 

 
As  of  1  April  2014  the  position  remained  as  it  had  been  on  17  December  2013. 
Despite what had been said in the correspondence from Brendan Fleming and Dawson 
Cornwell in December 2013, no application of any kind had been made on behalf of 
either  the  mother  or  the  Italian  authorities,  whether  to  the  Court  of  Protection,  the 
Chelmsford County Court or the Family Division, nor had any application been made 
to the Court of Appeal. In particular, it is to be noted, neither the mother, nor for that 
matter the father, had made any application in accordance with section 47(5) of the 
Adoption and Children Act 2002 for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order. 

 

In  these  circumstances  the  submission  made  on  behalf  of  Mr  and  Mrs  X  by  their 
 
solicitor  was  simple  and  compelling.  The  Annex  A  report  was  understood  to  be 
wholly  positive  about  P’s  placement  with  Mr  and  Mrs  X  –  as  indeed  it  is  –  and  it 
being clear that the mother was fully aware of the hearing and had not indicated any 
intention to seek leave to oppose the making of the order, I should make an adoption

order. 

 
15.	 

The Annex A report is a long, detailed and impressive document, running to some 70 
pages. It is, of course, confidential to the court. I therefore say little about its contents. 
Two passages should, however, be highlighted. The first focuses on P: 

“[P] is not of an age where she can fully express her wishes and 
 
feelings;  however,  through  observation  it  is  observed  that  [P] 
has  a  strong  and  positive  bond  with  both  her  prospective 
adoptive parents. There is warmth and care in their relationship 
 
which  is  reciprocated  from  both  prospective  adoptive  parents 
and  [P].  They  are  very  nurturing  towards  [P]  and  show  her 
affection. 

[P] presents as a very happy and content little girl who is very 
affectionate  towards  both  her  prospective  adoptive  parents. 
Although she is unable to verbally communicate [P] expresses 
very cheerful and happy emotions.”

The other summarises the recommendation of the two social workers who prepared 
the  report.  They  “warmly  and  whole  heartedly  support”  the  application  by  Mr  and 
Mrs X to adopt. Having carefully read the report I can only agree.  

 

17.	  Mr and Mrs X are good and loving people. They are admirably equipped to meet P’s 
needs now and into the future. P is obviously thriving in their care and doing very 
well. In all the circumstances, and having regard to the ‘welfare checklist’ in section 
 
1(4) of the 2002 Act, P’s welfare throughout her life requires – demands – that she be

SIR JAMES MUNBY PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY DIVISION 


This judgment was delivered in open court, but the reporting of this case is subject to a 
reporting restriction order the terms of which are annexed to the earlier judgment 

handed down on 17 December 2013: Re P (A Child) [2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam) 

 

 

SIR JAMES MUNBY PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY 
DIVISION 
 
Approved Judgment 
 

 
Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division : 
  

Re P (A Child) 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

This  is  the  final  chapter  in  the  litigation  relating  to  Alessandra  Pacchieri  and  her 
daughter  P.  The  case  has  been  the  subject  of  much  reporting  and  comment  in  the 
media, in this country, in Italy (of which the mother is a national) and indeed around 
the world. For that reason I am giving this judgment in open court. 

 

On 17 December 2013 I gave a judgment, also in open court, in which I described 
 
events down to that date in some detail: Re P (A Child) [2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam), 
paras 2-32. There is no need for me to repeat it here. It suffices to recall that P was 
born in this country on 24 August 2012; that on 1 February 2013 His Honour Judge 
Newton  sitting  in  the  Chelmsford  County  Court  made  both  a  care  order  and  a 
placement order in respect of P; that the mother’s last contact with P was on 22 May 
2013;  that  on  25  October  2013  Judge  Newton  made  an  order  giving  the  local 
authority,  Essex  County  Council,  leave  to  place  P  for  adoption;  and  that  not  long 
after, in fact on 19 November 2013, P was placed with prospective adopters. She has 
remained with them ever since. I shall refer to them as Mr and Mrs X. 

 
3.	 

Before  moving  on  there  is  one  other  matter  I  should  refer  to.  I  can  best  do  so  by 
repeating what I said in my earlier judgment (paras 19-20): 

instructed  by 

“According  to  reports  in  the  media  the  mother  has  English 
solicitors  acting  for  her.  It  is  also  a  fact  that  other  solicitors, 
Dawson  Cornwell,  have  been 
the  Italian 
government … Be all that as it may, the fact is that, as at the 
date  of  the  hearing  before  me  on  13  December  2013,  no 
application of any kind had been made on behalf of either the 
mother  or  the  Italian  authorities,  whether  to  the  Court  of 
Protection,  the  Chelmsford  County  Court  or  the  Family 
Division,  nor  had  any  application  been  made  to  the  Court  of 
Appeal … This, so far as I am aware, remains the position as of 
this morning, 17 December 2013.” 

I went on (para 29) to refer to letters dated 6 and 13 December 2013 written to the 
court by Dawson Cornwell. I commented (para 30) that “The Italian authorities must 
take such steps (if any) as they may be advised.” 

 
4.	 

On  23  December  2013  a  firm  of  solicitors,  Brendan  Fleming,  wrote  the  following 
letter to my clerk: 
 

 

“We  confirm  that  we  are  instructed  to  act  for  Alessandra 
Pacchieri in respect of the above matter. 

We  have  instructions  to  prepare  and  lodge  an  Appeal  in  this 
matter. Those papers are being prepared by the legal team we 
have secured which is … 

Unfortunately  there  has  been  a  delay  as  a  result  of  funding 
problems for this proposed action. We are working very hard to 
resolve this problem.

running off it down one side of the building. Ryaheen fell through a gap in the barrier 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where a glass panel had been removed at the end of the walkway.

building.  Although  there  was  conflicting  evidence  exactly  when  this  occurred,  at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the end of May 2012 one of the glass panels in the barrier facing the river was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smashed by vandals. You did not notice that this had happened until 14 June, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody reported it to you. However, on 14 June you reported the matter to Arim, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  company  who managed the building,  and obtained their  authorisation  to fit a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

replacement panel at that location and also on the ground floor where another panel 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was broken or missing. However, the panel which you had planned to use to replace 
 
the panel on the 4th floor did not fit.
--------
By their verdict the jury have concluded that what you then did was to replace the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing panel at the front of the building using the panel in the barrier which was at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end of the walkway round the side. This repaired one major and obvious hazard 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but left a gap in the walkway barrier through which Ryaheen was to fall. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Although you denied that this is what you had done, you yourself acknowledged in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your evidence that to leave a missing panel in an area where you knew that children 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

played was extremely dangerous. So it was. But you took no steps to board up the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gap as you could easily have done, or even to draw attention to its existence, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply left a gap there for a period of almost two weeks. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can  only  conclude,  taking  account  of  the  evidence  at  the  trial  that  you  were  in 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general a hard working, helpful and conscientious caretaker, who took pride in your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work, that something happened to cause you to overlook the need to board up the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gap  which  you  had  left.  That  evidence  is  confirmed  by  the  character  references 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which I have read. To board it up would have been an easy job and you had the tools 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and materials with which to do so. I do not believe that you left the gap deliberately, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intending  to  do  nothing  about  it.  As  you  yourself  said,  and  as  was  obvious,  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  extremely  dangerous.  Having  seen  you  give  evidence  and  heard 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what others have said about you, I cannot believe that this is what you intended to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  Why  you  did  not  board  up  the  gap  we  may  never  know,  although  there  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling evidence that after your hours were reduced to two days a week at the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning of 2012, you were run off your feet with work and unable to cope with all 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the work that needed to be done in a large building which suffered from frequent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  mindless  acts  of  vandalism.  I  take  account  also  of  the  fact  that  although  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

walkway where the missing panel was appears to have been a place where people 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequently  went  to  smoke,  nobody  ever  reported  to  you  that  there  was  a  panel 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missing. 
 

 

Nevertheless your failure to board up the gap was a thoroughly irresponsible failure 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which has caused the tragic death of a little girl and brought grief to her family, as

have borne their loss with quiet dignity. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  circumstances  which  I  have  described  mean  that  your  culpability  is  high.  For 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever reason, you created an obvious danger for any little child using the garden, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and even if it slipped your mind under the pressure of other work, you did nothing to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remove the danger for an extended period. The families who used the garden relied 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on you to keep it safe for them to do so. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I take into account that you are a man of good character and I have already referred

I derive relatively little assistance from the differing facts of other cases. Every case is 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different. I have to make a judgment as to the sentence which will properly reflect 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the culpability of your conduct and the tragic consequences which resulted. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You will go to prison for 4 years. After half that time you will be released on licence.

Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, CJ: 
 

Introduction 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

 
1.	 

The statutory scheme enacted by Parliament for sentencing an adult guilty of murder 
 
is set out in the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 (the 1965 Act),  the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) and Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (the 1997 
Act): 

 
i) 

 
ii) 

A  trial  judge  must,  under  s.1  of  the  1965  Act,  impose  a  life  sentence  for 
 
murder.  Under s.269 of the 2003 Act, the judge must decide whether to make 
 
a minimum term of a fixed number of years or a whole life order.  

If a fixed minimum term order is made, the Parole Board has the power under 
the  provisions  of  s.28  of  the  1997  Act,  commonly  called  the  early  release 
provisions, to direct release of the offender after the expiry of any minimum 
term for a fixed number of years set by the trial judge; it considers in essence 
the risk to the public if release is ordered.  However, the Parole Board has no 
 
such power where a whole life order is made. 

 
iii) 

A  power  of  release  is  given  under  s.30  of  the  1997  Act  to  the  Secretary  of 
State,  if  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which  justify  release  on 
compassionate grounds. 

 
2.	 

In the cases before the court a challenge is made to this scheme.  It is advanced under 
Article 3 of the Convention and founded on decisions of the Strasbourg Court: 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

On 12 February 2008, the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court decided in 
Kafkaris  v  Cyprus  (Application  no.  21906/04)  that  whilst  a  sentence  of  life 
imprisonment  did  not  violate  Article  3, there  would  be  a  violation  if  such  a 
sentence was irreducible – that is to say a sentence for the duration of the life 
of the offender with no “possibility” or “hope” or “prospect” of release from 
the sentence.  

In R v Bieber [2009] 1 WLR 223, this court held, in the light of the decision in 
Kafkaris that, as the Secretary of State had a power of release under s.30 of the 
 
1997 Act, a sentence with a whole life order was not irreducible and thus not 
in violation of Article 3. 

On 17 January 2012 the Fourth Chamber of the Strasbourg Court in Vinter v 
UK [2012] 55 EHHR 34 held that there was no violation of Article 3.  On 9 
July 2012, the Grand Chamber decided to hear the case.

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

 
iv)	 

 
v)	 

Prior to the hearing by the Grand Chamber, a special constitution of this court 
 
considered appeals where four of the appellants had received whole life orders 
and one a minimum term of 30 years.  In its decision given in November 2012, 
R v David Oakes and others [2012] EWCA Crim 2435, [2013] 2 Cr App R (S) 
22,  this  court  concluded  that  whole  life  orders  were  not  incompatible  with 
Article 3 of the Convention. 

0n 9 July 2013, the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court gave its decision 
in Vinter v United Kingdom.  It held, for reasons we shall analyse, that there 
had been a violation of Article 3 in relation to the whole life orders imposed on 
the basis that they were not reducible. 

 
3.	 

 
4.	 

This court was therefore specially constituted to consider, in the light of that decision, 
 
three  appeals  by  defendants  on  whom  a  whole  life  order  had  been  imposed  and  a 
 
reference by the Attorney General under s.36 of the CJA 1986 in a case where it was 
 
contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the decision in Vinter 
precluded the imposition of a whole life order.   

Prior to the hearing the first of the appellants, Mark Bridger, abandoned his appeal 
 
against the whole life order imposed on him for the sadistic murder of a child.  In 
respect of the second appellant, Matthew Thomas, it was clear that the appellant had 
not  received  a  whole  life  order.    The  hearing  therefore  proceeded  as  an  appeal  by 
Newell,  the  third  appellant,  on  whom  a  whole  life  order  had  been  imposed,  and  a 
 
reference by the Attorney General in the case of McLoughlin where the judge, after 
concluding the decision in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order, had 
imposed a minimum term of 40 years.  The reference was made on the grounds that 
the judge had made an error of law as to his powers and that the consequent failure to 
make a whole life order had resulted in an unduly lenient sentence. 

The development of the legislative scheme 

(a) 	

The fixing of the tariff and its reconsideration in exceptional circumstances 

Although  an  account  of  the  development  of  the  life  sentence  for  murder  and  its 
 
practical operation has been set out on many occasions, such as the judgment of Lord 
Mustill in R v Secretary of State ex p Doody [1994] AC 531 and the judgment of Lord 
 
Judge CJ in R v Oakes, it is important to summarise one aspect of that development as 
it assists in understanding the submissions presented to us. 

On 30 November 1983 the then Home Secretary introduced a scheme that formalised 
the practice that had developed in the years after the introduction of the mandatory 
life sentence for murder (see Hansard HC Deb 30 November 1983, vol 49, cols 505-
507).  Under that scheme a formal distinction was drawn between the penal element 
 
of a sentence (punishment, retribution and deterrence) and the element that protected 
the public from risk.  It initially operated on the basis that the trial judge would make

6.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

a  recommendation  to  the  Home  Secretary  on  the  term  required  to  reflect  the  penal 
element.  The Home Secretary was not bound by that recommendation; he made his 
own determination of that period which was  commonly  known  as  the  tariff  period. 
 
Although the overwhelming majority of tariffs were for a determinate period, some 
whole life tariffs were imposed.  At the conclusion of a determinate tariff period, the 
Parole  Board  was  asked  to  review  whether  the  offender  should  be  released,  having 
regard to the risk that he posed to the public.  The decision on release was then made 
by the Home Secretary. 
 

 
7.	 

The position in relation to whole life tariffs was more complex.  

 
i)	 

On 7 December 1994 the then Home Secretary announced a policy in relation 
to prisoners serving a whole life tariff (Hansard HC Deb 7 December 1994, 
vol 251, cols. 234-235: written answer). 

""In addition, I have decided that for those life sentence 
prisoners for whom it is decided that the requirements 
of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by 
their  remaining  in  prison  for  the  whole  of  their  life, 
 
there will in future be an additional ministerial review 
 
when  the  prisoner  has  been  in  custody  for  25  years. 
 
The purpose of this review will be solely to consider 
whether the whole life tariff should be converted to a 
tariff  of  a  determinate  period.    The  review  will  be 
 
confined  to  the  considerations  of  retribution  and 
deterrence.  Where  appropriate,  further  ministerial 
reviews  will  normally 
take  place  at  five-yearly 
 
intervals  thereafter.    Existing  prisoners  who  fall  into 
this category and who have already served 25 years or 
more  in  custody  will  not  be  disadvantaged.    Their 
cases  will  be  reviewed  by  ministers  as  soon  as  is 
 
practicable  and  after  any  representations  they  may 
wish to make."" 

 
ii)	 

That  policy  was  modified  by  a  different  Home  Secretary  on  10  November 
1997 (Hansard HC Deb 10 November 1997, vol 300, cols. 419-420: written 
answer): 

“So  far  as  the  potential  for  a  reduction  in  tariff  is 
 
concerned,  I  shall  be  open  to  the  possibility  that,  in 
exceptional  circumstances, 
including  for  example 
exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, 
a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate.  
I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at 
the 25-year point the cases of prisoners given a whole 
 
life  tariff  and  in  that  respect  will  consider  issues 
 
beyond  the  sole  criteria  of  retribution  and  deterrence 
described in the answer given on 7 December 1994.”

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

 
iii)	 

 

In a challenge by Myra Hindley to the whole life tariff imposed on her, Lord 
Bingham CJ held in the Divisional Court in R v Home Secretary ex p Hindley 
[1998] QB 751 at page 770 that whereas the narrow policy set out in 1994 was 
 
unlawful,  this  had  been  corrected  by  the  1997  policy  which  permitted  the 
taking into account of exceptional progress whilst in prison.  In the appeal to 
the House of Lords counsel for the Home Secretary made clear that the Home 
 
Secretary was prepared to review any whole life tariff, even in the absence of 
exceptional circumstances (see page 417C of [2001] 1 AC 410).  Lord Steyn, 
when approving the legality of the Home Secretary’s 1997 policy, recorded the 
way in which the policy had been clarified (at 417D): 

“…. counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that 
the  policy  of  imposing  a  whole  life  tariff  merely 
involves  the  expression  of  the  current  view  of  the 
Secretary of State that the requirements of retribution 
and  deterrence  make  it  inappropriate  ever  to  release 
such a prisoner.  It does not rule out reconsideration. 
 
The  Secretary  of  State  envisages  the  possibility  of 
release in the event of exceptional progress in prison; 
and, even in absence of such progress, the Secretary of 
State  is  prepared  to  reconsider  any  whole  life  tariff 
decision from time to time.” 

 
iv)	 

The  Secretary  of  State’s  policy  of  being  willing  to  review  existing  tariffs  in 
exceptional circumstances was noted in R(Cole & others) v Secretary of State for 
the Home Department [2003] EWHC 1789 (Admin) at paragraph 11.  The then 
Vice President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division (Rose LJ) observed (in 
relation to then planned review by judges in the High Court of existing tariffs as 
 
subsequently enacted in the CJA 2003) that it seemed: 

“inconceivable, in human terms, that … in relation to prisoners 
serving a notified tariff, exceptional progress in prison will not 
be taken into account.”  (See paragraph 88) 

 
8.	 

Following  successive  decisions  of  the  Strasbourg  Court  and  of  the  House  of  Lords 
and an acceptance that decisions on the liberty of an individual are properly decisions 
for the judicial branch of the state as opposed to the executive, policy and legislative 
changes were made.  These gradually brought both the fixing of the tariff period to 
reflect the penal element and the decision on the prisoner’s safety for release under 
judicial control within the scheme we have summarised at paragraph 1. 

 

(b)  The duty of the judge under the CJA 2003 
  

Under that scheme the trial judge approaches the task of setting the penal element of 
the  sentence  of  mandatory  life  imprisonment  by  determining  the  seriousness  of  the 
 
offence in accordance with the principles set out in Schedule 21 and any applicable 
 
guidelines  of  the  Sentencing  Council.  The  judge  is  not  concerned  with  risk  to  the

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

 
public on release.  Paragraph 4 of that schedule provides that the appropriate starting 
point where the seriousness of the offence or offences is exceptionally high should be 
a whole life order.  The types of case that would normally fall within this category 
 
are: 

“(a)  the  murder  of  two  or  more  persons,  where  each  murder 
involves any of the following— 

(i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning, 

(ii) the abduction of the victim, or 

(iii) sexual or sadistic conduct, 

(b) the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the child 
or sexual or sadistic motivation, 

(c)  a  murder  done  for  the  purpose  of  advancing  a  political, 
religious, racial or ideological cause, or 

(d) a murder by an offender previously convicted of murder.” 

 (c) 	

The power of release under s.30 of the 1997 Act 

 
10.	 

Although,  as  we  have  explained,  the  Parole  Board  has  no  power  to  consider  early 
release if a whole life order is made, the power of the Secretary of State to release the 
prisoner is set out in s.30 of the 1997 Act: 

“(1) 
The Secretary of State may at any time release a life 
 
prisoner  on 
that  exceptional 
circumstances  exist  which  justify  the  prisoner’s  release  on 
compassionate grounds.

(2) 
Before  releasing  a  life  prisoner  under  subsection  (1) 
above,  the  Secretary  of  State  shall  consult  the  Parole  Board, 
unless the circumstances are such as to render such consultation 
impracticable.” 

 
11.	 

The  Secretary  of  State  for  Justice  has  set  out  in  chapter  12  of  the  Indeterminate 
Sentence Manual (the Lifer Manual), issued as Prison Service Order 4700, guidance 
on his policy as to the criteria for release on compassionate grounds.  The criteria in 
the current chapter date from April 2010.  

“the  prisoner  is  suffering  from  a  terminal  illness  and  death  is 
likely  to  occur  very  shortly  (although  there  are  no  set  time 
 
limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period

These are highly restrictive criteria. 

The contentions of the parties 

 
12.	 

The submissions of Mr Eadie QC on behalf of the Attorney General and the Crown 
can be summarised: 

 
i)	  The Grand Chamber’s decision did not hold that the statutory regime relating to 
 
the imposition of a whole life order under s.269 of the CJA 2003 was incompatible 
with  Article  3.  The  Grand  Chamber  had  drawn  a  clear  distinction  between  the 
regime  which  governed  the  imposition  of  the  sentence  and  the  regime  for  the 
reducibility  of  that  sentence  through  review  and  release.    The  imposition  of  a 
whole life order was just punishment and was compatible with the Convention. 

 

ii)  The Grand Chamber were mistaken in concluding that the statutory regime for the 
reducibility of the sentence by review and release was insufficiently certain; and 
 
that uncertainty gave rise to a breach of Article 3.  As a matter of analysis of the 
law of England and Wales, the Human Rights Act required the Secretary of State 
 
to  act  compatibly  with  Convention  Rights.    When  the  Secretary  of  State 
considered review and release, the Secretary of State had to exercise his powers 
under s.30 of the 1997 Act compatibly with Convention Rights.  The policy set out 
in the Lifer Manual (to which we referred at paragraph 11) did not represent the 
whole of the circumstances in which the power of release might be exercised.  

 
iii)	 

 
Even if the statutory scheme for imposing the sentence and the legal regime for 
review  and  release  had  to  considered  as  a  single  regime,  and  there  had  to  be  a 
regime which provided for reducibility compatible with Article 3 at the time the 
 
whole life order was imposed, and the current regime was not compatible, then the 
court could not read the terms of s.269 down in accordance with s.3 of the Human 
Rights Act.  That is because s.269(4) says that the court ‘must’ impose a whole 
life order and the effect of any attempt to read down the section would require it to
--------

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

be read as ‘must not’.  Furthermore, whilst the court is a public body enjoined by 
s.6(1) to act compatibly with the Convention, s.6(2) has the effect of disapplying 
that  provision  where  a  public  body  acts  in  accordance  with  primary  legislation 
which cannot be read down.  S.6 is one of the mechanisms in the Human Rights 
Act which carefully preserves the supremacy of Parliament in the domestic legal 
order. 

 
13.	 

The only short submission made in response was that by Mr Joe Stone QC for the 
 
appellant Newell.  The offender McLoughlin had expressly instructed his counsel and 
solicitors not to oppose the Attorney General’s reference in the terms we set out at 
 
paragraph  46  below.  Mr  McCartney  (who  had  represented  McLoughlin  before  the 
judge) was present at the appeal at the direction of the court to assist us to the extent 
that  he  could,  consistent  with  McLoughlin’s  instructions  to  make  no  submissions. 
 
The submission made by Mr Stone QC was that the Grand Chamber had made it clear 
 
that there must be a regime for review of the sentence at the time the sentence was 
passed;  that  regime  must  provide  for  the  realistic  possibility  of  reducibility  to  be 
compatible  with  Article  3;  the  current  regime  did  not.    The  whole  life  order  was 
therefore incompatible with Article 3. 
 

Is the statutory regime established by Parliament compatible with Article 3? 

(a) 	

The power to impose a whole life order as just punishment 

In Vinter the Grand Chamber set out its view that it was axiomatic that a person could 
not  be  detained  unless  there  were  “legitimate  penological  grounds”  for  detention; 
those  grounds  were  stated  by  the  court  to  include  punishment,  deterrence,  public 
protection and rehabilitation. 

Although there may be debate in a democratic society as to whether a judge should 
have the power to make a whole life order, in our view, it is evident, as reflected in 
 
Schedule  21,  that  there  are  some  crimes  that  are  so  heinous  that  Parliament  was 
 
entitled  to  proscribe,  compatibly  with  the  Convention,  that  the  requirements  of  just 
punishment encompass passing a sentence which includes a whole life order.   

In  R  v  Oakes,  Lord  Judge  CJ  summarised  (at  paragraphs  9  and  10)  the  views 
expressed on the whole life tariff by Lord Bingham CJ and Lord Steyn in  Hindley as 
illustrations of a view held by eminent judges in the judiciary of England and Wales. 
Lord  Bingham  had  said,  at  a  time  the  whole  life  tariff  was  fixed  by  the  Home 
 
Secretary: 

 

""I can see no reason, in principle, why a crime or crimes, if 
sufficiently  heinous,  should  not  be  regarded  as  deserving 
life-long  incarceration  for  purposes  of  pure  punishment….. 
Successive Lord Chief Justices have regarded such a tariff as 
lawful, and I share their view."" (769).  

 
14.	 

 
15.	 

 
16.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

Lord  Steyn,  giving  the  leading  judgment  in  the  House  of  Lords  had  specifically 
agreed with this observation (at page 416) and went onto say at page 417: 

""There is nothing logically inconsistent with the concept of a 
 
 
tariff by saying that there are cases where the crimes are so 
wicked that even if the prisoner is detained until he or she 
 
dies  it  will  not  exhaust  the  requirements  of  retribution  and 
deterrence."" 

Lord Judge CJ concluded in R v Oakes: 

“At the time when this case [Hindley] was making its way 
through the courts, the whole-life tariff was not based on an 
express statutory provision.  Nevertheless Lord Bingham and 
Lord  Steyn  were  expressing  views  which  affirmed  support 
for  the  principle  that  there  had  been  and  no  doubt  would 
continue to be cases in which a whole life order represented 
just punishment.” 

 

17.	  We do not read the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Vinter as in any way casting 
doubt on the fact that there are crimes that are so heinous that just punishment may 
require imprisonment for life.  There may be legitimate dispute as to what such crimes 
 
are - at one end genocide or mass murder of the kind committed in Europe in living 
memory or, at the other, murder by a person who has committed other murders, but 
 
that there are such crimes cannot be doubted.  In Vinter the Grand Chamber accepted 
that, because what constitutes a just and proportionate punishment is the subject of 
debate  and  disagreement,  States  have  a  margin  of  appreciation.    Under  our 
 
constitution it is for Parliament to decide whether there are such crimes and to set the 
framework under which the judge decides in an individual case whether a whole life 
order is the just punishment. 

 

18.	  We therefore conclude that no specific passage in the judgment nor the judgment read 
as a whole in any way seek to impugn the provisions of the CJA 2003 (as enacted by 
Parliament) which entitle a judge to make at the time of sentence a whole life order as 
a sentence reflecting just punishment.  

(b)	  Does  the  regime  which  provides  for  reducibility  have  to  be  in  place  at  the  time  the 

 

whole life order is imposed? 

The Grand Chamber made clear, as is self evident, that there is no violation of Article 
3  if  a  prisoner  in  fact  spends  the  whole  of  his  life  in  prison.    One  example  is  an 
offender who continues to be a risk for the whole of his or her life. 

However,  the  Grand  Chamber  considered  that  the  justification  for  detention  might 
shift during the course of a sentence; although just punishment at the outset, it might 
 
cease to be just after the passage of many years.  It said at paragraphs 110 and 121 of 

 
19.	 

 
20.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

its  judgment  that  for  a  life  sentence  to  be  compatible  with  Article  3,  there  must 
therefore  be  both  a  prospect  of  release  and  a  possibility  of  review.    It  added  at 
 
paragraph 122: 

“A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his 
 
sentence,  what  he  must  do  to  be  considered  for  release  and 
under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence 
will  take  place  or  may  be  sought.    Consequently,  where 
domestic  law  does  not  provide  any  mechanism  or  possibility 
for  review  of  a  whole  life  sentence,  the  incompatibility  with 
Article  3  on  this  ground  already  arises  at  the  moment  of  the 
imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of 
incarceration.” 

 
21.	 

It made it clear that this requirement was quite different from the task of the judge in 
setting the sentence when saying at paragraph 124: 

“However,  the  need  for  independent  judges  to  determine 
whether  a  whole  life  order  may  be  imposed  is  quite  separate 
from  the  need  for  such  whole  life  orders  to  be  reviewed  at  a 
later  stage  so  as  to  ensure  that  they  remain  justified  on 
legitimate  penological  grounds.    Furthermore,  given  that  the 
stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the 
 
executive 
the  decision-making  process 
concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent 
to provide that, henceforth, the twenty-five year review, instead 
of  being  eliminated  completely,  would  be  conducted  within  a 
 
wholly  judicial  framework  rather  than,  as  before,  by  the 
executive subject to judicial control.” 

entirely 

from 

 
22.	 

Thus whilst it is clear that the Grand Chamber accepted that a judge can impose a 
 
whole  life  order  as  just  punishment,  it  concluded  that  a  legal  regime  for  a  review 
 
during the sentence must be in place at the time the sentence is passed. 

 

23.	  Whilst we have accepted the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the 
Strasbourg  Court  did  not  determine  that  the  imposition  of  a  whole  life  tariff  itself 
violates  Article  3,  we  return  briefly  to  the  arguments  advanced  contingently  on  the 
hypothesis that it did.  In our judgment s.3 of the Human Rights Act could not be used 
to read down the legislation to preclude the imposition of whole life tariffs.  That is 
because  s.269(4)  provides  that  if  the  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  order  for  early 
release  should  be  made  because  of  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  alone  or  in 
combination with others, it must order that those provisions do not apply.  That being 
so, s.6(2) of the Human Rights Act disapplies the obligation on the court as a public 
authority to act compatibly with the Convention. 

 
24. 

The  only  remedy  available  in  the  domestic  courts  on  this  hypothesis  would  be  a 
 
declaration  of  incompatibility,  the  discretionary  remedy  available  under  s.4  of  the
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

Human  Rights  Act  when  primary  legislation  is  found  to  incompatible  with  the 
Convention.  Such a remedy is not available in the Crown Court and would not, in any 
event, affect the continuing operation of the statutory scheme. 

(c)  	

Is  the  regime  under  s.30  a  regime  for  reducibility  which  is  in  fact  compliant  with 
Article 3? 

 
25.	 

 
26.	 

The  questions  therefore  arise  as  to  whether  the  provisions  of  s.30  provide  such  a 
regime  compatible  with  Article  3  as  interpreted  by  the  Grand  Chamber  and  on  the 
assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into 
account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation. 

Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the 
 
regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of 
 
the Secretary of State under s.30 of the 1997 Act.  He said at paragraph 48: 

“At present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this 
power  sparingly,  in  circumstances  where,  for  instance,  a 
prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or 
 
similarly  incapacitated.    If,  however,  the  position  is  reached 
where  the  continued  imprisonment  of  a  prisoner  is  held  to 
amount  to  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment,  we  can  see  no 
reason  why,  having  particular  regard  to  the  requirement  to 
 
comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not 
 
use his statutory power to release the prisoner.” 

In R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court – see paragraph 15. 

 
27.	 

The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of s.30 of the 1997 Act as 
 
set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, 
 
was  concerned  that  the  law  might  be  insufficiently  certain.    It  added  at  paragraphs 
126-7: 

 
“The fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal’s judgment 
in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his 
 
explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise 
his s.30 power.  Notwithstanding the reading given to s.30 by 
the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force 
and  provides  that  release  will  only  be  ordered  in  certain 
exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, 
… 

These  are  highly  restrictive  conditions.    Even  assuming  that 
they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the 
Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether 
compassionate  release  for  the  terminally  ill  or  physically 
incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather 
than  behind  prison  walls. 
Indeed,  in  the  Court’s  view, 
compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by 
a “prospect of release” in Kafkaris, cited above.  As such, the 
terms  of  the  Order  in  themselves  would  be  inconsistent  with 
Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes 
of Article 3.” 

 
28.	 

The  Grand  Chamber  therefore  concluded  that  s.30  did  not,  because  of  the  lack  of 
certainty,  provide  an  appropriate  and  adequate  avenue  of  redress  in  the  event  an 
 
offender  sought  to  show  that  his  continued  imprisonment  was  not  justified.    It 
concluded at paragraph 129: 

“At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such 
an application for release under s.30 by a whole life prisoner, 
the  Secretary  of  State  would  apply  his  existing,  restrictive 
 
policy,  as  set  out  in  the  Prison  Service  Order,  or  would  go 
beyond  the  apparently  exhaustive  terms  of  that  Order  by 
applying  the  Article  3  test  set  out  in  Bieber.  Of  course,  any 
ministerial  refusal  to  release  would  be  amenable  to  judicial 
review  and  it  could  well  be  that,  in  the  course  of  such 
proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for 
 
example  by  the  withdrawal  and  replacement  of  the  Prison 
Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the 
 
courts.  However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy 
the  lack  of  clarity  that  exists  at  present  as  to  the  state  of  the 
applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release 
of whole life prisoners.” 

 

29.	  We  disagree.    In  our  view,  the  domestic  law  of  England  and  Wales  is  clear  as  to 
 
“possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners”.  As is set out in R v Bieber the 
Secretary  of  State  is  bound  to  exercise  his  power  under  s.30  of  the  1997  Act  in  a 
manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3.  

As we understand the Grand Chamber’s view, it might have been thought that the fact 
that policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. 
 
However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence.  It is important, 
therefore, that we make clear what the law of England and Wales is. 

First,  the  power  of  review  under  the  section  arises  if  there  are  exceptional 
circumstances.  The offender subject to the whole life order is therefore required to 
demonstrate  to  the  Secretary  of  State  that  although  the  whole  life  order  was  just 
punishment  at  the  time  the  order  was  made,  exceptional  circumstances  have  since 
arisen.  It is not necessary to specify what such circumstances are or specify criteria; 
the term “exceptional circumstances” is of itself sufficiently certain.

34.	 

 
35.	 

 
36.	 

Second,  the  Secretary  of  State  must  then  consider  whether  such  exceptional 
 
circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds.  The policy set out in the 
Lifer Manual is highly restrictive and purports to circumscribe the matters which will 
be considered by the Secretary of State.  The Manual cannot restrict the duty of the 
 
Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate 
grounds.  He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set 
out  in  the  Lifer  Manual.    In  the  passages  in  Hindley  to  which  we  have  referred  at 
 
paragraph 7 the duty of the Secretary of State was made clear; similarly the provisions 
of  s.30  of  the  1997  Act,  require  the  Secretary  of  State  to  take  in  to  account  all 
exceptional  circumstances  relevant  to  the  release  of  the  prisoner  on  compassionate 
 
grounds. 

Third, the term “compassionate grounds” must be read, as the court made clear in R v 
Bieber, in a manner compatible with Article 3.  They are not restricted to what is set 
out in the Lifer Manual.  It is a term with a wide meaning that can be elucidated, as is 
the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis. 

Fourth, the decision of the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the 
circumstances of each case and is subject to scrutiny by way of judicial review. 

In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender 
“hope” or the “possibility” of release in exceptional circumstances which render the 
just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.  

It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an 
individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so 
as to render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable.  We 
 
find it difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the 
 
heinous nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for 
 
life.  But circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases.  The interpretation of 
s.30  we  have  set  out  provides  for  that  possibility  and  hence  gives  to  each  such 
 
prisoner the possibility of exceptional release. 

Conclusion 

Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the CJA 2003 and 
in exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with 
Schedule 21.  Although we were told by Mr Eadie QC that it might be many years 
 
before the applications might be made under s.30 and the three applicants in Vinter 
(Vinter,  Bamber  and  Moore)  did  not  seek  to  contend  that  there  were  no  longer 
 
justifiable penological grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that 
we would not discount the possibility of such applications arising very much sooner. 
 
They will be determined in accordance with the legal principles we have set out.

38.	  We therefore turn to consider whether in these two cases, a whole life order ought to 

 

have been made. 

 

The reference by the Attorney General in the case of McLoughlin 

 
39.	 

On 21 October 2013 McLoughlin pleaded guilty to murder and to robbery.  He was 
 
sentenced by Sweeney J at the Central Criminal Court to life imprisonment for the 
offence  of  murder.  A  sentence  of  eight  years  imprisonment  concurrent  with  that 
 
sentence was passed for the robbery.  The judge fixed a minimum period of 40 years 
 
under s.269 (2) of the CJA 2003. 

(a)  The facts 

 

40.	  McLoughlin  who  was  born  on  31  May  1958  and  is  55  years  old,  had  a  previous 
history  of  serious  offending,  including  previous  convictions  for  manslaughter  and 
murder. 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

Between May 1970 and October 1983 he was sentenced on 14 occasions for 
various offences including burglary and theft. 

On  19  September  1984  he  was  convicted  of  manslaughter  and  sentenced  to 
 
eight years imprisonment.  He confronted a man, lost his temper, picked up a 
hammer and hit him several times over the head.  He tied a towel round the 
victim’s neck in the hope it would reduce the flow of blood.  It also reduced 
the noise of the hammer blows.  He hid the body in a cupboard. 

 
On 2 July 1992 he was convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment for 
 
a  minimum  term  of  14  years.    He  had  been  offered  accommodation  by  his 
victim and formed the view that the victim had a sexual interest in young boys.  
This  made  him  angry.    He  took  a  knife  and  marched  the  victim  into  his 
bedroom where he stabbed him several times, causing his death. 

 

 
41.	  Whilst  serving  that  sentence  of  life  imprisonment  at  HMP  Littlehay  in  December 
2011,  he  befriended  a  fellow  prisoner,  Mr  Cory-Wright.    He  learnt  that  Mr  Cory-
Wright  was  a  wealthy  man.    In  February  2013  Mr  Cory-Wright  was  released  and 
returned to his home in Little Gaddesden. 

On 13 July 2013 McLoughlin was released for the day from HMP Spring Hill near 
Aylesbury,  He went to the home of Mr Cory-Wright, then in his 80s, intending to get 
money and property from him by theft or robbery if necessary.  When he arrived Mr 
Cory-Wright invited him into his home and gave him a drink.  After some amicable 
conversation  McLoughlin  said  he  wanted  to  know  where  Mr  Cory-Wright  kept  his 
gold and silver.  When he was told it was in the bank he picked up a knife and forced 

 
42.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

Mr Cory-Wright upstairs and tied him up.  He then robbed him of valuables, his bank 
cards  and  PIN  numbers.    Mr  Cory-Wright  freed  himself  and  shouted  for  help.    A 
neighbour, Mr Buck, came to help, even though Mr Cory-Wright warned him not to 
do so.  McLoughlin came out of the house, grabbed Mr Buck and slashed his throat 
with a knife.  Mr Buck managed to escape to his own front garden but died before the 
emergency  services  could  attend.    Three  days  later  McLoughlin  was  arrested  in 
London, having spent the money he had stolen from Mr Cory-Wright.  In interview he 
admitted killing Mr Buck and robbing Mr Cory-Wright. 

 
43.	 

There was only one mitigating feature, namely his plea of guilty.  There were four 
aggravating  features.    First,  the  murder  was  committed  in  the  course  of  a  robbery. 
 
Second, he had the numerous previous convictions we have set out, including both the 
 
previous murder and the manslaughter to which we have referred.  Third, the robbery 
was premeditated, involved the use of a knife and was committed against a vulnerable 
victim in his own home.  Fourth, at the time, he was a prisoner serving the custodial 
 
part of the life sentence imposed on him for murder.  The judge also found it difficult 
 
to accept that he had not formed the intention of killing Mr Buck. 

 
44.	 

The court has before it a very moving personal impact statement from the widow of 
the victim. 

(b)  The decision of the judge 

 
45.	 

In the course of his sentencing remarks the judge said he had to decide whether there 
 
should be a whole life order or whether there should be a determinate minimum term. 
 
In deciding whether to impose a whole life order the judge referred to the decision in 
Vinter and said: 

“Given  that  there  is  a  duty  upon  the  court  imposed  by  the 
 
Human  Rights  Act  to  act  in  compliance  with  the  Convention 
and to take into account at the least of it the decisions of the 
Court.  And given that the 2003 Act does not require me to pass 
a whole life order, even though that is necessarily my starting 
point,  I  have  reached  the  conclusion  against  the  background 
that  is  incumbent  upon  me  to  pass  a  sentence  which  is 
compliant  with  the  Convention  if  I  can.    But  it  is  not 
appropriate to impose a whole life term.  However, even for a 
man of 55 years of age the minimum term of years must be a 
very long one indeed.” 

(c)  Our conclusion 

 
46.	 

In deciding that he did not want to be represented or make any submissions on the 
reference  by  the  Attorney  General,    McLoughlin  wrote  in  a  letter  to  his  lawyers 
placed before the court:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

“It is just that I believe I deserve the whole life tariff which the 
AG is seeking and that the family of Graham Buck deserves to 
 
know officially that I will never be released.” 

 
47.	 

It is clear that the judge did not think he had the power to make a whole life order.  He 
 
was, for the reasons we have given, in error.  His reasoning as to whether he should 
 
impose  a  whole  life  order  or  a  minimum  term  of  a  fixed  number  of  years,  had 
therefore proceeded on the assumption he had no such power.  

 

48.	  We  must  consider  the  matter  afresh.    The  judge  proceeded  on  the  basis  of  a 
misunderstanding of the law.  It is our duty to exercise our judgment free from that 
misunderstanding.    This  was  McLaughlin’s  second  conviction  for  murder.    The 
serious  aggravating  features  were  correctly  identified  by  the  judge.
  The  only 
mitigation was his admission and plea. 

 
49.	 

The approach to Schedule 21 has been made clear in numerous decisions of this court, 
as is summarised in R v Oakes at paragraph 21.  A court must only impose a whole 
life  order  if  the  seriousness  is  exceptionally  high  and  the  requirements  of  just 
punishment and retribution make such an order the just penalty.  As a second murder, 
it was a case for which the starting point is normally a whole life order.  In addition it 
had the aggravating features to which we have referred.  The only mitigation was his 
plea. 

 
50.	 

In our judgment this was a case where the seriousness was exceptionally high and just 
 
punishment required a whole life order.  A fixed minimum term of 40 years was for 
that reason unduly lenient.  We therefore quash the minimum term of 40 years and 
make a whole life order. 

The appeal by Newell 

 
51.	 

On  19  September  2013  Jeremy  Baker  J,  sitting  at  the  Crown  Court  at  Leamington 
Spa, sentenced Newell, who had been convicted of murder and theft, to imprisonment 
 
for life with a whole life order under s.269(4) of the CJA 2003.   

(a)  The facts 

Newell was born on 5 October 1968.  In 1986 and 1987 he had convictions for theft. 
  
On 17 January 1989 he was convicted at the Crown Court at Norwich of murder; he 
was sentenced to youth custody for life and his tariff period was subsequently fixed at 
15  years.  The  brief  facts  of  the  murder  were  that  he  obtained  entry  to  a  house  by 
deception, told the victim he wanted money and then strangled her to death.  Jeremy 
Baker J accepted, when passing the sentence in the case from which this appeal arises, 
that the murder may not have been planned.

56.	 

 
Newell  was  still  serving  that  life  sentence  when  in  February  2013,  with  another 
prisoner, Gary Smith, also serving a life sentence for murder he murdered a prisoner 
Subhan Anwar, aged 24, in HMP Long Lartin.  The deceased had been convicted of 
killing a young child and was considered by Newell and his fellow prisoners worthy 
of particular condemnation.   

On the evening of 14 February 2013 Newell and Smith followed the deceased into his 
cell  and  engaged  the  privacy  lock.    Each  had  taken  with  them,  as  improvised 
weapons,  a  sharpened  toothbrush  and  a  pen.    They  told  the  deceased  that  they 
intended to hold him hostage to bargain with the prison authorities.  The judge was 
satisfied this was merely a pretence in order to ensure that the deceased did not resist 
while they tied him up with sellotape. 
   

Once the deceased had been tied up, Newell used the deceased’s tracksuit bottoms as 
a  ligature  round  his  neck  and  strangled  him  to  death.    The  strangulation  took 
significantly in excess of half a minute to achieve.  Newell used the cell intercom to 
inform the prison authorities that the deceased was dead.  When Newell and Smith 
were asked why they had done it, they said it was because they were bored and it was 
 
something to do.  When they were taken from the cell both Smith and Newell were 
 
completely calm.  Each was wearing a piece of the deceased’s property which they 
had stolen from him - Newell was wearing a watch and Smith an earring.  The judge 
concluded  that  they  regarded  these  as  trophies  of  their  exploits.    Both  were  silent 
during police interviews and at trial.  

The judge stated he was satisfied there was nothing spontaneous about the murder, the 
killing was premeditated and Newell was heard to laugh about what occurred.  There 
 
was  no  mitigation  in  either  case.    The  judge  considered  a  whole  life  order  was 
 
required  as  this  had  been  a  cold  blooded  second  murder,  deliberately  lulling  the 
deceased into a false sense of security and killing him in a manner where he had taken 
a significant time to die.  They had shown no concern for anyone but themselves. 

(b)  Our conclusion 

Newell is now 45 years of age.  It was pointed out by Mr Stone QC that if the court 
were to fix a minimum term of 35 to 40 years as the appropriate fixed minimum term, 
he will be 80 to 85 before he is considered for release.  He had been in prison since 
1989.  In the circumstances, it was submitted that the court should not deprive him of 
all hope of atonement.   

Because this was a second murder, the starting point would normally be a whole life 
 
order.  The murder was premeditated and involved the use of an improvised weapon. 
It occurred in prison whilst Newell continued to serve a life sentence.  The deceased 
 
took a significant time to die.  There was no mitigation.  This was a murder where the 
seriousness of the offence was exceptionally high.  The judge was right in making a 
whole life order.  This appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Conclusion 

R v  Newell; R v McLoughlin 

 
59.	 

These  two  cases  are  exceptional  and  rare  cases  of  second  murders  committed  by 
persons serving the custodial part of a life sentence.  The making of a whole life order 
requires  detailed  consideration  of  the  individual  circumstances  of  each  case.    It  is 
likely to be rare that the circumstances will be such that a whole life order is required. 
  
Our decision on each case turns on its specific facts and cannot be seen as a guide to 
any similar case.",2014-02-17 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Males
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

David Sindall, you have been convicted of the murder of Dean Armitage. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dean Armitage was a 49 year old man who worked hard all his life to provide for his 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family. He was well regarded by all who knew him. The affection in which he was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  is  shown  by  the  large  number  of  people  who  attended  his  funeral  and  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered support to his family. He was married, with grown up children. His wife and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two daughters have spoken movingly in their victim statements of the heartbreak 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and emptiness which his premature death has caused, of the agony of having to sit 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by his bedside for three weeks waiting to see if there were any signs of recovery, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of how it felt when the doctors had to tell them that there was nothing more they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could do. 
  

 

 

While Dean Armitage was a man who built a business and a home for his family by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his hard work, you are a man who preferred to get things by stealing them. You are 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now 33 and have since your youth been a committed burglar as well as committing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many other crimes. 
  

 

 

 

On the night of Saturday 20 July going into the Sunday morning you had been out 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drinking. On your way home in the early hours you decided to burgle a house. You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had committed burglaries before in the area of Hoyland where the Armitage family
--------
lived. Although you claimed that you saw the door of their house ajar and that your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary of it was opportunistic and unplanned, I have no doubt that it was not. It 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may well be that you had been trying other doors along the road, but when you got 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  their  house  you  must  have  thought  you  had  got  lucky.  You  found  the  door 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlocked,  you  entered  and  stole  what  you  could  see  –  a  handbag,  some  bags  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shopping  and  the  keys  to  the  family  Range  Rover  which  was  parked  in  the  drive, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although in the dark you managed to miss a roll of banknotes. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was when you were sitting in the Range Rover trying to put it into gear that Dean 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Armitage was woken up from sleep by the sound of the engine. He rushed out to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defend his property, as he was entitled to do. He grabbed hold of you and a verbal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange took place. I have no doubt that it was you who uttered the threat “I’m 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gonna show thee” which can be heard on the audio recording of this incident which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  picked  up  by  a  neighbour’s  equipment.  That  was  intended  as  a  threat.  You 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried out your threat, with tragic consequences. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dean Armitage was able to pull you out of the car. At that point you raised your right 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arm and brought it down with a heavy blow to the left side of his head. You had with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  a  torch  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  your  burglary  and  that  was what you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck  him  with.  The  blow  caused  Dean  Armitage  to  lose  his  balance  and  he  fell 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backwards, pulling you down on top of him and striking his head either against the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground  or  against  a  wall. That accelerated fall was the  fatal  impact,  fracturing  his 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skull.  You  got  up  and,  as  you  did  so,  you  punched  Dean  Armitage  in  the  jaw  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kicked him in the body, both with  considerable force. Without a thought for your 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim, who was now lying insensible and bleeding on the ground, but thinking only 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of yourself, you ran off. As you did so, you literally added insult to injury by shouting 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foul mouthed abuse at him. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Dean Armitage never recovered consciousness and died three weeks later. Because 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your conduct what had been a happy family day visiting friends for a barbecue 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ended in this horrific way. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
While  you  did  not  intend  to  kill  Dean  Armitage,  the  jury  have  found  that  you  did 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend to cause him grievous bodily harm and are therefore guilty of murder. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The sentence for murder is fixed by law and is a sentence of imprisonment for life, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  must  also  set  the  minimum  term  which  you  must  serve  before  you  can  be 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered for release on licence. I emphasise that this is a minimum term. It does 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not mean that you will be released after that time. Whether or when you will be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released will be for the Parole Board to determine. You will only be released if the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board is satisfied that you can be released without risk to public safety and, in any 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

event, once you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of your life and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable to recall if you offend again or breach the terms of your licence. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All murder is very serious, but this offence falls into a category which Parliament has 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterised as being of particularly high seriousness. It was a murder done for gain 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the course of a burglary and an attempt to steal the Armitages’ car. In such a case 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statutory starting point is a minimum term of 30 years. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, as the cases make clear, this is only a starting point. The statutory starting 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points must be applied with flexibility, with careful consideration of the facts of each 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  case,  and  they  are  subject  to  adjustment  to  take  account  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances of each case. What I have to do is to pass a sentence which reflects as 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  as  it  can  the  gravity  of  what  you  have  done  and  your  culpability,  although 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing I do or say can lessen the pain which the Armitage family are suffering and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with which they will have to continue to live. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  a number  of  factors present here which  aggravate  your  conduct. These 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  your  numerous  previous  convictions,  including  convictions  for  burglary  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both dwellings and non‐dwellings, and offences of violence including participation in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  armed  robbery.  Indeed  it  was  in  part  because  you  knew  that  on  a  further 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction for burglary of a dwelling you would face the mandatory minimum term 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  were  prepared  to  use  violence  when  you  were  apprehended,  although 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there had also been previous occasions when you were prepared to offer violence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
when apprehended in the course of a burglary. The fact that you committed these 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offences  while  on  bail  and  also  during  the  period  when  you  were  subject  to  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspended sentence is also a serious aggravating factor, demonstrating as you have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during most of your life a complete disregard for the requirements of the law and of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court orders made against you. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

That said, I recognise (as did the prosecution in the course of your trial) that you did 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not intend to kill Dean Armitage, but to cause him grievous bodily harm, and that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your use of violence was not premeditated. The statutory starting point is premised 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon an intention to kill and these are mitigating factors which I am required by the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  legal  framework  to  take  into  account.  Moreover,  the  cases  have  also 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognised that there is a significant difference in the culpability of a criminal who 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sets out to kill, if that is necessary to achieve his ends, and one who uses violence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with fatal results when unexpectedly apprehended in the course of his crime. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
That latter position is closer to the position here, albeit that you cannot have been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unaware of the risk of being apprehended, and had no qualms about using violence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you needed to to make good an escape. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taking all of these matters into account, I conclude that the appropriate minimum 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term which you must serve is 24 years less the time that you have spent on remand 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in custody. 
 

 

 

I also have to deal with you for various other matters, although in the light of the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence which you will serve for murder they are largely academic. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I activate the suspended sentence of 9 months imprisonment passed against you by 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  court  on  12  March  2013  for  two  offences  of  burglary  and  two  of  attempted 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary. 
  

 

I  sentence  you  to  9  months  for  each  of  the  offences  of  theft  of  a  motor  vehicle 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed on 11 June 2013 for which you have been committed to this court.

--------
I impose no separate penalty for the possession of cannabis. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those sentences will all be concurrent. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For  the  murder  of  Dean  Armitage  I  sentence  you  to  life  imprisonment  with  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum term of 24 years less the time which you have spent on remand in custody.

Sentencing Remarks by Mr Justice Singh
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

[The Defendants may remain seated for now.] 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Introduction 
 

 

1.	  This is on any view a tragic case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.	  The  Defendants  have  both  pleaded  guilty  to  the  offence  of  gross  negligence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manslaughter. They were the parents of Ndingeko Kunene, who was born on 1 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

January 2012.  He died on 14 June 2012. He was found to have been suffering 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from florid rickets resulting from severe vitamin D deficiency. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.	  Although at one point it was not entirely clear, it has become clear as a result of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussions that have taken place between the parties during the course of this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing hearing that there are no material disputes of fact.  Those discussions 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have led to further written bases of plea being filed by both Defendants today. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Crown  opened  the  hearing  on  the  basis  of  its  Case  Summary.  The  facts, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events  and  dates  set  out  in  that  summary  are  not  disputed  on  behalf  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendants, although they have drawn attention to certain other matters in their

detail.  I hope it will suffice for present purposes if I summarise the facts. 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Factual summary 
 

 

4.	  From  birth  Ndingeko  had  medical  problems.  On  the  day  he  was  born  he  was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moved for a day or two to the Special Care Baby Unit because of his low weight 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  difficulty  in  establishing  breast feeding. However, he was discharged from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital on 6 January.  A care plan was put in place for visits by Social Services 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and community midwives. Before he was discharged, the Defendants said that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would bring him to hospital if he was unwell.  It is emphasised on behalf of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Defendants that Ndingeko’s vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed at that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage, nor was Mrs Kunene given advice about taking supplements, which would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  important  in  particular  because  she  was  going  to  breastfeed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively and in view of her ethnic origins and her vegan diet. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.	  Over the following weeks Ndingeko was visited by health visitors on a number of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasions.  However, Mrs Kunene did not attend the scheduled 8 week check up 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 8 March and Ndigeko was not seen by a health care professional again before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 June. 
 

 

 

6.	  From April 2012 it was appreciated by the Defendants that their son was unwell. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, his health fluctuated over the next two months.  Although he was not 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visited by healthcare professionals as such, Mrs Kunene’s sister is a midwife and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did visit on occasion.  On 9 April she noted that Ndingeko had apparently lost 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight and his breathing was wheezy.  She and another relative, who is a health 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visitor, expressed concerns more than once and asked Mrs Kunene to consult her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
GP.  She said that she would do so but would speak to her husband first.  It is 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that, because of their own religious beliefs, the Defendants did not in fact 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek  medical  assistance,  nor  did  they  seek  advice  for  example  from  the  NHS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Direct helpline. 
 

 

 

7.	  Both  Defendants  are  strict  Seventh  Day  Adventists.  However,  their  views  (in 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular Mr Kunene’s) appear to be very extreme and do not reflect the official 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine of that church.  On the other hand, it has been emphasised on behalf of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Defendants  and,  in  particular  Mrs  Kunene,  that  they  have  not  refused  all 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical  interventions  at  all  times.  For  example,  a  vitamin  K  injection  was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted shortly after the birth although it had initially been refused. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.	  On 14 June 2012 Mr Kunene arrived home at around noon having done a night 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shift and was told that Ndingeko was not feeding properly. He noticed that his 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

son’s health had deteriorated. He appreciated that this was something serious 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that his son might be close to death. He thought that he was suffering from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

low blood sugar and was dehydrated, so he prepared a solution of salt and water 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for him. Ndingeko took this and straight afterwards breastfed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.	  Mr Kunene went to bed at about 3:00 pm. Shortly afterwards Mrs Kunene took 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their son upstairs to have a nap and laid him in bed next to his father. Mr Kunene 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waited until his son fell asleep before allowing himself to follow. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10. Later  Mr  Kunene  was  woken  by  his  wife,  who  said  Ndingeko  was  lifeless.  Mr 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kunene took his son downstairs and tried CPR to no avail. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
The admitted offence of manslaughter 
 

 

 

 

 

11. Importantly, Mr Kunene accepts, as he said in interview, that he realised when 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he returned from work that day that Ndingeko might die and decided not to call 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  medical  assistance.  On  that  basis  he  accepts  that  he  is  guilty  of  gross 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligence manslaughter. 
 

 

12. Mr Kunene accepts that he advised his wife that it would be a sin in the eyes of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

God to call for medical assistance as he had made a vow that he would await 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance from God before doing so. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

13. Mrs Kunene has, in a written basis of plea which is agreed by the Crown, pleaded 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty to the offence of gross negligence manslaughter only on the basis of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

omission to act to call for medical attention on 14 June itself. She accepts that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she realised that her baby was very unwell and at risk of death but did so only on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that day. She adds that on that day itself she did wish to seek medical attention 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the baby but Mr Kunene said that this would be a sin. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14. Mrs Kunene says that  her  religious  convictions  were  a  significant  factor in  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  to  her  husband’s  view  that  medical  attention  should  not  be  sought 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and her omission to call for medical attention. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Legislation and guidelines 
 

 

 

15. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is life imprisonment. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16. By  virtue  of  section  143(1)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  this  court  must 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider an offender’s culpability as well as any harm which the offence caused. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17. There is no specific guideline issued by the Sentencing Council or its predecessor 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for gross negligence manslaughter. However, general guidance is to be found in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
the guideline issued by the former Sentencing Guidelines Council on ‘Overarching 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles: seriousness’. 
 

 

18. It is not suggested on behalf of the Crown that an indeterminate sentence would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

be justified in this case. Nevertheless it is suggested that Schedule 21 to the 2003 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  is  of  some  relevance.  This  is  because  it  provides  a  clear  indication  by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parliament of its wish to see sentences for homicide increase by comparison to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the previous position. As Lord Judge CJ said in R v Wood [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 2, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at para 23: “this coincides with increased levels of sentence for offences resulting 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  death,  such  as  causing  death  by  dangerous  driving  and  causing  death  by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careless driving. Parliament’s intention seems clear: crimes which result in death 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be treated more seriously and dealt with more severely than before.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19. In  R  v  Reeves  [2013]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  21,  which  was  a  case  of  gross  negligence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manslaughter, at para 13, Treacy LJ said: “it is now beyond argument that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect of the Criminal Justice Act has been to lift the level of sentencing in such 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases… In short, the fact that a death has resulted from criminal conduct is to be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  rather  greater  recognition  than  hitherto.  Of  course  all  cases  are  fact 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific but the principle holds good. What might have been seen as a general 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicative figure of two to two and a half years after a trial for this kind of case in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the past can no longer apply.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

20. The court explained that the death of the victim was by definition  great harm 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that on the facts of that case the Appellant’s culpability was high since she 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had totally abandoned her responsibilities as a mother. In that case there was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigation in the form of the Appellant’s previous good character and absence of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any other suggestion of ill treatment of her children. A sentence of 3 years and 9 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
months after a guilty plea was upheld on the basis that the starting point after 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial would have been 5 years and a discount of 25% was appropriate given its 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timing. 
 

21. The  Crown  submit  (and  I  accept)  that  some  indirect  assistance  can  be  gained 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council on offences of child cruelty. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  Ndingeko’s  life  had  been  saved,  the  Crown  submit  (and  I  accept)  that  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendants’ conduct before 14 June 2012 would have fallen at least within the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third level of that guideline. For that level the guideline suggests a starting point 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after trial of 36 weeks imprisonment and a range of 26 weeks to 2 years, where 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the offence involves more than one incident of neglect, not amounting to long‐

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term behaviour, or a single incident of long‐term abandonment.  However, in the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present case, there was the additional significant fact that Ndingeko died and the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendants accept that they are guilty of manslaughter. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aggravating and mitigating features 
 

 

 

 

22. In my view, the aggravating features of this case are these: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) The victim, as a baby, was particularly vulnerable. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) The Defendants failed to heed warnings from relatives that they should seek 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical help from April 2012 onwards at a time when he was apparently unwell. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23. It is accepted on all sides that the following are mitigating features: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

(1)  The good character of each Defendant.	  Mr Kunene is now 36 years of age 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Mrs Kunene is 32.  They are a dedicated and humble couple. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2)  The  fact  that  the  Defendants  were  otherwise  apparently  good  and  caring 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents of their son. 
 

 

 

 

 

6
--------
(3)  The complete absence of any evidence to suggest that Ndingeko had been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assaulted or ill treated by his parents. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4)  Not only have the Defendants lost their first child, Mrs Kunene has since had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a miscarriage. 
 
 

24. I  have  taken  into  account  Professor  Nussey’s  evidence  that  both  the  Darent 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Valley  Hospital  and  Northumberland  Medical  Centre  played  a  part  in  failing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  to  advise  the  Defendants  and  to  prescribe  vitamin  D  supplements 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(Ergocalciferol). The necessity and use of that supplement (which are suitable for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vegans and all the more important as Mrs Kunene is of African origin) was never 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  to  either  of  the  Defendants. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

I  have  also  taken  into  account  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  Dr  Allgrove  and  Dr  Barnard  in  this  context.  As  I  have  already 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, Ndingeko’s vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed in the early days 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after his birth and before he was discharged from the neo‐natal unit. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Pre‐Sentence Reports 
 

 

 

25. I have read the pre‐sentence reports in the case of each defendant. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

26. The  report  in  respect  of  Mr  Kunene  realistically  accepts  that  an  immediate 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

custodial sentence is likely in this case.  On his behalf counsel has urged me to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider suspending any custodial sentence. 
 

 

 

 

 

27. The report in respect of Mrs Kunene also accepts that immediate custody is a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real possibility but suggests that consideration be given to whether the sentence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  suspended.  This  has  been  urged  upon  the  court  by  counsel  on  her 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behalf at the hearing before me. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

28. I am unable to accept those submissions in view of the seriousness of this case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

7
--------
Appropriate sentence 
 

 

29. As I have already said, the sentence must fit the facts of each case.	  I accept that 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was not as serious a case as that in Reeves on its facts.  Nevertheless, the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  have  by  their  pleas  accepted  that  they  were  guilty  not  just  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligence  but  gross  negligence.  Furthermore,  they  accept  that  they  realised 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  risk  to  Ndigeko’s  life,  at  least  on  14  June  itself.  They  had  a 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  high  degree  of  responsibility  for  his  health  and  welfare,  as  his 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents, but they decided not to call for medical assistance that day.  I accept 
 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Mr Kunene’s culpability was higher than that of Mrs Kunene, who wanted to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call for medical assistance that day but deferred to his view.  Furthermore, the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background of the preceding two months is important.  Although the Defendants 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not appreciate the risk of death, they did realise that their son was unwell 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but did not seek or obtain medical assistance. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30. The secular courts of this country apply the secular law of the land.  They do so 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally to all who come before them.  The law respects the right of everyone to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

freedom of thought and belief.  However the right to manifest one’s religion is 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not absolute.  It is limited in particular by the rights of others.  The state has a 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child is concerned. 
 

 

 

31. In  my  view,  having  regard  to  all  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  including 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating and mitigating features, the appropriate sentence after trial would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been 4 years for Mr Kunene; and 3 years for Mrs Kunene.  This is because of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the difference in their degree of culpability, for reasons I have already set out. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------
32. I propose to give them about 25% credit for their guilty pleas.  I do not give full 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

credit of one third in view of the time at which the pleas were entered, which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  few  weeks  before  the  trial  date  but  not  at  the  earliest  reasonable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity.  This is in fact greater than would normally be the case for pleas 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered relatively close to the trial date but this is because the Crown have urged 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  me  that  a  more  generous  approach  is  justified  in  this  case,  since  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendants’  pleas  in  substance  reflect  admissions  they  made  to  the  police  at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  interviews  and  because  discussions  between  counsel  were  taking  place 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the possibility of pleas being entered before they were. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[The Defendants should now stand.] 
 

 

 

 

 

 

33. Mr Kunene: the sentence of the court is imprisonment of 3 years. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34. Mrs Kunene: the sentence is imprisonment of 2 years and 3 months. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35. Unless released earlier, each of you will serve one half of your sentence and will 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then be released on licence until the end of your sentence.  While on licence you 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be liable to recall by the Secretary of State. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[The Defendants can be taken down.] 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Postscript 
 

36. There  is  one  further  aspect  of  this  case  which  I  should  mention.	  Ndingeko 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kunene’s case was known to Social Services and health authorities from an early 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9
--------
stage in his life.  I have been informed that a Serious Case Review has already 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken place and is due to report shortly. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37. It  is  to  be  hoped  that  all  necessary  enquiries  will  have  been  made  by  those 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

authorities to establish that everything was done to protect Ndingeko’s life that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could reasonably have been done. 
 

 

 

 

 

38. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further since I have not heard 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

what others who are not parties to these proceedings and are not represented in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court may have to say about these matters.

owner the Bismallah Food Store, a small supermarket and Halal meat shop serving the Eastwood 

area of Rotherham. He was a friendly and popular member of the community who was well liked 

and respected by his employees, his customers and all who knew him, as shown by the very large 

number of people who attended his funeral. You yourself have described him, in a letter which 

your counsel read today, as “a very good man” and it appears from the material before me that 

that is exactly what he was. 

 

His  brother  Shafaq  Iqbal  has  provided  a  victim  statement  in  which  he  speaks  on  behalf  of  all 

those, including Parvais’s wife and three sons, who wanted to speak of the effect which Parvaiz 

Iqbal’s death has had upon them. He speaks, not surprisingly, of the pain and suffering felt by 

those who knew and loved Parvaiz and how they are having difficulty coming to terms with the 

premature  and  violent  death  of  the  head  of  their  family.  He  feels  they  have  a  life  of  grieving 

ahead of them and speaks too of the way in which their strong faith is helping them all through 

this time.  

 

Your second victim, Saied Husseine, was aged 44 and was an assistant at the store. He too has 

provided a statement describing the pain which he still suffers, both day and night, and saying 

that  the  doctors  can  give  him  no  assurance  as  to  when  this  pain  will  ease.  In  addition  to  the 

physical effects of your attack upon him he reports that he suffers from nightmares as a result of 

it.
--------
Although nothing I do or say can take away the grief of Parvais Iqbal’s family or the pain suffered 

by Saied Husseine, I have taken both these statements into account. 

 

You are now aged 27, with no previous convictions. You came to this country from Pakistan in 

May 2011 and in about June 2013 obtained work at the Bismallah Food Store in Rotherham, a 

small supermarket and Halal meat shop jointly owned by Mr Iqbal and his brother Shafaq. From 4 

August you were absent from work as a result of having severed the top of your right index finger 

in a cutting machine whilst working in the store, but you returned to work on 14 October and 

were welcomed back by Mr Iqbal, who arranged for you to be given a lift home at the end of the 

day. Although you were later to complain about your treatment by Mr Iqbal, I can see no valid 

basis for any such complaint and it is clear not only that there was little or no difficulty between 

you  when  you  returned  to  work  but  also  that  on  the  following  day,  15  October,  all  those 

employed  within  the  store  were  in  good  spirits  because  of  the  commencement  of  the  Eid 

celebrations.  

 

It was on that day, however, at about 2 pm, that you killed Mr Iqbal in a savage and unprovoked 

attack  in  the  walk‐in  freezer  section  of  the  Bismallah  store.  You  followed  him  into  the  freezer 

section, taking a knife with you, determined to kill him. He was unarmed and defenceless. You 

stabbed  him  a  total  of  51  times,  beginning  with  a  stab  in  the  back.  When  interviewed  by  the 

police you claimed that you had acted in self defence, but that contention was nonsense and was 

quickly abandoned. In all you stabbed Mr Iqbal five times to the back of his body, 19 times to the 

head and neck, and 20 times to the front of his torso. There were in addition multiple injuries to 

his arms and hands as he tried unsuccessfully to defend himself. You continued to stab him after 

he  collapsed  to  the  ground.  Many  of  the  stab  wounds  on  Mr  Iqbal’s  body,  head  and  neck 

penetrated deeply. The force with which you inflicted these injuries was so severe that several of 

his ribs were fractured and major damage was caused to his heart, lungs and other vital internal 

organs.  

 

At some point while this was going on Mr Husseine, an assistant at the store whom you had met 

for the first time the day before, heard a moaning noise from the freezer section. It is apparent, 

therefore, that Mr Iqbal was still conscious, and no doubt in great pain. Mr Husseine opened the 

door and saw Mr Iqbal on the floor covered in blood and you standing over him. He asked what 

the problem was and you shouted at him to get out. You then ran forward and stabbed him to 

 

2
--------
the  stomach,  cutting  an  artery.  Mr  Husseine  managed  to  escape  from  the  freezer  area  and 

shouted at others to call the emergency services.  

 

You turned back to continue your attack on Mr Iqbal. Your final blow struck Mr Iqbal’s chest with 

such force that you were unable to remove the knife from his body. The blade, which was 18cm 

long, was plunged in almost to the hilt. The whole episode last for a minute and a half. 

 

As  you  left  the  store  you  picked  up  another  large  knife,  a  meat  cleaver,  from  the  meat 

preparation area. It was described by some witnesses as a machete and was 25.5 cm in length. 

You smashed glass counters within the store, holding the knife above your head in both hands 

and  bringing  it  down  with  considerable  force.  You  were  shouting  and  swearing  in  front  of 

customers and youngsters within the store, causing them to fear for their lives. Still armed, and 

with  Mr  Iqbal’s  blood  on  your  arms  and  hands,  you  left  the  store  and  made  your  way  up 

Grosvenor  Road,  smashing  the  windows  of  seven  vehicles  on  your  way  and  terrifying  the 

members  of  the  public  who  saw  you.  You  smashed  the  front  window  of  a  barber’s  shop  on 

Fitzwilliam  Road  showering  customers  with  glass.  You  brandished  your  knife  at  the  proprietor 

and  threatened  to  kill  him.  You  made  similar  bloodthirsty  threats  to  others  while  holding  the 

knife.  You  made  your  way  to  the  car  park  of  a  nearby  Tesco  store  as  the  police  arrived.  Chief 

Inspector Ian Wormesley saw you still in possession of the knife, but at risk to his own life ran 

towards you and instructed you to drop it. You complied and were arrested. 

 

This was a brutal, sustained and unprovoked attack, beginning with a cowardly stab in the back 

with a lethal weapon. It involved a degree of premeditation on your part as you took the knife 

into the freezer area of the store intending to use it to kill Mr Iqbal. It was very nearly a double 

murder as the injury to Mr Husseine was life threatening and it was only the skill of the doctors 

who operated on him which saved  his life. The aftermath, as  you left  the store and rampaged 

down the road in broad daylight for about ten minutes leaving a trail of destruction behind you, 

caused real and understandable fear to many members to the public. Why you acted as you did is 

not apparent. It may be that you were reacting to what you perceived, with no justification at all, 

as some kind of slight or that you harboured some kind of grudge. But in any event there is not 

the slightest excuse for what you did. 

 

The question might arise whether someone who acted in this barbaric way was suffering from 

some  mental  disorder  or  disability,  but  you  have  no  history  of  mental  illness  and  the  medical 

 

3
--------
experts  who  examined  you  after  your  arrest  and  have  examined  you  since  have  found  no 

evidence of any mental difficulties which might explain your conduct. 

 

The sentence for murder is fixed by law and is a sentence of imprisonment for life, but I must also 

set the minimum term which you must serve before you can be considered for release on licence. 

I emphasise that this is a minimum term. It does not mean that you will be released after that 

time. Whether or when you will be released will be for the Parole Board to determine. You will 

only be released if the Board is satisfied that you can be released without risk to public safety 

and, in any event, once you are released you will remain on licence for the rest of your life and 

liable to recall if you offend again or breach the terms of your licence. It is apparent from your 

conduct in this case that you are a very dangerous man and present a considerable risk to public 

safety. But the minimum term which I have to set is not concerned with that, but only with the 

appropriate punishment for what you have done. 

 

All murder is very serious, but the seriousness of this offence was particularly high. It involved a 

savage  and  ferocious  attack  with  a  lethal  weapon,  premeditation  and  gratuitous  violence 

continuing well after Mr Iqbal was bleeding to death on the floor. There was also a deliberate and 

murderous attack on Mr Husseine which could very easily have caused his death. Your conduct as 

you left the store and proceeded along the road, terrifying and threatening innocent members of 

the public as you went, was a serious aggravating factor. 

 

 I  consider  that  the  appropriate  starting  point  for  this  offence,  taking  account  of  all  these 

circumstances, is a minimum term of the order of 30 years, although any starting point is subject 

to adjustment to take account of the particular circumstances of the case. In reaching this figure I 

have taken account of the aggravating factors which I have mentioned.  

 

Your counsel has submitted that the correct starting point for the minimum term should be 25 

years,  on  the  basis  that  you  took  a  knife  to  the  scene.  In  my  judgment  it  makes  little  or  no 

difference whether this is a case where the aggravating features make a 30 year starting point 

appropriate  or  whether  it  should  be  a  starting  point  of  25  years  aggravated  by  the  frenzied 

nature of your attack on Mr Iqbal which was premeditated, your attack on Mr Husseine, and your 

subsequent  conduct  in  the  shop  and  in  the  street.  For  the  reasons  I  have  given,  however,  I 

propose to take a starting point of 30 years and to reduce it by such mitigation as there is.  

 

 

4
--------
As to mitigation, there are some mitigating factors in your case, but they do not amount to much. 

You have pleaded guilty, and I give you some credit for that, but there was never any doubt that 

you killed Mr Iqbal and once the possibility of any defence based on your mental state was ruled 

out,  the  eventual  outcome  of  the  case  was  inevitable.  You  have  no  previous  convictions  or 

history of violence, which is to some extent a point in your favour, and you did eventually drop 

the knife when instructed by the police to do so rather than cause still worse mayhem. But this 

was only after the death, injury and damage which you had already caused. 

 

Taking  these  matters  into  account,  I  conclude  that  the  appropriate  minimum  term  which  you 

must serve is 27 years less the time that you have spent on remand in custody. 

 

I  must  also  sentence  you  for  the  injury  which  you  inflicted  on  Mr  Husseine.  This  is  an  offence 

which clearly falls into the most serious category of its kind, involving (as will be obvious from 

what I have already said) life threatening injury and high culpability. It is unnecessary to rehearse 

again the aggravating features of this case. After giving credit for your guilty plea the sentence on 

this count will be 10 years, concurrent with the sentence passed on count 1. 

 

The sentence which I pass on you on count 1 is life imprisonment with a minimum term of 27 

years  less  the  time  that  you  have  spent  on  remand  in  custody.  On  count  3  the  sentence  is  10 

years concurrent. The statutory surcharge provisions will apply. 

 

You may go down. 

 

Finally, I have mentioned already the conduct of Chief Inspector Ian Wormesley who put his own 

life at risk in tackling this defendant who was still in possession of a knife or meat cleaver and had 

demonstrated  that  he  was  prepared  to  use  it  to  kill  or  wound.  I  would  like  to  commend  his 

bravery, presence of mind and devotion to duty which enabled the arrest to take place without 

more  violence  and  suffering  to  innocent  people  of  a  highly  dangerous  man  who  posed  a 

considerable threat to both members of the public and other police officers.

Sentencing Remarks of Coulson J
 
   

 

 

 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

 
 
1.	 

On 17 September, 2012, Lydia Bishop, who was just 3, died on her first day at the nursery 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run by York College.  She was found on the slide with her neck in a loop of rope, the loop 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being part of a longer piece of rope attached to and dangling down the slide.  The evidence 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was that, unsupervised, she had gained access to the slide, which was in the furthest corner 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the playground, bypassing the ineffective barrier designed to indicate that this area was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of bounds, and caught her neck in the loop as she went down the slide.  Because no‐one 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had seen her, she lay for a period of 20 minutes with the loop around her neck and her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body positioned, feet‐first, down the slide, before anyone realised she was missing.  By the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time that happened, she was dead. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

Proceedings  were  brought  against  Ms  Sophee  Redhead,  the  Early  Years  Practitioner 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervising  Lydia  that  afternoon,  and  against  York  College.  The  charges  against  Ms 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Redhead, for gross negligence manslaughter and, in the alternative, for breaches of Health 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Safety of Work Act 1974, were unanimously rejected by the jury in their verdict on 6 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

February 2014.  At the same time, York College were unanimously convicted of a breach of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  sentencing  York  College,  I  have  reminded  myself  of  certain  sections  of  the  Criminal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”), and the particular principles applicable to the sentencing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a company for an offence against Health and Safety legislation.  The relevant principles

were recently summarised by the Lord Chief Justice in R v Sellafield Limited and Network 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rail Infrastructure Limited [2014] EWCA Crim 49.  In particular, I note: 
  

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(a)	 

In considering the seriousness of the offence the court must have regard to the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culpability  of  the  offender  and  the  harm  caused  or  which  might  reasonably  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused (section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003); 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)	  A  fine  must  have  regard  not  only  to  the  purposes  of  sentencing  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriousness of the offence but must also take into account the matters set out in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  164  of  the  2003  Act  (which  include  the  financial  circumstances  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  or  company,  which  can  either  increase  or  reduce  the  amount  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine). 
   

I  have  also  had  regard  to  the  Definitive  Guideline  of  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council, 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corporate Manslaughter and Health and Safety Offences Causing Death published in 2010. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section B, entitled ‘Factors Likely to Affect Seriousness’, contains the following important 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passage: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

“5. This guidelines applies only to corporate manslaughter and to those health and 
 
safety offences where the offences shown to have been a significant cause of the 
 
death.  By definition, the harm involved is very serious. 
   
6.  Beyond  that,  the  possible  range  of  factors  affecting  the  seriousness  of  the 
 
offence will be very wide indeed.  Seriousness should ordinarily be assessed first 
 
by asking: 
  
(a) How foreseeable was serious injury? 
 
The more foreseeable it was, the graver usually will be the offence. 
 
   
(b) How far short of the applicable standard did the defendant fall? 
 
(c) How common is this kind of breach in this organisation? 
 
How widespread was the non‐compliance?  Was it isolated in extent or indicative 
 
 
of a systematic departure from good practice across the defendant’s operations? 
   
 
(d) How far up the organisation does the breach go? 
 
Usually  the  higher  up  the  responsibility  for  the  breach,  the  more  serious  the 
 
offence.” 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paragraph  B7  lists  various  possible  aggravating  factors,  which  include  a  failure  to  heed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warnings  or  advice,  and  injury  to  vulnerable  persons.  Paragraph  B8  identifies  various 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible mitigating factors, including a high level of co‐operation with the investigation, a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good health and safety record and a responsible attitude to health and safety. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section C is concerned with the necessary financial information that the organisation must 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  forward  and  warns  that  a  fixed  correlation  between  the  fine  and  either  turnover  or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit  is  not  appropriate.  Paragraph  C/19  identifies  a  whole  serious  of  factors  the  court

2. CONTEXT 
 

should consider when assessing the financial consequences of a fine, including the effect on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  called  ‘the  employment  of  the  innocent’  and  the  effect  on  shareholders,  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directors and the provision of services to the public.  Paragraph C/19(viii) requires the court 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to consider whether the fine will have the effect of putting the defendant out of business. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section D is concerned with the level of fines.  Paragraph 25 provides: 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“The range of seriousness involved in health and safety offences is greater than for 
 
corporate  manslaughter.  However,  where  the  offence  is  shown  to  have  caused 
 
death,  the  appropriate  fine  will  seldom  be  less  than  £100,000  and  may  be 
 
measured in hundreds of thousands of pounds or more.” 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section I of the guideline summarises the proper approach to sentence. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

My attention has also been drawn to a number of decisions which pre‐date the guideline, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including R v Howe [1999] 2 Cr App R(S) 37 and R v Yorkshire Sheeting and Insulation Ltd 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[2003] EWCA Crim 458, and two decisions of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post‐date the guideline, namely R v Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd [2012] EWCA Crim 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2670 and R v D Roche Ltd [2013] EWCA Crim 993. Both of these latter cases involved fatal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breaches of the 1974 Act. In the former case, the fine of £350,015 was upheld by the Court 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Appeal; in the latter, on a guilty plea following the death of an 80 year old woman, the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine was reduced on appeal to £70,000. But I also remind myself that, in paragraph 7 of his 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment in Sellafield, the Lord Chief Justice noted that “the size of the penalty will depend 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the facts of each case.” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Nothing  that  I say  in  the  remainder of  these  sentencing  remarks can  provide  comfort  or 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recompense for Lydia’s death; a child is priceless, so the loss of a child is an irredeemable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss. I have read the victim impact of Rebecca Dick, Lydia’s mother, and it speaks eloquently 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  her  loss  and  the  breach  of  trust  for  which  she  blames  the  College.  The  fixing  of  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate fine in a case like this is not concerned at all with putting a value on Lydia’s life. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I would, at the outset, like to pay tribute to Lydia’s family who sat in the public gallery 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  this  trial,  and  behaved  at  all  times  with  dignity  and  restraint. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  has  been  a 
 

 

 

 

shattering experience for them, and I would like to pass on the Court’s admiration for their 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courage and its best wishes for the future.

Equally,  nothing  I  say  is  intended  to  diminish  York  College’s  hard‐won  reputation  as  an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outstanding college of further education which makes an extremely important and valuable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contribution  to  the  life  of  the  city.  The  failures  that  occurred  here  (which  I  am  sure  will 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never happen again) should not be allowed to obscure the obvious benefits that the College 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides to its students and the wider community. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. THE PARTICULAR FAILURES 
 

 

 

 

 
10.	 

 
11.	 

 
12.	 

 
13.	 

 
14.	 

 

The first step is to set out the particular failures on the part of York College which caused 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lydia’s death.  For the reasons set out below, I consider that York College were guilty of two 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious failings, one specific and one systemic.  Those failings were the more tragic because 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  took  place  against  a  backdrop  of  the  generally  careful  and  thoughtful  approach  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health and safety matters at the College, a matter to which I shall later return. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The specific failure concerned access to the slide.  The playground around the nursery was 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an inverted L shape, with most of the equipment in the area in front of the three rooms that 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made up the nursery building.  But the playground also extended down at right angles from 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the main area, the narrow down‐stroke of the inverted L, which comprised little more than 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a path leading to a slide right at the end of the playground. 
 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The slide was placed on a mound and there were steps up the mound to the platform from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the children could then use the slide to get back down to ground level.  The CCTV 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footage  from  17  September  2012,  and  the  evidence  of  some  of  the  supervisors  at  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursery,  made  plain  that  the  slide  was  probably  the  most  popular  feature  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

playground. 
 

However, its location caused a problem of supervision.  The slide was most popular with the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Investigators (children from 2 to 3) and Buccaneers (children from 3 to 5).  Neither of their 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rooms in the nursery building itself overlooked the slide.  Furthermore, because the slide 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was tucked right at the far end of the inverted L shaped space, it was not visible from the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

main part of the playground either. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

The slide could be seen from the sandpit, which was in the angle of the inverted L, but even 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then the view was not perfect, there being plants and equipment between the sandpit and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the slide. Anyone standing there would be some way from the slide itself.  Moreover, from 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sandpit, it was not possible to see the far side of either the slide or the mound on which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was based.  In short, effective supervision of the slide could really only happen if there 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a supervisor in the area of the mound itself.

15.	 

 
16.	 

 
17.	 

 
18.	 

 
19.	 

 

There was a good deal of evidence to this effect.  For example, Lindsay Harrison, one of the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervisors on duty that day, said that, when the slide area was opened up, she waited at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sandpit whilst the children went past on their way to the slide but then, when actually 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervising the children at the slide, she sat on the planter close to the mound.  That can be 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen in the CCTV footage. She did not supervise the children playing on the slide from the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area of the sandpit. 
   

 

 

 

The difficulty created by the location of the slide, and the strains that it imposed on proper 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision,  were  evident  before  Lydia’s  death.  Ms  Redhead  gave  evidence  that,  at  an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier meeting, a member of staff had said that a fence and gate should be installed leading 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down to the slide area so that, when the slide was out of bounds (because, for example, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were insufficient supervisors in the playground) access could be prohibited.  She said 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this request was rejected by the nursery manager on the basis that it would disturb 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was known as the ‘free‐flow’ of the children’s play.  Indeed, during the trial, much was 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made of the ‘free‐flow’ ethos which allowed children to go where they wanted and do what 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they wanted both inside and outside.  However it was not explained how making one part 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the playground out of bounds for a period could adversely affect the children. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Other  reasons given during  the  trial  for  the  absence  of  a  fence  and  gate, such as that  it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  mean  that  children  got  left  behind  when  the  area  was  closed  up,  or  that  it  might 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disturb  the  natural  atmosphere  and  ambience  of  the  playground,  were,  on  analysis, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsustainable. 
   

In  my  view,  there  was  no  good  reason  for  the  failure  to  take  up  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion of a fence and gate, particularly when the evidence was that, if it was required 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for health and safety purposes, funds would have been available for any such installation. I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find that the decision not to install the fence and gate was not a financial decision, or one 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made to maximise profits; it was instead an inexplicable and unjustified error of judgment. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead of the fence and gate, the staff were obliged to use a wooden bench, and a plastic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trolley  which  contained  the  sand  toys,  as  a  means  of  blocking  access  to  the  slide.  Ms 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Redhead called this a makeshift barrier and I agree: it was a ramshackle affair which, as the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CCTV footage showed, was easily capable of being circumvented by the children, who could 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and did step round it.  The evidence was that this arrangement had been operating at the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursery for some time, possibly even years. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I consider that the attempts to argue that the barrier was some form of educational device, 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a visual signal or sign that the slide area was out of bounds, were entirely unpersuasive.  If 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
the staff needed a part of the playground to be out of bounds for a period, because of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strain on their supervision resources, then they needed a proper mechanism to assist that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision, which completely blocked access to the slide.  The bench and sand trolley were 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no such thing: Lydia simply walked round the side of the sand trolley on her way to the slide 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was supposed to be out of bounds, just as other children can be seen doing in the CCTV 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footage. 
 

Not only were the bench and trolley an inadequate aid to supervision, because they did not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent children from getting past the barrier, they potentially muddled the way in which 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision could be performed. Although it was said at the trial that the staff did not rely 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  them,  the  presence  of  the  bench  and  trolley  could  easily  lead  a  supervisor,  who  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken his or her eye off the barrier momentarily, to assume that no children had got past it. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If a child had got past it because a supervisor had taken their eye off the barrier, that child 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  get  into  the  slide  area  and  then  remain  invisible  to  the  rest  of  the  playground. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tragically, that is what happened to Lydia.  She could not have got to the slide if the slide 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was closed off with a fence and gate. 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The systemic failure related to the rope that was to strangle Lydia.  It appears that a long 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length of rope, some 16 metres in length, was regularly attached to the slide to allow the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children to pull themselves up the mound.  The rope was relatively thick and easily formed 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coils.  A number of the witnesses described it as climbing rope.  The rope only has to be 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examined to see at once the potential danger it posed to small children. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

York College made a feature of what they called ‘challenging’ play, and playing with ropes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was one aspect of that.  But York College was also rightly aware that the rope or ropes could 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause serious harm to the children.  Accordingly, as part of their health and safety regime, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they produced two separate risk assessments which dealt with the use of the rope in the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  area.  Those  risk  assessments  expressly  identified  that  the  rope  posed  to  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children the risk of strangulation.  There were two particular control measures identified in 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the risk assessment to deal with that risk: putting the ropes out of reach of children when 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ropes were not in use, and supervision. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Given that supervision was, of course, dependant on so many variables (including the bench 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and trolley arrangement, the ratio between staff and children, and what else was going on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the playground) the other principal control measure – putting the ropes away when they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not being used – had the merit of clarity and simplicity.  That doubtless explained why

--------
many of the witnesses at the trial confirmed that, if the rope had been put away after the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last time it had been used under supervision, Lydia would not have died. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  evidence  established  beyond  any  doubt  that  this  control  measure  was  sometimes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignored. Instead, the rope was often treated by the nursery staff as being just one element 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  equipment  available  to  the  children  in  the  playground.  So,  as  with  the  other 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equipment, once the rope had been taken out and brought to the slide area, it was often 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left out and only tidied away at the end of the day. Some witnesses (like Chloe Moses and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mathew Parkin) said that, as a matter of routine, the rope was put away at the end of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day, but not after each supervised play session; others, like Sophee Redhead, acknowledged 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this happened but said that such a practice was occasional. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There was some evidence that the rope was not even put away at the end of the day (and 
 
certainly the rope that was present on Monday 17th September had been left out since the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous Friday). But that evidence was much less extensive and much less persuasive. It 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may well have happened, but only very occasionally. I do not sentence York College on the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  that  the  rope  was  regularly  left  out  overnight.  However,  ultimately  that  does  not 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to me to make very much difference.  Because the rope was often left out all day, one 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the critical control measures in the risk assessment, to put the rope away when it was not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in use, was ignored.  This had been happening, on and off, for some time; thus the condition 
 
 
at the slide on the afternoon of 17th September 2012 was not an isolated incident. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  some  evidence  that  some  of  the  staff  had  not  seen  the  risk  assessments 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, but they were posted up close to the equipment so it does not seem to me 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate to criticise the College for failing to publicise the risk assessments.  Moreover, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every member of staff who gave evidence agreed that, regardless of whether or not they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had seen the risk assessments, they knew that the rope should be put away when it was not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being supervised. Much more serious was the complete absence of any evidence to show 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the College had a system of checking/monitoring/ensuring that the control measures 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were being implemented. 
   

 

 

I  conclude  on  that  evidence  that  no  one  at  York  College  saw  it  as  their  responsibility  to 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check, as a matter of regular routine, that any of the stated control measures were actually

was not her job and was instead the responsibility of Ms Liz Radford, the nursery manager. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms Radford denied that this was a matter for her, and said she only went to the nursery for

health  and  safety  purposes  if  something  was  specifically  brought  to  her  attention.  She 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hinted that such a task may have been the responsibility of Mr David Jackson, the Health 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Safety  Manager  at  the  College.  Mr  Jackson  did  not  give  evidence,  but  from  other 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  I concluded  that  the  nursery was not  very high  up  his  list  of  priorities (it  being 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat removed from the College’s core activities), and that he only visited the nursery 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a specific purpose, such as a fire assessment or an inspection for an annual audit. There 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was no evidence that he undertook any routine or regular inspections to see if the control 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measures were being implemented. 
 

 

 

 

Ultimately,  in  relation  to  the  rope,  this  was  a  very  important  failing  because  it  was  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncommon for the rope to be left out throughout the day, and then tidied away when the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursery closed at 6pm. That was contrary to the control measures in the College’s own risk 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessment.  That situation should clearly not have been allowed to happen; it happened 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was no regular system of checking – no weekly or monthly inspections, no 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

records, no box‐ticking ‐ to enforce the control measures. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Accordingly, I take the view that Lydia’s death was the result of one specific failure, and one 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systemic failure.  The specific failure was the failure to appreciate that a proper barrier was 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  prevent  children  from  getting  to  the  slide  area  when  there  were  insufficient 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers of staff properly to supervise that remote part of the playground, and by instead 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying on the so‐called visual sign provided by the bench and trolley which was a wholly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective  barrier.  The  systemic  failure  was  the  failure  to  enforce  control  measures 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally and, specifically, the failure to enforce the control measure that required that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rope to be put away after use.

4. CONCLUSIONS ON HARM, SERIOUSNESS AND CULPABILITY 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
30.	 

 
31.	 

 

Lydia Bishop died because the barrier to the slide was ineffective and because the ropes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had not been put away after use.  Therefore the harm arising from the two failings that I 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have identified could not have been more serious (B5 of Definitive Guideline). 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In my view the seriousness of the offending, and therefore the culpability of the College, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  high,  although  not  very  high  because  it  did  not  extend  to  the  very  top  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management chain. It was high because the bench and trolley were obviously ineffective, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a sensible and cheap solution had been suggested but not implemented.  The risk of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children getting past the barrier and into an unsupervised area was therefore foreseen, let 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------
alone  foreseeable  (Section  6(a)  of  the  Definitive  Guideline).  The  College  fell  a  long  way 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below an appropriate standard (Section 6(b) of the Definitive Guideline) because they failed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to act on the sensible suggestion of a fence and gate, for reasons which were unjustified, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  allowed  a  plainly  inadequate  measure  to  be  used  for  so  long.  This  specific  failure 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended to the Nursery Manager and the Health and Safety Manager but not higher up the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management chain (Section 6(c) of the Definitive Guideline). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The seriousness of the offending in respect of the rope was also high. Putting away the rope 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it was not in use was the College’s stated solution to the risk posed by the rope. The 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

College’s  own  risk  assessment  said  that  there  was  a  risk  of  strangulation  if  that  control 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure was not implemented: thus the risk of serious injury, even death, by strangulation, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  again  foreseen  by  the  College,  let  alone  foreseeable  (Section  6(a)  of  the  Definitive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline).  The College fell a long way below an appropriate standard (Section 6(b) of the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Definitive Guideline) because they failed to put in place any mechanism whereby their own 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control measures were checked, monitored or enforced.  That was a systemic failure that 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went back as far as the risk assessments themselves; the evidence suggests that there was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never any system of checking/monitoring/enforcement. That failure was principally that of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Health and Safety Manager; even though it was systemic, it is difficult on the evidence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  that  responsibility  for  it  should  also  extend  to  the  member  of  the  Senior 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Management Team responsible for health and safety matters.

5. AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS 
 

 

 

 

 

 
5.1	 
 
33.	 

Aggravating Factors 
 

 

In addition to the matters noted above, and by reference to Section B7 of the Definitive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline, there were the following aggravating factors: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)	  The  risks created by  the  makeshift barrier were  known  because  the matter had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been raised at a staff meeting. The evidence was that the warning was deliberately 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignored (Section B7(b) of the Definitive Guideline). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)	  Other children, not just Lydia, were exposed to the risk of the rope on the slide. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They were all very young and so acutely vulnerable (Section B7(e) of the Definitive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline). 
  

5.2	  Mitigating Factors 
 

 

 
 
34.	 

In my view, there are four mitigating factors which seem to me to be significant. In brief: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9
--------
(a)	 

I  consider  that  York  College  generally  took  health  and  safety  matters  seriously. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  risk  assessments  were  suitable  for  their  purpose  and,  because  they  were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posted around the nursery, properly drawn to the attention of the staff. The basic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  were  all  well‐known  to  the  supervisors  in  the  nursery  (Section  8(e)  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Definitive Guideline); 
   

 

(b)	  York College have no previous convictions or warnings in respect of the health and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safety  at  the  nursery.  On  the  contrary,  any  third  party  who  has  inspected  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursery  prior  to  the  accident,  such  as  Ofsted  and  York  Council,  was  extremely 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complimentary about the way in which it was run, including in respect of safety 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues.  The  report  produced  by  RSM  Tenon  in  October  2011  dealing  with  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

College’s Health and Safety Framework, was also couched in extremely favourable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms (Section 8(d) of the Definitive Guideline); 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)	  The College reacted to Lydia’s death by closing the nursery and it has never been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

re‐opened. Moreover they have taken  a number of steps to ensure that this sort 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of accident could not happen again; 
   

 

 

 

 

 

(d)	  York College derives much of its income from public funds, which is a factor that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to be considered for the purposes of the amount of any fine (Section C of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Definitive Guideline).  I deal with that matter in greater detail below. 
   

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I would wish to expand what I say about the mitigating factors by dealing expressly with 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three submissions put forward by the College by way of mitigation. First, whilst I accept that 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  many  ways  the  College  co‐operated  fully  with  the  police  inquiry,  there  were  some 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

omissions. Thus the evidence before the jury was that, although Ms Redhead gave a very 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full statement to the police on the day after Lydia’s death, a number of the College staff did 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not answer the questions asked by the police during the investigation.  The College Principal 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered  ‘no  comment’  to  the  questions  put,  and  although  she  put  in  a  lengthy  pre‐

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepared statement, that statement dealt with barely any relevant matters.  The relevant 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member of the Senior Management Team responsible for health and safety, Ms Lawrence‐

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crockford, also answered no comment, even in relation to basic matters of fact. That was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their right, of course, but it cannot fairly be described as ‘full co‐operation’. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The second issue, the College’s generally careful attitude to health and safety matters, is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something to which I have already referred. I think that Mr Lynagh QC and Mr Antrobus are 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to say that, on the evidence, the College took health and safety matters seriously, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

 
35.

--------
had a good structure in place to deal with them. I consider that the failures in respect of the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursery were not typical of the College’s overall approach to health and safety, and can, to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  extent,  be  described  as  out  of  character  (albeit  that  they  were  not  the  result  of  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolated incident and were reasonably foreseeable). That raises a question as to some of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  of  this  case  which,  encouraged  by  the  police,  has  wrongly  hinted  at  a  cavalier 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

attitude within the College towards health and safety issues. I deal with one aspect of that 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the end of these sentencing remarks. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thirdly, I accept the College’s submission that they were devastated by what happened on 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 September; they have reacted responsibly to Lydia’s death; and they have put in place 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  measures  to  review  and  improve  their  health  and  safety  practices.  The 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement of Mr John Short, the Chairman of the Board of Governors is illuminating on this, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and many other matters.  He sets out in detail the degree of upset and remorse caused 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  York  College  by  Lydia’s  death.  He  also  records  that  the  likely  costs  to  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

College of closing the nursery may exceed £400,000. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As to the extent to which lessons have been learned, it is worth setting out paragraphs 28 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 29 of his statement in full: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

“28. That decision [to close the nursery] was not, however, seen as representing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end of the matter so far as the College was concerned.  It was appreciated by 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  that  the  safety  management  system  required  careful  review  in  light  of  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident  such  as  this,  irrespective  of  the  closure  of  the  nursery,  because  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

College  still  opens  its  doors  to  thousands  of  students  each  day  and  must 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrate  that  it  is  safe  to  do  so.  With  that  in  mind,  I  am  aware  that  the 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following measures have been taken at York College as part of the process over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
(a)	 

the years of continuous review of health and safety procedures/systems: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

An external health and safety expert (recommended to the College by the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

HSE) carried out an immediate health and safety inspection of the College 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the incident involving Lydia which was followed by a full British Safety 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Council audit the following year; 
 

 

 

 

 

 
(b)	 

A small project group was established, chaired by the Principal, to oversee 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the action plan for what was expected (at the time) to be the re‐opening of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nursery (including refresher training of staff etc.) and which thereafter

--------
focused on (and still does meet to focus on) taking forward actions relating 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to health and safety in the College; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(c)	 

Risk  assessments  have  been  reviewed  throughout  the  College  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  refresher  training  instituted  for  all  staff,  together  with  some 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governors, in relation to health and safety aspects of College life; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d)	  Whilst daily checks were in place, they are now specifically documented for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all College workshops and other areas considered to be higher in risk; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(e)	 

 
(f)	 

 
(g)	 

Compliance  checks  continue  regarding  manager  inspections,  audits  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

student and staff health and safety inductions; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Additional  regular  review  of  risk  assessments,  induction  procedures  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monitoring procedures; 
 

 

Unannounced spot checks by the health and safety team across all sites to

6. THE RELEVANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
39.	 

 

I have been provided with a good deal of financial information relevant to the fixing of the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine. In summary, the evidence is that: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

(a)	  York College is a registered charity.  The majority of its income (83%) is from the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public purse. It has no shareholders and distributes no profit.  Any surplus is put 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back into the College 
  

 

 

 

(b)	  Although it has Reserves of about £30 million, these are largely fixed and are not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available for future spending.  Nett Current Assets are just over £9 million but the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

College has financial obligations over the next three years which will account for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the vast majority of that amount. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

12
--------
(c)	  York  College  has  always  specialised  in  Construction  Industry  training,  and  has  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

major  capital  project  ongoing  for  a  new  Construction  Centre  which  will  cost 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approximately £6 million. 
   

 

 

(d)	  The accounts for the year ending 31.7.13 show a deficit of £276,000,  whilst the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash  from  operating  activities  has  reduced  from  £2.3  million  in  July  2012  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£570,000 for the year ending July 2013.  Much of this reduction is explained by the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision to close the nursery. 
   

 

 

 

 

(e)	  York  College  anticipates  a  surplus  for  the  year  ending  31.7.14  in  the  region  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£400,000. 
 

It is conceded that the financial information shows that it would be able to pay a penalty of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up to £500,000, although it is said that in all the circumstances of this case, the fine should 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be fixed at less than the £100,000 referred to in the Guideline.  I deal with this submission in 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the next section of these Sentencing Remarks.

7. THE APPROPRIATE FINE 
 

 

 

 

 
41.	 

 
42.	 

 
43.	 

 
44.	 

 

I consider that, in all the circumstances of the case, only a substantial fine is appropriate.  I 
 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

note  that  Paragraph  D/25  of  the  Definitive  Guideline  suggests  that  a  fine  of  less  than 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£100,000 in any case where death has been caused will ‘seldom’ be appropriate. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  do  not  accept  that  this  is  an  exceptional  case  which  warrants  a  fine  at  a  figure  below 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

£100,000.  In one sense this kind of case is all too common: a first‐class institution, with 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numerous outstanding qualities, failed to do two things which were reasonably practicable, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in respect of one part of its operations, and a tragic death ensued. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The seriousness of the offence, and the College’s culpability for it, both of which I consider 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be high, and the aggravating factors noted above, would lead me to think in terms of a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level  perhaps  three  times  the  figure  of  £100,000  referred  to  in  the  Guideline.  But  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating factors, including the College’s funding position, the financial impact so far, and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lessons learned, would suggest a significant reduction from that sort of figure. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For all these reasons, therefore, I fix the fine in the sum of £175,000. It will be seen that 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such a level of fine is just over half that imposed in R v Merlin (where the defendant was a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much bigger organisation but whose culpability was lower than that of the College), and a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit more than twice that in Roche, where the defendant care home was a modest business 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and where the original fine of £150,000 would have led to the loss of 75 jobs. That factor,

which does not apply here, made that case exceptional. The defendant in that case was also 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given full credit for its guilty plea. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A fine of £175,000, when considered with the figure for costs, noted below, is also broadly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in line with the figure in the similar Crown Court case of Epping Forest District Council v 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Casterbridge Care and Education Ltd and Another (July 2013) where the defendants were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial organisations. 
 

 

I have considered the consequences of a fine fixed at £175,000. It seems to me that a fine at 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that level can be paid; it will have no significantly detrimental effect on the College’s future 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans; and it is capable of being paid without risking job losses or a reduction in the services 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided by the College. 
   

 

 

 

 

8. COSTS 
 

 

The Crown seeks its costs in the total sum of £45,453.94. No issue arises as to the College’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability to pay costs, and the figure seems to me to be relatively modest. I therefore allow 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim in full. It should be noted that this figure includes the costs of prosecuting Ms 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Redhead. It is, I think, in keeping with the spirit of Mr Short’s statement that the College 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should pay those costs, even though of course the decision to charge her was nothing to do 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the College. I consider that the College has generally been as supportive as they could 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  of  Ms  Redhead,  although  it  was  inevitable  that  at  trial  there  would  be  marked 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differences between their respective defences.

9. ‘A TICK‐BOX EXERCISE’? 
 

 

 

 

 
48.	 

On the afternoon of 6 February, within minutes of the conviction of York College and the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquittal  of  Sophee  Redhead  the  North  Yorkshire  Police,  released  a  press  statement  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  amongst  other  things,  they  said  that  the  rope  had  been  in  place  on  the  slide  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  two  months.  Detective  Inspector  Costello  was  quoted  as  saying  that  “health  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safety is more than just a tick‐box exercise”.  The statement was widely reported. 

   

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49.	  Whilst statements of this kind can be made before the end of proceedings, provided they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do not cause prejudice to the defendant, they are ill‐advised, particularly where, as here, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  woefully  inaccurate.  On  that  basis,  the  statement  could  have  been  potentially 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudicial to York College, who are already unhappy at some of the reporting of this trial in

the  media.  At  the  very  least,  ordinary  principles  of  justice  require  me  to  correct  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement publicly. 
 

 

The statement that the rope had been in place for about two months is simply wrong. As I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  made  clear,  the  evidence  did  not  support  any  such  conclusion  and  I  have  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  York  College  on  that  basis. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

In  circumstances  where  the  jury  does  not  give 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons for its decision, it is an abuse of the criminal justice system for the police to provide 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their own, incorrect, reasons. 
 

 

 

 

DCI Costello is also quite wrong to say that, in some way, York College’s approach to health

and safety was a matter of box‐ticking.  It was not, as anyone who had actually listened to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  in  the  trial  would  know.  I  have  already  explained  at  some  length  that  the 
 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  for  Lydia’s  death  arose  from  one  specific  failing  (not  dealing  with  the  particular 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  of  access  to  the  slide)  and  one  systemic  failure  (failing  to  enforce  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implementation of control measures).  Neither of those failings resulted from any alleged 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

‘tick‐box’  exercise,  or  demonstrated  an  approach  which  put  ‘box‐ticking’  ahead  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive matters. 
   

 

52.	  More widely, I consider that DCI Costello’s remarks are positively damaging.  It is very easy 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for those who are not involved in the details of health and safety operations on a daily basis 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to criticise those who are for having a ‘tick‐box’ mentality.  It is a cheap and easy jibe.  But 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  reality,  in  the  workplace,  or  in  the  hospital  or  the  school,  having  a  system  whereby 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something is inspected and then noted as satisfactory, with the result recorded on a form as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a box ticked, can often be the best way of ensuring that a health and safety regime set out 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on paper is actually being complied with in practice. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  element  of  this  case  provides  a  good  example  of  that. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  Health  and  Safety 
 
 

 

 

 

Manager at York College had undertaken a regular inspection regime at the nursery, with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  risk  assessment  in  front  of  him,  seeing  whether  the  control  measures  were  actually 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being implemented, and ticking a box if they were, he would have been unable to tick the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

box that said that the ropes were being put away after use.  Having been obliged to cross, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not tick, the relevant box, he would then have ensured that everyone knew that the ropes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to be put away after use, and the accident might never have happened. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On that basis, you could make a strong case that, in relation to the rope, what went wrong 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here was not that the College had a tick‐box mentality, but that it did not.  In my view, crass 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generalisations  of  the  kind  made  by  DCI  Costello  simply  serve  to  undermine  proper  and

The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Leveson, Lady Justice Hallett, Lord Justice Treacy 
 
and Mr Justice Burnett) has today ruled that judges can continue to impose whole life orders in 
 
accordance with Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 
 
 
On the facts of two individual cases, the Court increased the sentence of Ian McLaughlin to one of 
 
 
 
a whole life term for the murder of Graham Buck. The Court dismissed an appeal by Lee Newell 
 
 
 
against his whole life order for the murder of Subhan Anwar. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
 
In the introduction the Lord Chief Justice (Lord Thomas) explains that, as a result of the decision of 
 
the European Court of Human Rights in Vinter v UK, a specially constituted court was set up to hear 
 
three applications for permission to appeal their whole life terms (Mark Bridger, Matthew Thomas 
 
and Lee Newell) and a reference by the Attorney General under s36 of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 
 
1986 in the case of Ian McLoughlin. Mark Bridger abandoned his application prior to the hearing and 
 
at the start of the hearing it was confirmed that Matthew Thomas had not received a whole life term. 
 
The hearing therefore proceeded as an appeal by Newell and a reference by the Attorney General in 
 
 
the case of McLoughlin. (paras 1– 4) 
 
 
The development of the legislative scheme 
 
 
The Court sets out the development of the legislative scheme established by Parliament for 
 
sentencing in cases of murder at paragraphs 5 – 11, including the Home Secretaries’ polices of 
 
 
reviewing whole life terms in exceptional cases.  It also sets out the statutory power of release by 
 
the Secretary of State under s30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 if there are exceptional 
 
circumstances which justify the release of a prisoner on compassionate grounds.

--------
The contentions of the parties 
 
 
The submissions made on behalf of the Attorney General and the Crown are summarised in 
 
paragraph 12 and the submission made on behalf of Newell is set out in paragraph 13. 
 
 
Is the statutory regime established by Parliament compatible with Article 3? 
 
 
The Court discusses this in paragraphs 14 – 36 by reference to three questions: 
 
 
a)	  Can a court impose a whole life order as just punishment? 
 
 
The answer was yes. 
 
 
Lord Thomas, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

“Although there may be debate in a democratic society as to whether a judge should have 
 
the power to make a whole life order, in our view, it is evident, as reflected in Schedule 21, 
 
that there are some crimes that are so heinous that Parliament was entitled to proscribe, 
 
compatibly with the Convention, that the requirements of just punishment encompass 
 
 
passing a sentence which includes a whole life order.” (para 15) 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
He went on to say: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

“We do not read the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Vinter as in any way casting doubt 
 
on the fact that there are crimes that are so heinous that just punishment may require 
 
imprisonment for life.  …. In Vinter the Grand Chamber accepted that, because what 
 
constitutes a just and proportionate punishment is the subject of debate and 
 
disagreement, States have a margin of appreciation.  Under our constitution it is for 
 
 
Parliament to decide whether there are such crimes and to set the framework under which 
 
the judge decides in an individual case whether a whole life order is the just punishment. 
 

 
  
 
 
 

  
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“We therefore conclude that no specific passage in the judgment nor the judgment read as 
 
a whole in any way seek to impugn the provisions of the CJA 2003 (as enacted by 
 
 
Parliament) which entitle a judge to make at the time of sentence a whole life order as a 
 
 
sentence reflecting just punishment.” (paras 17 – 18) 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
b)	  Does the regime which provides for reducibility have to be in place at the time the whole life 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

order is imposed? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
The European Court of Human Rights had decided in 2008 and again in Vinter that a sentence of life 
 
 
imprisonment which was irreducible – that is to say gave the offender no possibility or hope or 
 
prospect of release ‐ was incompatible with Article 3. 
 
 
The Court of Appeal proceeded on the assumption that it should adopt that interpretation as if the 
 
 
law of England and Wales provided for reducibility, the question could be dealt with in this way. 
 
 
(paras 19 – 24) 
 
 
c)	  Does the regime established by Parliament provide for reducibility? 
 
 
The answer to the question was: Yes 
 
 
The Court went on to consider whether s. 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 is a regime for 
 
reducibility which is in fact compliant with Article 3 (paras 25 – 36). 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page 2 of 5
--------
The Grand Chamber had reached a conclusion in Vinter that the law of England and Wales did not 
 
clearly provide for reducibility as the conditions set out in the lifer manual was too restrictive. The 
 
court held that the Grand Chamber was wrong on this point. The law of England and Wales clearly 
 
provided for such a regime through s.30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the lifer manual 
 
could not restrict the power under s.30 given to the Secretary of State by Parliament.  Lord Thomas 
 
said: 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

“In our view, the domestic law of England and Wales is clear as to “possible exceptional 
 
release of whole life prisoners”.  As is set out in R v Bieber the Secretary of State is bound to 
 
 
exercise his power under s.30 of the 1997 Act in a manner compatible with principles of 
 
 
domestic administrative law and with Article 3.” (para 29) 
 

   
 

  
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Lord Thomas went on to conclude: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

“In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender 
 
“hope” or the “possibility” of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just

“It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an 
 
individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so as to 
 
 
render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable.  We find it 
 
difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the heinous 
 
nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for life.  But 
 
circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases.  The interpretation of s.30 we have 
 
 
set out provides for that possibility and hence gives to each such prisoner the possibility of 
 
exceptional release.” (paras 35 – 36) 
 

 
 
  
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Conclusion 
 
 
Lord Thomas, on behalf of the Court, concluded: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

“Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the CJA 2003 and in 
 
exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with Schedule 
 
21.  Although we were told by Mr Eadie QC that it might be many years before the 
 
applications might be made under s.30 and the three applicants in Vinter (Vinter, Bamber 
 
 
and Moore) did not seek to contend that there were no longer justifiable penological 
 
 
grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that we would not discount the 
 
 
possibility of such applications arising very much sooner.  They will be determined in 
 
 
accordance with the legal principles we have set out.” (para 37) 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The reference by the Attorney General in the case of Ian McLoughlin 
  
 
The Court considers this case in paragraphs 39 – 50. 
 
 
On 21 October 2013 McLoughlin pleaded guilty to murder and to robbery committed whilst he was 
 
on day release from prison. He had a previous history of serious offending, including previous 
 
convictions for manslaughter and murder. McLoughlin was sentenced by Mr Justice Sweeney at the 
 
 
 
Central Criminal Court to life imprisonment for the offence of murder.  A sentence of eight years 
 
 
imprisonment concurrent with that sentence was passed for the robbery.  The judge fixed a 
 
  
minimum period of 40 years under s.269 (2) of the CJA 2003. (para 39 ‐ 42)

“In the course of his sentencing remarks the judge said he had to decide whether there should be a 
 
whole life order or whether there should be a determinate minimum term.  In deciding whether to 
 
  
impose a whole life order the judge referred to the decision in Vinter and said:

compliance  with  the  Convention  and  to  take  into  account  at  the  least  of  it  the 
 
decisions of the Court.  And given that the 2003 Act does not require me to pass a 
 
whole life order, even though that is necessarily my starting point, I have reached the 
 
conclusion  against the  background  that  is  incumbent  upon  me  to  pass  a  sentence 
 
which is compliant with the Convention if I can.  But it is not appropriate to impose a 
 
whole life term.  However, even for a man of 55 years of age the minimum term of 
 
 
years must be a very long one indeed.”” (para 45)

for the reasons we have given [earlier in this judgment], in error.  His reasoning as to 
 
whether he should impose a whole life order or a minimum term of a fixed number of years, 
 
 
had therefore proceeded on the assumption he had no such power. 
 
 
“We must consider the matter afresh.  The judge proceeded on the basis of a 
 
misunderstanding of the law.  It is our duty to exercise our judgment free from that 
 
misunderstanding.  …. 
 
 
“In our judgment this was a case where the seriousness was exceptionally high and just 
 
punishment required a whole life order.  A fixed minimum term of 40 years was for that

The appeal by Lee Newell 
 
 
The Court considers this case in paragraphs 51 – 58. 
 
 
On 19 September 2013 Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, sitting at the Crown Court at Leamington Spa, 
 
sentenced Lee Newell, to imprisonment for life with a whole life order following his conviction for 
 
 
the murder of Subhan Anwar at HMP Long Lartin. Newell was already serving a life sentence for 
 
murder at the time of Anwar’s murder. (para 51 ‐52)

“Because this was a second murder, the starting point would normally be a whole life 
 
order.  The murder was premeditated and involved the use of an improvised weapon.  It 
  
 
occurred in prison whilst Newell continued to serve a life sentence.  The deceased took a 
 
 
significant time to die.  There was no mitigation.  This was a murder where the seriousness 
 
of the offence was exceptionally high.  The judge was right in making a whole life order. 
  
This appeal is accordingly dismissed.” (para 58)

2225355,R v Orrett Duncan,"R v Orrett Duncan 

In the Crown Court at Sheffield 

26 February 2014 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Males 

 
Orrett Duncan, you have pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Calvin Clarke on the 

basis of loss of control. That plea has been accepted by the prosecution. 

 

You  are  now  aged  40.  Calvin  Clarke  was  a  man  with  whom  you  had  an  ongoing 

dispute concerning a woman who was his former partner and with whom you were 

having a sexual relationship. On 27 September 2013 he was standing outside a shop 

on  the  Haymarket  in  Sheffield.  He  had  a  knife  in  his  jacket  pocket.  You  saw  him 

standing  there  and  decided  to  confront  him.  You  went  into  another  shop, 

Wilkinson’s,  accompanied  by  two  of  your  young  children  whom  you  had  just 

collected  from  school.  You  bought  a  knife,  a  sharp  vegetable  knife,  which  you  put 

into a plastic carrier bag. You sent your children into another shop across the road 

and were then seen to rummage in the carrier bag, removing from its packaging the 

knife which you had bought. Your counsel told me that there had been an incident a 

week or so before this when Calvin Clarke had confronted you when you were with 

your  children  and  had  threatened  to  use  a  knife  on  you  if  you  had  not  been  with 

them.  So  you  bought  the  knife  on  this  occasion,  expecting  and  preparing  for  a 

confrontation,  knowing  that  he  might  well  be  armed even  if  you  did  not  know  for 

sure  that  he  was.  You  left  the  shop  and  walked  towards  where  Calvin  Clarke  was 

standing. You shouted at him and he shouted back in an exchange of insults. As you 

advanced towards him, Calvin Clarke took his knife out of his pocket and ran towards 

you.  When  you  saw  his  knife,  you  took  out  your  own  knife  from  the  carrier  bag.
--------
There  was  a  fight  and  you  had  the  worst  of  it.  You  fell  to  the  ground.  A  witness 

thought that you were being robbed. Calvin Clarke slashed at you and cut you across 

the face. I have seen a photograph of your injury and it was a vicious cut. You got up 

and moved towards Calvin Clarke, stabbing with your knife. You stabbed him three 

times  in  the  chest.  Two  of  those  wounds  penetrated  his  body  and  one  of  them, 

which proved fatal, cut an artery. He died from those injuries a few days later. 

 

The  basis  on  which  you  have  pleaded  guilty  to  manslaughter  and  on  which  the 

prosecution has accepted your plea is that you bought your knife for the purpose of 

having  it  with  you  in  an  altercation  which  you  knew  was  likely  to  take  place;  you 

actively engaged Calvin Clarke in a verbal altercation; you produced your knife when 

you saw that he was armed and you had it in your hand when the incident began; 

you  lost  your  self  control  after  the  injury  to  your  face  but  you  inflicted  the  fatal 

wounds intending to cause at least really serious bodily harm to Calvin Clarke; and 

you quickly regained your self control after doing so. 

 

Thus, although I now have to sentence you for manslaughter on the basis of loss of 

control and not for murder, so that at the time of the killing you had lost your self 

control,  your  plea  to  manslaughter  is  advanced  on  the  very  narrow  basis  which  I 

have described. It is relevant to note also that, as your counsel acknowledged, if you 

had  been  convicted  of  murder  I  would  be  obliged  to  pass  a  life  sentence  with  a 

minimum term whose starting point would be 25 years. 

 

As it is, and even though there are no victim statements in this case, the harm which 

you have caused, the death of Calvin Clarke, is no different from what it would have 

been  if  you  had  been  convicted  of  murder,  but  the  fact  that  you  killed  when 

suffering from a loss of control means that your culpability is less.  

 

Your conduct in this case shows that although you were not armed when you came 

into town to shop and it was by chance that you came across Calvin Clarke, you were 

prepared deliberately and with a degree of forethought and preparation to engage 

in  what  you  knew  was  likely  to  be  a  knife  fight  in  broad  daylight  in  a  busy  public 

 

2
--------
place with a man whom you regarded as an enemy. This involved an obvious risk of 

serious  personal  injury  to  your  opponent  and  yourself,  and  potentially  to  other 

members  of  the  public  who  would  at  the  least  be  witnesses  to  a  disturbing  and 

distressing sight. Although you inflicted the fatal wounds at a time when you had lost 

your  self  control,  you  did  so  intending  to  cause  at  least  really  serious  bodily  harm 

and  there  was  always  a  risk  that  such  injury  at  least  might  be  the  result  of  the 

altercation for which you prepared yourself. 

 

In deciding what sentence is appropriate I must have regard to the guidelines issued 

by  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  on  manslaughter  by  reason  of  provocation, 

even though the old defence of provocation is in some respects different from the 

new defence of loss of control. Those guidelines emphasise that the sentence in such 

a  case  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  the  offence  for  which  you  are  to  be 

sentenced involves a loss of self control on your part and that your culpability is to 

be assessed in the light of that fact. 

  

They  indicate  also  that  the  degree  of  provocation  as  shown  by  its  nature  and 

duration is a critical factor or even the critical factor. In this case it may be said that 

in one sense the fact that you were slashed in the face with a knife by Calvin Clarke 

represents  extreme  provocation  on  his  part,  but  I  do  not  take  that  view.  On  the 

contrary,  the  important  considerations  in  the  present  case  are  that  you  prepared 

yourself for a knife fight; and that you were at least complicit in the initiation of that 

fight  by  shouting  to  and  approaching  Calvin  Clarke  when  you  knew  that  he  might 

well be armed and there was no reason to suppose that he had even seen you. The 

guidelines recognise that the carrying and use of a weapon which is brought to the 

scene  in  contemplation  of  possible  use  before  the  loss  of  self‐control  occurs  is  an 

aggravating factor. So too is the fact that this incident took place in a busy shopping 

area, with many members of the public present to witness it. It is not easy to fit a 

case such as this within the guidelines, but so far as it is possible to do so I would 

regard this as a case falling within and towards the top of the most serious category 

dealt with in the guidelines. 

 

 

3
--------
I would add that although you have a conviction for possession of a samurai sword in 

a  public  place,  the  circumstances  of  that  offence  were  very  different  and  it  was 

almost eight years ago. I do not regard that as an important factor. 

 

I have seen the material provided by way of mitigation, referring to the way in which 

you have worked hard in your job as a cleaner, and including a letter from one of 

your former partners who is the mother of two of your children and another former 

partner  who  is  the  mother  of  two  of  your  other  children.  They  speak  of  how  you 

have been a caring and committed father and have provided a home for two of your 

four  children,  whose  performance  at  school  has  improved  since  they  came  to  live 

with  you.  That  is  to  your  credit,  but  it  is  also  the  case  that  you  committed  this 

offence  when  you  had just  collected  two  of  your  children for  whom  you  were  the 

sole carer from school, even though it appears that they did not have to witness this 

incident. The material speaks also of the way in which your children are suffering as 

a result of your conduct. Tragically, and as is so often the case, your children are the 

innocent victims of your criminal violence. That is to be regretted and deplored, but 

cannot significantly affect the sentence which it is my duty to pass. 

 

Balancing the various considerations, if you had been convicted after a trial, I would 

have passed a sentence of 18 years. I will give you maximum credit for your guilty 

plea.  Although  you  did  not  comment  when  first  interviewed  and  claimed  in  a 

subsequent interview that you did not know Calvin Clarke and had merely defended 

yourself when attacked by a stranger, I accept that it was reasonable in a complex 

case such as this to obtain your counsel’s advice before tendering your plea and that 

your plea was then offered at the first reasonable opportunity. 

 

Orrett  Duncan,  for  the  manslaughter  of  Calvin  Clarke,  I  sentence  you  to  12  years 

imprisonment. You will serve half of that period in prison and will then be released 

on licence. 

 

The statutory surcharge provisions apply.

Birmingham Crown Court 

 

5 February 2014 

 

Sentencing remarks of the Honourable Mrs Justice Carr 

 

 
Saturday 15th June 2013 was a night that Mr Tahir Mumtaz, Mr Zakaria Bhayat and PC 
Adam Koch will never forget.  You subjected them to a terrifying and unprovoked attack 
in  Washwood  Heath  mosque  with  a  large  knife.  Mr  Mumtaz  and  Mr  Bhayat  were 
worshippers on a religious retreat peacefully going about their prayers in what should 
have been a safe and calm place.  There were up to 30 worshippers in the mosque at 
the  time.  PC  Koch,  together  with  PC  Stevens,  arrived  as  the  first  police  officers  in 
response to emergency calls following the attacks on Mr Mumtaz and Mr Bhayat. 
 
You  yourself  had  attended  ostensibly  as  a  worshipper.    You  were  noticed  behaving 
unusually by the bay window in the main prayer room.  You went to pray but, without 
warning,  then  drew  a  large  knife  from  a  sheath  on  your  belt  and  went  to  attack  Mr 
Mumtaz from behind. You stabbed him multiple times.  You wounded Mr Bhayat as he 
went  about  trying  to  help  Mr  Mumtaz.  After  attacking  Mr  Mumtaz  you  retired  to  a 
washroom in the mosque and then returned to a kneeling praying position in the prayer 
room.  PC Koch arrived and shouted to you to show your hands. You failed to do so.  PC 
Koch then discharged a Taser gun unsuccessfully. You turned and proceeded to launch 
an attack on him, again with your knife.  Despite the fact that PC Koch was wearing a 
protective  police  stab  vest,  your  knife  penetrated  his  abdomen  causing  him  serious 
injury. Others in the mosque bravely intervened to stop you continuing your attacks and 
also tended to the injured.  Many in the mosque were affected by what they saw, some 
left weeping in the aftermath. 
 
During the attacks you were heard to shout variously at worshippers ordering them to 
stop mocking the religion of Allah and accusing them of making a mockery of God. You 
were repeating yourself.  You shouted that Allah would kill everyone.  You referred to 
worshippers as “kafirs”, meaning non‐believers.
--------
In the police station you referred to a police officer as “devil colleague” and gave your 
name as “Amir”, meaning “ruler”.   
 
All  three  victims  were  badly  hurt.    Mr  Mumtaz  received  surgery  for  multiple  stab 
wounds to his upper body and left thigh area.  Mr Bhayat received surgery for a long 
stab wound to upper thigh.  PC Koch received surgery for a stab wound to the upper left 
side of abdomen and a superficial injury in his back just below his left shoulder blade. 
 
The  Court  has  the  benefit  of  victim  impact  statements  from  all  three  victims.    Mr 
Mumtaz  describes  how  he  has  trouble  sleeping.  He  is  always  thinking  about  what 
happened to him.  He remains in pain, with a dull ache where he was stabbed.  Nothing 
feels right in his body.  He was an active person but everything has changed overnight.  
He  feels  very  scared  going  out.  He  now  always  has  his  mobile  phone  with  him.  He 
believes that his life has been ruined.  He had been planning to get married, but this has 
been  put  on  hold.    Mr  Bhayat  too  has  been  affected  both  physically  and  mentally. 
Physically he has now healed, though he has been left with a large scar across his thigh.  
But mentally he has not.  His prayers are affected. He takes more care when he is out 
and about.  The attack will always be there in his life.  PC Koch bears a scar on the left 
side of stomach which causes him permanent discomfort as well as disfigurement.  It is a 
constant  reminder  of  the  day  when  he  feels  he  nearly  died.  His  other  scar  is  also  a 
permanent reminder. He is unable to take part in any regular intensive exercise as he 
previously  did  on  a  nearly  daily  basis  before  hand.    But  the  psychological  impact  has 
been greater than the physical.  He has still not yet fully come to terms with the attack. 
He  is  on  restricted  duties  and  confined  to  office  work.  His  confidence  has  taken  a 
massive blow, and the effects have placed a great strain on his personal relationships. 
He  feels  numb  and  emotionless  on  what  should  and  would  otherwise  be  special 
occasions. He remains under counselling.    
 
On  being  apprehended  and  restrained  you  were  taken  to  Stechford  Police  Station.  
Following  a  mental  health  assessment  you  were  sectioned  under  s.  2  of  the  Mental 
Health Act 1983. 
 
From the evidence that the Court has heard, it is clear that you were severely mentally 
ill at the time, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.   
 
You had in fact suffered from schizophrenia for many months and more prior to these 
offences.    You  were  born  in  Somalia  in  1981  and  are  now  32  years  of  age.    With  the 
outbreak of civil war you came to this country with your family to live in Sheffield.  Your 
father died in 2002.  You left school with no qualifications at the age of 17.  At around 
this  time  you  received  a  conviction  for  attempted  robbery  and  two  cautions  for 
theft/offensive weapon in a public place.  You have no other convictions.  You obtained 
work in the security industry, moving to Bristol and then Birmingham in about 2009.
--------
Like many other young Somalian males, you had a habit of chewing khat, a stimulant, 
until late 2012 or so. Khat has properties which can trigger mental illness.  It is not clear 
what part, if any, the use of khat has played in the development of your illness. 
 
In  October  2012  you  were  seen  by  a  psychiatrist  at  your  brother’s  instigation.  You 
brother is a qualified and practising general practitioner. He was extremely concerned at 
your mental state.  You harboured theories to the effect that there was a conspiracy to 
kill your brother.  You were calling the security services in Saudi Arabia many times a 
week reporting that he was about to be kidnapped and tortured. You came under the 
care  of  the  Birmingham  and  Solihull  Mental  NHS  foundation  Trust.    On  admission  a 
diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was made but you were discharged after only some 
five 5 days or so on the grounds of your non‐cooperation. You had no insight into your 
condition.  
 
The Court has heard evidence that you did not receive the care that you needed.  Your 
illness deteriorated following discharge.  In February 2013 it appears that you married, 
but that marriage was never consummated due to your mental health problems.  You 
were not able to contact or live with your wife.   At the time of the offences you were 
living alone and without effective treatment. 
 
Medical  evidence  has  been  adduced  from  Dr  Dinesh  Maganty  and  Dr  Rafiq  Memon, 
both consultant forensic psychiatrists qualified under s. 12 (2) of the Mental Health Act 
1983.  They are agreed that your offences occurred due to your paranoid schizophrenia, 
more specifically passivity phenomena.  You believed that spirits were possessing your 
body.    You  were  suffering  with  auditory  hallucinations  and  delusional  beliefs  that  the 
freemasons, together with these spirits, were somehow controlling you and were going 
to cause harm to others and to Islam in general.  You suffered from grandiose delusions 
that  you  were  the  Emir  of  the  Islam  Republic.    Dr  Maganty  was  clear  that  you  were 
genuine in your behaviour. 
 
Dr Maganty could find no alternative motive for your actions on 15th June 2013 apart 
from mental illness.  You were in a mental state where neither your actions nor your 
thoughts  were  in  your  control.    You  believed  your  actions  to  be  morally  and  legally 
correct. In your psychotic state you were punishing those who were acting against Islam 
in your capacity as an Islamic ruler. Dr Maganty was in no doubt that you were legally 
insane at the time of the offences.  
 
Dr Maganty’s views were supported by those of Dr Memon, who agreed that you were 
legally  insane  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  You  were  psychotic  with  an  illness  
characterised by delusional beliefs that were grandiose and persecutory in content. 
 
It is in these unusual circumstances that that the jury has found you not guilty by virtue 
of insanity on the counts of attempted murder of Mr Mumtaz, wounding with intent of 
Mr Bhayat and the attempted murder of PC Koch.
--------
S.5 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 is engaged by the jury’s special verdict. 
By s. 5(2) the Court shall make a hospital order (with or without a restriction order) or a 
supervision order or an order for absolute discharge. 
 
Both  Dr  Maganty  and  Dr  Memon,  together  with  the  expert  consultant  forensic 
psychiatrist  instructed  for  the  prosecution,  have  agreed  that  the  most  appropriate 
disposal of this case is a restricted hospital order. 
 
s. 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983 provides that a hospital order may be made only if 

certain specified conditions are met.   

 
Having heard the medical evidence which has been given in this trial by Dr Memon and 
Dr Maganty, I am satisfied that : 
 
a) you are suffering from a mental disorder, namely schizophrenia, 
 
b) this disorder is of a  nature which makes it appropriate for you to  be detained in a 

hospital for medical treatment and 

 
c) appropriate medical treatment is available for you at the Tamarind Centre and a bed 

is available currently. 

 
I  am  of  the  opinion  that  because  of  all  the  circumstances  of  your  case,  including  the 
grave nature of the offences of which you have been found not guilty by insanity (which 
are ones of attempted murder and wounding with intent), and having considered your 
character,  antecedents,  and  complicated  history  of  mental 
illness,  and  having 
considered all the other available ways in which I might deal with you, the most suitable 
method  of  dealing  with  your  case  is  by  means  of  an  order  under  s.  37  of  the  Mental 
Health  Act  1983.    You  have  a  mental  disorder  of  a  nature  and  degree  that  requires 
inpatient treatment in hospital for your own health and safety and for the protection of 
others. 
 
I therefore make an order that you will be readmitted to and detained at the Tamarind 
Centre,  165  Yardley  Green  Road,  Bordesley  Green,  Birmingham.  I  am  satisfied  that 
arrangements have been made for you to be readmitted. 
 
I have also considered whether this order should be subject to special restrictions which 
are specified in s. 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983.   
 
In  this  regard  I  have  heard  additionally  the  oral  expert  evidence  of  Dr  Maganty.    He 
remains of the clear opinion that a restriction order is necessary for the protection of 
the  public.  There  is  a  significant  risk  of  serious  harm  if  there  is  a  relapse  in  your 
condition, and your condition is one that relapses and remits.
--------
Having heard and considered all of the expert evidence I am satisfied that, because of 
the nature of your offences and having regard to your mental illness and to the risk that 
you will commit further offences if you are not detained, a restriction order is necessary 
to protect the public from serious harm.  I take into account the serious and significant 
risks  that  you  pose  if  you  relapse,  together  with  the  strong  possibility  of  a  future 
relapse. You require lifelong follow up and monitoring to protect the public.  This is not 
a punishment but necessary for the protection of the public. 
 
Accordingly I order that you will be subject to the special restrictions set out in s. 41 of 
the Mental Health Act 1983.   This order is unlimited in time.   
 
I order forfeiture of the knife, its sheath and the belt.  
 
In the circumstances of this case I make no compensation order. 
 
The surcharge provisions apply and the order will be drawn up accordingly.",2014-02-04 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Southwark Crown Court 

5 February 2014 

Sentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge McCreath 

 

 

I am in no position to come to any informed conclusions about why it was that 
the family court ultimately denied you access to your children, other than to 
observe,  as  you  well  know,  that  in  our  system  of  family  justice  it  is  the 
interests  of  the  children  which  are  paramount,  as  they  surely  should  be.  If 
anyone has rights in these matters, it is the children, not the parents, who have 
them.  

Nonetheless,  for  the  purposes  of  sentencing  you  today,  I  accept  that  your 
separation  from  your  daughters  for  a  period  of  4  years  caused  you  real 
anguish. I also accept that you felt that the legal processes by which you had 
tried to have contact with them had failed you. 

I  do  not,  however,  accept  that  the  means  you  chose  to  adopt  to  make  your 
protest were in any way justified. This was, in reality, a choice you made, not 
a sudden ill-considered act under immediate provocation. 

You made a carefully considered decision that you would gain publicity for 
yourself  and  for  your  wider  cause  by  targeting  the  portrait  of  the  Queen  on 
public display in Westminster Abbey. You prepared yourself by buying a can 
of spray paint and taking it into the Abbey. 

You caused damage to the painting, disappointment to those who had come to 
see  it,  cost  to  the  Abbey  and  their  insurers  in  putting  it  right,  and  almost 
certainly some degree of offence to many people who would regard an attack 
on a portrait of the monarch as unacceptable.  

 

1.1 

1.2 

1.3 

1.4 

1.5 

1.6  Whilst  I  accept  that  the  painting  was  damaged  and  not  destroyed,  I  am 
satisfied, having seen you give evidence, that your assertion that you intended 
to do no more than cause damage which could be easily repaired is simply not 
true. I have no doubt that you intended to do as much damage as you could 
and that it was only the intervention of Mr Crook, the steward on duty, that 
limited the damage to the extent that it was possible to repair the painting at a 
cost of less than £10,000. 

1.7 

There is one other aspect of this which is worthy of mention. The opportunity 
to have close access to works of art is greatly valued by many people. Those 
who act as you did put that opportunity at risk. It would be a sad day when 
works of art can only be viewed from a distance or from behind barriers.
--------
1.8 

1.9 

Your case does not fall easily within such sentencing guidelines as there are in 
relation  to  criminal  damage.  This  case  involves  the  deliberate  and  planned 
causing of damage to a valuable item of property, on public display, carried 
out as a publicity exercise. 

The sentence I must pass must acknowledge your distress and unhappiness but 
must also have regard to the aggravating features of the offence which I have 
identified and to a degree deter others from acting as you did. 

1.10 

I do not consider that a sentence of any great length is necessary in your case 
but there must be a sentence of imprisonment and one which you must serve 
today. 

1.11  The sentence on you is 6 months imprisonment.",2014-02-05 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

In the Crown Court at Cambridge sitting at the Central Criminal Court 

 

28 February 2014 

 

 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Spencer 

 

Joanne  Dennehy,  Gary  Stretch,  Leslie  Layton   and  Robert  Moore,  you  may  remain 

seated for the time being.  

 

 Joanne  Dennehy,  within  the  space  of  10  days  at  the  end  of  March  last  year  you 

murdered three men in cold blood. Although you pleaded guilty you have made it 

quite  clear  that  you  have  no  remorse  for  those  murders.  With  the  help  of  one  or 

more of your co‐defendants you dumped the bodies of your three victims in remote 

rural areas around Peterborough hoping they would not be found. Only a matter of 

days later you attempted to murder two more men, this time openly on the streets 

of  Hereford,  victims  chosen  entirely  at  random.  Miraculously  they  survived.  You 

claim  to  feel  remorse  for  stabbing  those  two  men  nearly  to  death.  I  have  no 

hesitation  in  rejecting  that  suggestion.  You  are  a  cruel,  calculating,  selfish,  and 

manipulative serial killer.   

 

1
--------
You  Gary  Stretch  actively  assisted  Joanne  Dennehy  in  dumping  the  bodies  of  all 

three  men  she  had  murdered,  making  use  of  your  local  knowledge.  You  were  her 

driver  in  Hereford  and  stopped  the  car  to  enable  her  to  get  out  and  attempt  to 

murder  two  more  men.  You  knew  exactly  what  she  was  likely  to  do.  The  jury 

convicted you of attempted murder as well.  

 

 You Leslie Layton actively assisted Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch in dumping the 

bodies  of  two  of  the  three  men  she  had  murdered.  One  of  them  was  your 

housemate.  The  other  was  your  landlord.  You  had  every  opportunity  to  distance 

yourself  from  these  crimes.  Instead  you  chose  to  go  along  with  them.  When  the 

police  were  trying  to  find  your  missing  housemate  and  needed  your  help  as  a 

member of the public, you repeatedly lied to them to cover your own tracks and to 

protect Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch. Had you told the truth, it is possible they 

would have been arrested before the attacks in Hereford.  

 

 You Robert Moore gave shelter and assistance to Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch  

for two nights when you knew or believed she had committed those murders and 

that he had helped her dump the bodies.  

 

 I have to sentence each of you for your part in these appalling offences. Before I do 

so, however, I need to set out the factual basis on which I sentence you all.  

 

 Your  first  victim,  Joanne  Dennehy,  was  a  31  year  old  Polish  man,  Lukasz 

Slaboszewski.  He  had  come  to  this  country  in  2005.  Somehow  you  met  and 

befriended  him.  Within  a  matter  of  days  of  meeting  him  you  murdered  him.  He 

texted  his  friend  to  the  effect  that  life  was  beautiful  now  that  he  had  you  as  his 

girlfriend.  You  lured  him  soon  afterwards  to  11  Rolleston  Garth  in  Peterborough, 

where  you  had  been  living.   There   can  be  no  doubt  that  you  lured  him  there 

specifically to kill him. You stabbed him once through the heart. Whilst you decided 

how to dispose of his body permanently, you put the body for the time being into a 

wheelie  bin.  You  made  a  point  of  bringing  a  14  year  old  girl  whom  you  had 

 

2
--------
befriended  to  11  Rolleston  Garth  where  you  opened  the  bin  and  showed  her  the 

dead  body.  You  deny  doing  this,  but  the  detail  of  her  account  is  so  clear  and 

compelling  that  I  find  it  impossible  to  accept  your  denial.   That  conduct  is  an 

aggravating  feature  of  the  murder  and  of  the  charge  of  preventing  the  lawful  and 

decent burial of the body. You set about acquiring a vehicle specifically to dispose of 

the body. With money you borrowed for the purpose from your landlord and third 

victim, Kevin Lee, you bought a Vauxhall Astra, travelling with Gary Stretch by taxi to 

collect it. This was within two days of the murder. Later the same evening, you and 

Gary  Stretch  were  driving  around  remote  areas  on  the  outskirts  of  Peterborough 

looking  for  a  suitable  site  to  dump  the  body.  The  site  chosen  was  Thorney  Dyke, 

close  to  where  you,  Gary  Stretch,  had  lived  some  years  earlier.  You  boasted  to 

Georgina Page that no‐one would ever find the bodies dumped there.  

 

 The  second  man  you  murdered,  Joanne  Dennehy,  was  John  Chapman.  He  was  56 

years old. He was murdered a week or so later, probably in the early hours of Friday 
29th March, Good Friday. You stabbed him to death in his own bedsitting room at 38 

Bifield where by now you were also living. John Chapman was a kindly, harmless and 

inoffensive man who had served his country in the Royal Navy but had fallen on hard 

times through his weakness for alcohol. You, Joanne Dennehy, were well aware of 

that vulnerability and exploited it. You, Gary Stretch, and you, Leslie Layton, met and 

drank  with  John  Chapman  at  38  Bifield  only  a  matter  of  days  before  he  was 

murdered. You, Leslie Layton, lived in another bedsit room on the same floor of the 

building. You, Joanne Dennehy, said or hinted to Georgina Page when you visited her 

a few days later that you had killed this man because he came into the bathroom 

when you were having a bath and would not leave. I bear in mind that it is a feature 

of  your  psychopathic  personality  that  you  are  a  pathological  liar.  There  is  clear 

evidence that you had threatened John Chapman that you would get him out of the 

house by any means. Eviction notices had been served on the tenants at 38 Bifield by 

your landlord and third victim Kevin Lee, someone you wanted to lead to believe you 

were helping. You had only just moved into 38 Bifield. John Chapman described you 

to another tenant, Toni Ann Roberts as “the mad woman”. It was she whom he told 

that he was having problems with you, and that you had said you would get him out 

 

3
--------
of the house by any means. I am quite sure that this, once again, was a planned and 

premeditated killing.  

 

 You stabbed John Chapman to death in his own bed sitting room. You stabbed him 

once in the neck, severing the carotid artery, and five times in the chest. Two of the 

stab wounds penetrated the heart, one of them inflicted with sufficient force to pass 

first through the breast bone. There was no injury to suggest that John Chapman had 

attempted  to  defend  himself.  His  blood  alcohol  level  was  four  times  the  limit  for 

driving. It may even be that you stabbed him as he lay asleep on his bed.  

 

 You, Leslie Layton, had a photograph of John Chapman’s dead body on your mobile 

phone, a photograph taken at 7.32am that day, not long after the murder. You were 

never asked about that photograph by the police in interview, because it had been 

deleted from your phone and had not then been retrieved by forensic analysis. You 

had the opportunity at your trial to give evidence and tell the jury, if it was truly the 

case, that you did not take that photograph, did not delete it, and knew nothing of it. 

You did not give evidence.  Instead the theory was put forward by your counsel in his 

closing speech that the photograph might have been taken by Joanne Dennehy using 

your phone and that she might have deleted the image without your ever knowing it 

was  there.  That  was  only  a  theory.  There  is  no  evidence  to  support  it.  Bearing  in 

mind  how  critical  the  evidence  of  this  photograph  was  to  the  prosecution  case 

against you in rebutting your defence of duress, and how important it would have 

been be for you to challenge it, I am quite sure that the reason why you chose not to 

give evidence about this photograph was that you knew it was you who took it and 

you who deleted it.  

 

 Soon after you had murdered John Chapman you, Joanne Dennehy, were using the 

dead  man’s  mobile  phone.  I  strongly  suspect  that  it  was  you  who  was  using  it  as 

early as 6.34am to call Gary Stretch, an hour before the photograph was taken, but I 

cannot be sure of that as the telephone schedule shows that from time to time over 

the previous few days John Chapman had himself called Gary Stretch, albeit never so 

early in the morning.

--------
When  you,  Leslie  Layton,  were  confronted  with  the  body  of  John  Chapman  early 

that  Friday  morning  your  reaction  was  not  to  call  for  help  but  to  photograph  the 

body  for  your  own  purposes  as  a  morbid  souvenir.  That  showed  a  callous 

indifference to the plight of your housemate. When Gary Stretch came round to 38 

Bifield  soon  afterwards  that  morning  you  were  able  to  leave  the  house,  free  of 

threat or fear, and you went out shopping with a friend. You could and should have 

raised  the  alarm  then,  but  instead  you  chose  to  meet  up  again  with  Gary  Stretch 

later that afternoon knowing that the body of John Chapman still lay upstairs in the 

room where  he had been murdered. You played your part in helping to dump the 

body of John Chapman later that night, in the same ditch at Thorney Dyke where the 

body of Lukasz Slaboszewski lay undiscovered. I shall return to that.  

 

 The third man you murdered, Joanne Dennehy, was your landlord Kevin Lee. He was 

48 years old, a much loved husband and father. By a combination of bad judgement 

on  his  part  born  of  genuine  compassion  and  desire  to  help  you,  and  the  strange 

fascination  that  you  held  for  him,  as  you  did  for  other  men,  Kevin  Lee  became 

infatuated with you. Over a period of several months you led him to believe that you 

had been grossly abused as a child and even that you had killed your own father and 

served many years in prison as a result. That was pure fantasy. You had a perfectly 

decent  and  proper  upbringing  and  the  advantage  of  a  good  home.  Kevin  Lee 

befriended you, gave you employment in his property letting business and provided 

you with accommodation in a series of bedsits in the houses his company owned and 

rented out. Your relationship with Kevin Lee became so close that you felt able to 

confide in him that you had committed the first murder. You were to tell Georgina 

Page later that it was because he had seen the body that you had to kill Kevin Lee. 

That may be part of the reason, but it was only part. I am quite sure that the reason 

you murdered Kevin Lee in the way that you did, and dumped his body in the way 

that you did, was to gratify your own sadistic lust for blood.  

 

 Like  your  first  victim,  you  lured  your  third  victim  Kevin  Lee  to  11  Rolleston  Garth 

specifically in order to murder him. You had whetted his appetite sexually by telling 

 

5
--------
him that when he came to see you that Friday afternoon you were going to dress 

him up and rape him. That is what he told his best friend Dave Church when he met 

him that afternoon on business less than an hour before his fatal rendezvous with 

you  at  Rolleston  Garth.  It  was  not  the  first  time  Kevin  Lee  had  described  to  Dave 

Church the sort of extreme sexual activity you and he were taking part in together. 

You  stabbed  Kevin  Lee  five  times  in  the  chest.  The  wounds  penetrated  both  lungs 

and  the  heart.  This  time  there  were  injuries  to  suggest  that  your  victim  tried  to 

defend himself.  

 

 With  two  dead  bodies  now  to  dispose  of,  at  two  separate  addresses,  you  Joanne 

Dennehy  and  you  Gary  Stretch  were  seen  by  various  witnesses  engaged  in  the 

cleaning up operations. Then in the evening, with you as well now, Leslie Layton, the 

three  of  you  set  about  dumping  these  two  bodies  and  covering  your  tracks.  You, 

Leslie  Layton,  I  am  quite  satisfied  on  all  the  evidence,  were  a  wholly  willing 

participant in getting rid of the bodies and setting fire to Kevin Lee’s Mondeo car. 

The  three  of  you  travelled  to  another  remote  rural  area  on  the  outskirts  of 

Peterborough at Newborough to dump the body of Kevin Lee. You, Joanne Dennehy, 

had  indeed  dressed  Kevin  Lee  in  a  black  sequinned  dress  of  your  own.  As  a  final 

humiliation, his body was dumped in the ditch still wearing that dress, with his naked 

buttocks exposed. I have studied the photographs of his body as it was found in the 

ditch, rather than rely on the sanitised photograph which, quite properly, was all the 

jury were allowed to see. I am quite satisfied that Kevin Lee’s body must have been 

deliberately  positioned  or  deliberately  left  that  way,  with  his  bare  buttocks 

prominently exposed upwards, still wearing the sequinned dress. 

 

 I  am  prepared  to  accept,  however,  that  you,  Leslie  Layton,  played  no  part  in  that 

and,  as  you  told  the  police,  did  not  get  out  of  the  car  on  that  occasion.  But  you, 

Leslie Layton, were active in driving the Mondeo, probably with Kevin Lee’s body in 

the boot, and as the CCTV clearly showed you were prominent in obtaining petrol 

with which to set fire to and destroy the Mondeo. This was done on an area of waste 

ground at Yaxley quite deliberately chosen, I am sure, to be as far away as possible 

 

6
--------
from  where  Kevin  Lee’s  body  had  been  dumped,  out  beyond  the  other  side  of 

Peterborough.  

 

 The three  of you then returned in the Astra to 38 Bifield  where  the body of John 

Chapman was loaded into the car. You, Leslie Layton , admitted in interview that you 

played an active part with Joanne Dennehy in carrying his body downstairs from the 

top floor. It was probably his body that you, Gary Stretch, were seen carrying to the 

car and putting in the boot, causing the suspension to drop. The three of you drove 

out  to  Thorney  Dyke  where  John  Chapman’s  body  was  dumped  in  the  same  ditch 

where  the  body  of  Lukasz  Slaboszewski  still  lay.  This  time  you  got  out  of  the  car, 

Leslie Layton, and must have seen there was another body already there. The jury 

rejected  your  defence  of  duress.  You  had  ample  opportunity  in  the  course  of  that 

day to distance yourself from Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch. It was fascination 

not fear which led you to stay with them and help them to dispose of the bodies. 

That is why you had no qualms about accepting Gary Stretch’s offer to stay at his flat 

overnight.  

 

 You Gary Stretch, also relied on the defence of duress before the jury. Whatever the 

true  nature  of  your  relationship  with  Joanne  Dennehy  there  is  not  a  shred  of 

evidence  that  you  were  ever  in  fear  of  her.  Had  you  been,  you  would  not  have 

dispensed with the gun which I am sure you had in your possession when you went 

on the run to Hereford two days later.  

 

 You, Leslie Layton, and you, Robert Moore, were more than willing to given Joanne 

Dennehy and Gary  Stretch whatever assistance they  wanted in evading the police, 

even  though  you  knew  full  well  that  murders  had  been  committed  and  bodies 

dumped. Leslie Layton told the police that it was from your house, Robert Moore, 

that the tarpaulin was borrowed in which to wrap or carry the bodies that Friday. I 

do not sentence you on the basis that you lent them the tarpaulin knowing why it 

was needed.  That allegation has never been made. But you knew that the body of 

the first victim had been stored for a while in a wheelie bin at 11 Rolleston Garth, 

close to where you lived. That much is apparent from what you told the probation 

 

7
--------
officer,  although  you  made  no  comment  in  interview  when  the  police  questioned 

you on the topic. It is quite clear, not least from the text messages you sent her, that 

you  were  besotted  with  Joanne  Dennehy  and  prepared  to  do  almost  anything  to 

indulge her. Knowing what she and Gary Stretch had done you were willing to put 

them  up  in  your  house  and  willing  even  to  expose  your  young  daughter  to  their 

influence.  When  they  could  not  return  to  their  own  accommodation  because  the 

police  were  looking  for  them,  you  provided  them  with  food  and  shelter  for  two 
nights running, Saturday 30th and Sunday 31st March..  

 

 Over that Easter weekend you, Leslie Layton, were undoubtedly wracked with guilt 

and worry over what you had done. That is why your friends Toni Ann Roberts and 

Michelle Bowles described you as distressed and upset on the Sunday evening when 

they spoke to you. That did not stop you trying to cover your tracks, however, nor 

did  it  induce  you  to  go  to  the  police  and  tell  them  what  you  knew  about  the 

disappearance  of  John  Chapman  which  was,  by  now,  headline  news  in  the  media. 
Instead, when the police came to see you on Sunday 31st March and again on the 
afternoon of 1st April you lied time and again in denying all knowledge of what had 

become  of  John  Chapman.  You  said  you  had  not  seen  him  since  the  previous 

Wednesday or Thursday. In fact on the Friday night you had helped to dump his dead 

body  in  a  ditch.  You  said  you  had  not  seen  Joanne  Dennehy  since  the  previous 

Wednesday. You lied to the police in a determined attempt to pervert the course of 

justice. The jury rejected your defence of duress. By now Joanne Dennehy and Gary 

Stretch were far away in East Anglia. All you had to do was tell the police the truth if 

you had the remotest concern for your own physical safety. I am sure you did not. 

You were thinking only of yourself and your friends in crime. Whilst the police were 

speaking to you that Monday afternoon you had several calls from Joanne Dennehy, 

calling you on the phone of the dead man the police were asking you about. As soon 

as  the  police  had  left,  you  rang  Joanne  Dennehy  back,  no  doubt  to  report  the 

progress of the police investigation as you knew it, as she had requested you should 

in a revealing earlier text message you neglected to delete from your phone. 

 

 

8
--------
On  the  Monday  evening,  you,  Joanne  Dennehy  and  Gary  Stretch,  paid  a  visit  to 

Georgina Page in King’s Lynn. There you both talked in a matter of fact way about 

the  murders.  It  was  there  that  you,  Gary  Stretch,  boasted  that  the  bodies  would 

never be found. You, Joanne Dennehy, became excited and animated when you saw 

reports  on  television  that  you  were  wanted.   Ecstatic   was  the  way  Georgina  Page 

described you to the jury. You told her that when you dressed Kevin Lee up you had 

lubricated his backside and shoved something up it to make it look as though it was a 

sexual act. I am quite sure that you, Gary Stretch, did threaten Georgina Page before 

you  left  her  house,  saying  that  you  would  get  your  father  to  sort  it  out  if  anyone 

grassed on the two of you. Georgina Page told the jury that she understood by this 

that if she went to the police she might be killed. You, Joanne Dennehy, said that you 

knew the two of you would get caught and go to prison for a long time. You, Gary 

Stretch, laughed and said “My kids are grown up, so I don’t care”. The two of you 

returned to Peterborough and spent a second night at Robert Moore’s home.   

 
 Early  on  Tuesday  morning,  2nd  April,  you  set  off  together  from  his  home  for 

Hereford.  You  chose  Hereford  because  it  was  somewhere  Gary  Stretch  knew  well. 

You had burgled a house at Diss in Norfolk the previous day. This time you burgled 

another  house  in  Herefordshire  looking  for  valuable  electrical  items  you  could  sell 

easily. By now the two of you were well and truly on the run and your behaviour was 

totally lawless. 

 

 You met up with other criminals at a flat in Kington, about 20 miles from Hereford 

on the Welsh border. The two of you, and the rest of the group you met, agreed to 

sell  the  stolen  property  to  someone  in  Hereford  with  whom  there  would  be  a 

rendezvous. One of the men in the group you met was Mark Lloyd. He gave evidence 

at the trial over a long period and, like the jury, I had a good opportunity to assess 

him. I bear in mind the need for caution in relation to his evidence. However, I am 

quite sure he was not a willing passenger in the Vauxhall Astra when it set off for 

Hereford.  I  am  also  sure  that  before  you  left  the  flat  in  Hereford  there  was  an 

incident  in  the  kitchen,  out  of  sight  of  Joanne  Dennehy,  when  you,  Gary  Stretch, 

showed  Mark  Lloyd  a  hand  gun  which  was  in  the  waistband  of  your  trousers. 

 

9
--------
Whether  the  gun  was  in  fact  loaded,  as  Mark  Lloyd  believed  on  the  basis  of  his 

experience of such weapons, matters not. His evidence that you were in possession 

of such a gun was not challenged in cross‐examination, although I accept that it was 

your  counsel’s  judgment  not  to  challenge  it.  I  accept  too  that  you  had  denied  in 

interview having such a gun, but you told many important lies in your interviews, so 

that  denial  counts  for  very  little.  Nor  did  you  give  evidence  to  contradict  Mark 

Lloyd’s evidence about the gun, where any denial would have been tested. 

 

 I  am  sure  that  you  did  have  such a  gun  in your  possession,  and  sure that  you  led 

Mark Lloyd to believe you had it with you to rob a drug dealer if you could find one. 

You left the flat and disposed of the gun somewhere before the journey to Hereford 

began.  That  is  significant  in  itself  because  it  shows  you  were  not  truly  in  fear  of 

Joanne  Dennehy  and  did  not  consider  that  you  needed  a  gun  for  your  own 

protection against her. It is more likely, in my judgment, that you realised you were 

bound  to  be  apprehended  by  the  police  sooner  or  later  and  did  not  want  to 

compound your criminality by being caught in possession of a firearm. The fact that 

you had access to such a gun is, however, relevant to the danger you may pose to 

the public. I shall return to that.  

 

 Either before the journey to Hereford began, or during the course of the journey, I 

am quite sure that you, Joanne Dennehy, said words to the effect that Gary Stretch 

had  already  had  his  fun,  in  the  sense  of  carrying  out  the  burglary,  and  now  you 

wanted your fun. I am also sure that you said earlier, at the flat, that you had killed 

three people, that Gary Stretch had helped to dispose of the bodies, and  you had to 

do  some  more.  By  the time you  arrived  in Hereford  I  have  no  doubt that you had 

already  formed  the  intention  of  killing  at  least  one  more  man,  at  random,  by 

stabbing him to death, and that you Gary Stretch knew perfectly well that this was 

bound to happen.  In the event two men were nearly killed, not one.  

 

 On the jury’s verdicts you, Gary Stretch, either shared Joanne Dennehy’s intention 

to  kill  the  two  men  she  stabbed  in  Hereford  or  at  the  very  least  realised  that  she 

would stab them with the intention of killing them. On the facts of this case there is 

 

10
--------
no real difference. One way or the other you foresaw the inevitability of what was 

going to happen and you played your part in bringing it about.  

 

 I am quite sure on the evidence that it was you, Gary Stretch, who spotted the first 

victim, Robin Bereza, as you drove down the road. He was walking his dog ahead of 

you on the nearside pavement. You lied to the police in interview in suggesting that 

you had pulled up only after passing him and you lied in suggesting that you did not 

see what happened because it was taking place behind the car. The truth, I am sure, 

is that you decided to stop the car when and where you did, pulling up before you 

reached him, in order to give Joanne Dennehy the advantage of surprising her victim 

by  attacking  him  from  behind.  Whether  you  actually  uttered  the  words  “Will  he 

do?”, as Mark Lloyd told the jury, is less important. The fact is that you initiated the 

opportunity for the attack.  

 

 You, Joanne Dennehy, claim that you were under the influence of alcohol when you 

carried  out  this  attack  and  that  you  feel  remorse  for  what  you  did.  You  had 

undoubtedly  been  drinking  whiskey  from  a  bottle  during  the  journey  that  day  but 

despite the expert’s back‐calculation of your possible alcohol level, I reject entirely 

any suggestion that you were so inebriated that you were unaware of what you were 

doing or that you were disinhibited by the alcohol you had consumed. Only a minute 

or so before the first attack you and Mark Lloyd went into the Green Lane store, as 

shown on the CCTV. You appear to have been in high spirits and, from the way you 

were behaving towards the young woman behind the counter, you were possibly in 

a state of euphoria at what was in prospect, but there was no indication at all that 

you were grossly affected by drink. 

 

 Robin Bereza was 63 years old at the time, a retired fireman who had kept himself 

fit.  That  afternoon  he  had  chosen  to  walk  his  dog  rather  than  go  jogging.  You 

attacked him from behind, taking him completely unawares. You stabbed him first in 

the back then a second time in the right upper arm. When he turned to face you and 

asked what on earth you were doing you told him “I want to hurt you, I am going to 

fucking kill you”. He tried to fight you off, kicking out at you. You pursued him into 

 

11
--------
the road, continuing the attack, but eventually you did desist, probably because of 

the  arrival  of  another  car  at  the  scene  waiting  to  turn  into  a  side  road.  You,  Gary 

Stretch, had driven the car slowly behind Joanne Dennehy and beckoned to her to 

get back into the car. You did and said nothing to show any disapproval or surprise at 

any  stage  at  what  she  was  doing.  I  accept  the  evidence  of  Mark  Lloyd  that  you 

exercised  some  degree  of  physical  restraint  over  him,  for  otherwise  I  am  sure  he 

would have got out of the car and distanced himself from what was going on. You 

Joanne Dennehy calmly got into the car, looking across and smiling at the driver of 

the other car waiting to turn right at the junction where this was taking place.  

 

 Although you managed to inflict only two stab wounds to Robin Bereza you caused 

him potentially fatal injuries. The deep wound to his back penetrated the chest wall 

causing a haemo‐pneumothorax as well as bruising the lung and fracturing a rib. Had 

the blood and air not been promptly drained from his chest cavity by expert medical 

treatment, his life would have been in danger. The other stab wound shattered the 

shoulder blade and fractured the bone in the upper arm. It was only by pure chance 

that  the  nerves  in  the  arm  were  not  damaged  irreparably  with  a  drastic  loss  of 

function.  The  attack  has  had  a  profound  effect  on  him  emotionally  and 

psychologically, and I shall return to this.  

 

 You, Joanne Dennehy, were not satisfied with the outcome of this first attack. You 

had  not  succeeded  in  your  objective  of  killing  another  man.  You  required  Gary 

Stretch to find you another victim and you, Gary Stretch, were happy to oblige her.   

It was no coincidence that the second victim was another man walking his dog. Using 

your local knowledge you, Gary Stretch, drove to a cul‐de‐sac adjacent to a path well 

used by dog walkers.   As you told the police in interview, it was close to where your 

grandmother used to live. This time your victim was a 56 year old man, John Rogers 

who  lived  nearby  and who  was  taking  his  dog  for  a  walk.  He  had  only  gone  a  few 

yards down the path when you attacked him from behind, stabbing him in the back. 

When he turned round you stabbed him repeatedly. You pushed him backwards for 

several yards, stabbing him all the time. When he fell over you continued to stab him 

to the front and to the back. It was a relentless and frenzied attack with only one

purpose, to kill him. You left him for dead, picked up his dog, and left the scene. As 

he lay there helpless he thought he was dying. You accept that you thought you had 

killed him. That is what you told the police officer who arrested you a few minutes 

later.  

 

 You  stabbed  John  Rogers  more  than  30  times.  He  had  deep  wounds  to  his  chest, 

abdomen  and  back.  Both  lungs  had  collapsed.   His   bowel  was  perforated  and 

exposed.  Had  he  not  received  the  most  expert  and  prompt  medical  treatment  he 

would  have  died  from  these  injuries.  So  severe  was  the  force  of  the  stab  wounds 

that nine ribs were fractured. He also received wounds to his hands and arms which 

could  have  resulted  in  irreparable  nerve  damage.  He  too  has  suffered  grievous 

emotional and psychological harm, to which I shall return.     

 

 The  death  and  destruction  for  which  you  are  responsible,  Joanne  Dennehy,  has 

caused untold distress to the families and friends of the men you murdered and to 

the  victims  who  survived  and  their  families.  Many  of  those  affected  are  in  court 

today.  I have read and taken into account the victim personal statements from John 

Chapman’s brother‐in‐law, from Kevin Lee’s widow, and from Robin Bereza and John 

Rogers.  The  cruel  and  aggravated  circumstances  of  Kevin  Lee’s  death  in  particular 

have been very hard indeed for his loved ones to bear. They are here in court as a 

tribute  to  his  memory  and  to  see  justice  done.  You  Joanne,  Dennehy,  described 

yourself to Kevin Lee as a monster for what you had done in the past. Kevin Lee’s 

widow describes you as a monster who has taken and ruined her family’s lives. Robin 

Bereza speaks of his inability to grasp the reality that anyone could be so evil as to 

attack  someone  in  this  way  for  no  reason,  someone  you  had  never  met.  The 

experience  has  totally  shaken  his  confidence  and  turned  a  robust  former  fireman 

into  a  nervous  shadow  of  his  former  self.  The  lives  of  his  wife  and  family  have 

likewise been turned upside down and it is only with their love and support that he 

has been able to come to terms at all with the enormity of this experience.  

 

 John Rogers acknowledges that he owes his life to those who came to his assistance 

so  promptly  and  the  doctors  who  treated  him  so  expertly.  He  continues  to 

 

13
--------
experience the physical consequences of the attack. For example he no longer has 

the dexterity to play the guitar, and he is a keen musician.  The psychological trauma 

has been just as devastating, and perhaps even greater. Only through the love and 

devotion of his wife has he been able to get through the ordeal at all.  

 

Having set out the factual basis on which I pass sentence, I now deal with each of 

you in turn.  

 

Joanne Dennehy 

 First  you,  Joanne  Dennehy.  For  murder  there 

is  only  one  sentence, 

life 

imprisonment. But I am required to determine the minimum term you must serve. 

Parliament has laid down different starting points for the minimum term, depending 

upon the seriousness and circumstances of the case. In your case only two starting 

points  could  conceivably  be  appropriate,  either  a  whole  life  order  or  a  term  of  30 

years.  If  the  latter,  the  gravity  of  your  offending  is  such  that  the  minimum  term 

would have to be very substantially in excess of 30 years.  

 

 The  issue  in  your  case,  therefore,  is  whether  or  not  there  should  be  a  whole  life 

order. Any question as to the lawfulness of such a sentence has been dispelled by 

the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of McLoughlin [2014] EWCA 

Crim 188. My duty is to apply the provisions of paragraph 4 of schedule 21 to the 

Criminal Justice Act 2003, and to consider whether the seriousness of the offence (or 

the  combination  of  the  offence  and  one  or  more  offences  associated  with  it)  is 

exceptionally high. If the seriousness is exceptionally high, the appropriate starting 

point is a whole life order. Paragraph 4(2) provides that cases that would normally 

fall  within  this  category  include  the  murder  of  two  or  more  persons  where  each 

murder involves a substantial degree of premeditation or planning, or the abduction 

of the victim, or sexual or sadistic conduct.  

 

 For the reasons I have already explained, I am quite sure that each of these three 

murders did involve a substantial degree of premeditation or planning. I am sure on 

the  evidence  that  you  lured  your  first  victim  Lukasz  Slaboszewski  to  11  Rolleston 

 

14
--------
Garth specifically in order  to kill him. I am  quite sure on  all the evidence  that you 

murdered  John  Chapman  not  on  the  spur  of  the  moment  because  he  had  been 

watching you in the bath but because by then you had got a taste for murder and, as 

you had told him, you were prepared to do whatever it would take to get him out of 

the house. I am quite sure that you lured Kevin Lee to 11 Rolleston Garth that Friday 

specifically  in  order  to  kill  him.  I  am  also  quite  sure  that  his  was  a  murder  which 

involved sexual and sadistic conduct on your part. It is true that there is no medical 

evidence at post mortem of sexual interference, but the whole circumstances of the 

killing bear out what he told his friend he was expecting, namely that you were going 

to dress him up and rape him. You admitted as much to Georgina Page. The way in 

which his body was dumped was part of the playing out of your sexual and sadistic 

motivation.  

 

 Quite  apart  from  meeting  the  threshold  of  seriousness  in  the  examples  given  in 

paragraph  4,  there  were  other  aggravating  features  to  these  three  murders.  First, 

each of them involved stabbing with a knife or knives that you took to the scene for 

that very purpose, even if only within the same building. Second, having murdered 

Lukasz Slaboszewski and having put his body in a wheelie bin, you made a point of 

inviting a 14 year old girl to come to 11 Rolleston Garth specifically to show her the 

body in the bin. Third, John Chapman, although not physically disabled, was to your 

knowledge  a  particularly  vulnerable  victim  on  account  of  his  alcoholism  and  you 

exploited that vulnerability. Fourth, you went to great lengths to dump each of the 

three bodies in a remote area where you hoped it would not be found. Fifth, having 

committed  these  murders  and  dumped  the  bodies,  and  knowing  that  you  were 

wanted  by  the  police,  you  attempted  to  murder  and  very  nearly  succeeded  in 

murdering  two  more  men,  selected  at  random,  by  stabbing  them  repeatedly. 

Although  there  are  separate  counts  which  cover  the  dumping  of  the  bodies  and 

these  two  attempted  murders,  the  overall  criminality  of  your  conduct  in  this  case 

must be reflected in the minimum term you are required to serve.  The starting point 

for your minimum term must therefore be a whole life order rather than 30 years.  

Your counsel submits that a whole life order is not necessary in your case because 

the minimum term would in any event be so long. 

 

15
--------
In  addition  to  the  most  recent  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  which  I  have 

referred, I have also considered carefully the guidance in this area given by the Court 

of Appeal in the case of Oakes [2013] 2 Cr App R 22. In particular I bear in mind that 

a whole life order should be imposed only where the seriousness of the offending is 

so exceptionally high that just punishment requires the offender to be kept in prison 

for the rest of his or her life. I am required to consider all the material facts before 

concluding that a very lengthy finite term will be not be sufficiently severe. I bear in 

mind that a whole life order is reserved for the few exceptionally serious offences in 

which, after reflecting on all the features of aggravation and mitigation, the court is 

satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the imposition 

of a whole life order. I also remind myself that I am setting the penal element of the 

sentence only. I am not concerned with risk to the public on release. That is a matter 

solely for the parole board or, very exceptionally, for the Secretary of State. 

 

 I have considered your criminal record. You are now 31 years of age. You have been 

in and out of prison in recent years serving short sentences, mainly for offences of 

dishonesty, although I note that in 2012 you were convicted of possessing a bladed 

article in a public place, razor blades, and later in the year you received a community 

order  for  an  offence  of  assault  occasioning  actual  bodily  harm.  I  have  read  the 
psychiatric report on you from Dr Farnham, dated 26th October 2013. I note that his 

assessment  is  that  you  suffer  from  a  severe  emotionally  unstable  personality 

disorder, and from an antisocial personality disorder. In his opinion you also suffer 

from paraphilia sadomasochism, a disorder of preference for sexual activity involving 

the infliction of pain or humiliation or bondage. It is Dr Farnham’s assessment that 

you suffer from a psychopathic disorder, that is a personality disorder characterised 

by superficial charm, callous disregard for others, pathological lying and a diminished 

capacity for remorse.  

 

 You have not sought to put forward any partial defence to murder based upon your 

psychiatric  condition.  You  very  strongly  declined  the  opportunity  to  do  so  by  the 

firmness  of  your  guilty  pleas  to  all  counts  on  the  indictment  when  you  were  first 

 

16
--------
arraigned on 18th November last year. Your counsel accepted in mitigation that you 

do  not  have  the  normal  range  of  emotions  and  you  do  not  form  personal 

attachments.  Others  end  up  suffering  because  of  your  personality  and  that  risk  is 

removed by your being in custody. I do not consider that your personality disorders 

or psychiatric condition afford any mitigation in this case.  

 

 You  have  shown  no  genuine  remorse.  Quite  the  reverse.  In  the  letter  you  have 

written to me you say in terms that you do not feel any remorse for the murders, 

and to claim otherwise would be a lie. You claim in that letter, and this formed part 

of your counsel’s mitigation, that you do feel remorse for the attempted murders. 

You say that you are ashamed of the brutality and fear you heaped upon those two 

victims and that the attacks will always be a great source of regret. The only reason 

you  can  offer  for  the  attempted  murders  is  “drunken  cruelty  plain  and  simple, 

compelled  by  my  lack  of  respect  for  human  life”.  As  I  have  already  made  clear,  I 

reject your protestations of remorse for these attempted murders. I note that you 

told the psychiatrist that you killed to see how you would feel, “to see if I was as cold 

as I thought I was. Then it got moreish and I got a taste for it.” It is very significant, in 

my judgement, that from a single stab wound to the heart to kill your first victim you 

progressed  by  the  end  to  the  frenzied  attack  on  John  Rogers  when  you  so  nearly 

killed him, stabbing him more than 30 times. You told the psychiatrist you saw the 

killings as a kind of fetish and that you were sadistic.   

 

 I  have  considered  very  carefully  all  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  and  all  the 

features  of  aggravation  and  mitigation,  including  your  guilty  pleas.  I  am  quite 

satisfied  that  the  seriousness  of  these  murders  is  exceptionally  high  and  that  the 

element of just punishment and retribution requires the imposition of a whole life 

order. Even if, contrary to my conclusion, any of the three murders did not involve a 

substantial  degree  of  premeditation  or  planning,  the  overall  circumstances  of  the 

three murders, taken in combination with the attempted murders and the dumping 

of the bodies, plainly makes this a case of exceptionally high seriousness and one of 

the rare cases which requires a whole life order. 

 

 

17
--------
Having  regard  to  the  Sentencing  Council  guideline  for  attempted  murder,  I  am 

satisfied  that  each  of  these  attempted  murders,  if  they  stood  alone,  falls  into  the 

highest  category  in  level  1,  where  the  sentencing  range  after  a  trial  is  27‐35  years 

custody  and  the  starting  point  30  years.  There  must  be  life  sentences  for  the 

attempted murders. Had the offences of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a 

body  stood  alone,  the  appropriate  total  sentence  for  those  three  offences,  after  a 

trial, would in your case have been at least 16 years imprisonment, but you did at 

least  plead  guilty,  for  which  you  are  entitled  to  credit  although  it  makes  no 

difference overall.  

 

Joanne  Dennehy  for  these  three  cruel  and  brutal  murders  I  sentence  you  to  life 

imprisonment  and  the  term  you  will  serve  is  a  whole  life  order.  That  reflects  the 

seriousness not only of the three murders but also the two attempted murders and 

the three offences of preventing the lawful burial of the bodies of your three victims. 

For  the  two  attempted  murders,  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  life 

imprisonment. For each of the offences of preventing burial, there will be concurrent 

sentences of 12 years imprisonment.  

 

 

Gary Stretch 

 I  deal  with  you  next,  Gary  Stretch.  I  have  to  sentence  you  for  three  offences  of 

preventing  the  lawful  and  decent  burial  of  the  bodies  of  the  three  men  who  had 

been murdered, and for two offences of attempted murder. They are all very serious 

offences indeed, for which a very lengthy sentence of imprisonment is inevitable. 

 

 I  consider  first  the  three  counts  of  preventing  lawful  and  decent  burial.  It  is  a 

common law offence for which there is no maximum penalty. These were offences 

at  the  very  top  of  the  scale  of  seriousness.  I  have  been  referred  to  a  number  of 

authorities. In particular I have been assisted by the guidance of the Court of Appeal 

in the case of Godward [1998] 1 Cr App R (S) 385. This is an offence which can vary 

enormously  in  its  seriousness.  The  most  important  factor  is  the  intention  of  the 

offender. If the intention was to obstruct the course of justice by concealing a body, 

 

18
--------
so  as  to  make  it  difficult  or  impossible  to  bring  home  a  charge  against  the  person 

responsible  for  the  death,  then  a  sentence  at  the  top  of  the  appropriate  scale  is 

required.  That  is  plainly  the  position  here.  The  case  of  Skinner,  referred  to  in 

Godward, tends to suggest that any of these three offences on its own would have 

merited a sentence of at least 7 ½ years imprisonment after a trial.  

 

 Although  Joanne  Dennehy  initiated  these  offences,  you  played  a  leading  role  in 

selecting  the  sites  where  these  three  bodies  were  dumped.  In  particular  you  had 

lived near Thorney Dyke and boasted to Georgina Page that no one would find the 

bodies. Just how close you came to achieving that objective is demonstrated by the 
fact that the farmer who found the two bodies in the ditch at Thorney Dyke on 3rd 

April  had  for  several  days  been  working  in  that  area  of  his  land  without  spotting 

them. I am quite sure that you carried out reconnaissance of the outlying rural areas 

around  Peterborough  to  find  suitable  places  to  dump  the  bodies.  You  helped  to 

clean up the scenes of the murders. You helped to load the bodies into the car. You 

drove  the  car  to  the  scene.  As  I  have  already  made  clear,  I  reject  entirely  any 

suggestion  that  you  were  in  fear  of  Joanne  Dennehy.  On  the  contrary,  you  were 

revelling  in  helping  her  and  in  the  publicity  of  being  described  as  “Britian’s  most 

wanted”.  You  were  luxuriating  in  the  notoriety  which  you  enjoyed  through  your 

association  with  Joanne  Dennehy  and  her  crimes.  Taking  account  of  totality,  and 

passing concurrent sentences to reflect the overall criminality of the three offences, 

the overall sentence for these three counts of preventing the burial of the bodies, if 

the offences stood alone, would be 15 years imprisonment.  

 

 I turn to the two attempted murders. For the reasons I have already explained, on 

the facts of this case there is little difference between the alternative mental states 

which the jury were required to consider. Joanne Dennehy had to your knowledge 

already murdered three men. She was talking that day about wanting her  fun and 

doing  more.  It  was  therefore  obvious  to  you  that  if  and  when  she  found  another 

victim  she  was  bound  to  try  to  kill  him.  For  that  reason  there  is  precious  little 

difference between a shared intention to kill on the one hand and a realisation that 

there was a real risk she would kill, with the intent to kill, on the other. I am quite 

 

19
--------
satisfied  that  you  knew  perfectly  well  that  when  the  opportunity  arose  she  would 

attempt to kill again.  

 

 You did not wield the knife, but you played a crucial part in facilitating these two 

dreadful attempted murders. As I have already set out, you stopped the car where 

and when you did specifically so that she could get out and attack Robin Bereza from 

behind,  catching  him  unawares.  In  that  sense  you  both  assisted  and  encouraged 

Joanne Dennehy to commit the offence, fully believing and expecting that she would 

stab  her  victim  to  death.  You  knew  there  were  no  half  measures  with  Joanne 

Dennehy.  You  said  or  did  nothing  to  stop  her.  Quite  the  opposite.  You  sat  and 

watched what she was doing, and beckoned her back to the car when the time was 

right.  For  the  reasons  I  have  already  explained,  I  am  quite  sure  as  well  that  you 

exercised some physical restraint on Mark Lloyd for a short time at least in order to 

stop him leaving the car and raising the alarm.  

 

 When Joanne Dennehy made it clear that she wanted a second victim you drove her 

to a spot where you knew, from your local knowledge of Hereford, that dog walkers 

were to be found. It was no coincidence that John Rogers, walking his dog, was the 

next  victim.  Again,  you  assisted  and  encouraged  Joanne  Dennehy  to  commit  that 

second  and  very  nearly  fatal  attack,  knowing  perfectly  well  that  murder  was  what 

she intended. Had either of these two victims died, you would have been facing a life 

sentence for murder. The starting point for your minimum term for one such offence 

of murder would have been 25 years, and if both men had died, the starting point 

would have been at least 30 years. 

 

 Both  victims  survived,  but  these  two  attempted  murders  are  still  offences  of  the 

utmost seriousness, and at the very top of the scale under the Sentencing Council 

guideline. Your counsel submits that your culpability was markedly less than Joanne 

Dennehy’s  and  that  this  means  that  these  were,  in  your  case,  at  most  level  2 

offences. I disagree. In my judgment they are plainly level 1 offences, that is to say 

offences of a kind which would attract a starting point of 30 years for the minimum 

term had the charge been murder. That is equivalent to a determinate sentence of 

 

20
--------
60  years.   In   both  cases,  for  the  reasons  I  have  explained,  the  victim  has  suffered 

serious and long term physical and psychological harm. That means that under the 

guideline  the  starting  for  these  two  attempted  murders  would  be  a  determinate 

sentence of 30 years imprisonment, with a sentencing range of 27 to 35 years. That 

would  be  the  appropriate  level  of  sentence  for  someone  with  no  previous 

convictions whatsoever.  

 

 You have an appalling criminal record, albeit mainly for offences of dishonesty. That 

record, however, includes many convictions for dwelling house burglary where the 

potential  for  confrontation  with  a  householder  is  always  a  risk.  You  also  have  a 

conviction for robbery as a young man, for which you received a custodial sentence 

of 5 years. That, I am told, arose in the course of a house burglary. More recently in 

2000  you  were  sentenced  to  a  total  of  4  years  imprisonment  for  handling  stolen 

goods.  When  you  breached  your  licence  following  release  from  that  sentence  you 

received  a  consecutive  sentence  of  2  years  for  a  dwelling  house  burglary.  In  2008 

you  received  a  total  sentence  of  15  months  imprisonment  for  harassment  of  your 

former partner, threatening via a third party to kill her. When she was due to give 

evidence you intimidated her to try to prevent her giving evidence. As a result there 

is an indefinite restraining order in force against you. These offences show a violent, 

aggressive and impulsive side to your character which you try to hide by portraying 

yourself as a harmless failed burglar who is always caught because of his enormous 

size.  

 

 Your  counsel  has  submitted  that  your  sentence  for  these  two  attempted  murders 

should be significantly shorter because you were only a secondary party and not a 

principal  offender.  It  is  well  established  on  the  authorities  that  for  murder  the 

starting  points  in  schedule  21  apply  equally  to  secondary  parties  as  to  principals, 

although  the  starting  point  may  well  have  to  be  adjusted  to  reflect  a  secondary 

party’s lesser culpability on the facts of the particular case: see Attorney General’s 

Reference (No.24 of 2008) [2009] 2 Cr App R (S) 41. The same reasoning applies to 

the situation here. I accept that your culpability was substantially less than that of 

Joanne Dennehy in these offences, but it was still very great. If the two attempted 

 

21
--------
murders  stood  alone  the  appropriate  total  sentence  for  you  for  those  offences 

would be 27 years.  

 

 The  offences  you  committed  in  Hereford  amounted  to  entirely  distinct  criminality 

from  the  offences  you  committed  in  Peterborough.  Consecutive  sentences  are 

therefore required as between the two sets of offences. On what I have indicated so 

far, that would make a total of 42 years. Because the offences are so distinct and so 

serious,  and  because  I  have  not  treated  either  set  of  offences  as  aggravating  the 

seriousness of the other, only a modest further reduction for totality is appropriate. I 

therefore  conclude  that  if  a  determinate  sentence were  the  appropriate  course  to 

follow  in  your  case,  these  offences  together  would  merit  a  total  determinate 

sentence of 38 years, made up of 13 years concurrent for each of the prevention of 

burial  offences  and  25  years  concurrent  for  each  of  the  attempted  murders.  If  38 

years were your sentence, you would serve 19 years before release on licence. 

 

 However, I have to consider whether a determinate sentence is appropriate at all or 

whether it is necessary to pass a sentence of life imprisonment or, alternatively, an 

extended sentence of imprisonment.     

 

 Because you have been convicted of offences of attempted murder I am required by 

law  to  consider  whether  you  are  a  “dangerous”  offender,  in  other  words  whether 

there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the 

commission by you of further specified offences, which for practical purposes means 

serious harm from any significant offence of violence. In making that assessment  I 

must  take  into  account  all  information  available  to  me  about  you  and  about  the 

nature  and  circumstances  of  these  offences  of  attempted  murder  and  the  other 

offences of which you have been convicted, including information about any pattern 

of behaviour of which any of those offences forms part. 

 

 I  bear  in  mind  that  these  attempted  murders  are  offences  at  the  very  top  of  the 

range  of  seriousness.  You  were  convicted  as  a  secondary  party,  not  as  a  principal, 

but  these  offences  demonstrate  your  willingness  to  involve  yourself  in  the  most 

 

22
--------
serious  violence.  Second,  I  bear  in  mind  that  likewise  the  offences  of  preventing 

burial were of the most serious kind, committed in order to interfere with the course 

of justice. They did not involve any violence but they demonstrate a willingness to 

assist a triple murderer to evade justice. Third, you have a previous conviction for a 

serious offence of robbery, albeit a very long time ago, and a more recent conviction 

for  harassing  your  ex‐partner  by  indirectly  threatening  to  kill  her,  compounded  by 

intimidating  her,  or  attempting  to  intimidate  her,  into  not  giving  evidence  against 

you. Fourth, you are an inveterate house burglar, where the risk of conflict with a 

householder  is  always  present.  Fifth  you  threatened  Georgina  Page  with  violence, 

albeit  indirectly,  if  she  went  to  the  police.  That  was  not  just  for  bravado  because 

Joanne  Dennehy  was  present.  Sixth  you  were  prepared  to  arm  yourself  with  a 

handgun whilst you were on the run from the police, although you disposed of the 

gun  without  using  it,  and  I  accept  there  is  no  other  evidence  you  have  ever 

possessed or used a firearm.  

 

Your counsel rightly urges upon me the most powerful point in mitigation against the 

imposition of a sentence based on dangerousness, namely the fact you committed 

these  offences  in  the  thrall  of  Joanne  Dennehy.  That  opportunity  will  never  arise 

again. I have considered carefully the guidance of the Court of Appeal in the recent 

decision in Saunders [2013] EWCA Crim 1027, and the circumstances in which a life 

sentence may be appropriate and necessary for its “denunciatory”  value reflecting 

public  abhorrence  of  the  offence,  and  where  the  notional  determinate  sentence 

would be very long indeed, as here, measured in very many years. However, I would 

first have to be satisfied that there is a significant risk that you would commit further 

offences of violence if at large and a significant risk of serious harm to members of 

the public as a result.  

 

 I have considered very carefully all the submissions, both written and oral, made so 

powerfully by  your counsel,  but  despite  those submissions,  I  have  no  hesitation  in 

reaching the conclusion that there is a significant risk of serious harm to members of 

the  public  from  the commission  by  you  of  further  specified  offences.  I  accept  that 

these offences of attempted murder in which you played a full part arose from the 

 

23
--------
special  circumstances  of  your  association  with  Joanne  Dennehy.  However,  having 

seen  the  way  she  attacked  the  first  victim,  you  encouraged  her  to  attack  again, 

knowing  that  she  was  likely  to  kill.  That  persistence  on  your  part,  as  well  as  hers, 

demonstrates all too clearly your potential for causing serious harm to the public in 

the  future,  particularly  in  the  light  of  the  other  factors  I  have  just  identified.  I 

therefore conclude that the threshold of dangerousness is clearly met. 

 

 That  being  so,  the  next  question,  under  s225(2)  of  the  2003  Act  is  whether  the 

offences are together so serious as to justify a sentence of life imprisonment. In my 

view  they  are.  A  very  long  determinate  sentence  would  not  in  my  judgment  be 

sufficient  to  protect  the  public.  Nor  would  an  extended  sentence  be  appropriate 

bearing in mind the very long custodial term which would dwarf even the maximum 

extension  period  of  5  years.  I  bear  firmly  in  mind  that  a  sentence  of  life 

imprisonment must always be a last resort. But in my judgment, this is a case where 

a life sentence is required in order to reflect public abhorrence of these offences of 

attempted  murder  committed  jointly  whilst  you  were  seeking  to  evade  arrest  for 

helping to dispose of the bodies of three men already murdered by Joanne Dennehy.  

 

 As the Court of Appeal made clear in Saunders, it remains open to the court to pass 

a  discretionary  life  sentence  even  where  the  pre‐conditions  for  a  sentence  under 

section 225 of the Act are not met. Had that been the position in your case (which I 

stress  it  is  not),  I  would  in  any  event  have  passed  a  discretionary  life  sentence  on 

that  alternative  basis,  having  regard  to  the  overriding  need  to  protect  the  public 

from you indefinitely.  

 

Gary  Stretch,  for  each  of  the  offences  of  attempted  murder  the  sentence  is  life 

imprisonment. You will serve a minimum term of 19 years, that being one half of the 

determinate sentence which would otherwise have been appropriate. That term of 

19  years  reflects  the  criminality  not  only  of  the  attempted  murders  but  also  the 

three  offences  of  preventing  burial.  For  those  offences  there  will  be  concurrent 

terms of 15 years imprisonment. You will receive credit against the term of 19 years 

for the time you have already spent on remand which, by my calculation, is 332 days. 

 

24
--------
The effect of this sentence is that you will serve 19 years in prison before you are 

even  eligible  to  be  considered  for  parole.  It  will  then  be  a  matter  for  the  parole 

board to decide if and when it is safe to release you, and  if you are released you will 

remain on licence for the rest of your life.  

 

 

Leslie Layton 

 I deal with you next Leslie Layton. I have to sentence you for preventing the lawful 

and decent burial of the bodies of two of the men Joanne Dennehy had murdered. I 

also have to sentence you for perverting the course of justice by lying to the police 

when they were trying to find what had become of John Chapman, one of the men 

who  was  murdered.   For   the  reasons  I  have  already  explained,  these  offences  of 

preventing  burial  are  at  the  very  top  of  the  range  of  seriousness.  Had  they  stood 

alone,  each  individually  would  have  merited  a  sentence  of  7½  years  or  more.  You 

were actively involved in dumping these two bodies, but your involvement spanned 
a single day, Friday 29th March. I am satisfied that you played a subordinate role to 

Gary Stretch and Joanne Dennehy, although you were a perfectly willing participant.  

 

It  is  an  aggravating  feature  of  the  offences  that  you  had  already  taken  that 

photograph of John Chapman’s dead body on your mobile phone. That casts a flood 

of  light  on  your  attitude  towards  the  fate  of  your  housemate  and  on  your  lack  of 

concern or respect for human life and for the  decency and dignity of a body after 

death.  You  had  every  opportunity  to  distance  yourself  from  what  you  were  being 

asked to do but chose to go along with it. You assisted physically with the removal of 

John Chapman’s body from the house. You travelled with each of the bodies to the 

separate sites where they were dumped. You were prominent in setting fire to and 

destroying Kevin Lee’s vehicle, as a further way of preventing the circumstances of 

his death being discovered and hence preventing his lawful and decent burial.  

 

Yours was also a serious offence of perverting the course of justice. You lied to the 

police repeatedly in what you knew to be a murder investigation. You did so to cover 

your  own  tracks  and  to  protect  Gary  Stretch  and  Joanne  Dennehy.  You  had  no 

 

25
--------
reason  to  be  in  fear  of  them  because  they  were  far  away  in  East  Anglia  when  the 

police  came  to  see  you,  as  you  well  knew.  Whether  they  would  have  been 

apprehended  sooner  had  you  told  the  police  the  truth,  we  shall  never  know.  It  is 

certainly possible they could have been arrested before committing the offences in 

Hereford. That is an illustration of the potential seriousness of your offence.  

 

 You are now 37 years of age. You have previous convictions for offences involving 

vehicles and for dishonesty but you had never been to prison before. These offences 

are wholly outside your normal league. You were caught up in the excitement and 

fascination of these appalling murders committed in one case quite literally on your 

doorstep by a woman who undoubtedly exercised some psychological influence over 

you and other men with whom she came into contact, including her victims. But that 

does not excuse what you did. Nor do you have the mitigation of guilty pleas. 

 

 I have had regard to the guidance in the authorities to which I have been referred 

and in particular Tunney [2007] 1 Cr App (S) 91 and Gonsalves [2008] 1 Cr App (S) 40, 

both  of  which  involved  perverting  the  course  of  justice  in  homicide  cases.  They 

emphasise the need to consider three factors in particular. First, the seriousness of 

the substantive offence. Here it was murder. It could not be more serious. Second, 

the  persistence  of  the  offender’s  conduct.  Here  you  persisted  in  these  false 

statements over a period of two days, although the most extensive lies were told on 
the afternoon of Monday 1st April. Third, the effect of what you did on the course of 

justice itself. Here your attempt was unsuccessful in the sense that the police soon 

discovered the truth of what had happened, and John Chapman’s body was in any 

event discovered, fortuitously, two days later.  There must plainly be a consecutive 

sentence for the offence of perverting the course of justice because it involved quite 

separate and distinct criminality from the two offences of preventing burial.      

 

Leslie  Layton.  Were it not  for  the fact  that  I must  bear  in  mind  the totality  of  the 

sentence I am passing upon you, the individual sentences would have been longer. 

For the two offences of preventing the lawful and decent burial of bodies you will 

serve concurrent sentences of 10 years imprisonment. For the offence of perverting 

 

26
--------
the course of justice you will serve a consecutive sentence of 4 years imprisonment. 

So  your  total  sentence  is  14  years  imprisonment.  You  will  serve  one  half  of  that 

sentence in prison and upon release you will be on licence for the remainder of the 

sentence  and  liable  to  recall  if  you  commit  any  further  offence  or  breach  your 

licence.   

 

Robert Moore   

 I deal finally with you, Robert Moore.  You had the good sense to plead guilty to the 

two counts you faced, although your guilty pleas did not come at the first reasonable 

opportunity so you cannot expect full credit. It is clear to me from the pre‐sentence 

report that you do not fully understand even now just how serious your conduct was 

in giving shelter to Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch for two nights when you knew 

they were wanted by the police for the most serious of offences.  

 

You are 56 years of age and a man with no previous convictions whatsoever. I am 

prepared  to  accept  that  you  came  under  the  spell  of  Joanne  Dennehy  and  were 

flattered  by  her  attention.  You  must  have  known  the  sort  of  woman  you  were 

getting involved with when you were made aware that the body of one her victims 

was  in  a  wheelie  bin  at  her  address  close  to  your  home.  You  admitted  to  the 

probation officer that you knew that. You kept in close touch with Joanne Dennehy 

and Gary Stretch by phone in what might be described as a fawning manner, texting 

that you had food waiting for them. When Joanne Dennehy and Gary Stretch went 

on the run in East Anglia you texted them that the police were after them and you 

wished them luck. They returned to your home again that night.  

 

When  you  were  interviewed  by  the  police  you  repeatedly  lied  about  your 

involvement  in  helping  Joanne  Dennehy  and  Gary  Stretch.  Had  you  not  provided 

them  with  shelter  for  those  two  nights  and  had  you  instead  done  your  duty  as  a 

citizen  by  telling  the  police  straightaway  what  you  knew,  it  is  possible  that  they 

would  have  been  arrested  earlier,  and  before  the  offences  In  Hereford  were 

committed.  Again,  we  shall  never  know  but  it  illustrates  the  seriousness  and  the 

potential consequences of what you did.  

 

27
--------
The  maximum  sentence  for  the  offences  to  which  you  have  pleaded  guilty  is  10 

years imprisonment. I have had regard to the guidance in the authorities in this area, 

notably R v Elfes [2006] EWCA Crim 2799 and Attorney General’s Ref (No:16 of 2009) 

[2009] EWCA Crim 2439. In both those cases, however, the duration and value of the 

assistance  was  greater  than  in  your  case.  I  also  take  into  account  your  good 

character and the health issues which are revealed in the pre‐sentence report. I have 

had  the  opportunity  to  observe  you  in  the  dock  during  the  sentencing  hearing  at 

Cambridge two weeks ago as well as in the dock here today. I accept that you are 

genuinely remorseful. 

 

Had you been convicted of these two offences after a trial, the sentence would have 

been  four  years  imprisonment.  As  it  is  you  pleaded  guilty  at  a  late  stage,  but  that 

took courage. You will receive credit of one‐quarter for those pleas.  

 

Robert  Moore.  For  each  of  these  offences  you  will  serve  a  sentence  of  3  years 

imprisonment concurrent. That means you will released when you have served one 

half of the sentence and you will remain on licence for the rest of the sentence.

2225364,R v Keith Wallis,"am
JUDICIARY OF
ENGLAND AND WALES
THE QUEEN
-V-
KEITH WALLIS
IN THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
6 FEBRUARY 2014
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE SWEENEY

Keith Wallis you have pleaded guilty to an offence of misconduct in public office. At the
material time you were a Constable in the Metropolitan Police and had been so for some 29
years. For the great majority of your service you were in the Diplomatic Protection Group—
latterly as part of the North Sector team based at Apex House and on permanent restricted
duties because of a degenerative physical condition affecting your lower back and knees.
That base was shared with the Downing Street team of the Diplomatic Protection Group.
You admit that following an incident in Downing Street on the evening of Wednesday 19
September 2012 which involved Diplomatic Protection Group Officers (in particular PC
Rowland) and the then Chief Whip Mr Andrew Mitchell MP, and after you had become
aware of PC Rowland's account of what had happened, you misconducted yourself by:
1. On 20 September 2012, before the story broke in the media, sending an email to
your Member of Parliament MrJohn Randall (who, as it happened, was at the time the
Deputy Chief Whip) in which you falsely portrayed yourself as being an independent
member of the public who, in the company of your nephew, had happened to be in the
vicinity of and witnessed the incident - giving a version of it which was broadly consistent
with PC Rowland’s account (in particular asserting that Mr Mitchell had sworn at the officers
and called them plebs), praising the conduct ofthe officers and complaining about the
conduct of Mr Mitchell - although saying that you did not expect anything to come of it.
2. On 24 September 2012, in a telephone conversation with Mr Randall (following
earlier attempts by him to contact you) purporting to confirm that you had heard Mr
Mitchell use the word 'pleb', and falsely asserting that you did not know anyone who
worked in the police - albeit re-iterating that you did not want to take the matter any
further.
3. Later on 24 September 2012 sending Mr Randall a second email keeping up the
pretence of being an independent member ofthe public, and again purporting to confirm
that you had heard Mr Mitchell use the word pleb, and that he had used foul language which
was totally unacceptable - albeit stating that you did not think that Mr Mitchell should lose
his job.
--------
4. In the run up to a meeting with Mr Randall on 14 December 2012 (which was nearly
two months after Mr Mitchell had resigned, and which followed earlier contact with Mr
Randall during which you had maintained your pretence, and attempts by the press to
interview you) persuading your nephew (who was in his early 20's ) to attend and give a
supporting account, which he did, with you repeating with emphasis at the meeting that
both you and your nephew had been present, indeed that you must have been on CCTV, and
that you had heard Mr Mitchell use the word pleb — such that Mr Randall believed that there
was an ”air of truth” in what you were saying.
5. After your meeting with Mr Randall, speaking that same day with colleagues in a way
that caused them concern, but during which you told them the same false story of having
been present and having witnessed the incident.
6. On 15 December 2012 following your arrest (after your emails and the relevant CCTV
footage had been provided to the police and it had been discovered that you were a police
officer) lying for almost one and a half hours in interview under caution by maintaining your
account of having been present and having witnessed the incident.
It was only after it had been pointed out to you that the CCTV footage did not support your
account that, in a further interview, you finally admitted the truth that neither you nor your
nephew had been there, and that you had not witnessed the incident at all. You said that
you had been under stress and drinking a lot; that (having heard colleagues talking about the
incident) you were incensed about what had happened and the fact that Mr Mitchell had not
been arrested because of who he was; that you had convinced yourself that you were there;
that in a stupid naive pathetic way you were backing up your colleagues; and that you now
accepted that you had done the wrong thing and let everyone down — lying not only to Mr
Randall but to your wife, your nephew, the Police Federation and the interviewing officers.
You apologised to the Metropolitan Police and to your family for your misconduct.
You have entered a basis of plea the details of which the Prosecution either accept or do not
dispute. I will sentence you in accordance with it. You do not dispute the essential facts that
I have outlined. The basis underlines that, by the time of your guilty plea you had been a
police officer for 30 years; that your father was a police officer before you; that you were not
well at the time of the offence and had long concealed that fact; that your shift on 20
September 2012 ended at 2pm after which you drank a significant amount of alcohol before
going home; that you had heard and overheard gossip and rumour about the incident during
the course of your work that day; that you believed that Mr Mitchell had behaved
outrageously towards the police; and that you were intoxicated when you wrote and sent
the untruthful email that night- after which matters had begun to escalate and run out of
your control, with you eventually becoming convinced that you had indeed been present.
In passing sentence upon you I am in no position to decide precisely what happened
between the officers and Mr Mitchell in Downing Street (nor do I need to do so), but it is
absolutely clear what did not happen - you were not an independent member of the public,
you were not present, neither was your nephew, and neither of you witnessed the incident.
Yet, over a total period of nearly three months you pretended to your Member of
Parliament, and initially to the interviewing officers, that all of those things were true
(including involving your nephew in the process). You gave an account which you knew

knowledge whether that account was true or not - and albeit that there eventually came a
time (in my view towards the end of the events that I have described) when you were
convinced that you had been present.
This was thus sustained, and in significant measure, devious misconduct which fell far below
the standards expected of a police officer. Indeed it was a betrayal of those standards, and
was misconduct which as well as having had an impact on Mr Mitchell himself, has had a
significant negative impact on public trust and confidence in the integrity of police officers.
Whilst the gravity of this type of offence can vary greatly, the correct broad approach to
sentence is clear- police officers must be deterred from misconduct, and the public must be
able to see that condign punishment will be visited upon police officers who betray the trust
reposed in them.
Whilst accepting that broad approach, Mr Gibbs QC on your behalf invites me to take the
following factors into account in mitigation - that you did not know any of the officers
concerned in the incident; that you had pre-existing mental health issues and your life was
unravelling; that you were angry and intoxicated when you wrote the first email; that
(however unrealistically) you did not expect anything to come of it, or for anyone to contact
you; that thereafter things got out of hand with the initiative being taken by others and
thingsjust getting worse and worse (albeit that you could have brought things to an end by
telling the truth); that your lies were limited to your role as a witness; that you did not
conspire with anyone to do anything and that no criminal charges have been brought against
anyone else; that you did not intend to pervert the course ofjustice; that at the age of 53
(and approaching retirement) you have lost your good character and are bound to be
dismissed from the Metropolitan Police in whose service you have hitherto found meaning
in life; that your actions have also had an adverse effect on your family; and that (as the
expert evidence shows) your mental health has deteriorated further such that there are
serious concerns about the risk that you pose to yourself which may escalate in a custodial
setting.
Mr Gibbs accepts that your offence crosses the custodial threshold, and that you yourself
consider that you deserve an immediate custodial sentence, but submits that I should
suspend the sentence with mental health and supervision requirements.
Whilst I have taken account of all the points that Mr Gibbs has advanced, I cannot agree with
his final submission. In my view an immediate custodial sentence is required.
Applying the broad approach that I have indicated, and balancing the factors on either side,
it seems to me that the appropriate sentence after a trial would have been one of 18
months’ imprisonment from which I deduct one third to reflect your early guilty plea.
Keith Wallis the sentence that I impose upon you is one of 12 months' imprisonment. If not
released earlier, you will serve half that sentence - after which you will be released on
licence.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HER HONOUR JUDGE CUTTS QC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
   

 
During the years 1959-1970, the time period of your offending, you were employed 

 

 
The boys at this school were aged from as young as 6 to 13 years. Many of them 
 

 
 

 
 
 
1. 
 
 
as a school master and then headmaster of Caldicott preparatory school. You began 
 
 
employment in 1952 and from 1968 remained headmaster until your retirement in 1993. 
 
 
You were described in one of the character references I heard in the course of the trial as an 
 
outstanding headmaster. I readily accept that you dedicated your life to this school. 
 
 
2. 
 
were boarders throughout. By the time they were in their final year all were boarding. It is 
 
manifestly obvious that these boys were vulnerable. During term time they were cared for 
 
 
exclusively at the school. Their parents entrusted their welfare to the school at this time. It 
 
was your responsibility, together with the rest of the staff, to ensure they were living in a 
 
 
safe and secure environment. Great trust was placed in you. Yet you abused that trust. Far 
 
from protecting and nurturing the boys you used them at a whim – to satisfy what you 
 
wanted from them regardless of the impact on them. 
 
 
 
3. 
You were a comparatively young man in your 30s when these offences took place. 
 
You taught French and also coached sport, predominantly rugby. It is clear that you were 
 
looked up to and admired by the boys. 
 
 
4. 
 
You were clearly charismatic and charming to boys and parents alike. You possessed the 
 
 
talent to interest the boys and could have been a force only to the good in their lives. In the 
 
course of the trial I heard witness after witness, complainant after complainant, speak of 
 
their gratitude for the way that you taught them and the positive way in which your teaching 
 
has influenced their lives. There can be no dispute that many boys who went to Caldicott 
 
have gone on to achieve great things. 
 
 
5. 
 
 
of these boys. You fostered an environment whereby those good at sport were the elite in 
 
 
the school. Boys craved your attention and strove for your praise. From those you picked out 
 
boys for your individual sexual attentions. They were invited to your room, often with 
 
others, to watch TV (one of only 2 in the school at that time). They described this as almost a 
 
touch of home in an otherwise austere environment; some were invited to go on holiday 

 
But regrettably that was not the whole story. There was a darker side to your tuition 
 

 
 
I heard evidence that you were an inspirational teacher, both of French and of rugby.
--------
For many years those you abused kept their silence. No doubt you believed and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

   
 

 
   

I heard evidence in the course of the trial that on more than one occasion you went 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

At the material time you were accommodated within the school. Within a short time 
 
 

with you to watch the rugby 7s tournament in the Scottish borders or to fish, these holidays 
 
at your own expense; on occasion you gave them alcohol. For such attention there was a 
 
price. When you exacted that sexual price boys did as they were told. Some felt confused, 
 
some felt flattered by the attention, many felt it was just what happened to get Mr Wright’s 
 
 
attention. The boys you chose were all aged primarily 11, 12 or 13 years. 
 
 
6. 
 
of your employment at Caldicott you were living in a bedsit room next to the senior boys’ 
 
 
dormitory. Reference was repeatedly made during the course of the trial to a plan showing 
 
the geography of the school and the location of that room. It is plain that a master was 
 
placed in amongst these dormitories in order to supervise the boys and ensure that all was 
 
 
 
well. That was your responsibility. In fact you used the proximity of the room to the 
 
dormitories and the distance of that area from the rest of the school to set up your own little 
 
 
fiefdom and used it to abuse boys. 
 
 
7. 
 
with Mr Henry into the senior boy’s dormitory after lights out and when you had clearly both 
 
been drinking alcohol. There is no evidence that you yourself abused a boy when there with 
 
Henry but I am satisfied on the evidence that you were there on one occasion when Henry 
 
did so. I am also satisfied that you went to the dormitory with Henry on occasion with at 
 
 
least the intention of so doing. 
 
 
8. 
 
hoped that they always would. During your trial I heard the reasons for that: 
 
 
a. 
 
their sons in sending them to the school, many of such parents admired you; 
 
 
b. 
 
felt complicit in what had happened; 
 
 
c. 
 
 
It is sadly all too frequent that those who are abused in childhood consider in adulthood that 
 
because they failed to say something and did as they were told they are in some way 
 
responsible for what happened. I wish to make it absolutely clear that no man should feel 
 
 
 
guilt or consider he was complicit in any way. All were children in the care of an adult who 
 
 
 
had little but his own sexual gratification in mind. 
 
 
9. 
The offences began to come to light in 2001. A 2 year police investigation followed. I 
 
   
heard about that investigation during the course of your trial. It is clear to me that the police 
 
fear of being accused of trawling for evidence prevented the proper investigation of this 
 
case at that time. 
 
 
a. 
 
as a judge stayed the indictment for abuse of process. Following that stay a further 5 men 
 
 
made allegations against you. I am to sentence you today for the offences against those 5 
 

You were then charged with offences against 5 boys. No trial took place at that time 
 

Some felt a sense of guilt as they looked back at their young selves and in some way 
 

Boys felt they could never tell parents who had thought they were doing right by 
 

Some felt fear and embarrassment of what would happen if they spoke about it.

--------
I also take into account that you no longer pose a risk to children. I take into account 
 
 

later complainants. The stay meant that the jury were not called upon to return a verdict in 
 
the case of the 1st 5 complainants. Notwithstanding that fact and knowing of it each of them 
 
came to give evidence in the course of the trial. I commend their selflessness and their 
 
courage in so doing. 
 
 
b. 
Their evidence clearly showed the jury how you operated at the school in grooming 
 
 
and sexually assaulting children. Their evidence was an important part of the trial. I make it 
 
clear that I sentence you today only for the offences of which you have been convicted but I 
   
wish to make it equally clear to them that I believed every word of their evidence. 
 
 
10. 
The result of the delay is that you are now a man aged 83. You are not in the best of 
 
 
health. You suffer from a number of conditions which cause you pain. I witnessed that in the 
 
 
course of the trial. I recognise that you need assistance with day to day care. I must take that 
 
 
into account and I do. 
  
 
11. 
 
 
the positive aspects of your life and of you as a teacher following this offending. 
 
 
 
However these factors can provide only limited mitigation. I cannot ignore the impact of 
 
your behaviour on so many boys. It is clear from the impact statements that I have read that 
 
 
your conduct has had a lasting effect upon them. I do not propose to read aloud any of those 
 
 
statements now. The victims of your offending can be sure I have read them all. Your 
 
offending, albeit so many years ago, has affected them throughout those years. It has 
 
affected the confidence of some and the ability of others to form lasting and intimate 
 
relationships. I witnessed a successful man now in his 60s in tears when giving evidence of 
 
what you did to him. 
 
 
12. 
 
against 5 complainants. As the first jury could not reach verdicts on the majority of the 
 
charges you faced the witnesses had to give evidence twice. 
  
 
13. 
 
heard that it came to an end shortly after and as a result of you becoming headmaster at the 
 
school. You moved out of the room by the dormitories into a cottage and got married. It 
 
seems your new role, marital status and residence brought these offences to an end. 
 
 
14. 
 
 
a. 
 
 
Between 1959 and 1960 you went into the senior boys dorm as they were getting 
i. 
 
 
ready for bed. On several occasions you asked the boy named in those counts, then in his 
 
last year at school so aged 12-13, to join you in his room. He did so some 5 or 10 minutes 
 
 
later. He was able to watch TV there, something he considered a great privilege. 
 
 
ii. 
 
masturbate you to ejaculation. Once that happened you sent him back to the dormitory. 
 

You have never admitted your guilt. You were convicted after a trial of 12 offences 
 
 
 

Between 3-6 times you put his hand on your erect penis and caused him to

Count 12 
 

These offences are so serious that notwithstanding your age and all I have heard 
 

   

This boy, in the sporting elite, was invited many times to your cottage. There you 
 

I bear in mind that the maximum sentence for counts 4 and 7 is 2 years 
 
 
 

e. 
 
 
i. 
 
masturbated him to ejaculation. This boy did not always leave the school on exeat 
 
weekends. At times he would stay with you in the cottage. He was aged 12-13 at the time. 
 
 
15. 
 
about you it is beyond question that only a custodial sentence can be justified. 
 
 
16. 
I have regard to the sentencing guidelines for offending of this nature. These 
 
 
 
offences have been charged under the Sexual Offences Act 1956. I have applied the 
 
 
guideline by reference to the nature of the activity involved as it would be charged under the 
 
 
Sexual Offences Act 2003. In my view for counts 3-7 (where the boy was under the age of 13 
 
 
 
at the time) the applicable guideline is that relating to an offence under Section 7 of the 
 
Sexual Offences Act 2003. For all other counts it is that relating to an offence under Section 9 
 
 
of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as the boy concerned may have been over the age of 13 at 
 
 
the material time. Given your prolonged behaviour and the context of it there is little 
 
 
difference in my view in whether the boy concerned was 12 or 13 years. 
 
 
17. 
 
imprisonment and for all other counts 10 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for 
 
offences under S7 and S9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is 14 years imprisonment. I have 
 
   
adjusted the sentences accordingly. However it must be remembered that the starting 
 
points and range of sentences are designed for a single offence involving the activity in 
 
question. I am to sentence you for multiple offending against each of these victims. 
 
 
18. 
 
prolonged activity, the boys were groomed by a master at a school responsible for their care. 
 
Some boys were awoken at night and told to come from their beds to your room. You 
 
caused many of them to ejaculate and to masturbate you to ejaculation. You were offending 
 
between 1959 and 1970. It is difficult to think of a more serious breach of trust. 
  
 
19. 
 
 
offending against these boys. I keep in mind the totality of your sentence. 
 
 
20. 
 
years imprisonment. The sentences are made up in the following way: 
 
 
a. 
 
 
b.

d. 
 
 
e. 
 

The aggravating features of these offences are significant. With all boys this was 
 
 

In reaching the appropriate sentence in this case I have looked at the entirety of your 
 

Looking at the entirety of your offending the least sentence I can impose is one of 8

On counts 4 and 7 – 2 years imprisonment.

Errol Clive Heibner now 68 on 18 Nove mber 1976 in the Central Criminal Court was 
 
convicted by a majority of 10 to 2 of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On 1 
December 1978 the Full Court refused his app
lication for leave to app eal against 
 
conviction. His co-accused Robert Rossi was acquitted of murder.

On the day  of  the m urder the Ap pellant  Heibner was on bail awaiting trial for 
robberies. He was later sentenced to 15 y ears imprisonment, which he was serving 
when tried for the murder of Mrs Gold. Before and after the murder he was, in respect 
of the robberies, under surveillance headed by DCI Adams.  

 

The Crown’s case was a contract killing by  Heibner acting alone as g unman at th e 
request of persons it could not name. Rossi it suggested was the middle-man.  

It led evidence that Charles Fagan said Heibner tried to recruit him to injure someone. 
At the m urder Fagan was in custody awa iting trial for arm ed robbery. He blamed 
Heibner for his a rrest and candidly admitted that his evidence against the Appellant 
was driven by malice but claimed it was true evidence. Heibner confessed in a written 
statement of 22 nd October 1975 (exhibit 32, the conf
ession statem ent) albeit the 
Crown suggested he had labelled him self as the look-out 
so as  to trivialise h is 
involvement. DC Tyers shortly before th e shooting saw him near Angel underground. 
He lied in his interviews. He changed his alibi notice. He was s hort of money before 
the killing and in f unds afterward s. He agreed  he  had burned som e of his clothes 
 
shortly after the murder. 

 

 

His case was that he had not been involved in  any way. He told the jury his tr eatment 
over two days in custody coerced his confes
sion that he had been look-out for the 
 
gunman. Al though he had signed the confession statem ent he had not said all it 
recorded.

Fagan said that at the beginning of Sept ember Heibner suggested Fagan for £1,000 
should hurt som eone but gave no nam e. At  a public house in Hari ngey Heibner said 
 
he was going to m eet someone to fi nd out who was the victim  and if not back in 15 
minutes Fagan should go to the T rafalgar in Southgate. Fagan saw Heibner outside 
 
talking for a couple of minutes to a man before the pair walked towards Manor House 
underground. Fagan went to the Trafalgar but did not see Heibner. 

Fagan said on Saturday 6th September Hei bner rang saying everything was all right. 
At 8.30pm the two went to a pub where Heibner explained that he had seen the victim 
who was to be m urdered on Monday 8 th September at a C lerkenwell clothing firm. 
Fagan told the jury that once he realised this was to be a murder he told H he did not 
want to get involved.

Parker told Fagan on the day after the m urder that he had helped Heibner burn some

notes. Joy Heibner Heibner’s step-mother sa id he arranged that 
if asked where he

told her, “I’ve done som ething nice, and you need not know anything more about it”.

On 20th October Heibner was arrested agai n. DS Stimpson interrupted a conversation 
between Heibner and D CI Adam s to say he  w as inv estigating som ething f ar m ore 
serious than robbery. Heibner said, “Oh my God”, shook and trembled violently.  

On 22nd October he was interviewed four
 tim es. From  10.40 to 11.59 and 3.05 to 
4pm by Det Supt O’Brien, between 4.15  to 6.15 by DCI Dixon and between 7.30 and 
10.35 by Det Supt O’Brien. At the final interview he signed his witness statement, the 
confession, exhibit 32. 

Interview 1 – O’Brien said he was with Stimpson who took down a contemporaneous 
note. He told a shaking Heibner that  police thought him  the gunm an who had been 
seen in Goswell Road at Angel at 5pm . Heibner said he had not been there. Asked 
whom he had m et outside Haringey dog 
track on 4th Septem ber Heibner said, 
“Fucking bastard” and added, “I can see it  all now. That fuc king Fagan has done this 
 
because I s et him  up. That’s  it isn’t 
it”.  He adm itted m eeting Fagan on 5 th 
 
September. Asked whether he had told  Fagan the job involved hurting som eone he 
said “I’ll kill that fucking Fagan. He’s doi ng this out of spite” and “It’s not a wise 
thing Fagan’s done to grass m e. These people will have him ”. Asked whom  he sa id 
“You’ll see”. He claim ed he did not rem ember giving clothes to Parker to burn. H e 
 
did not tell Parker to burn his shoes, he gave them to Parker who needed a pair.

Interview  2  O’Brien said Heibner denied m eeting Rossi in the Strand on 8th 
September and said “ I know I am  in the shit b ut I can ’t put other people in it…I ’ll 
never shop that man. If I do I’m dead. If I tell you everything I am dead. What do you 
think my chances are on this? ”. He asked  to speak to DCI Dixon as he did not trust

Interview 3 as recorded shows DCI Dixon told Heibner just to tell the truth. Heibner 
said “It’s a big step. Do you realise what I face?
Statements by Fagan and Parker were read to  him and he  said they had “done him in 
good”, but he would deny it. He said, “I’ll 
tell you the truth but  I can’t m ention any 
names. I trust you because you were fair to m e before….I want to tell yo u all about it 
but life’s a long time and then there’s the other people. If I go on remand I’ll never go 
for trial. I’ll be dead”. His wife wa s brought in and Dixon recorded her saying “Just 
tell the truth. That’s all I want you to do”.  

” and  asked to see his wife. 

Interview 4 as recorded shows that  when his wife had left Heibner said, “How ca n I 
admit it? I  think I  m ight tak e m y chan ce. Lo ok I can ’t put  my hands up to the 
shooting. I’ll never come out”. “Did  anyone see me go inside the p lace, or was I just 
seen outside?” He was asking becau se he  could say he was m inding a bloke’s back. 
He said he would make a written statement. 

 

 

Exhibit 32  was his statem ent under caution. In it Heibner  said he had been given a 
 
photo of a m an, “the fa ce”, by the m an who set up the m urder and wh o told him  to 
meet the face outside A ngel underground at  5pm on Monday. H did, and kept watch 
while the face, whom  he had not seen before, d id the shooting, gave h im the gun at 
 
the bus stop as earlier arranged and walked off. Heibner got just under £4,000. 

 

 
22.	 

Rossi’s interview was on 27 October . O’Brien said Rossi ad mitted he gave a gun to 
 
Heibner. 

 

The defence case 

Heibner told the jury he met Fagan and with another discussed a wages snatch of 17th 
September in Catford. He had not invite
d Fagan to hurt som eone, rather he had 
explained that som eone might get hurt. If  he rang Fagan on Saturday 6th Septem ber 
 
and said everything was all  right it referred to the Catford job. Their only discussions 
 
were about robberies, not a murder. 

He asked Rossi to drive him  to Fagan’s fl at as Fagan knew a fence for the jewellery. 
Rossi played no part in the 
jewellery deal. He took from  Rossi in the car a box of 
jewellery, not a gun. He and Rossi separated at about 2pm . Heibner reached his home 
 
in the East End at 6pm.  

 

On the afternoon of the murder he was at  Angel underground at about 4.35pm  having 
used nearby public conveniences. Then from  a stop in U pper Street he caught a bus 
home. He was on it a t the time Tyers said he was outside Angel. The £600 he had on 
arrest on 12th September was the proceeds 
Suspecting he was und er surveillance he bu rned his clothes to destroy incrim inating

He was in custody for 42 hours before intervie w. He was left in a lighted cell, one 
 
officer in it, another outside. Dixon said he had an obligation to keep his family (some 
of whom Heibner knew had been interviewed) out of it. Jewellery had been found and 
he was the only one who could get them  out of trouble. Once they had his statem ent 
he would get whatever he wanted, as opposed to only cups of tea. When he started the 
statement he was knackered and just wanted to get out of the room. Sti
mpson 
frightened him by saying “ Whatever happens, we’ll get it out of  you, if we have to 
kick you from one end of the room  to the other”. When he saw the statement in court 
he couldn’t even remember it. 

Rossi told the jury he collected a parcel  of, he understood, jewell ery and went to the 
Strand Palace where he m et Heibner who as ked for a lift hom e and got into Rossi’s 
car. He denied saying in interview that

Submissions on this appeal

For Heibner Mr Blaxland QC put nine 
grounds within thre e categories: the 
confession, evidence of which the Crown knew  but H did not, and evidence post-trial 
of the bad character of three police officers. 

Ground 1: the confession and preceding interviews should have been excluded. 

 
i)	 

Length of custody 

Heibner was held for 42 hours before inte rviews began. Although the Judges’ Rules, 
which then governed the topic, did not pr ohibit detention for such a period, under the 
subsequently enacted Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”) the approval 
of a Superintendent would be require

R v Heibner 
 

In our view it is important to see this submission in context. That Heibner had been at 
the police station for a consid erable period by th e time of his statem ent was explored 
both on the  voir dire and in front of  the Jury. Hei bner had previous convictions for 
serious offences, including armed robbery. He was no stranger to police stations or to 
the routine of arrest and in terview. Custody for him  was unlikely to have been as 
 
challenging as for a detainee unfamiliar with the system or familiar only with criminal 
allegations lower on the ladder of seriousne ss. We do not attach im portance to this 
complaint. 

ii) 

     

Access to a solicitor 

No solicitor was present. DCI Dixon said that he at one  stage said: “What you need is 
a brief” and Heibner replied,  “I don’t want a brief”. Hei bner denied the exchange. In 
evidence-in-chief, asked, “Did you a sk for Reg Dixon to com e?” Heibner said “No I 
 
didn’t. I asked for a solicitor.” H
throughout. Rossi m ade a like claim . H told th e jury “My wife got in touch with m y 
 
solicitor and they phoned up Bow Road police station, where I was…” at which point 
the Judge prevented any m ore being said si nce it was hearsay. Nothing indicates that 
O’Brien was cross-examined about it. Nothing suggests it was raised on the voir dire. 

e clai med he wanted but was not allowed one 

Although the law in relation to the significan ce of refusal of acce ss to a solicito r has 
developed, the right privatel y to  co nsult a so licitor pr e-dated PACE where it was 
restated in S.58. That said, even a breach of the principle was not determinative of the 
admissibility of a conf ession At the  time of this trial th e focus of challenges to th e 
admissibility of confessions was, necessarily, on voluntariness: Prager (1972) 1 WLR 
260 where the court rejected a sub mission that a breach of  Rule II sho uld itself have 
 
led to the exclusion of the confession and stated: 

“Its acceptance would exalt th e Judges' Rules into rules of law. 
That they do not purport to be,  and there is abu ndant authority

hing of the kind. Their non-

A judge’s discretion is not now so c onfined: Peart 14/02/2006 (2006) UKPC 5. The 
 
Board said the criterion  for adm ission of a  statement is fai rness. If a statem ent is 
voluntary, that is s trongly in favour of  admitting it, notwith standing a b reach of the 
Judges’ Rules, but the court m ay rule that it would be unfair to adm it it even were it 
voluntary. 

Peart aligns  the app roach to adm issibility u nder the  Judg es’s Rule s to that und er 
 
PACE, in which the court has to consider the question of voluntariness under S.76 and 
fairness under S.78. Applying current standards the denial of access to a solicitor, one 
of the most important and fundamental rights of a citizen, Mr Bl axland argues should

He relied on the prevailing winds at the tim e of the trial. It was, he thought, probably 
conventional wisdom that were a challenged  police officer to explain his fear that a 
solicitor would alert others the co
urt w ould accept his  anxiety  as justification. 
Additionally, for a suspect, saying one want ed a solicitor was a sign of weakness or 
seen as such.  

 
 

He invited us to reach a firm conclusion that Heibner was denied access to a solicitor 
 
for whom he had asked. He suggested it would be fanciful to think H
eibner would 
have decided he did not need one. His 
breaches of standards then in place, apply m odern approaches, and be le d inexorably

Invited to relate that p hilosophy to these facts he subm itted that we should not ask 
ourselves w hat Heibner would be likely to
address the reality: had proper  procedures been followed it  is very lik ely a solic itor

 have done or said, rather we should 

As to what account we should take of the li kely mindset of this particular suspect, a 
man experienced in the ways of arrest, dete ntion, serious crim e, trial, and long-term 
imprisonment, he argued that we cannot know what Heibner would have said had that 
 
cast of mind and experience been put to him . His evidence to the jury (that he wanted 
but was refused access to a solicitor) is on record but beyond that lies speculation.  

 

For the Crown the submission is that it is asserted, as if fact , that Heibner was denied 
access to a solicitor. The Crown does not accept that he was. It argues th at this is one 
of several exam ples within the subm issions of the dangers of speculating, after 38 
years, about what happened during the investigation. 

 

It is not possible for us, now, to be confid ent whether the ab sence of a solicitor were 
or were not raised on the  voir dire or explored before the jury. There is no eviden ce 
that it was. True, Heibn er told the jury he  had asked for a solicitor. However, it was 
 
common ground that, for exam ple in eviden ce Heibner challenged more of DCI 
Dixon’s evidence than was put. His evidence on  at least that topi c, a matter to which 
we shall return, may have been inconsistent with his instructions. It is impossible now 
 
to test the plausible contention that the fi
rst his counsel knew of his claim  to have 
asked for a solicitor was when Heibner gave  evidence. It would be an unwary court 
which assumed that all he claimed in his evidence was true. On the other hand we can 
be confident that at trial parties put their m inds to this issue. The submission is at this 
distance so clouded by conjecture that we are not persuaded that it achieves the power 
 
for which Mr Blaxland argued.  If we sought fortification fo r our rejection of it we 
 
should find it in the equally plausible possi
bility that Heibner had indeed given 
instructions on the topic, but they were that th e Crown’s evidence was correct and he 
had not sought a solicitor. To  that extent too, his couns el m ight, for all this court

iii)	 

Failure to caution durin g the Dixon interv iew, a breach of Rule II Judges’ 
Rules. 

 
42.	 

The Judges’ Rules in a preamble read where relevant: 

“These Rules do not affect the principles 

(a)… 

(b)… 

(c) That every person at any stage  of an investigation should be 
able to communicate an d to consu lt privately with a solicitor. 
This is so even if he is in cu stody provided that in such a case 
no unreasonable delay or hindranc e is c aused to the processes 
of investigation or the administration of justice by his doing so; 

(d)… 

(e) That it is a funda mental cond ition of the a dmissibility in 
evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given 
by that person to a question put  by a police officer and of any 
statement m ade by that person,

by fear of prejudice or hope of  advantage, exercised or held out 
 
by a person in authority, or by oppression.” 

 that it sh

The principle set out in paragraph (e) is ove rriding and applicable in all cases. W ithin 
that prin ciple the follo wing Rules  are put  forward as a guide to police officers 
 
conducting investigations. Non-conformity with these Rules m ay render answers and 
statements liable to be excluded from evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings. 

 
43.	 

Rule II where relevant read: 

“As soon as a police officer has evidence which would afford 
reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has comm itted 
 
an offence, he sh all caution  th at person or cause him  to be 
cautioned bef ore puttin g to him any questio
ns, or f urther 
 
questions, relating to that offence.”

Rule IV (e), all written statements made after caution, read: 

“When the writing of a statement by a police officer is finished

e end of t

“I have read the above statement and I have been told that I can 
correct, alter or add anything I wish. This statem ent is true. I 
have made it of my own free will.”” 
 

 

45.	  Mr Blaxland placed great emphasis – “it leaps from the page” - on the ab sence of the 
Dixon caution, a point not taken at trial a nd a Ground not advanced by the CCRC. It 
 
was he argues a significant and substantia l breach of the Judges’ Rules and should 
have led to the exclusion of the Dixon interview and of the statement under caution. 

 
46.	 

 
47.	 

 
48.	 

 
49.	 

Since the requirem ent to adm inister a cau tion under Rule II applied to all questions 
 
and further questions Mr Blaxland submitted that a caution was require d at the outset 
of the Dixon intervew, particularly so that  Heibner did not think  it a confidential talk 
with an officer with whom he had a relationship. 

It was agreed that Dixon did not rem ind Heibner of the caution. The Crown’s case 
was that he had already  been cautio ned at the beginning of the two earlier O’Brien 
interviews and was onc e m ore at the subs equent O’Brien and Stim pson interview. 
Heibner’s case was that he was not. 
He  also disputed m uch of Dixon’s evidence, 
denying he had asked to speak to him. 

Examination of what if any inculpatory m aterial emerged from the Dixon interview is 
revealing. According to Dixon it started with Heibner saying, “I’m in the shit, can you 
help me out?” and Dixon’s “Well you’d better tell me what it’s all about.”  

As we have already rehearsed, the jury heard that Dixon to ld Heibner to tell the truth, 
Heibner described doing that as a big st ep, said he would deny the dam aging Fagan 
and Parker statem ents, and that though he wa nted to and w ould tell police the truth, 
names could not be m entioned, since [were he  to identify individuals]  he would be 
killed.

There are insurmountable difficulties in the wa y of this submission. First,  at the start 
of the confession s tatement Heibner’s signature appears after “I have been told that I 
 
need not say anything unless I  wish to do so and  that whatever I say may be given in 
evidence”. Heibner was cautioned three tim es during 22 nd October and signed a note 
recording that he was awar e of his rights under the cauti on. Nothing w e have heard

persuades us that th is aspect of the evidence  is so called into question as to m ake us 
uneasy about it. Yet more compellingly, however, the content of the Dixon dialogue is 
of li mited inculpatory weight, if inculpat ory it be. The dam age done  to Heibner’s 
 
defence is done in the O’Br
ien interview when the conf ession statement em erges. 
Heibner was not naïve about police interv
iews or about m ixing with experienced 
criminals who played for high  stakes. We  approach this submission with an  eye to 
context. Though Mr Blaxland positioned it as his strongest card, we are not persuaded 
that it undermines the safety of the convict ion, seen as a freestanding argum ent or, as 
we shall see, taken together with the balance of the submissions.

Westburgh. At som e point she was detained  for questioning and at the tim e Heibner 
was making the confession statem ent so too  was his girlfriend Gloria Priestaff (Miss 
Westburgh’s sister) and his sister Elaine Sm ith. Heibner told the jury his decision to 
confess was clinched when he understood it would mean they were released. 

 

53.	  Mr Blaxland submits the meeting would have affected Heibner’s state of mind and the 
reliability of his confession. The police, who  allowed the visit, made a contribution to 
that un reliability. They  let him  talk to h is wif e becaus e it was likely  to break h is 
resolve, and so it proved. Mr Blaxland ar
gues that even though Heibner m ade the 
 
request it should have been rejected. 

 
54.	 

Once again it is important to see this issue in context. Such meetings were common in 
 
the 1970s. There is no suggestion of bad faith  in allowing it, and we remind ourselves 
that Miss Westburgh was not, without warning,  brought in to see Heibner, rather he 
had asked to see her. He told the jury he confessed because he had been led to believe 
 
he alone “could get [his fa mily] out of the  situation”. The jury had all the ev idence 
 
necessary to reach a conclusion, if it thought it necessary on this topic, so as to reach a 
verdict and we see nothing in the point to challenge the safety of the conviction.

Breach of Judges’ Rule IV (e) 

 

55.	  Mr Blaxland accepted that even were we with  him this was not as im portant a breach 
 
as the failure to caution or the denia l of solicitor. The requirement for the Certificate 
at the end of the statem ent under caution to  be written by the 
suspect acted as a 
safeguard against a po lice officer simply pl acing a s tatement before him and saying 
“sign that”. Here, absent a solicitor, to ensure the confession was voluntary the 
 
submission is that the Rules provided a m inimum protection agains t oppression in a 
police interview.

apparent breach of the Judges’ Rules ques tions were asked by O’Brien in the course 
of taking the statement no point seems to have been taken on it. W e remind ourselves 
that Heibner conceded having uttered the  most inculpatory words, those upon which 
the Crown confidently relied. If, on thes
e facts, any difference were m ade by the 
 
manuscript being that of a police of ficer not of Heibner, it was not  great. We are not 
persuaded that the safety of this convicti on is called into question by the words at the 
top of the confession not being in Heibner’s hand. 

 
Ground  2:  The  evidence  of  the  officers  who  interviewed  Heibner  was  so  lacking  in 
credibility that no jury could safely rely on it. 
 

 
57.	 

 
58.	 

The first two interviews lasted in tota l 2 hours and 14 m inutes. Mr Blaxland subm its 
 
that the rec ord of  the inte rviews take s le ss than 10 m inutes to  re ad at norm al 
conversational speed and Dixon’s witness st atement significantly less tim e to repeat 
than the 2 hours the interview was said to last. There is a stark difference between the 
length of the transcript of Ro ssi’s taped interview and the  length of the transcript of 
the other interviews with him. 
 

 

However, there is no  indication in the summ ing-up that these points w ere made. In 
Maynard and Dudley No.200003731 S1 C.A. 31/07/02 the Court of Appeal quashed a 
conviction from  1977 on the basis of 
contemporaneous interview with Dudley c ould not have been recorded in the tim e 
alleged. Mr Blaxland is obliged to concede  that such analysis has not been conducted 
in this case. Additionally, during the interview, statements were read to Heibner. That 
said, Mr Blaxland relies on the apparent di screpancy as raising serious doubts about 
the veracity of the police evidence.

The Dixon attendance point 

R v Heibner 
 

The evidence about the attendance of Dixon at
 Kings Cross police station is said by 
Mr Blaxland to def y credibility. Ac cording to O’Brien, towards the end of the 3.05 
p.m  interview Heibner aske d to see Dixon of the Regi
onal Crim e Squad (“RCS”) 
whom he trusted. O’Brien said he would 
arrange it and th e inte rview is shown as 
ending at 4 p.m. The dialogue with Dixon began 15 minutes later. 

Dixon told the jury that about midday, angry because interrupted, he got a message to 
go to the police station. He had no invol

evidence. The Judge in summing up descri bed Dixon, who had been cross-exam ined 
on the point, as slightly im precise and not posit ively saying that he  got the call at 1 2 
 
o’clock. 

vement in the murder investigation and 

On O’Brien’s account Dixon had fewer than 
fifteen m inutes to m aster what Mr 
Blaxland described as detail. Asked “Is it tr ue about the others shopping m e?” Dixon 
could say “Yes they are tel ling the truth, your relations ha ve made statements and so 
have other people.” He said he had read Fagan’s and Parker’s statements. 

That Dixon had m astered the facts and had  with him some important docum ents Mr 
Blaxland asserts com pletely destroys his and O’Brien’s acco unt of how Dixon cam e 
 
to be present at Kings Cross police station and to interview Heibner.  

The summing-up does not reveal whether the sp eedy grasp of detail point were taken. 
The discrepancy between O’Brien’s tim ing and Dixon’s reference to m idday was 
 
explored, as the summing-up shows.  

The Judge absent the jury raised with c

Dixon was less than precise about the tim ing of his summons. Assuming first, since it 
is of greater advantage to Heibner, that he  was called during the later part of the day, 
arriving at the police station  at about 4 o’clock and beginn ing to ta lk to Heibner b y 
 
4.15, we are not persuaded of a suspicious m astery of detail. The point amounts to no 
more than how quickly an experienced o
 
record shows. There is no evidence of wh

statements he mentioned, the record simply shows that they were read to Heibner. The 
preponderance of Dixon’s part in the anti phony is on one reading m ore generalised 
than Mr Blaxland suggested. Even were Dixon summoned l ater in the day we are not 
 
persuaded that the tim e available to him  to put himself in the position to conduct the 
conversation as he did must have been beyond what was achievable by an officer of 
his experience. It follow s that were he  summoned earlier, as the summ ing-up shows 
on the evidence might have been the case, the point dies away.

Though the CCRC considered it a misdirection to  invite the jury to consider its truth,

Additionally, examination of what is said  to amount to oppression reveals m ore than

The suggestion by Mr Blaxland is that the defence was disadvantaged by inexperience 
and that for the Judge to invite adverse

significant.

Further, the direction failed to introduce the consideration that Heibner might sim ply 
have misremembered what had been said a nd when in the interviews. W ithout such a 
qualification the direction was unbalanced. Heib ner, Mr Blaxland told us confidently, 
more than once strugg led to recall what  was said and often could not recall his 
instructions. 

For the Crown the submission is that the supposed inequality, assumed 37 years later, 
may not ha ve been as m arked to those invol ved in the trial as it m ight seem today.

In our view if this Ground goes to anythi
ng it is to an unco mplicated question of 
professional ethics. The presentation of Heibner’s defence  was certain to have been a 
considerable responsibility for junior counsel to assume at short notice.  That said, the 
 
justification for two counsel includes just this eventuality.  The jury was likely to have 
been less sensitive to this aspect than were  counsel, since, in our view, a professional 
 
task was properly done.  The Judge said as  much. Had counsel for Heibner realised 
that an om ission needed attention, his duty  was to invite the court to perm it him to 
 the defendant. After dialogue there m ight

Counsel took Heibner through his confessi on statem ent line by line. It was always 
open to Heibner to say, of any topic, that
 he could not recall  and his counsel could 
have made that submission to the jury. In  our view the trial process is well equipped 
to deal with situations like this, which are f amiliar to members of the profession and 
are very far from  unusual. Advocates and j udges deal with them  with a sense on the 
one hand of judgment and on the other of grounded reality.

 on a counsel-to-coun

It is at leas t possible that these s tatements were inc luded within thos e of fered f or 
inspection. However in a recen t witness statement dated 1 st May 2013 Paul Garlick 
QC, junior defence counsel at trial, states that the existence of those witnesses had not 
 
been disclosed to trial counsel. Had they b een they would have played a part in the 
 
defence case, underm ining the Crown’s case that Heibner was the gunm an. On the 
basis that these statements had not been s een by trial counsel, th e question is whether 
this is sufficient to provide Heibner with an arguable ground of appeal.  

As to the tim ing of when Mrs Gold was s hot, although there is no  direct reference in 
the summ ing up to the witnesses Elaine 
Tibbetts and Alice Ca mpbell who were 
walking past 364 Goswell Road on the day  of the m urder and heard bangs between 
5.10 and 5.20pm, the Judge reminded the jury that the shooting  was at about 5.15pm. 
It is argued  that not on ly are the two witn esses likely to be describing one and the 
same man but also that there is a real po ssibility that he, whose description did not 
match that of Heibner, participated in  the murder, undermining the Crown’s case that 
Heibner was the gunman.   

Because of the first witness’s likely direc
tion of travel, n orth from  work to home, 
there is doubt as to whether the two were describing one and the same man. Moreover 
there must be real doubt as to whether, gi ven the timings, the man could realistically 
be put forward as the gunman. It would be odd were a gunman to remain at the scene 
rather than flee it immediately after the killing.

R v Heibner 
 

 
90.	 

However of even greater difficulty for Heibne r is that, as he argue s in relation to the 
previous grounds, one, if not the central, piece of evidence was his voluntar
y 
statement, exhibit 32, in which, whilst ad mitting aiding and abet ting the killing,  he 
denied being the gun man. Thus, although possible these statem ents could have been 
used to s uggest that h e was telling  the trut h about that, th eir effect may have been 
more likely to support the veracity of the voluntary statement.   

91.	  We refuse leave on this ground. 

 

 

 

92.	  Ground 6 - The CCRC reviewed witnesses stat ements of Richard Reeves and John 
Galvin dated respectively the 17 th and 24 th of September 1975. Neither prom pted the 
CCRC to identify arguable grounds of appeal  against conviction. H however suggest s 
that this evidence tended to underm ine  the Crown’s case and should have been 
deployed at trial. Unlike 
the witness statem ents relied upon under ground 5, the 
existence of evidence from  Reeves and Galvin was disclos ed in a 9 th of April 1976 
letter from  the Director of Public Prosecutions. Although Paul Garlick has no 
recollection of the existence of these statem ents, he is sure his leader would have 
inspected the unused material.  

 

 
93.	 

 
94.	 

The evidence of John Galvin is that about 12 to 18 months pre-murder he was on two 
 
occasions approached b y a m an in a public  house in Fulh am and asked whether he 
 
would be interested in killing Mrs  Gold on behalf of her husband for £5000.00. 
Despite telling the m an that he was not in terested, Galvin claim ed he was provided 
with written details of the identity of Mrs Gold which, after the murder, was seen by 
 
Temporary Detective Constable Reeves.   

The possibility tha t the murder was at th e behest of her husband was clear from  the 
known circum stances, nam ely the absence  of him self and Mrs Brown from  the 
premises at the tim e of the killing. Heibne r’s argument rests upon  the description of 
Galvin’s interlocutor not m atching that  of Rossi, som ething confirmed by Detective 
Chief Superintendent Lamont in his 25 th of July 1979 report. This evidence deployed 
at trial would, it is cont ended, have underm ined the Crown’s case against Rossi and 
by implication against Heibner. 

 

 

95.	  We see no force in this argum ent. Not only is  it likely these witness statements were 
seen by Heibner’s leading counsel, but also a decision not to rely upon them is wholly 
 
understandable. They were capable of s
upporting the evidence of F agan that the 
murder was indeed a “contract killing.” 
Furthermore, although the evidence coul d 
have been used to show that Galvin ’s interlocutor 12 to 18 m onths pre-murder was 
not Rossi, it is doubtful wh
ether this would significa ntly have underm ined the 
Crown’s case against him , since the obvi
ade was that an 
 
intermediary m ight have been used.  W e  are even less persuaded this would have 
undermined the Crown’s case against Heibner. We refuse leave on this ground.

Adams retired in the rank of Commander in 1993. Between 1987 and 1989 he was the 
 
subject of an investigation by DAC W inship into allegations  of corruption and 
misconduct. He faced neither crim inal ch arges nor d isciplinary pro ceedings as a 
result. However, the core facts Mr Blaxland argues provide cogent m aterial for cross-
examination as to cred it. It is not a c ondition precedent to the in troduction of such 
 
material that there sho uld have b een an adv erse dis ciplinary findin g or crim inal 
 
conviction. 

 
97.	 

A number of allegations recorded by the MPS Department for Professional Standards 
 
was not investigated because Adam s had by then retired. The picture which em erges 
is said to mean he could not now be put forward as a witness of truth. 

98.	  We were ta ken to ex tracts f rom the W inship report which we summ arise. Some 
 

 

information about Adam s could have am ounted to a conspiracy, and an innocent 
explanation was difficult to identify. Ada ms’ behaviour was at least unprofessional 
and unbecoming. He had close connection with King a former police officer who kept 
in contact not only with serving officers 
but also with a  crim inal f amily. Adams 
employed him and took holidays with him .  Alex Leighton another for mer officer 
worked for the notorious Ada ms (no rela tion to Comm ander Adam s) fa mily and 
Burrows family. Most significant, according to Mr Blaxland, was that a DS Coles had 
 
been investigated for corruption but Ada ms, disregarding orders, put Coles onto the 
RCS. Coles was an offi cer allowed anonym ity at the Lawrence Inquiry and Ada ms,

involvement in the m urder investigation and the lack of any evidence of collusion or

whether, on these facts, they were relevant. It is not an invariable rule that evidence of 
 
misconduct post-trial in which the integrity  of the officer was im pugned inevitably 
leads to a successful appeal. It depends on the facts.

R v Heibner 
 

101.	  We are far from convinced that this material would have been admitted. In any event, 

 

to what would it go? 

 

102.	  The extent of Ada ms’ involvement in this m urder investigation is as follows: He ran 
RCS surveillance and h ad arrested Heibner for robberies. Despite intens e interest in 
 
Heibner and though he was seen with Rossi on 4th and 5th Sept, on 8th he was seen to 
get into a car with Rossi which drove off and of which officers lost sight. Surveillance 
was called off, said Adams.  

103.	  Mr Blaxland advanced this as possibly 

 

an inconsequential point or possibly of 

significance in connection to PC T yers. At tr ial a deal of tim e and effort went into 
contesting his evidence. True, Heibner'
 
Angel but precise timing (he said he was th ere at 16.55) was disput ed and his precise 
location disputed. 

s cas e was that he had indeed been at the 

 

104.	  Supporting evidence for the Tyers account co uld have come from the confession. But 
Heibner’s counsel used the at tack on Tyers - not part of 
the surveillance team  - to 
attack the credibility of the entire po lice body of evidence. It was open to the defence 
to say it cannot be true. W hy would the su rveillance be called  off? This rhetoric 
question Mr Blaxland argued showed how ludicrous it was that it should have been, at 
 
least without ulterior motive. He confidently asserted that far from being abandoned it 
was continued. Officers would have seen Hei bner at the An gel, just as Heibner told 
the jury he was. If he were at Angel, 
he was not at Goswell Road murdering Mrs 
Gold. 

 

105.	  This complicated submission relied on a number of building blocks. Before the Dixon 
interview Dixon knew Heibner had been seen  by Tyers at A ngel. One explanation is 
 
that Adams, who had the Tyers inform ation, knew from  his own team  that Heibner 
ed to  conceal th e continui ng surveillan ce operatio n. 
had been at Angel but need
Adams thus needed som eone to say Heibne r had been at Angel.
 Had surveillan ce 
continued the team  of observers woul d have known Heibner did not comm it the 
 
murder. Tyers filled that gap. Tyers, Mr
someone knew Heibner had in fact been at  Angel between 4.55- 5. Adams, he asserts, 
knew and specifically recruited  Tyers to m ake a false statem ent. Tyers had to kn ow 
about the surveillance operation because  Tyers would have known that the defence 
case was that Heibner had not gone to Goswell Rd. 

 Blaxland suggested, only makes sense if 

 
106.	 

Invited to take us to the evidence for all this, Mr Blaxland said it was an avenue which 
would have been explored. Its foundation is  Adams’ bad character, revealed in the 
Winship report. Adam s took witness statem ents (in the robberies i nvestigation) from 
Miss Priestaff and from Parker. Although not involved in th e murder investigation he 
 
was involved in the arrest of Heibner for 
robberies. F inally Leslie Joyce, a fellow 
prisoner, lent support to the contention th at Adam s had an i mportant orchestration 
background role.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Heibner 
 

 

107.	  The first of m any difficulties in the way of  such a bold subm ission is indeed the role 
Adams played in the murder investigation.  We have set it out. He was i nvestigating 
robberies and was in charge of the 8 th September surveillance team whi ch watched 
 
Heibner. He interviewed Hei bner about the  robberies on 12 th and 13 th Septem ber 
 
1975. That was the extent of his involvement. 

 

108.	  To make good the submission, the following would have been required. Adams had to 
 
frame a wholly innocent m an, destroy records, and corrupt an entire team, unless we 
 
assume it was already corrupted.  There 
is nothing to suggest Adam s knew on 8t h 
September that Heibner would  be arrested on 20th October,  so it was  in October that 
he must have decided to fram e Heibner. Th e conspiracy had to be com plete befor e 
 
matters were put to Heibner in interview.  Then, so the reasoning goes, Adams needed 
 
someone to say Heibner was seen at Angel.  There is not the slightest evidential basis 
for any such proposition. 

 

109.	  To suggest it is surprising the surveillance  was called off is speculation 38 years after 
the event. The importance for Heibner of it being called off is that it deprived him  of 
an alibi if  he did no t commit the murder . The implication s eems to be that Adam s 
knew the murder was going to happen and  wanted to inculpate Heibner by depriving 
him of an alibi. This requires so m uch confidence in m atters not canvassed, not put, 
and wholly unsupported by evidence that the argument is fanciful and we reject it. 

110.	  There is nothing in this Ground and we refuse leave. 

 

 

111.	  Ground  8  O’Brien was suspended from  dut y in July 1977 on the basis of a

n 
 
allegation th at he failed to repo rt an  accidental meeting at  Royston Heath Sporting 
Club on 24 July 1977 with Alexander Eist, 
 
O’Brien had previously infor med a superior officer that he was “liable to  meet” Eist, 
and been told to report it if it happened. 

a for mer police officer then on bail. 

 

 
112.	 

Information on file was that O’Brien suggested to a junior officer that an allegation of 
corruption against another officer should not  be reported.  This suggestion was never 
the basis of a disciplinary charge. 

 

 

113.	  Both these matters related to events after Heibner’s trial. O’Brien retired on 22 April 

1978 on medical grounds, and th
disciplinary proceedings.  O’Brien therefore had no disciplinary finding against him. 
  
He had no criminal conviction.  There was no proven matter indicating bad character.  

e Eist m eeting allegati on was never tested in 

 

 

114.	  There was little challenge to the content of the interviews he conducted.  He faced an 
attack on the timing and circumstances of the involvement of Dixon, and a suggestion 
 
that Heibner’s treatment in custody before his confession amounted to oppression.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R v Heibner 
 

115.	  The first point was fully canvassed before the jury and we have dealt with it in detail 

above.  Dixon was unsure when he got the 
call to the police stat ion.   O’Brien  said 
Dixon was asked to attend at about 4pm .  He ibner says that canno t be right, since 
Dixon was fully briefed and prepared with copy witness statem ents, on t he basis of 
which he “broke the appellant’s resolve”, within too short a time.   

116.	  The second  point was  also  f ully develop ed as relev ant to  the  re liability of  the 

confession. 

 

 

 

117.	  Mr Blax land subm its that the ev idence of  bad character now available would be 

admissible and powerful evidence in favour of  Heibner.  We should conclude that it 
renders the conviction unsafe. 

 

118.	  We reject this subm ission  on both grounds.  We consider it highly unlikely that 

 
unproven allegations of this kind, taking place  (if they did take pl ace) well after the 
trial, would be adm itted.  If admitted they  would add little or nothing  to the jury’s 
thinking.  T he suggestion of lying and m anipulation by police officers was fully 
explored, the attack on O’Brien  forceful.  Even if this m aterial were b efore the ju ry, 
any judge would give the strongest possi ble warning about relying on such unproven 
allegations as providing safe support for an allegation of a major conspiracy to pervert 
justice.  This material does not render the conviction unsafe.

121.	  We are content to assume it more likely than not that these matters would be admitted 
at trial today, and to a degree would dam age his cred ibility.  However that does  not 
render the conviction unsafe, for a number of reasons.    

 

 

122.	  The underlying disciplinary m isconduct and the mu ch later theft are very different in 
nature from and markedly less seriousness than a conspiracy to pervert the course of

However, the Judge told the jury, in fairly  strong terms, that even if it assumed Tyers 
had given honest evidence, such identification evidence was very unreliable.  Hence, 
even if an h onest witness, Tyers gav e inherently unreliable evid ence of facts which 
were not really in issue.

Nathaniel Flynn 


Bradford Crown Court 


18 December 2013 


Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Keith 


 

 

 
Nathaniel Flynn, you have pleaded guilty to the murder of your grandmother, as well 
 
as the attempted murder of a 9 year old boy.   Anyone listening to Mr Waterman’s 
account of what happened to them would be likely to think that there was something 
very strange about you to have caused you to behave the way you did.   The doctors 
have spent a lot of time trying to understand your inner world, and like many things in 
life the reasons for your behaviour are complex.   It looks as if you have always had 
mood swings, though nothing sufficiently severe to amount to clinical depression, and 
 
you have not developed as well as others the kind of social skills you need in life if 
you are to get on with the people you meet, though again nothing acute enough to 
amount  to  a  recognised  personality  disorder.    But  you  were  not  alone  in  having 
problems  of  that  kind.    Other  people  have  them,  and  they  manage  to  cope.    You 
turned to drugs, and if what you told the mental healthcare nurse last year is anything 
to  go  by,  you  had  been  into  hard  drugs  for  quite  a  while,  and  they  included 
hallucinogenic drugs like mescalin and LSD.    
 
I am prepared to accept that your increasing use of drugs may have been – in part at 
least – to help you cope with the pain from your accident last year, but you were an 
entrenched user of drugs before then, and it looks as if it was your use of cannabis 
which  resulted  in  a  deterioration  in  your  mental  functioning  and  eventually  caused 
you to become so disinhibited that you did whatever you felt like doing, even though 
you knew that what you were doing was wrong.   But taking drugs was your lifestyle 
choice, which means that you and you alone are responsible for what you did.   The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
one thing which one can say is that you were not suffering from an abnormality of 
 
mental  functioning  arising  from  a  medical  condition  which  substantially  impaired 
your ability to do things like understanding what you were doing or forming rational 
judgments or exercising self-control.    
 
You say that you killed your grandmother – in effect as an act of mercy – because her 
 
mental functioning had deteriorated as she got older.   No-one else seems to have 
noticed that, and a likelier explanation is that she just got on your nerves.   Killing her 
meant  that  any  inhibitions  you  may  have  felt  about  not  harming  anyone  else 
disintegrated, and there was nothing to prevent you from trying to murder the 9 year 
old boy who had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.    
 
As you know, the law allows only one punishment for the crime of murder, and the 
sentence  which  I  pass  on  you  on  count  1  of  the  indictment  for  the  murder  of  your 
grandmother,  Louisa  Denby,  is  one  of  imprisonment  for  life.    That  is  an 
 
indeterminate sentence, and I must therefore specify the minimum period you must 
 
remain in prison for before your release on licence can be considered by the Parole 
Board.  The law requires me to take 15 years as my starting point, but your killing of 
your  grandmother  was  aggravated  by  a  number  of  things.    She  was  a  particularly 
vulnerable woman because of her age.   She trusted you by allowing you to live in her 
home,  and  you  betrayed  that  trust  by  going  into  her  bedroom  and  stabbing  her  to 
 
death.  Your murder of her was not done on the spur of the moment.   You must have 
taken the knife into the bedroom with you, and you must have been intending to kill 
her before you went in.   Indeed, you have admitted that you had been thinking about 
it that night, and it also looks as if you had been planning to do something dramatic 
for  some  time  in  the  light  of  the  books  which  told  you  how  to  survive  in  the  wild 
together  with  the  rope,  tarpaulin  and  camping  or  bush  knives  you  ordered  from 
 
Amazon in the week before the murder.   And finally there was the ferocity of the 
 
attack on your grandmother.   You say that you had intended to kill her with a single 
 
cut to her throat, and it was only when she did not die immediately that you felt that 
you had to stab her again and again.  That may be so, but her death was nevertheless 
 
a horrific one, not least because the pathologist who conducted the post mortem on 
 
her  identified  50  stab  wounds  in  all,  together  with  defensive  injuries  on  both  her 
hands. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
I  acknowledge,  of  course,  that  the  starting  point  of  15  years  proceeds  on  the 
 
assumption that you intended to kill Mrs Denby, rather than to cause her really serious 
harm,  so  the  fact  that  you  intended  to  kill  her  does  not  of  itself  amount  to  an 
additional  aggravating  factor.  But  for  the  reasons  I  have  already  given,  I  do  not 
regard  the  deterioration  in  your  mental  functioning  as  significantly  mitigating  what 
you did, though I have to factor into my thinking the fact that the court was told at an 
 
early stage that it was unlikely that you would deny that it was you who killed your 
grandmother,  and  that  you  pleaded  guilty  to  murdering  her  –  and  to  attempting  to 
murder the boy – when you were advised that you were well enough to give coherent 
instructions to your lawyers and that the medical evidence could not support a plea of 
guilty  to  the  manslaughter  of  your  grandmother  based  on  your  diminished 
responsibility. 
 
 
I must also sentence you for attempting to murder Jason D’Arcy.   Your attempt to 
murder Jason was a level 2 offence using the classification adopted by the Sentencing 
Council in its guideline on sentencing in cases of attempted murder, because you had 
decided to kill anyone who happened to cross your path when you went armed with 
the knife to the park for skateboarders and BMX bikers.   The fact that Jason suffered 
both physical and psychological harm, whose effects could be lasting, means that the 
starting point for any determinate sentence is 15 years’ imprisonment.   Jason too was 
particularly vulnerable because of his age.   Had I not been passing an indeterminate 
sentence  on  you  for  the  murder  of  Mrs  Denby,  and  had  I  been  considering  a 
 
determinate sentence for the attempted murder of Jason, the determinate sentence I 
 
would  have  passed  for  the  attempted  murder  of  Jason  would  have  had  to  be 
discounted to reflect your plea of guilty, and you would have had to serve only half 
that  sentence  because  that  is  what  the  law  requires.      But  since  I  have  passed  an 
indeterminate sentence on you for Mrs Denby’s murder, the appropriate course for me 
to take is to factor half the determinate sentence which I would otherwise have passed 
on  you  for  the  attempted  murder  of  Jason  into  the  length  of  the  minimum  term  – 
making sure, of course, at the same time that the overall minimum term reflects the 
totality of your offending – and then to pass a concurrent sentence for the attempted 
murder of Jason.  Balancing all these factors, I have concluded that your release from 
prison should not be considered by the Parole Board until you have served 24 years in 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
prison.  That is the minimum term which I set in your case, though the number of 
days  you  have  been  in  custody  since  your  arrest  will  automatically  be  taken  into 
account.  The  sentence  on  count  2  of  the  indictment  for  the  attempted  murder  of 
Jason is one of 14 years’ imprisonment.   That sentence will be served concurrently 
with the sentence of life imprisonment which I have already passed.   You will have 
 
to  pay  the  appropriate  victim  surcharge  on  your  release  from  prison.    He  may  be 
taken away. 
 
 
There is one other thing I want to say, and that is to express my own condolences to 
Mrs  Denby’s  family  for  their  terrible  loss,  especially  as  her  killer  was  her  own 
grandson.  I want them to know that I have taken into account the devastating effect 
which Mrs Denby’s death will have had on their lives.   I also wish to pay tribute, as 
others more distinguished than me have already done, to Jason’s courage and to the 
efforts he has made to put the trauma of the attack behind him.   And even though the 
prosecution did not proceed with the charge that Flynn had also attacked an elderly 
man,  Terence  Thackray,  I  want  him  to  know  that  I  understand  how  frightening  his 
encounter with Flynn must have been.   I hope that they all realise that the minimum 
term I have set is equivalent to a determinate sentence of 48 years’ imprisonment, and 
it does not mean that Flynn will be released as soon as he has spent 24 years in prison.   
   
It only means that his release cannot be considered by the Parole Board until then. 
Whether he is ever released will depend on when the Parole Board decides that he no 
longer poses a risk to the public.  Thank you very much.

The claimant was at all material times a member of the Metropolitan Police Service 
 
(“MPS”).  In  June  2006  he  was  a  member  of  its  Extradition  Unit.    The  defendant 
(“TNL”) is the publisher of The Times and The Sunday Times. 

The  claimant  brings  this  action  for  libel  arising  out  of  an  article  (“the  article”) 
published  in  The  Times  on  2  June  2006  under  the  headline  “Detective  accused  of 
taking bribes from Russian exiles”.  The subheading reads “Police are investigating 
 
the alleged sale to a security company of intelligence on the Kremlin’s attempts to 
extradite opponents of President Putin”.  The article first appeared in the print edition 
of The Times and thereafter on the TimesOnline website.  The author of the article is 
 
Michael Gillard, an investigative journalist employed by the defendant. 

On  31  May  2007  the  claimant  issued  proceedings.    The  defendant  advanced  two 
substantive  defences,  a  defence  of  public  interest  (Reynolds)  privilege  and 
justification.  Following a trial in July 2009 before Tugendhat J the Reynolds defence 
in respect of the print version and in respect of the publication on the website up to 5 
September 2007 was upheld [2009] EWHC 2375 (QB) [2008] EMLR 8.  Appeals to 
the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court ensued.  The Court of Appeal allowed the 
 
claimant’s appeal to the extent that it reversed the judgment of Tugendhat J where it 
 
had been held that the Reynolds defence succeeded [2010] EWCA Civ 804; [2011] 
1WLR 153.  The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court which restored Tugendhat 
J’s judgment and held that publications up to 5 September 2007 were protected by 
Reynolds privilege [2012] UKSC 11 [2012] 2 AC 273.  The defendant also appealed 
against that part of Tugendhat J’s decision in which he held that the Reynolds defence 
failed in respect of website publications post 5 September 2007, the Court of Appeal 
 
having upheld that part of the earlier decision.  The defendant subsequently withdrew 
its appeal to the Supreme Court on that issue.

Tugendhat J identified the material parts of the article thus (paragraph numbers are 
 
added): 

“1. Allegations that a British security company with wealthy Russian 
 
clients  paid  a  police  officer  in  the  extradition  unit  for  sensitive 
 
information are being investigated by Scotland Yard. 
 
2.  The  officer,  who  has  been  moved  temporarily  from  his  post,  is 
alleged  to  have  provided  Home  Office  and  police  intelligence 
concerning  moves  by  Moscow  to  extradite  a  number  of  Russia's 
wealthiest and most wanted men living in Britain. 
 
3.  Anti-corruption  detectives  are  examining  documents  detailing  the 
client accounts of ISC Global (UK), a London based security firm at

the  centre  of  the  investigation.  The  financial  dossier,  seen  by  The 
Times,  shows  that  ISC  was  paid  more  than  £6m  from  off-shore 
companies  linked  to  the  most  vocal  opponents  of  President  Putin  of 
Russia. 
 
4.  Between  2001  and  2005,  ISC  provided  a  variety  of  specialist 
security  services  including  ‘monitoring’  the  Kremlin's  attempts  to 
extradite key clients to Moscow, where they face fraud and tax evasion 
 
charges. 
 
5. A former ISC insider passed the dossier to the intelligence arm of 
the anti-corruption squad in February. The informant directed handlers 
to  a  series  of  ISC  payments,  totalling  £20,000,  made  to  a  recipient 
codenamed  Noah.  Detectives  from  Scotland  Yard  professional 
standards  directorate  were  told  that  Noah  could  be  a  reference  to  an 
 
officer  in  the  extradition  unit  who  was  friendly  with  one  of  ISC's 
bosses. 
 
6.  The  officer  under  investigation  has  been  identified  as  Detective 
Sergeant Gary Flood. His home and office were raided last month. 
 
7. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said yesterday: 
 

“We are conducting an investigation into allegations that a
 
 
serving  officer  made  unauthorised  disclosures  of 
information to another individual in exchange for money.” 


 
8.  Anti-corruption  detectives  are  examining  the  relationship  between 
 
Sergeant  Flood  and  a  former  Scotland  Yard  detective,  one  of  the 
original  partners  in  ISC.  The  men  admit  to  being  close  friends  for 
 
more  than  25  years  but  deny  any  impropriety  and  are  willing  to 
cooperate with the inquiry. 
 
9.  Sergeant  Flood  has  not  been  suspended.  His  lawyer  said:  “All 
allegations  of  impropriety  in  whatsoever  form  are  categorically  and 
unequivocally denied.” 
 
10.  ISC  Global  was  set  up  in  October  2000  by  Stephen  Curtis,  a 
lawyer. He was already acting for a group of billionaire Russians led 
 
by Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Leonid Nevzlin, who controlled Yukos 
Russia's privatised energy giant… 
 
15. The dossier also reveals … Boris Berezovsky was a client of ISC. 

 

16. … Two companies linked to Mr Berezovsky – Bowyer Consultants 
Ltd  …  and  Tower  Management  Ltd  …  -  appear  to  have  made 
 
payments totalling £600,000 to ISC. 
 
19. ISC stopped trading last year after Curtis, the chairman, died in a 
helicopter  crash.  Subsequently,  two  former  Scotland  Yard  officers,

Keith Hunter and Nigel Brown, whom Curtis recruited to set up ISC, 
fell out and Mr Hunter bought the company and renamed it RISC. 
 
20.  A  spokesman  for  Mr  Hunter  said:  “Neither  my  client  nor  his 
associated companies have ever made illegal payments to a Scotland 
 
Yard officer.” 
 
21.  Mr  Brown,  who  lives  in  Israel  said:  “Scotland  Yard  recently 
contacted me as a result of receiving certain information. I have been 
asked not to discuss this matter.”

As  a  result  of  correspondence  emanating  from  a  journalist  employed  by  TNL,  an 
investigation by the Directorate of Professional Standards (“DPS”) of the MPS into 
allegations  of  corrupt  practice  said  to  have  been  committed  by  the  claimant  was 
commenced.  As a consequence of the investigation, the claimant was removed from 
the Extradition Unit from 28 April 2006 until December 2006.  On 2 December 2006 
the report of the investigation was completed, the Senior Investigating Officer being 
 
DCI Crump.   The final paragraph stated: 

 

“In conclusion, I have been unable to find any evidence to show that 
Detective Sergeant Gary FLOOD is “NOAH” as alleged by Jonathon 
 
CALVERT  in  his  letter,  or  that  he  has  divulged  any  confidential 
information  for  monies  or  otherwise.    Consequently  there  are  no 
recommendations  made  as  to  criminal  or  discipline  proceedings  in 
relation to this matter.” 

 

The finding was accepted by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 

Michael Gillard was informed of the outcome in a letter dated 4 September 2007 from 
DCI  Crump.    Following  this  notification,  deemed  to  have  been  received  on  5 
September  2007,  the  defendant  did  not  update  the  website  in  order  to  report  the 
outcome of the investigation until about 21 October 2009.  Prior to that date the only 
alteration to the original article on the website was a legal warning which read “This 
 
article  is  subject  to  a  legal  complaint.”    No  identification  of  the  complainant  was 
made. 

 
7.	 

The update made in October 2009 was as follows: 

“Update 
In May 2007, DS Gary Flood issued libel proceedings against Times 
 
Newspapers in respect of the article below.  Those proceedings are still 
 
ongoing.  DS Flood disputes that there is any truth in the allegations 
which, as the article reported, were being investigated by the police at 
the time it was published. 
   
On  20  December  2006,  DS  Flood  returned  to  his  duties  at  the 
Extradition  Squad. 
In  the  middle  of  2007,  the  Independent  Police 
Complaints  Commission  accepted  DCI  Gary  Crump’s  final  report
--------

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

which concluded, “I have been unable to find any evidence to show 
that  Detective  Sergeant  Gary  Flood  is  “NOAH”?  or  that  he  has 
divulged  any  confidential  information  for  money  or  otherwise. 
 
Consequently there are no recommendations made as to any criminal 
or disciplinary proceedings in relation to the matter.” 

The Legal Proceedings 
 

The defendant’s plea of justification 

 
8.	 

The original plea of justification which was amended pursuant to the order of Eady J 
on 8 May 2008 stated: 

“Further or alternatively, if and in so far as the Article bore the natural 
 
and ordinary meaning that: 
(1)  The  claimant  was  the  subject  of  an  internal  police  investigation; 
 
and 
(2)  There  were  grounds  which  supported  that  objectively  justified  a 
 
police  investigation  into  whether  the  Claimant  received  payment  in 
return  for  passing  confidential  information  about  Russia’s  possible 
plans to extradite Russian Oligarchs, 
  
Then it is true in substance and in fact.” 

 
9.	 

By  the  May  2008  amendment,  it  was  alleged  that  in  2002  the  claimant  was  in 
 
particular  need  of  extra  money  in  addition  to  his  normal  salary.  The  claimant  had 
“increased  his  borrowings  by  approximately  £22,500  from  November  2001  to 
December 2002.  The Defendant will invite the inference that a principal reason for 
this was the Claimant’s gambling habit”.  This allegation was linked to the original 
 
allegation  that  between  December  2002  and  April  2003,  seven  payments  totalling 
£20,000 had been made to “Noah” from the suspense account of Keith Hunter of ISC. 
 
The  May  2008  amendments  averred  that  the  claimant’s  personal  financial  situation 
improved materially at or around the same time as these payments 

 
10.	 

Further, amendments on 8 May 2008 or in June 2009 alleged that: 

 
  Boris  Berezovsky,  a  key  ISC  client,  was  arrested  on  extradition  warrants  in 
March  2003,  the  claimant  played  a  significant  role  in  the  Metropolitan  Police’s 
 
handling  of  that  extradition  request,  that  he  advised  on  and  influenced  Mr 
Berezovsky’s bail conditions; 

 
  Mr  Hunter,  the  claimant’s  long-standing  close  friend,  frequently  bragged  about 
having a contact within the Extradition Unit; 

 
just  before  the  ‘Noah’  payments  started  -  the  claimant  and  Mr  Hunter  had 
 
meetings; at the first meeting it was alleged that the claimant passed to Mr Hunter 
police intelligence concerning Mr Berezovsky and one of his associates, Mr Dubov,
--------
MRS JUSTICE NICOLA DAVIES DBE

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

including the fact that Mr Dubov would be arrested immediately if found in the UK 
and possibly held in custody; the claimant offered to update Mr Hunter in the future 
on the outcome of meetings involving his superiors; at the second meeting, he briefed 
Mr  Hunter  on  a  recent  meeting  between  police  officers  and  representatives  of  the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Crown Prosecution Service; 

 
the claimant told Mr Hunter to advise a particular named suspect as to how to 
 
avoid being sent to the UK, advice clearly prejudicial to the chances of apprehending 
 
and extraditing him; 
 

the  claimant’s  ‘number’  was  to  be  included  in  an  ISC  invoice  relating  to 

 
 
extradition matters i.e. ISC was invoicing for the claimant’s services. 

It  is  the  claimant’s  case  that  the  effect  of  the  plea  of  justification  was  to  accuse  the 
 
claimant  of  passing  confidential  police  intelligence,  derived  from  his  work  in  the 
 
Extradition Unit, to ISC, to the potential grave prejudice of policing interests. 

 
Meaning 

 
11.	 

 
12.	 

 

In May 2008, Eady J refused to strike out the defendant’s plea of justification holding that 
 
the meaning pleaded at paragraph 7 of the original Defence, namely that when the article 
 
was first published the claimant was the subject of an internal police inquiry and there 
were grounds which objectively justified such an inquiry, was a meaning which the article 
 
was capable of bearing. 

In  July  2013  at  a  hearing  before  Tugendhat  J,  the  parties  sought  a  ruling  upon  the 
meaning of the article.  The ruling [2013] EWHC 2182 (QB) at [25] determined that the 
 
meaning was: 

“that  there  were,  and  at  the  date  of  publication  of  the  article  online 
 
complained  of  there  continued  to  be,  strong  grounds  to  believe  that  the 
 
claimant:  
4.1  had  abused  his  position  as  a  police  officer  with  the  Metropolitan 
 
Police’s Extradition Unit by corruptly accepting £20,000 in bribes from 
 
some of Russia’s most wanted suspected criminals in return for selling to 
 
them  highly  confidential  Home  Office  and  police  intelligence  about 
attempts to extradite them to Russia to face criminal charges;  
4.2  had  thereby  committed  an  appalling  breach  of  duty  and  betrayal  of 
trust; 
4.3 had thereby also committed a very serious criminal offence” 

 
13.	 

The ruling by Tugendhat J resulted in the defendant considering its position.  In a letter to 
the claimant’s solicitors dated 1 October 2013 from the defendant’s legal manager it was 
 
stated:
--------

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

“TNL does not intend to amend its defence and will not be pursuing its 
 
defence of justification ….. ” 

No explanation for the abandonment of the defence was given in the letter, nothing was 
 
reported in The Times or on TimesOnline. 

 
14.	 

 
During this hearing Mr Rampton QC, on behalf of the defendant said that by reason of the 
ruling of Tugendhat J the defence of justification was no longer sustainable.  The result of 
 
the  defendant’s  late  abandonment  of  their  defence  is  that  no  remaining  defence  to  the 
 
action exists, it is now for the Court to assess damages in respect of the publication of the 
 
 
article on the TimesOnline website from 5 September 2007 until about 21 October 2009. 

 

 
Correspondence between the parties 

 
15.	 

On 20 December 2006 the claimant was informed that he was authorised to return to 
work in the Extradition Unit, that the investigation had concluded and that there was 
 
“no  evidence”  to  support  any  of  the  allegations  which  had  been  made  against  him. 
 
The claimant was not given a copy of the report of the investigations, he was told of 
 
its conclusion.  On 22 December 2006 the claimant’s solicitor wrote to Alistair Brett, 
the then Legal Manager of TNL.  The letter included the following: 

“As  a  result  of  your  journalists,  our  client  was  off  work  for  about  4 
months with work related stress until last August when he was allowed 
 
to  return  to  his  command  and  building  in  the  belief  and  expectation 
that our client had done nothing wrong, though this was to a specific 
 
project and not to his original duties.  However as at 20 December our 
client  has  been  authorised  to  return  to  his  original  duties  as  the 
investigation  has  concluded  that  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  any 
allegations of wrong doing on the part of our client, whether as alleged 
by yourselves or otherwise and he has been totally exonerated.  … 
Your  response  to  our  letter  dated  18  July  suggests  you  have  no 
intention of seeking to resolve this matter.  However in view of what is 
stated  above  we  are  prepared  to  give  you  a  final  opportunity  to 
 
reconsider  your  position  and  adhere  to  our  client’s  demands.    If 
however we do not receive a satisfactory response by 8 January 2007 
we shall instruct counsel to settle the proceedings……” 

 
16.	 

By a reply dated 11 January 2007 Alistair Brett responded: 

“I  refer  to  your  letter  of  22  December  2006  and  would  respond  as 
follows.  First,  I  am  utterly  amazed  that  you  state  that  the  police 
investigation into your client has now “concluded”.  I was certainly led 
to understand that the investigation was likely to go on well into this 
year  –  with  detailed  examination  of  seized  computer  material  from 
 
RISC’s officers’ and unlikely to conclude until the early summer.  We 
 
do  know  that  your  client  is  only  recently  returned  to  the  Extradition 
Squad, but as we understand it, he is on restricted duties and therefore

not doing his original job as the earlier restrictions have been varied 
but not lifted.  If, contrary to our understanding, the investigation has 
concluded  please  may  we 
the  conclusions  and  any 
recommendations  made  or  at  the  very  least  those  parts  which  are 
disclosable  and  relevant  to  your  client’s  complaints  against  The 
Times’ article in June last year.  …..” 

see 

The letter then deals in detail with the refusal of Mr Brett to accept that the original 
 
complaint which led to the investigation had emanated from The Times.  The letter 
concluded: 

“… you now try and maintain that the investigation into your client is 
concluded and that he has been “totally exonerated”.  Well if this is the 
 
case, please may we have a copy of the official form stating that there 
will be no further action against your client and that he is no longer the 
subject  of  an  investigation  that  may  lead  to  criminal  or  disciplinary 
 
charges. 
 
As I have always made clear in on-going investigations of this kind, 
The  Times  is  always  happy  to  carry  a  report  on  the  outcome  of  an 
investigation but The Times will not prejudge a matter, which should 
be  left  to  the  Directorate  Professional  Standards.    To  do  otherwise 
would be entirely wrong and for your client to issue proceedings now 
when  an  investigation  is  still  ongoing  would  again  be  entirely 
premature and leave your client exposed to a serious costs order.  And, 
finally, might I add that threats of conducting litigation on a CFA basis 
cut no ice with this department. 
 

I hope the above makes The Times position clear. … ” 

The  first  paragraph  of  Mr  Brett’s  letter  demonstrates  that  The  Times  had  its  own 
source  which  it  still  appeared  to  be  using.    In  fact,  the  information  relating  to  the 
 
client’s restricted duties was wrong, he returned to work in the Extradition Unit on 
unrestricted duties. 

 
17.	 

The  DPS  report  is  dated  2  December  2006.    However,  it  was  not  until  September 
2007  that  the  claimant  received  formal  written  notification  of  the  result  of  the 
investigation on Form N163A which stated that the claimant had been informed by 
DCI Gary Crump that no formal disciplinary proceedings would be taken against him. 
 
On  4  September  2007  DCI  Crump  wrote  to  Mr  Gillard,  informing  him  “of  the 
conclusion of the investigation into the matters raised in the letter from your colleague 
Mr Calvert dated 27 April 2006”.  The letter stated: 

“….  Having  considered  all  of  the  available  information,  I  am  of  the 
 
opinion  now  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  proceed  with  any 
 
criminal prosecution.  I am also of the view that insufficient evidence 
exists  to  mount  any  internal  police  disciplinary  process.    …  An 
investigative  report  has  been  submitted  to  the  IPPC  who  have
--------

concluded that the investigation has been completed in a satisfactory 
manner and that the terms of reference have been met.  I am therefore 
formally notifying you that this investigation is now complete and that 
 
the officer implicated in it will not be subject to any further criminal or 
 
disciplinary process.  The officer will be notified of the result of this 
investigation immediately…..” 

 
18.	 

 
19.	 

On  31  May  2007,  the  claimant’s  solicitors  sent  by  way  of  service  to  Mr  Brett,  the 
Claim  Form  issued  on  behalf  of  the  claimant  in  order  to  preserve  his  position  in 
 
respect of the limitation period.  In his response Mr Brett asked for a copy of Form 
163A and took issue with the suggestion that the original complainant emanated from 
The Times or The Sunday Times. 

By early September 2007 both the claimant and TNL had received notification that 
 
the  investigation  into  the  claimant  had  been  concluded  by  DPS.    The  claimant’s 
solicitors wrote to Alistair Brett informing him of the outcome of the investigation. 
  
By a letter dated 14 September 2007, Mr Brett replied, the letter began: 

“Thank you for your letters of 5th and 10th September.  Last week, we 
also were notified by the DPS that the investigation into your claimant 
 
had  now  been  concluded  and  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to 
proceed  with  any  criminal  prosecution  or  internal  police  disciplinary 
process.  There  are  a  number  of  important  witnesses  who  DCI 
 
Crump’s  team  were  unable  to  speak  to  or  locate.    Surprisingly,  this 
includes  the  person  referred  to  in  The  Times  article  as  “the  ISC 
insider”.  Once again the DPS has confirmed in recent conversations 
 
with Mr Gillard that this person was in their words “the informant”, 
who had approached another part of the DPS earlier in 2006.  We will 
 
obviously have to approach these and other witnesses if we are unable 
to resolve this matter in accordance with the proposals set out below. 
… 
 
Moving on to what I would now call The Times’s Reynolds obligation 
 
to your client and carry a report of the findings of the DPS, I hope that 
what is now suggested will help resolve the current litigation with your 
 
client.  As you know, I have always made it clear that “The Times is 
always  happy  to  carry  a  report  on  the  outcome  of  an  investigation” 
(see my letter of 11 January this year).  … 

 

We  would  therefore  be  very  happy  to  carry  a  News  in  Brief  item 
which would along the following lines:- 
 

DS Gary Flood 

In  June  last  year  we  reported  that  anti-corruption  detectives  were 
 
investigating  DS  Flood  of  the  extradition  unit  because  of  allegations 
that he had made “unauthorised disclosures of information” to ISC a 
London based security firm in exchange for money.  ISC had a number
--------

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

of  Russian  clients  who  might  have  been  the  subject  of  extradition 
 
applications. 
 
 
The  Metropolitan  Police’s  Directorate  of  Professional  Standards  has 
now concluded its investigation of DS Flood and found that there is 
insufficient evidence to proceed with any criminal prosecution and DS 
Flood will not be subject to any disciplinary process.  … 
 
In  addition  to  this  follow-up  piece  reporting  the  outcome  of  the 
investigation into your client we would on a totally ex gratia basis be 
prepared  to  pay  your  client’s  reasonable  costs  to  date  on  a  standard 
basis and without any CFA uplift.  … 
 
I  hope  the  above  proposals  will  enable  both  parties  to  settle  this 
litigation  rapidly  now  and  without  further  expenditure  of  time  and 
effort.  If we cannot now resolve the litigation, this letter will of course 
be  relied  on  to  buttress  our  defence  of  Reynolds  qualify  of 
privilege….. 
 
If we cannot resolve the litigation sensibly we will obviously have to 
go back to the confidential source and the complainant to see if they 
 
are prepared to release Mr Gillard and The Times from their duties of 
 
confidentiality……” 

 
20. 

By a letter dated 24 September 2007 the claimant’s solicitors replied: 

“We write further to your letter dated 14 September.  The terms of a 
settlement set out in it are rejected.   
 
We  note  that  in  addition  to  our  letter  dated  5  September  enclosing 
form  163A  you  were  notified  by  the  DPS  that  the  investigation  into 
our client had now finished.  Police complaints procedure dictates that 
complainants have to be notified of the outcome of the investigations 
 
that occur because of their complaint.  You were notified because you 
were the complainants, as is confirmed by forms 163 and 163A.  The 
DPS does not update journalists on the outcome of internal complaints 
and  would  not  have  informed  you  of  the  outcome  unless  you  had 
instigated the investigation.  ….. 
 
Whilst  we  note  your  offer  to  report  the  outcome  of  the  MPS 
investigation,  your  proposed  wording  adds  insult  to  injury.    The 
investigation of our client came about as a result of your allegations, 
not  those  of  any  third  party  complainant.    The  investigation  did  not 
find  “there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  proceed  with  any  criminal 
prosecution”.  There  was  no  evidence  and  as  a  result,  “no  formal 
 
disciplinary proceedings will be taken against” our client. 
 
It has particularly distressed our client that The Times has taken the 
very  serious  step  of  relying  upon  a  defence  of  justification,  a  plea
--------
MRS JUSTICE NICOLA DAVIES DBE

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

which it has not resiled from and which it is stridently pursuing; your 
letter of 14 September makes it clear that you will vigorously pursue 
third  party  disclosure  relevant  to  it.  Not  only  has  this  plea 
substantially aggravated the distress caused to our client, it has made it 
imperative that a formal acceptance by The Times that the allegations 
 
made by it were untrue be published.  Accordingly, we do not consider 
the  wording  of  your  proposed  apology  to  be  acceptable;  in  fact  we 
consider it to be positively unhelpful. 
 
Our client would be happy to settle these proceedings, but to do so he 
 
will  require  proper  and  full  vindication  and  thus  needs  a  proper 
 
apology published with reasonable prominence, the payment of all his 
costs and payment of suitable damages …..” 

A draft of the apology was attached to the letter. 

 
21. 

The reply from Mr Brett is dated 28 September 2007: 

“I am sorry that my letter of 14 September has elicited nothing more 
 
than an outright rejection of what was meant to be a positive move to 
try  and  resolve  the  differences  between  your  client  and  Times 
Newspapers Limited. ….” 

 

Mr  Brett  reiterated  the  terms  of  the  notice  which  were  proposed  and  said  that  he 
would be “perfectly happy to consider any changes you would like to make to more 
acceptable to your client”.  He again took issue with a suggestion that The Times or 
one of its employees was the original complainant and continued: 

 

“… I therefore come back to my original offer of a follow-up report 
and a payment of your client’s reasonable legal costs to date on an ex 
gratia basis and in an attempt to resolve this matter before further costs 
 
are incurred.  If you really do not want a follow-up report to appear in 
the paper, you only have to say.  But please be under no illusion that 
your client’s counsel.  Bennett cannot then in any way hold it against 
Times  Newspapers  for  not  publishing  a  follow-up  report  when  this 
matter goes to trial and we rely, not only on a plea of justification but 
also a Reynolds qualified privileged defence. 
 
Finally,  if  your  client  wants  to  take  out  £115,500  worth  of  ATE 
insurance that is his business.  Given his knowledge of horses he will I 
am sure know more about gambling than me.  In any event threats of 
 
ATE insurance do not frighten me in the slightest as it is exactly what 
 
happened in the Miller case with Associated and Associated won that 
case and the Police Federation lost a stack of money.  …” 

 
22. 

In their response the claimant’s solicitors noted:

“You state that you are happy to consider any changes to the proposed 
follow up report.  We have made our suggested changes set out in our 
letter dated 24 September.  We assume they have been rejected …” 

 
23.	 

In his reply dated 2 October 2007, Mr Brett once again took issue with the identity of

“…. As regards the report of the outcome of the investigation into your 
 
client, which might appear in The Times, what I suggested in my last 
two letters is light years away from what you wanted in your letter of 
24 September which is headed “Apology” and goes on to assert there 
was  no  basis  or  truth  in  the  article  which  appeared  in  The  Times. 
 
Indeed what you wanted published and is attached to your letter of 24 
September is nothing more than an admission of liability and states at 
the  end  that  we  have  paid  your  client  “legal  costs  and  suitable 
compensation”. 
is  manifestly 
unacceptable  when  as  you  know  we  have  mounted  clear  Reynolds 
 
qualified privilege defence and made it clear that insofar as the article 
 
meant  that  your  client  was  the  subject  of  “an  internal  police 
investigation”  and  “there  were  grounds  which  supported  that  police 
investigation”, the article was true in substance and in fact.  … 
 
Can I ask once again, “do you want us to carry a report on the outcome 
 
of the investigation into your client along the lines of what I have sent 
you or not? ….”

Mr Brett then deals with allegations relating to Boris Berezovsky and states:  

“it should be remembered that the unexplained Home Office u-turn in 
granting Mr Berezovsky political asylum happened in the same period 
that the corrupt payments were made to “Noah”…..”

By a letter dated 2 October 2007 the claimant’s solicitors responded: 

“We  have  already  answered  your  questions  and  see  no  point  in 
continuing  this  correspondence. 
  The  matter  will  have  to  be 
determined by the court …” 

 
25.	 

The  matter  did  come  before  the  courts.    In  his  ruling  upon  the  Reynolds  defence, 
Tugendhat J stated in respect of this correspondence: 

“244  Each party was entitled to reject the form of words tendered by 
the other in correspondence.  The parties to a dispute are not obliged to 
settle  it,  and  may  choose  to  litigate.    But  the  risk  in  relation  to  the 
 
Reynolds public interest defence lay on TNL, and not on the Claimant. 
 
It is for a defendant to make good his defence.  It may well be good 
practice to seek to agree a form of follow-up publication in a case such

as this.  But if there is no agreement, then the publisher must take his 
own course, and then defend it if he can at trial.  He cannot offer the 
 
claimant  a  form  of  words  which  the  claimant  refuses  to  accept,  and 
 
then  rely  on  that  refusal  to  relieve  him  of  the  obligation  of  acting 
 
responsibly  and  fairly,  at  least  when  the  claimant's  refusal  is 
reasonable, as it was here. 
 
245  The  upshot  is  that  in  relation  to  the  website,  TNL  has  not  put 
forward  anything  to  show  that  the  continued  website  publication, 
without  any  updating  or  correction,  met 
the  requirements  of 
responsible journalism as time went by.  … 
 
246  Some of the factors that applied in relation to the print publication 
on 2 June 2006 apply to the website publications since then.  But there 
have been significant developments since then.  After September 2007 
TNL  knew  that  there  had  been  an  investigation  which  had  been 
completed, and the outcome of it.  The status of the information had 
therefore changed for the worse (Reynolds Factor 5).  On 5 November 
2008 TNL obtained copies of documents from IPCC, as set out above. 
 
No evidence adverse to the Claimant’s case has come to light from any 
of  the  further  investigations  to  which  Mr  Brett  was  referring  in  his 
letter of 14 September 2007.  TNL can no longer state that the website 
publication  includes  a  fair  representation  of  the  Claimant’s  case 
(Reynolds Factor 8).  His case now includes the favourable outcome to 
the investigation. 
 
247  Nor can TNL rely on any of the public interest factors which they 
relied on in relation to the print publication (Reynolds Factor 2).  And 
Mr Rampton has not advanced any other.  As already mentioned, one 
of  the  principal  points  of  public  interest  advanced  for  the  print 
publication  was  that  Michael  Gillard’s  purpose  was  to  call  for  an 
 
investigation, and, when he learnt that there was one, to ensure that it 
proceeded  in  a  timely  fashion.    That  purpose  had  been  fulfilled  to 
 
TNL’s  knowledge  by  14  September  2007,  and  The  Times  has  not 
continued  to  call  for  an  investigation,  or  otherwise  explain  the 
continuing public interest in the website publications. 
 
248  A further factor is that the plea of justification is limited, as set 
out above.  It may or may not succeed.  Even if it succeeds, that would 
be  consistent  with  the  Claimant  being  entirely  innocent.    The  most 
recent  circumstance 
the  original  print 
publication  is  that  the  Claimant  and  Mr  Hunter  have  given  the 
evidence  I  have  summarised  above,  and  that  they  were  asked  no 
questions at all.  This will be relevant to any relief to be granted, and 
any further complaint the Claimant may make as to future publication 
 
on the website.  But it also goes to the care that a responsible publisher 
should  take  to  verify  the  information  published  ...  TNL  do  not 
 
challenge  the  Claimant's  evidence,  but  neither  do  they  act  as  a 
 
responsible publisher would act when faced with such evidence.  TNL 
have been aware of the Claimant's case, and his evidence, prior to trial

in the usual way, but have shown no response to it, such as would be 
 
appropriate to such unchallenged evidence. 
 
249  I reach the same conclusion in this case as the Court of Appeal 
reached in Loutchansky at para 79.  The failure to remove the article 
from the website, or to attach to the articles published on The Times 
website  a  suitable  qualification,  cannot  possibly  be  described  as 
responsible journalism.  It is not in the public interest that there should 
continue  to  be  recorded  on  the  internet  the  questions  as  to  the 
Claimant's honesty which were raised in 2006, and it is not fair to him. 
  
It is not in the public interest for the reasons given by Lord Nicholls in 
Reynolds at p201 cited in para 207 above.” 

 
26.	 

Tugendhat J’s comments at paragraph 249 were adopted by Lord Neuberger MR at 
[2010] EWCA Civ 804 [78]: 

“On the face of it, that conclusion appears to be not merely one which 
the judge was entitled to reach: it was plainly right, and indeed appears 
to be consistent with the decision of this court in Loutchansky …  If 
the  original  publication  of  the  allegations  made  against  DS  Flood  in 
the article on the website had been, as the judge thought, responsible 
journalism,  once 
the  Reports  conclusions  were  available,  any 
responsible journalist would appreciate that those allegations required 
speedy withdrawal or modification.  Despite this, nothing was done.” 

Lord Neuberger MR also adopted what the judge had said at paragraph 244 subject to 
a qualification which he identified thus [81]: 

 

“…. The only qualification I would make to that last analysis relates to 
the last sentence.  The fact that the claimant’s refusal is unreasonable 
will, save perhaps in the most unusual circumstances, not be enough to 
 
justify  the  defendant  doing  nothing  if  responsible  journalism  would 
otherwise  require  him  to  retract  or  modify  a  website  publication  if 
further relevant information comes to light.  The essential point is that 
it is for a defendant to decide on the appropriate course to take.  As 
 
well as being contrary to the principle, it seems to me to be literally 
 
adding insult to injury to enable a defendant to require a claimant, after 
new evidence has come to light, to agree a form of words to amend a 
publication which is defamatory of him but against which he cannot 
protect himself in law, so as to ensure he still cannot protect himself 
against it in law.” 

At  [82]  Lord  Neuberger  stated  that  it  is  “fanciful”  to  suggest  that  the  claimant’s 
solicitors  were  adopting  an  unreasonable  attitude  in  the  correspondence  to  the 
defendant’s  proposal.  At  [83]  he  identified  the  “consistent  position”  as  being  that 
what TNL were offering did not go far enough.

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

The trial of the Reynolds defence took place in July 2009, judgment being given in 
 
October  2009.  Correspondence  between  the  claimant’s  solicitors  and  Mr  Brett  on 
behalf of TNL continued from October 2007 up to trial and thereafter.  In addition to 
the Reynolds defence, TNL were vigorously pursuing a defence of justification, the 
nature and extent of which is set out in paragraphs 8 – 10 above.  The correspondence 
which emanated from Mr Brett during this period has properly been conceded to be 
“aggressive”  and  “unpleasant”  by  Mr  Rampton  QC.    On  occasion,  it  was  also 
unnecessary.  The  pleaded  defence  of  justification  alleged  that  the  claimant  needed 
money  by  reason  of  his  gambling.    Notwithstanding  the  limit  of  the  pleading,  in 
correspondence, Mr Brett pursued the sensitive issue of the IVF treatment undertaken 
by the claimant and his wife.  The intrusive and aggressive approach of Mr Brett upon 
an unpleaded issue of particular sensitivity is encapsulated in an extract from a letter 
written by him dated 29 November 2007: 

“… I must therefore insist on full disclosure of all documents relating 
 
to the IVF treatment, invoices, cheques, bank statements around this 
time in 2001 and 2002 etc as the treatment is on any basis extremely 
expensive …” 

 
28.	 

By reason of the concession made by Mr Rampton QC it is unnecessary to set out any 
further correspondence in this judgment.  The claimant, quite properly, was being sent 
all this correspondence by his solicitors in order for him to comment upon the same.   

 
29.	 

At the trial in July 2009, the claimant and Mr Hunter gave evidence.  Their evidence 
was unchallenged.  In the middle of the trial The Times reported the matter thus: 

“Times Defends “police cover-up” libel action

focusing  on  Mr  Flood  and  ISC  Global  Limited,  a  London-based 
security firm.  Mr Flood’s action is against Times Newspaper Limited, 
which will argue that the article was in the public interest.  The hearing

In his written evidence, Alistair Brett, stated that there were 763 visits to the web page 
during  the  relevant  period  and  estimates  that  the  number  originating  from  this 
jurisdiction to be in the order of 549.  The claimant accepts these figures.   Mr Brett 
noted that there was a spike in hits (33) on 16 July 2009 in the middle of the Reynolds 
trial, which he infers were triggered by legal activity.  This is disputed by the claimant 
who  contends  that  the  lawyers  and  others  involved  in  the  litigation  had,  for  a 
considerable time, their own copies of the articles as well as copies in trial bundles. 
 
The claimant relies on the fact that the search was due to the report of the trial in The 
Times  published  on  that  day  which  it  describes  as  unbalanced  and  unfair.    Neither 
party suggests that for the purpose of this trial it is necessary to identify with exact 
 
precision the number of visits to the relevant website.  Sufficient for these purposes is 
the fact that it is no less than 500 and no more than 550.  The “vast bulk” of online 
hits  apparently  came  from  readers  accessing  the  website  through  Google.    It  is  the 
claimant’s  case  that  this  indicates  that  the  visits  were  by  persons  with  a  particular 
interest  in  the  claimant  and  the  subject  which  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  online 
publications  are  particularly  damaging.    Print  publication  is  said  to  be  ephemeral 
whereas  website  publications  remain,  and  are  a  resource,  for  people  who  wish  to 
make checks.  Thus, as was noted by Tugendhat J, an old defamatory publication may 
permanently blight a person’s prospects.  It is the claimant’s case that the tendency of 
defamatory material of this kind to “percolate” is significant. 
 

The claimant’s evidence  
 

32.	  Witness statements from the claimant and one from his wife were before the court. 

 

 

The claimant also gave evidence. 

 
33.	 

The claimant joined the Police Force in January 1983, initially as a uniformed police 
constable.  In 1988 he was selected to be a detective, in 1990 he passed his Sergeant’s 
examination and in 1993 joined the Regional Crime Squad.  He became a detective on 
the Murder Investigation Team (South) and was promoted to Detective Sergeant.  In 
December 2001 he joined the Extradition Unit.

During the course of the claimant’s career he received numerous commendations for 
investigative  ability,  case  preparation  and  leadership.    In  the  period  following  his 
appointment to the Extradition Unit the following commendations were received: 

January  2005  –  Director  of  FBI,  Robert  Mueller,  commendation  for 
international co-operation in locating and arrest of Welsh and Trasher, 
wanted on FBI most wanted. 
 
January  2007  –  Letter  of  thanks  and  appreciation  from  Richard 
 
Bradley,  head  of  Home  Office  Judicial  co-operation  unit,  for  “the 
 
highly efficient and professional manner” in the planning of four co-
ordinated arrests of suspected Rwandan war criminals.

August 2008 – Letter of thanks and praise for professionalism in the

The  claimant  was  acknowledged  as  the  leading  expert  in  extradition  in  the  Police 
Service by peers and stakeholders (the Home  Office,  CPS,  court and counsel).  He 
was the author of, or contributed to, MPS responses to legislation, in this country and 
Europe.  He was a member of numerous Home Office working parties into various 
aspects of the extradition process and was the reference point for the Anti Terrorist 
Unit for terrorist extradition requests.   The claimant’s annual appraisals for 2002 until 
2009  identified  the  high  regard  within  which  he  was  held  within  the  MPS.    The 
claimant retired from the MPS on 1 March 2013. 

 

The claimant confined his evidence to the damage caused since 5 September 2007. 
The matter consumed over seven years of his life, the period has been stressful not 
only for himself but for his wife and the consequent strains on their marriage.  They 
have  lived  on  tenterhooks  with  the  threat  of  bankruptcy  and  with  the  constant 
aggression from The Times.  Taking on such a huge organisation as The Times, which 
“gives no ground” has left both of them feeling battered and bruised.  The Times has 
“attacked”  him  throughout  with  the  “double-barrels”  of  Reynolds  and  justification. 
The Times has done everything possible to try to discover evidence to support their 
defences including specific disclosure applications against the MPS and the IPCC. 

 

 

From  5  September  2007  until  21  October  2009  one  of  the  “most  respected  and 
influential newspapers” in the country made incredibly serious allegations against the 
claimant to the effect there were strong grounds to believe that he was corrupt.  The 
newspaper stood by the allegations that he most probably accepted bribes in exchange 
for selling confidential information which he learned from his job in the Extradition 
 
Unit and that by so doing he had committed a very serious criminal offence. 

As to the Update, whilst The Times published a summary of the conclusions of DCI 
Crump, it did not accept them, it continued to assert that the article was true.  The 
article on the website does not even record now that The Times has acknowledged (at 
least in private) that the justification defence will not be pursued at trial.

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

A  police  officer  was  what  the  claimant  had  wanted  to  be.    It  had  always  been  an 
important part of his life, the position and respect which he built up in the Extradition 
 
Unit were particularly important to him, he felt that he had really achieved something 
in his life.  Being a police officer and respected as such is a really important part of 
his identity. 
 

Having  spent  years  building  a  reputation  as  an  expert  in  extradition,  the  claimant 
believed that his work and reputation were wiped out by the allegations in The Times. 
  
He was terrified that after years of building trust and relationships with stakeholders, 
 
they would believe the allegations and those relationships would  be destroyed.  He 
 
has  since  felt  the  need  to  defend  himself  in  conversations  with  other  detectives,  to 
explain that he was completely exonerated and that he was suing The Times.  When 
meeting people he is unsure whether they have read the article or not, even comments 
which may have been intended to be light hearted have upset him.  By the date of the 
first  trial  in  July  2009  the  claimant’s  evidence  was  that  he  was  paranoid  and 
untrusting and tending to avoid people.  The result of The Times’s action has had a 
long term detrimental effect on his health and marred his enjoyment of much of his 
life.  He has been distressed to see that his wife has been upset, he feels responsible 
for this. 

The  DPS  investigation  was  extremely  thorough,  his  home  was  searched,  items 
 
including his computer were taken away and examined, he granted access to all of his 
financial records.  The claimant believed that once the investigation was completed he 
would be exonerated.  He had hoped that The Times would accept that the allegations 
 
which it had made were untrue.  Even if it did not do so, the claimant believed The 
 
Times would publish the outcome of the DPS investigation.  The apology offered by 
his  solicitors  was  reasonably  worded.    The  claimant  was  shocked  by  The  Times’ 
refusal to publish the result of the DPS investigation. 

The claimant felt that The Times was trying to use his exoneration against him as a 
“bargaining  chip”.    The  manner  in  which  The  Times  continued  to  litigate  after 
 
September  2007  was  “particularly  nasty”.    The  Times  set  about  trying  to  find 
justification  (evidence)  from  just  about  anywhere  it  could.    Particularly  distressing 
was  the  pursuit  by  The  Times  for  information  relating  to  the  IVF  treatment.    The 
claimant  found  it  extremely  distressing  to  have  to  go  over  the  facts  concerning  the 
IVF treatment including the fact of a miscarriage and it seemed to him there was no 
point  other  than  to  make  his  life  as  difficult  as  possible.    In  a  letter  dated  29 
November 2007 Mr Brett demanded disclosure of all the claimant’s financial records 
and also suggested that he was a drunk and a gambler.  The claimant said he does 
gamble,  it  is  not  illegal  and  is  not  a  problem  for  him,  he  has  never  had  gambling 
debts.  He rarely drinks alcohol. 

 

The Times made applications against the MPS and the IPCC for documents relevant 
to the investigation.  These documents were received by The Times on 5 November 
 
2008, none supported its case on justification.  The Times was given a copy of DCI 
Crump’s Report.  Even in possession of these documents, The Times did not update 
the  article.    It  was  awful  to  see  such  a  powerful  organisation  behaving  so

hypocritically,  there  was  nothing  the  claimant  could  do  but  press  on  with  his 
defamation claim.  One particularly difficult matter arising from the conduct of The 
Times was that the claimant’s exoneration by the DPS was seriously undermined by 
the continued publication of the article after 5 September 2007.  Anyone who knew 
that the claimant was saying that he had been exonerated would have wondered why 
The Times was still publishing the article in its original form and why it did not report 
the fact of exoneration.  Most people who read the article would not have known that 
he had been exonerated by the DPS investigation 

 
44.	 

 
45.	 

 
46.	 

The claimant identified a number of instances which have occurred as a result of the 
article  being  published.  Some  pre-date  5  September  2007  and  were  in  a  different 
 
jurisdiction,  however,  they  demonstrate  how  people  he  has  met  have  looked  at  the 
website article.  After 5 September 2007 the claimant was anxious that people were 
continuing to do this both before and after meeting him.  In January 2006 the claimant 
arrested Neil Entwistle for the murder of his wife and child on behalf of the USA.  It 
was a case which received a great deal of media interest.  In November 2007 the lead 
investigator  informed  the  claimant  that  the  Assistant  District  Attorney  wanted 
confirmation from a senior officer that the claimant had been exonerated, that he was 
 
telling the truth about the allegations against him having been false.  The investigator 
noted that the article was still online which is where he had read it.  The senior officer 
wrote  to  the  Assistant  District  Attorney  clarifying  that  what  the  claimant  said  was 
correct and that he had been exonerated.  The claimant gave evidence at the trial in 
America and prior to it learnt that the prosecution had disclosed to the defence the 
 
allegations that had been made against him. 
 

In August 2008 the claimant learnt that one of the organisers of the FBI Charity Golf 
Tournament  had  read  the  article  online  and  as  a  result  he  did  not  attend  the 
 
tournament  in  2009.    He  recently  returned  to  it  in  2013  having  waited  until  his 
retirement  before  reattending.    In  November  2008,  when  the  claimant  and  his  wife 
were  staying  in  Vermont  for  a  short  break,  a  conversation  with  the  owner  of  the 
property at which they were staying led to the owner Googling the claimant as a result 
of  which  he  remarked  to  the  claimant  that  he  could  see  why  he  needed  a  relaxing 
 
break. 

 

In April 2009 the claimant was moved from the Extradition Unit to an attachment at 
 
Charing Cross Police Station, undertaking a project to look into wanted suspects and 
how to find them.  It was the claimant’s belief that he was seen to have been moved 
“under  a  cloud”.  Three  police  officers  who  had  been  asked  to  work  for  him 
subsequently told the claimant that they had searched the internet and read the article. 
 
The claimant described that as unpleasant and undermining.  The claimant states that 
he  has  no  doubt  that  a  large  number  of  police  officers  in  the  MPS  and  others  who 
know him will have read the article since September 2007 and that it will remain a 
hindrance  to  his  reputation  and  career. 
In  April  2009  he  had  to  inform  his  line 
manager and senior officers of the continuing defamation proceedings, these being the 
officers who would decide his suitability for promotion to inspector.

The claimant was told in December 2006 that he had been exonerated by the police 
investigation  and  the  IPCC.  He  thought  this  came  from  DCI  Haynes  when  he 
returned to work in the Extradition Unit.  He believed he was told by DCI Haynes that 
there was no evidence against him.  He thought DCI Haynes genuinely welcomed him 
back.  The claimant was pleased to be back at work and overjoyed to return to the 
Extradition Unit.  In April 2009 he was moved away from the Unit, he was told that 
the Police Authority wanted to take him away from the high pressure of extradition 
work at a time when he was involved in this litigation.  In the police, as in life, there is 
a culture of “no smoke without fire” which continues to exist. 

 
48.	 

 
49.	 

The  claimant  described  The  Times  as  demonstrating  “arrogance”  in  disputing  the 
findings of the investigation.  He had been worn down and felt “bullied”, in particular 
by the conduct of Mr Brett as demonstrated in the correspondence.  The “attacks” by 
Alistair Brett he described as “vicious”.  The claimant read the first paragraph of Mr 
 
Brett’s letter of 14 September 2007 as indicating that Mr Brett was not happy with the 
police  investigation  and  that  The  Times  would  delve  and  make  enquiries  to  find 
further evidence.  This affected the way in which the claimant regarded The Times’ 
offer of a follow-up notice.  The refusal by The Times to publish the update sought by 
his solicitors accompanied by what he described as threats if he did not settle were, in 
the mind of the claimant, clearly directed to an intent on the part of The Times to try 
and undermine the police investigation.  His fear was that the investigation by The 
Times  following  his  exoneration  by  the  police  might  trigger  another  police 
investigation 

 

The claimant found the investigation pursued by Alistair Brett to be worse than the 
 
police investigation because he knew there was no truth in the allegation but he did 
not come out of it as quickly as he could.  The matter overtook his own and his wife’s 
life.  It is now over six years since he was exonerated and he is still waiting for an 
 
apology  from  The  Times.    The  Update  placed  in  October  2009  did  not  include  an 
acceptance by The Times that there was no truth in the allegation.  The Update did not 
say  that  The  Times  was  agreeing  with  the  result  of  the  police  investigation.    The 
police had completely exonerated the claimant but he had nowhere to direct people to 
see that he had been exonerated. 

 
50.	 

In  October  2007  the  claimant  and  his  wife  applied  for  adoption  which  had  been 
delayed until he had been formally exonerated.  The process which took a further two 
years was successful.  At no time during that process had he received any hint from 
anyone within the Social Services that their minds had been affected by The Times 
 
article.

the  way  in  which  he  was  treated  by  the  lawyer  who  worked  for  The  Times,  the 
claimant became particularly angry when he received letters from the lawyer because 
they often made false accusations against him and he felt that the lawyer was trying to 
 
intimidate him.  As to the adoption process, Mrs Flood states that both she and the 
claimant were in constant fear that the adoption personnel would discover details of 
the case and would not allow them to continue with the process.  Mrs Flood describes 
her husband as being “absolutely desperate for public recognition of the fact that he is 
not  guilty  of  the  charge  that  The  Times  made  against  him”.    The  claimant  was 
devastated when The Times did not report what DCI Crump had found, namely, that 
the allegations against Gary were untrue. 

Damages 
 

 
52.	 

The  authority  of  Cairns  v  Modi  [2013]  1  WLR  1015  CA  identifies  the  following 
points of law and practice: 

The three interlocking purposes of an award of damages in defamation cases are to: 
 
compensate  for  the  damage  to  the  claimant’s  reputation;  vindicate  his  good  name; 
take account of the distress, hurt and humiliation caused to him; 
 

 

The conventional ceiling for general damages is now of the order of £275,000.  This 
does not take account of the uplift consequential on the Jackson reforms, (which is 
inapplicable in this case); 

 

Conduct  or  aggravation  on  the  part  of  the  defendant  is  reflected  in  compensatory 
damages where it causes additional hurt to the claimant’s feelings, or, in the context 
of vindication, injury to his reputation, over and above that caused by the publication 
itself; 
 
Vindication involves not merely compensation for past or future losses, but “in case 
the libel, driven underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date, [the 
claimant] must be able to point to a sum awarded by [the Court] sufficient to convince 
a bystander of the baselessness of the charge”; 
 
There  is  no  general  principle  that  there  is  a  reduced  need  for  vindication  once  a 
 
reasoned  judgment  has  been  given  at  the  conclusion  of  a  trial.    It  is  unlikely  that 
readers of a web article will download the judgment and read it with close attention. 
The general public is concerned to discover the “headline” result; 

 

 

 
The  Judge  will  normally  arrive  at  a  global  figure  by  way  of  award,  rather  than 
splitting the award into conventional figures for injury to feelings. 

The claimant’s case 
 

 
Responsible  public  journalism  can  be  conducted  with  consideration  for  the  subject. 
 
The  claimant  was  an  experienced  police  officer  of  impeccable,  indeed  outstanding, 
record and service.  He had the misfortune to be caught up in the scheming of an ISC 
insider who had an axe to grind who spoke anonymously both to the journalists and to

the  police.    The  evidence  at  the  Reynolds  trial  suggested  that  the  person  was  Mr 
Hunter’s former partner at ISC. 

 
54.	 

 
55.	 

 

During the course of the police investigation the claimant was inevitably going to be 
under  stress  but  throughout  he  had  the  hope  and  confidence  that the police inquiry 
would clear him reasonably quickly.  What he could not have expected was TNL’s 
attitude when he was cleared.  From that point it became a fight for his reputation and 
vindication.  TNL refused to cease publishing the article complained of on the website 
and did not report the fact that the claimant was cleared by the police investigation.  It 
did  not  even  qualify  the  article  with  any  hint  that  the  investigation  was  over.    The 
update that it offered was conditional on the claimant settling on TNL’s terms backed 
up by what are described as threats undermining the conclusion of the police inquiry. 

TNL persisted in a defence of justification which made allegations of the most serious 
kind  against  a  police  officer.    For  this  reason  the  distress,  hurt,  stress  and  anxiety 
caused to the claimant by the publication and by TNL’s conduct in the period after the 
cut  off  point  can  fairly  be  said  to  be,  if  anything,  greater  than  that  for  the  period 
before the cut off point notwithstanding the much larger numerical distribution of the 
article complained of in the earlier period.  The injury to reputation was particularly 
 
serious because readers of TimesOnline were misled as to the status of the inquiry and 
led to suppose that there was still strong grounds to believe that the claimant was a 
corrupt  officer  and  a  criminal.    The  facts  were  deliberately  withheld  from  readers. 
  
TNL  was  undermining  the  exoneration  of  the  claimant  in  the  inquiry  and  as  the 
correspondence  and  the  Re-Re-Amended  Defence  demonstrates,  doing  so  with  its 
 
eyes open.  Hence the need for vindication is significantly greater in respect of the 
 
period after the cut off date. 

 

 
56.	 

Persistence in a plea of justification can increase damages, Rantzen v Mirror Group 
Newspapers Ltd [1994] QB 670 Neill LJ at 683: 

“… It is easy to see that a contest which involves justification or fair 
 
comment may increase the injury and add greatly to the anxiety caused 
by  the  proceedings  which  the  plaintiff  has  had  to  bring  to  clear  his 
 
name.” 

 
57.	 

In this case the defence of justification went beyond merely supporting a meaning to 
the  effect  that  there  had  been,  during  the  course  of  the  police  investigation, 
 
objectively  reasonable  grounds  for  the  police  to  investigate.    TNL  felt  no  scruple 
about holding over the claimant the threat of further investigations to undermine the 
 
conclusion of the police investigation in order to push the claimant into settling on 
TNL’s  term.  There  has  been  no  attempt  to  express  any  regret  for  the  anxiety  and 
stress which the claimant has suffered as a result of this matter hanging over him for 
some years. 

Vindication

58.	 

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

 

 
The  claimant  is  entitled  to  be  vindicated  to  the  extent  that  the  defence  of  privilege 
fails.  It is in the nature of a privileged publication that a claimant who may be wholly 
 
innocent  is  deprived  of  any  means  of  vindicating  his  reputation.    Described  by  Mr 
Price QC on behalf of the claimant as “the price a claimant pays in cases where the 
court  judges  that  the  public  interest  in  publication  must  prevail”  it  is  accepted  that 
damages  will  be  awarded  only  for  the  effects  of  the  unprivileged  publication.    In 
Underhill v Corser [2010] EQHC 1195 (QB) Tugendhat J held that the bulk of the 
 
distribution of a society’s magazine (443 copies) seriously defamatory of the claimant 
 
was privileged but the publication to about 13 readers was not.  On the basis of the 
judge’s findings as to the minimal extent of unprivileged publication, the defendant 
 
submitted that continuance of the action was an abuse of process but counsel for the 
 
claimant contended that as the aim of the proceedings was vindication that could be 
achieved in a claim based on publication to 13 publishees.  The judge held that the 
allegation  complained  of  was  so  serious  that  it  was  a  proportionate  step  for  the 
claimant to proceed with the claimant in respect of 13 or so readers 

 
59.	 

 
60.	 

There is a particular need for vindication arising from TNL’s persistence in the charge 
 
and  its  failure  to  inform  its  readers  of  the  outcome  of  the  investigation  after  the 
claimant  had  achieved  what  should  have  been  vindication  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
police inquiry.  TNL has never acknowledged that the claimant is innocent.  As such a 
“proper” sum by way of damages is required to vindicate the claimant.  It is accepted 
that  the  damages  must  be  proportionate  to  the  publication  which  gives  rise  to  the 
 
wrong and the claim. 
 

Further, the claimant contends that it is necessary to have regard to the proper and 
necessary  deterrent  effect  of  a  substantial  award  of  compensatory  damages  on 
newspapers which “ride roughshod over the rights of other citizens”.  Gleaner Co Ltd 
 
v  Abrahams  [2004]  1AC  628  per  Lord  Hoffmann  at  [53].    TNL  succeeded  in 
 
defending  publication  of  the  article  complained  of  up  to  5  September  2007  by 
establishing that reporting the police investigation into the claimant and naming him 
was  public  interest  journalism.    If  there  was  a  public  interest  in  reporting  the 
investigation there must be a public interest in reporting its result and it is elementary 
fairness to the subject to do so.  The meaning which TNL sought to justify related 
only to the existence of grounds objectively justifying the investigation.  Continuing 
to publish the story without qualification is not responsible journalism, it is not in the 
 
public interest and it is unfair to the claimant. 

The defendant’s case 
 

The failure by the defendant in allowing the original article to remain unamended on 
its  website  was  the  result  of  a  misjudgement  engendered,  at  least  in  part,  by  the 
attitude of the claimant to the defendant’s proposal that the article should be amended.  
The correspondence in September/October 2007 demonstrates that the defendant was 
willing to publish an update.  It did not do so because it reasonably understood that 
 
the  claimant  did  not  want  one.    The  defendant  initially  saw  the  outcome  of  DCI 
 
Crump’s investigation in September 2007 as a peg on which to attempt to settle the 
proceedings, the correspondence demonstrates that the discussion evolved, and, by 2

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

 
October 2007, the defendant was offering to publish an update outside the ambit of 
any  settlement  negotiations.    The  claimant’s  solicitors  told  the  defendant  in  clear 
 
terms that he did not want an update.  Moreover, at this stage of the proceedings the 
defendant  had  a  good  defence  of  Reynolds  privilege.  As  to  the  Court  of  Appeal’s 
 
criticism  of  the  position  the  defendant  took  in  this  correspondence,  that  has  to  be 
understood  in  the  context  of  its  decision  that  the  Reynolds  defence  failed  for  this 
 
period.  The  mitigation  of  damages  is  very  different  from  the  principles  governing 
responsible journalism which was the issue before the Court of Appeal. 

There was no obligation on the part of TNL to publish an apology.  If a defendant 
advances  the  defence  of  Reynolds  privilege,  seeks  and  obtains  the  response  of  the 
claimant to the allegations then there is an obligation to publish that response.  The 
claimant’s full denial was published in the article, there are no grounds upon which it 
can be said the lack of apology aggravates damages. 

The defendant’s failure to publish an update has left it exposed to the claim by the 
 
claimant.  That is a claim for such harm to the claimant’s reputation and feelings as 
 
the court may think additional but limited publication is likely to have caused.  The 
defendant’s failure to publish an update is not, and cannot be, an aggravating feature 
 
justifying any additional or greater award of damages, unless there is a feature of this 
failure which aggravates the claimant’s feelings. 
 

Advancing  and  persisting  in  a  plea  of  justification  is  not,  of  itself  aggravating 
conduct, even if the defence fails or was found to be weak.  Oriental Daily Publisher 
Ltd  v  Ming  Pao  Holdings  Ltd  [2012]  HKCFA  59  [2013]  EMLR  7  at  [132]. 
 
Compensatory  damages  can  take  into  account  matters  which  could  amount  to 
aggravation, for example, the defendant’s conduct of the action John v MGN ante at 
607H.  Whether categorised as aggravation or compensation for injury to feelings, the 
type  of  behaviour  for  which  a  claimant  can  recover  damages  is  any  “high-handed, 
oppressive or contumelious behaviour which increased the mental pain and suffering 
caused by the defamation”; McCarey v Associated Newspapers Ltd in (No.2) [1965] 2 
QB 86 per Pearson LJ at 104G.  It is denied that the defendant exhibited behaviour 
which could be described in these terms. 

It is accepted that the correspondence emanating from Mr Brett was aggressive and 
unpleasant  however,  what  Mr  Brett  was  doing  was  not  improper.    He  was  trying, 
legitimately, to find information to support a defence.  The information sought was 
 
the  material  which  an  investigating  officer  would  want  to  see  before  reaching  a 
conclusion.  The  pleading  of  justification  was  in  the  lowest  of  the  three  categories 
identified in Chase v Newsgroup Newspapers Limited [2003] ELMR 1 and accepted 
 
as such in 2008 by Eady J.  It was restricted to an assertion that the claimant’s conduct 
 
was being investigated by the police and that there were grounds which warranted that 
investigation.    The  defendant  has  never  contended  that  the  claimant  was  guilty  of 
corruption  or  any  wrongdoing.  The  limited  plea  of  justification  could  not  have 
 
permitted  an  “onslaught”,  in  court  or  on  paper,  upon  the  claimant’s  credibility 
 
directed to the issue of his guilt.  The amendments to the Defence were made without

objection  and  do  no  more  than  set  out  what  the  investigating  officer  would  have 
looked at in order to see if the claimant had received payments. 

 
66.	 

The size of the award of damages must reflect the circumstances and have regard to 
the constraints of necessity and proportionality.  Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers 
Ltd  [1994]  QB  670,  John  v  MGN  Ltd  [1997]  QB  586,  Cairns  v  Modi  ante.    This 
 
means  that  the  court  must  take  account  of  the  limited  nature  of  the  claim,  namely 
damages for the harm to the claimant’s reputation arising only from readers within 
this  jurisdiction  reading  the  article  on  the  website  between  5  September  2007  and 
about  21  October  2009  and  for  any  hurt  arising  from  those  publications  and  any 
aggravation of that hurt brought about by the conduct by the defendant. 

The claimant’s hurt and distress 
 

 
67.	 

It is accepted that the claimant suffered anxiety and hurt feelings.  These are a natural 
consequence of a defamatory publication and do not aggravate an award of damages. 
 
Described as noteworthy is the fact that in his evidence for the trial before Tugendhat 
J in July 2009 the claimant in his witness statement does not mention any additional 
distress caused by the lack of an update.  He gave extensive evidence of the distress 
he  suffered  in  April  2006  and  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  publication  of  the 
 
article.  Further much of the distress and hurt suffered by the claimant was caused not 
by the publication of the June 2006 article but by the police investigation into him that 
was initiated before that date. 

Damage to the claimant’s reputation 

 
68.	 

Principal  factors  said  to  affect  the  reputational  damage  of  any  publication  are  the 
extent  of  its  publication,  the  identity  of  the  publishees  and  the  gravity  of  the 
allegation.  It is accepted that the meaning found by Tugendhat J is “clearly serious” 
however the extent of the publication is said to be very limited and no publishee of 
any  importance  has  been  identified  by  the claimant.    There  is  no  good  evidence  to 
suggest that those whose opinion of the claimant mattered in the period 2007 to 2009 
was affected.  That would be the opinion of friends, colleagues, in the police, the CPS 
and the Home Office.  As to the number of users of the website, as a matter of general 
knowledge a hit does not equate to a unique user and the Court is invited to accept 
that both parties’ lawyers would have been among the website traffic.  By September 
2007 the article was over a year old and is likely to have receded from the first results 
page of a search engine.  This publication was at the opposite end of the scale from 
social media libels where the risk is that the allegation will go viral.  The claimant’s 
 
own  evidence  demonstrates  that  during  the  relevant  period  he  enjoyed  a  good 
reputation in the eyes of his superiors in the MPS whose opinions of his professional 
 
standing must be the most important.  He did not suffer any ongoing harm in respect 
of relations with other professionals outside the police. 

Vindication 

 
69.	 

It is accepted that the claimant is entitled to vindication.  Reliance is placed upon the 
judgments handed down in the course of litigating the Reynolds defence which state
--------
MRS JUSTICE NICOLA DAVIES DBE

Flood v Times Newspapers Ltd 

in terms that the claimant has been exonerated.  The meaning the defendant sought to 
defend as permitted by Eady J on 8 May 2008 was only that there were grounds to 
investigate him around the time of the original publication.  In Cairns v Modi ante at 
[32] the Court of Appeal observed that: 

“There  will  be  occasions  when  the  judgment  will  provide  sufficient 
vindication, but whether it does so is always a fact-specific question. 
 
The  judge  will  be  well  placed  to  assess  whether  the  terms  of  the 
judgment  do  indeed  provide  sufficient  vindication  in  the  overall 
context of the case.” 

Deterrence 

 
70.	 

There is nothing in this case which requires a deterrent award which could only be 
construed as punishment. 

Conclusion 

The conduct of the defendant 
 

It is possible to pursue journalism said to be in the public interest and demonstrate 
consideration for the subject whose reputation may suffer in the event of publication. 
The  need  for  such  consideration  is  particularly  acute  given  the  subject’s  lack  of 
redress.  Once it is known that there is material which exonerates, in whole or in part 
the  subject  of  the  journalistic  investigation,  consideration  should  be  shown  for  the 
 
position of the subject by publishing exculpatory material.  On the facts of this case 
no  such  consideration  was  demonstrated  by  TNL,  in  particular,  The  Times  and  its 
then Legal Manager Alistair Brett towards the claimant during the period 5 September 
2007 to 21 October 2009. 

The absence of consideration is compounded by the fact that the article published in 
June 2006 contained allegations which attacked the core of the claimant’s character, 
personally and professionally.  Of this experienced and responsible police officer, a 
recognised expert in his specialised field, it was being alleged that there were strong 
grounds  to  believe  that  he  was  dishonest,  corrupt  and  acting  in  a  manner  which 
represented not only serious criminal conduct but a grave breach of the trust which 
had been placed in him. 
 

In  my  view,  following  the  conclusion  of  the  police  investigation  the  claimant  was 
entitled to expect the defendant to amend the article and to publish, at the very least, 
the outcome of the investigation.  The fact that for two further years the claimant had 
to live with the article, publicly detailing allegations of dishonesty and corruption, of 
itself,  represents  a  need  for  proper  vindication.    I  do  not  accept  the  defence 
submission that the judgments handed down in the course of litigating the Reynolds 
 
defence  which  stated  that  the  claimant  had  been  exonerated  provided  sufficient

vindication.  The individual who wished to research the claimant and therefore access 
The Times website is unlikely to have found his or her way to one of these judgments 
and within it the fact of the exoneration. 

From 14 September 2007, TNL demonstrated an unwillingness to accept the findings 
 
of  the  police  investigation  and  persisted  in  its  own  pursuit  of  evidence.    Evidence 
which  could  serve  to  undermine  the  findings  of  the  investigation.    The  defendant’s 
 
stance is encapsulated in the first paragraph of Alistair Brett’s letter of 14 September 
2007 which states that witnesses, not seen during the police investigation, would have 
to be approached if the matter could not be settled on TNL’s terms.  From the outset 
Mr Brett linked the offer of an update to the article to settlement of the action. 

The defendants were pursuing a Reynolds defence.  It was submitted by Mr Rampton 
QC that at trial, by reason of the limited nature of that defence, the defendant would 
not be permitted to cross-examine the claimant as to his credibility or any “guilt” in 
respect of the allegation.  Whether such a course would have been permitted at trial it 
 
is a fact that the defendant’s pursuit of evidence went beyond the limited nature of the 
pleading  as  evidenced  by  the  insensitive  and  intrusive  demand  by  Mr  Brett  for 
financial details and documentation relating to the IVF treatment of the claimant and 
his wife.  It was not just the pursuit of evidence, it was the manner in which the same 
was  conducted.  When  the  concession  is  made  by  highly  experienced  Queen’s 
Counsel that the correspondence of the then Legal Manager of TNL was aggressive 
and unpleasant, that is a matter of which account should be taken by the court.  In his 
evidence  to  the  court  the  claimant  said  that  he  felt  bullied  by  Mr  Brett’s 
 
correspondence.  I accept his evidence. 

I  accept  that  the  cross-examination  of  the  claimant  in  these  proceedings  by  Mr 
 
Rampton QC, properly taking the necessary points, demonstrated both restraint and 
sensitivity.  The  claimant  was  not  cross-examined  in  the  2009  proceedings  before 
Tugendhat J.  Unhappily, the restraint demonstrated by Mr Rampton QC in court, is 
not  reflected  in  the  correspondence  nor  in  the  detailed  amendments  made  to  the 
original  Defence,  all  of  which  would  have  served  to  increase  the  anxiety  of  the 
claimant as to what he could face at trial and to his particular fear that the defendant’s 
 
conduct  would  lead  to  the  reopening  of  the  police  investigation.    I  accept  that  the 
aggressive conduct of the defendant’s case increased the distress and anxiety of the 
claimant.  I also accept that his fear that the same could lead to a reopening of the 
 
police investigation was reasonable in the circumstances. 

TNL were entitled to properly pursue a defence of justification.  However, the manner 
in which the defence was conducted went beyond merely supporting the pleaded case 
namely that there had been, during the course of the police investigation, objectively 
 
reasonable grounds for the police to investigation.  I accept the claimant’s contention 
that  TNL  felt  no  scruple  in  holding  over  the  claimant  the  threat  of  further 
investigations  to  undermine  the  conclusion  of  the  police  investigation  and  thus 
 
pressure the claimant into settling on TNL’s terms.

78.	  Mr Rampton QC describes the failure to provide an update as a “misjudgement”.  In 
my view, the course taken by the defendant goes beyond misjudgement, it represents 
a dogged refusal to take a course which was professional, responsible and fair.  It was 
devoid of any consideration for the position of the claimant.  The Times’ report of the 
 
proceedings  at  the  Reynolds  trial  on  16  July  2009,  set  out  in  paragraph  29  above, 
exemplifies the attitude of The Times, namely, its refusal to accept the findings of the 
police investigation and its continued reliance on the unamended article.  These facts 
underline the need in this case for proper vindication of the claimant.  The refusal, 
coupled  with  the  manner  in  which  The  Times  pursued  its  own  investigation  and 
sought  details  and  documentation  from  the  claimant,  can  properly  be  described  as 
 
oppressive  and  high  handed.  It  is  conduct  which  serves  to  aggravate  the  award  of 
 
damages. 

The claimant’s hurt and distress 
 

 
79.	 

 
80.	 

The  result  of  TNL’s  conduct  meant  that  the  claimant  had  no  choice  but  to  pursue 
these proceedings in order to clear his name.  I find that this exacerbated the distress 
 
and anxiety caused by the original publication.  I accept that the article, when first 
published, would have caused distress and anxiety as did the police investigation but I 
 
also accept the claimant’s evidence that throughout he had the hope and confidence 
that  he  would  be  cleared  reasonably  quickly  by  the  investigation.    When  the  result 
was known, the claimant was entitled to expect qualification of the original article by 
publication of the fact that he had been exonerated.  What he did not expect was from 
that point he had to fight for even the publication of the outcome of the inquiry.  The 
 
conduct  of  TNL  during  this  period  added  considerably  to  the  suffering  of  the 
claimant. 

In December 2006 the claimant was allowed to return to his work in the Extradition 
 
Unit.  In April 2009 he was moved from the Unit, the reason given being the pressure 
in his personal life and The Times litigation.  Extradition was the work the claimant 
enjoyed and upon which he had built his reputation.  Had the claimant received the 
published exoneration by TNL to which he was entitled, it is reasonable to conclude 
that he would have been permitted to remain in his specialist field.  The refusal of 
TNL to act responsibly can be said to have directly impacted upon the professional 
 
life of the claimant during this period, a factor of which account can also be taken in 
assessing any award of damages. 

Reputation 
 

I accept that the claimant did not submit actual evidence of damage to his reputation 
amongst  colleagues  and  his  peers  however  common  sense  suggests  that  the 
 
continuance of such serious allegations in a medium which can be accessed by those 
who wish to learn more about the claimant can have done his reputation no good.  I 
accept  the  defence  contention  that  it  was  the  original  article  which  received  the 
highest readership.  However, the continuance of the article on the website meant that 
it was there to be read by anyone with a particular interest in the claimant.  I do not

accept that this is likely to have been lawyers, as those lawyers involved in the case 
would have had their own copies of the article.  Far more likely is the example of the 
three police officers who were to work with the claimant, and in advance of so doing 
carried out their own research.  That is what people do, professionally and personally. 
 
Further, as the claimant demonstrated by the evidence relating to the Entwhistle case 
in  America,  the  existence  of  the  article  undermined  his  own  statement  that  he  had 
been  exonerated.  All  of  this  would  be  difficult  on  a  purely  personal  level  but  the 
attack included allegations of a grave nature upon the integrity, professionalism and 
reputation of an experienced police officer working in a specialised field. 

Deterrence 
 

 
82.	 

The Times was aware of its obligation to publish the result of the police inquiry.  This 
was  identified  in  correspondence  as  early  as  September  2007  as  was  noted  in  the 
judgments of Tugendhat J and the Court of Appeal.  The Times was also on notice of 
its need so to do be reason of the decision in Loutchansky.  For reasons, which have 
never  properly  been  identified,  The  Times  refused  to  act  responsibly.    It  is  such 
conduct which invokes the concept of deterrence as a marker and a warning that such 
conduct cannot represent responsible journalism. 
 

Award of damages

The  award  of  damages,  for  the  period  5  September  2007  to  21  October  2009,  to 
reflect the distress, anxiety and suffering of the claimant, the damage to his reputation 
and  the  need  for  proper  vindication  is  £45,000.    To  that  figure  I  have  awarded  a 
further  £15,000  to  represent  the  aggravation  of  those  damages  by  reason  of  the 
conduct of the defendant and to serve as a deterrent to those who embark upon public 
 
interest journalism but thereafter refuse to publish material which in whole, or in part, 
exculpates  the  subject  of  the  investigation.    Accordingly,  the  claimant’s  award  of 
damages is £60,000.",2013-12-18 00:00:00,UK High Court

     Sentencing Remarks  

 

 

Mr Justice Spencer:  

 

Colin  Frederick  Campbell,  I  have  to  sentence  you  for  the  brutal  murder  of  Claire 

Woolterton 32 years ago in August 1981. You are already serving a sentence of life 

imprisonment  for  the  killing  of  another  woman  3  years  later  in  1984,  Deirdre 

Sainsbury. Your conviction for her murder was eventually quashed by the Court of 

Appeal in the light of fresh evidence about the part your epilepsy may have played 

on that occasion. In January 1999, when you were about to be retried for the murder 

of Deirdre Sainsbury, the prosecution accepted your plea of guilty to manslaughter 

on the grounds of diminished responsibility. 

 

Had it been known in 1999 that you were responsible as well for the killing of Claire 

Woolterton,  the  prosecution  would  never  have  accepted  your  plea  of  diminished 

responsibility in relation to the killing of Deirdre Sainsbury. It is also unlikely that Dr 

Fenwick  and  Professor  Fenton  would  have  been  able  to  support  such  a  defence, 
given the content of Dr Fenwick’s report dated 5th November 2013 in which he said 

that  if  you  were  found  to  have  killed  Claire  Woolterton  “the  fact  that  he  had 

committed  two  similar  crimes  would  significantly  weaken  the  possibility  that  the 

 

1
--------
factors  that  we  determined  about  his  epilepsy  at  Broadmoor  Hospital  could  have 

played  the  central  role  that  was  suggested  in  the  case  of  the  Deirdre  Sainsbury 

killing. If it is found that he was present and did carry out the earlier killing then this 

must raise questions about the significance of epilepsy in the second killing”. I make 

it clear that I do not increase your sentence for the murder of Claire Woolterton on 

this account. It is simply part of the relevant background.  

 

For 31 years the family of Claire Woolterton lived with the tragedy of losing her in 

the  most  shocking  and  distressing  circumstances.  The  family  have  all  been 

emotionally  scarred,  and  devastatingly  so.  Claire  was  a  much  loved,  happy,  kind, 

generous and considerate 17 year old girl, boisterous and full of life and love for her 

family.  She  had  her  whole  adult  life  before  her.  Her  mother  has  never  got  over 

Claire’s death and never will. She has never wanted to know the details of how Claire 

died, and is terrified even now of finding out. She is still haunted by nightmares and 

flashbacks  month  by  month.  Claire’s  older  brother  never  got  over  the  shock  and 

trauma  of  her  death.  His  life  thereafter  was  blighted  by  mental  health  problems 

which the family understandably attribute directly to the murder of Claire. Sadly he 

died just over a month ago.  

 

Claire’s mother and step‐father, and her two brothers, suffered the double agony for 

all  those  years  not  only  of  losing  her  but  also  of  knowing  that  her  killer  had  gone 

undetected and unpunished. When you were arrested and interviewed a year ago in 

November 2012 you had the opportunity of giving Claire Woolterton’s family the one 

thing they must have desired most after all this time ‐ closure. Instead you denied 

responsibility for this killing, hoping you would continue to get away with it, as you 

had got away with it for the past 31 years. The jury saw through you and, after most 

careful examination of all the evidence, convicted you of this appalling offence.  

 

Only  you  know  the  true  circumstances  in  which  you  came  to  pick  up  Claire 

Woolterton that Thursday night in August 1981 and the true circumstances in which 

her naked body came to be found on the path alongside the river in Windsor some 8 

hours  later.  I  am  quite  sure  you  abducted  her  with  the  intention  of  abusing  her 

 

2
--------
sexually  and,  if  necessary,  killing  her.  There  can  be  no  other  explanation  on  the 

evidence the jury heard.  

 

You  assaulted  her  sexually,  overpowering  her.  It  is  plain  from  the  defence  injuries 

she suffered that she must have put up a fight but you were too strong for her and 

too  determined.  You  rendered  her  unconscious  by  smothering  her  in  some  way, 

probably with your bare hands. The asphyxial changes found at post mortem would 

have required  her breathing to be obstructed for 20‐30 seconds at least. When she 

was unconscious you stripped her naked, just as 3 years later you stripped Deirdre 

Sainsbury naked. But on this occasion your victim was still alive when you stripped 

her. You chose to end her life in a very public place, but under cover of night and in 

the shadows on that path by the river. With a knife you had with you for the purpose 

you cut her throat from behind, drawing the blade deep across her neck on 4 or 5 

occasions.  Mercifully  she  was  already  unconscious.  Then,  as  she  was  dying  or 

immediately after death, you mutilated her private parts in a final act of indignity. 

That was done for your own depraved sexual gratification. You stabbed and slashed 

at  her  vagina  and  buttocks.  Three  years  later  you  were  to  cut  off  the  breast  of 

Deirdre Sainsbury after you had killed her. You were and, in my view, remain a very 

dangerous man.  

 

For murder, as you well know from personal experience, there is only one sentence: 

life  imprisonment.  But  I  am  required  to  determine  how  long  you  should  serve  in 

prison before you are even eligible to apply to the Parole Board for release. You are 

now 66 years of age. It is very unlikely indeed that you will ever be released from 

prison because the minimum term that I must impose, despite your age, will be very 

long indeed.  

 

I  am  required  by  the  provisions  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  to  approach 

sentencing in your case in two stages. This is because your offence was committed 

before the provisions of the Act came into force. First I am required to determine, in 

accordance with schedule 21 to the Act, the appropriate minimum term you should 

serve. But secondly I am also required, by schedule 22 to the Act, to ensure that I do 

 

3
--------
not specify a minimum term which, in the opinion of the court, is greater than that 

which  you  would  have  been  directed  to  serve  under  the  practice  followed  by  the 

Secretary of State before 2002 and at the time this offence was committed.  

 

Approaching the matter in this way, the first stage is to decide what minimum term 

would be appropriate if this offence had been committed after the coming into force 

of the 2003 Act. Had you remained convicted of the murder of Deirdre Sainsbury the 

appropriate starting point under paragraph 4 of schedule 21 for this second murder 

would  have  been  a  whole  life  order.  As  it  is,  the  appropriate  starting  point  under 

paragraph 5 of schedule 21 is, in my judgment, 30 years because this was a murder 

involving sexual or sadistic conduct. 

 

 Next I have to consider whether there are aggravating or mitigating factors which 

require  departure  from  the  starting  point  of  30  years.  There  are  three.  First,  you 

undoubtedly  inflicted  mental  and  physical  suffering  on  Claire  Woolterton  before 

death. Secondly, the sexual mutilation you carried out came close to amounting to 

dismemberment of the body. I bear in mind that, to an extent, these two aggravating 

factors  have  already  been  taken  into  account  in  choosing  the  starting  point  of  30 

years for the very reason that the murder involved sexual or sadistic conduct. But in 

my judgment these factors would have merited a further modest increase. Third, it is 

also  an  aggravating  factor  that  you  have  a  previous  conviction  for  killing  another 

woman, albeit  a conviction for manslaughter rather than murder. That factor goes 

not so much to increase the minimum term, but to reduce the mitigation of your age 

and what might otherwise in some cases be regarded as the mitigation of so long a 

delay between the commission of this offence and the date of your sentence for it.  

 

There is no  other mitigating factor under schedule 21.  Plainly you intended  to kill. 

Plainly there was premeditation. I am not persuaded that you suffered at the time 

from any mental disability which lowered your degree of culpability for this killing. 

Despite  your  epilepsy  you  were  perfectly  able  to  lead  a  normal  life.  Your  had  not 

even informed the relevant authorities that because of your epilepsy you should not 

be  driving.  You  held  down  a  job.  You  played  competitive  sport.  You  arranged  and 

 

4
--------
revelled in social events. Your epilepsy may have made you irritable and impulsive 

on occasions but it did not turn you into a sexual predator and a cold blooded killer.  

 

You can expect no sympathy on account of the delay in your being convicted of this 

crime and you can expect no reduction in the term you are ordered to serve on that 

account. In 1985 when you were interviewed by the police you had the opportunity 

to  confess to this crime. You also had the opportunity to confess to it 10 years later 

when you were examined by so many psychiatrists and other doctors. Instead you 

painted a totally false picture of your personality and history, confident that you had 

been careful enough to leave no evidence of your involvement in this murder and 

confident that having got away with it for many years already you would never have 

to face trial.  

 

I  bear  in  mind  that  you  have  been  in  poor  health  for  the  last  few  years,  receiving 

treatment for rectal cancer. I bear in mind that you have made something of your 

time  in  prison,  and  have  done  good  works.  Balancing  all  the  aggravating  and 

mitigating factors, including your age, I take the view that under schedule 21 of the 

Act the appropriate minimum term in your case would be 30 years.  

 

Finally, I have to consider whether a term of 30 years would, in my opinion be longer 

than the term the Secretary of State would have directed that you serve under the 

earlier sentencing regime applicable at the time of the offence.  

 

I  have  had  the  assistance  of  detailed  submissions  from  counsel,  based  upon  the 

statutory  provisions  and  the  decision  in  particular  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  R  v 

Sullivan  [2005]  1  Cr  App  R  3.  The  relevant  principles  have  most  recently  been 
restated  in  the  new  Consolidated  Practice  Direction  which  came  into  force  on  3rd 

October 2013, at section N.  

 

I am satisfied that this would have been treated, under any past practice, as a very 

serious case justifying a very substantial departure indeed from the normal starting 

point for what might be described as an “unexceptional” murder. The best evidence 

 

5
--------
of  the  minimum  term  likely  to  have  been  imposed  for  a  “normal”  murder  under 

earlier  sentencing  regimes  is  to  found  in  the  statements  of  practice  by  respective 

Lord Chief Justices, Lord Bingham and Lord Woolf. These statements were made in 

the form of letters to the judiciary, as explained and set out in the case of Sullivan.  

 
In  his  letter  dated  10th  February  1997  Lord  Bingham  indicated  that  his  current 

practice was to take 14 years as the period to be served in a normal murder, which 

he noted  was longer than the period his predecessor Lord Lane took as his norm 10 

years  earlier,  i.e.  in  1987  or  thereabouts.  The  normal  period  then  was  12  years. 

However,  that  is  not  to  say,  in  a  case  as  serious  as  this,  that  the  minimum  term 

would  only  ever  have  been  set  as  low  as  12  years.  In  his  letter  Lord  Bingham 

identified a number of factors likley to call for a sentence more severe than the norm 

of 14 years. Three are in my view particularly relevant: at paragraph 3 “evidence of 

sadism,  gratuitous  violence,  or  sexual  maltreatment,  humiliation  or   degradation  

before the killing”, at paragraph 11 “macabre attempts to dismember or conceal the 

body”, and at paragraph 10 “ a substantial record of serious violence”. Lord Bingham 

also indicated that while the recommendation of a punitive term longer than, say, 30 

years would be very rare indeed, he did not think it right to set an upper limit. Some 

crimes, he said, would certainly call for terms very well in excess of the norm.  

 

Had you been sentenced in the 1980s for the murder of Claire Woolterton, within a 

few years of her death , but having by then  pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 

Deirdre Sainsbury on the basis of diminished responsibility, those three aggravating 

factors subsequently identified by Lord Bingham, would have been highly relevant. 

They  are  examples  only,  rather  than  completely  comprehensive,  as  Lord  Bingham 

made clear. First, there was, in this murder, evidence of sadism, gratuitous violence 

and  sexual  maltreatment,  humiliation  and  degradation  before  the  killing.  Second, 

there was a macabre attempt if not to dismember the body at least to mutilate it. 

Indeed it may very well be that you were interrupted, or feared interruption, in this 

desecration  of  the  body  and  that  you  would  have  gone  on  to  further  sexual 

dismemberment, as you did in the case of Deirdre Sainsbury. It is unnecessary for me 

to reach a concluded view on that but it was certainly a gravely aggravating feature 

 

6
--------
of the killing. Third, on any view your previous conviction for the killing of Deirdre 

Sainsbury, even as manslaughter, greatly increases the seriousness of this offence. It 

is  akin  to  a  substantial  record  of  serious  violence.  Finally  I  bear  in  mind  that  you 

would have been sentenced in the 1980s as a comparatively young man, in your mid 

to late 30s.  

 

The starting point for an unexceptional murder in those days would have  been 12 

years,  as  Lord  Bingham  explained.  For  this  murder  I  am  satisfied  you  would  have 

been ordered to serve at least double that figure, 24 years, but it is unlikely that the 

minimum term would have been as long as 30 years. The fact that you have already 

served 29 years in prison under your life sentence for the killing of Deirdre Sainsbury 

has no bearing on the assessment of the proper minimum term for this life sentence 

for  the  murder  of  Claire  Woolterton.  You  have  remained  in  prison  all  those  years 

because it was not considered safe to release you. 

 

 I am required by paragraph 10 (a) of Schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to 

impose  a  minimum  term  no  longer  than  you  would  have  been  directed  to  serve 

under the practice followed by the Secretary of State before December 2002. In my 

view that period would have been 24 years. 

 

 

Colin Frederick Campbell. For the murder of Claire Woolterton I sentence you to life 

imprisonment.  That  sentence  will  be  concurrent  with  the  life  sentence  you  are 

already  serving  You  will  serve  a  minimum  term  of  24  years  from  today  which,  for 

practical purposes, means it is likely that you will never be released.

Those  who  have  appeared  in  these  Courts  at  the  Bar  or  on  the  Bench  over 
 
many years see and hear a large number of horrific cases. This case however 
breaks new ground. 

Any decent person looking at and listening to the material here will experience 
shock;  revulsion;  anger  and  incredulity.  What  you  three  did  plumbed  new 
depths of depravity. 

You  Watkins  achieved  fame  and  success  as  the  lead  singer  of  the 
Lostprophets. You had many fawning fans. That gave you power. You knew 
you  could  use  that  power  to  induce  young  female  fans  to  help  satisfy  your 
apparently insatiable lust and to take part in the sexual abuse of their young 
children. Away from the highlights of your public performances lay a dark and 
sinister side.

What is the background ? 

Count 18 dates back to March 2007. You met TT after a Lostprophets concert 
when she was a 16 year old virgin. The prospect of taking her virginity excited 
you. You got her to dress in a schoolgirl’s outfit and you videoed her and you 
having oral, vaginal and anal sex. You asked her whether she enjoyed being 
your underage slut. At the end you urinated over her face and told her to drink 
it. 
 
That gives some insight into your attitude to young females at that time over 5 
years before the counts relating to B and P. 
 
Count 19 dates back to August 2008. The girl KJ was another fan aged 16.You 
videoed her having oral sex with you. She is to be seen snorting white powder

which you told her was cocaine. The taking of drugs linked with your sexual 
activities is a recurring theme. 
 
 
Count 31 relates to about 90 indecent photos of children. They include 45 at 
level 4 and 2 at level 5. The age range of the children is from 2 to 14 years. 

Count 32 involves images and videos of extreme pornography. There are 22 
images of bestiality including oral and vaginal sex with dogs.   

Watkins and B 

You B were only 19 when you met Watkins in late 2011. The communications 
between the two of you in March and April 2012 are seriously disturbing. That 
you were manipulated by Watkins may be obvious. But you were a mother. 
Your  infant  was  only  10  months  old.  A  mother  naturally  loves,  protects, 
shields, nurtures and cherishes. Your infant would have trusted you implicitly. 
You totally betrayed that trust. What did you do? You had detailed discussions 
with  Watkins  about  the  sexual  acts  to  which  the  two  of  you  were  going  to 
subject your infant. 

 
You  told  the  police  you  met  up  with  Watkins  at  the  Copthorne  Hotel  in 
Cardiff. On 21st March Watkins says “Come down this weekend and we can 
fuck him up again “You text back saying “tell me if you want to get your dick 
in our boy”. You had previously referred to getting your boy high on ice i.e. 
methyl amphetamine. 

This is what led up to the session at the K West Hotel in London on the night 
of 2nd/3rd April recorded on the video. What did you do? You presented your 
baby to him so that he could try to rape him. First in the mouth. Then in the 
anus.  Watkins  can  be  seen  spitting  on  the  boy’s  bottom  to  facilitate  his 
attempt.  You can be heard and seen encouraging him. Could there be a greater 
 
betrayal?

R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

And then what did you do? You took your little boy’s penis in your mouth and 
gave  him  oral  sex.  You  then  took  the  boy’s  hand  and  put  it  on  your  own 
vagina. Watkins then masturbated the boy. The planning and graphic detail are 
bad  enough.  The  videoing  of  what  you  were  both  doing  is  an  aggravating 
factor. The enjoyment both of you can be seen to derive from what you were 
doing is both sickening and incomprehensible. 

What happened after this? On 24th May you send Watkins a message saying 
“the boy is ready to be abused”. 

On 2nd August his message is “to be honest though, I think we have gone easy 
on  him  so  far.  Time  to  teach  him  and  MAKE  him  learn  to  love  it”.   The 
evidence  indicates  you  met  at  The  Maldron  Hotel  in  Cardiff.  Then  on  9th 
 
September you sent Watkins a photo of you licking your son’s penis. Counts 4 
to  7  relate  to  this.  In  all  it  is  a  dreadful  catalogue  of  abuse  of  a  previously 
innocent boy to satisfy your own interests and lusts. 

11.	  Watkins and P 

 

You P were a little older than B. You are now 24.Your communications with 
Watkins start in August 2012. It is not long before the communications turn to 
child sex abuse. There was talk of moving in together.  

Watkins said “if u belong to me so does ur baby” 

You responded “understandable… a mother - daughter slave duo worshipping 
you”. 

Watkins said “that’s all she will know... a life of filth”

R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

P said “the good thing about babies is put anything near their mouths and they 
start  sucking  it”.  She  went  on  to  talk  about  both  her  and  her  baby  sharing 
Watkins’ penis with their tongues. 

The  subsequent  communications  planning  even  more  depraved  activities  for 
this little girl including forcing her to engage in sex with animals and how to 
take drugs defy belief. This P was your own flesh and blood you were talking 
about. 

Watkins you referred to the girl as “my little fucktoy” and that sums up how 
 
you regarded her. Not as a human being but simply as a sexual object there for 
your pleasure. 

You Watkins then said you could not wait to get mother and daughter taking 
crack cocaine. 

You spoke of whoring her out to fat old men who would pay thousands. You 
went on “she needs to know mummy and daddy don’t love her she is just there 
to make us cum”. You spoke of torturing her for fun. 

 
12.	 

Count 11 to 13 relate to the taking of photos by P of the little girl’s genitalia 
and sending them to you Watkins. 

Count 14 relates to you P penetrating your daughter’s vagina with your finger 
and  sending  a  photo  of  that  and  similar  images  to  Watkins.  Your  response 
Watkins was to say you could not wait to stretch her. 

The  lengthy  split  screen  skype  session  on  12th  September  is  again  very 
disturbing  viewing  and  listening.  You  Watkins  encourage  P  to  spit  on  her 
finger and penetrate her daughter. You P do just that with apparent enjoyment. 
Watkins is masturbating throughout. That is count 8.

R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

 
You  have  both  pleaded  guilty  to  conspiring  to  rape  the  little  girl  and  to 
conspiring sexually to assault her. The evidence is compelling that you P took 
your infant to meet up with Watkins at the Travel Lodge in Caerphilly on the 
2nd  October  and/or  at  the  Radisson  in  Cardiff  on  the  23rd  October.  What 
happened there is not recorded.  You for a long time lied saying you had never 
 
met up with him.  You now say you did but you left your baby with someone 
else. The evidence to me is compelling that you took your baby but I do not 
deal  with  you  on  that  basis  as  I  bear  in  mind  you  have  been  charged  with 
conspiracy rather than the completed offences. 

Let there be no mistake however. This plea means you accept that the two of 
you agreed that the little girl should be raped by Watkins and you both 
intended that that should take place. You Watkins initiated and orchestrated 
the appalling abuse but you P betrayed your daughter for your own selfish 
ends. 

 
15.	 

Discount for plea 

You B are entitled to the standard one third discount as you entered your pleas 
at the first reasonable opportunity. 
 
Watkins and P waited until just before the jury was sworn in on the second 
day. It is arguable that the case was so overwhelming that you should receive 
no credit. But I give you the conventional 10%. 

 
16.	 

Dangerousness 

First Watkins.    
The PSR. You spoke to the author of your desire to shock and your craving to 
push sexual boundaries. This craving was fuelled by your use of cocaine and 
methamphetamine which increased your sexual aggression. You spoke of not 
knowing to what extremes you would have gone but for your arrest. It is 
difficult to imagine anything much worse. 
The author concludes “Mr Watkins presents a high risk of causing serious 
sexual, physical, emotional and psychological harm to children, both male and 
female, and to women, specifically his female sexual partners.” 

 

 

Page 6

17.	 

R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

 

The author also says “it is also my assessment that the child victims in this 
 
case appear to be coincidental to his need to dominate and to test out the 
extent to which his sexual partners would collude and participate in his sexual 
interests.” 
Psychiatric report. Miss O’Neill told me on the last occasion they had a 
psychiatric report but it needed updating in the light of the changes in plea. 
There has been put before me a short report from Dr Huckle prepared after 
visits to Watkins in September and October. It refers to a report by a 
psychologist S. Van Scoyoc. 
It does not deal with the issue of dangerousness and Miss O’Neill specifically 
does not ask for any adjournment to obtain further such evidence. 

I bear in mind a number of factors : ( 1) the facts of these offences against 
these babies  are enormously serious ( 2 ) the offending dates back to 2007; ( 3 
)  the delight that Watkins evidently has when engaging in the most terrible 
offences involving tiny children; ( 4 ) his need to dominate any sexual partner 
and his corruptive influence over young females; ( 5 )  the using of drugs in 
combination with sexual assaults;( 6) the interest in extreme pornography; ( 7 ) 
the almost complete lack of remorse; in this last respect the evidence of the 
phone conversations after the guilty pleas on the last occasion is enlightening. 
There is one further matter of concern. One of the passwords you chose, which 
needed the assistance of GCHQ to break was I FUK KIDZ.  

I have no hesitation in concluding that there is a significant risk to the public, 
in particular to young females and children, of serious harm occasioned by the 
commission by you of further specified offences. That risk is high. 

 
18.	 

B. 

There is a psychiatric report from Dr McFarlane dated 13/ 12/13. 

There is reference in that report to your infatuation with Watkins and to his 

strong influence in your drug taking with him. The future risk of you 

reoffending in similar fashion is assessed as medium. It is not considered that 

you were suffering from a mental illness at the material time. 

The  PSR. 


 

 

Page 7
--------
R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

The author’s assessment is that you pose a high risk of causing serious harm. 
The specific risk would be failure to protect children from others and sexual 
abuse by you.  It is said however that you appear genuinely devastated for the 
harm you have caused your child and how his future will be affected. 

 
19. 

P. 

 

I have read the report from clinical psychologist Dr Krljes dated 1st December 
2013. That was prepared at a time when you were still protesting your 
innocence of these offences. There is an addendum dated 17th December. 
The psychologist concluded that you had a mixed personality disorder. She 
also considered it likely you used your daughter as a tool to secure Watkins’s 
acceptance of you. She considered that in the long term you would benefit 
from an opportunity to engage in psychological interventions targeting your 
personality disorder and sexual offending. 
The risk of you reoffending in similar manner is assessed as relatively low. 
The PSR. 
The assessment given is that you pose a medium risk of harm to children 
based on your current behaviour and the fact that you no longer have access to 
your own child who was most at risk. 
 

20.  Mitigation 

 

Watkins you are aged 36 and have no previous convictions. Your mitigation is 
your late plea. I also take into account that through your offences over the last 
6 years you have lost a valued position with your group. I also take note of the 
letters written on your behalf from those who know a different side of you. 
 
B 
You are aged 21. You have one previous conviction for an offence of fraud for 
which you received a suspended sentence. Apart from that you are of good 
character. Your principal mitigation is the fact that you pleaded guilty at the 
first reasonable opportunity. There appears to be genuine remorse. 
 

 

 

Page 8

R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

P 
You are aged 25 now and are of previous good character. You have the 
mitigation of a late plea. There are signs of remorse. 

 
21.	 

You B and you P will hopefully mature and on your eventual release will steer 
clear of the corrupting influence of the likes of your Watkins. 

 
I consider that in your case B and your case P I can treat you as falling just 
short of the threshold necessary for dangerousness – and determinate 
sentences are appropriate. With Watkins that is not the case.  

 
22.	 

The Sentencing Guidelines 

 Factors indicating greater culpability are: 

The planning (and its graphic detail) 

 
The deliberate targeting of a vulnerable victim
 
The commission of the offences by two people acting together 

The abuse of trust in the cases of B and P 

The abuse of power in the case of Watkins 

The commission of offences whilst under the influence of drugs 

 
Factors indicating greater harm are: 
The fact that a baby is particularly vulnerable 
 
In the case of Watkins more than one victim 
Repeated assaults on the same victim 
Additional degradation through taking photos or videos as part of the 
offending 
 
What is the position in relation to any harm suffered by these babies? While it 
is right to say there is no evidence of any residual physical harm it is not 
possible to say what psychological harm may have been suffered or may be 
suffered in the future. As is pointed out in paragraph 2.10 of the PSR for B 
“Given his very young age it is unclear what effect the abuse would have had 
on him. However this child is likely to have lifelong psychological difficulties 
 
coming to terms with the enormity of what has happened to him. Despite him

being placed in long term foster care…he will eventually learn the truth of his 
childhood and the abuse he was subjected to. The effects of which are 
significant and we cannot and should not underestimate the effect this will 
have on him for the rest of his life.” The statement from those who are now 
responsible for his care is very telling in this context. 
One obvious immediate consequence is that they will be deprived of the love 
and care of their natural mother. 
There is however disturbing evidence in respect of your daughter P. When her 
hair was analysed it showed she had been exposed to methamphetamine. It is 
said on behalf of P that she was only exposed to methamphetamine when in 
company with Watkins but it is urged that P might have gone back to her baby 
and somehow exposed her to it. It is not an issue which requires 
determination. 

 
23.	 

For rape of a child under 13 where there is abuse of trust or more than one 
 
offender acting together the suggested range is 11 to 17 years with a starting 
point of 13 years. 

The same applies to assault by penetration of a child under 13. 
The Guideline recognises that starting points and ranges are not rigid and that 
the circumstances of a particular case may justify going outside the Guideline. 
This is a case where in my judgment such departure would be justified. That is 
because of the horrific nature of the offences involving these babies and the 
other factors in respect of culpability and harm to which I have referred. 
The suggested range for sexual assault of a child under 13 is 1 to 4 years with 
a starting point of 2 years. The range and starting point for taking indecent 
photographs and distributing them varies according to the level and volume. 

 
24.	 

Sentences 

The Watkins/B counts 
Counts 1 and 2.  I bear in mind these were attempts and not the full offences 
although the video shows how close to the full offences these attempts were. 
There was though more than one offence. They were followed by further 
assaulting in count 3. 

 

 

Page 10
--------
R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

I take a starting point of 17 years after trial. In your case Watkins that reduces 

to 15.3 years. 

In your case B it reduces to 11 years and 4 months. 

On count 3 my starting point is 4 years which reduces in your case Watkins to 

3.6 years which I round down to 3 years 6 months and in your case P it 

reduces to 2 years 8 months. Those will run concurrently. 

Count 4 happened much later in September. It was a wholly separate incident 

of licking your son’s penis and taking photos of it. My starting point is 4 

years. With discount for plea the sentence is 2 years and 8 months. There will 

be concurrent sentences of 18 months after discount on each of counts 5 and 6. 

But those sentences will run consecutively to the previous sentences on B. 

Total sentence therefore in her case is 14 years. 

On count 7 Watkins in your case you did not produce the photo although it 

was taken for your benefit. The sentence will be 12 months concurrent. 


 
25. 

The Watkins/ P counts 

Counts 8 and 9. 

You P enthusiastically penetrated your daughter with your finger at Watkins’ 

behest. The lengthy and distressing Skype episode has already been described. 

Count 9 is the agreement that she should be raped. 

My starting point for each of you is 16 years before discount for plea. That 

reduces it to 14.4 years which I round down to 14 years 4 months on each 

count concurrent. On count 10 there will be a concurrent sentence of 3 years 

after discount. On counts 11 and 12 P your sentence after discount is 2 years 

concurrent. 

Count 14 is a separate incident of you P holding open your daughter’s genitals. 

You took a photo of that and sent it to Watkins. The starting point after trial on 

count 14 is 4 years reducing to 3 years 6 months on plea. There will be 

concurrent sentences of 12 months on counts 15 and 16. As I propose to make 

these sentences consecutive to your other sentences I have to consider totality. 

Having done so I reduce the sentence on count 14 to 2 years 8 months. The 

total sentence for you P is 17 years. 


 

 

Page 11
--------
26.	 

R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.
 

In your case Watkins I have to consider the remaining counts in totality. On 
counts  13,  17,  18,  19,  30  and  31  there  will  be  concurrent  sentences  of  12 
months.  I  am  satisfied  that  you  are  a  deeply  corrupting  influence;  you  are 
highly manipulative; you are a sexual predator; you are dangerous. The public 
and  in  particular  young  females  and  children  need  protection  from  you.  On 
one  view  this  is  a  case  which  would  justify  a  “denunciatory”  indeterminate 
sentence  as  in  Saunders  [2013]  EWCA  1027.  I  bear  in  mind  that  such  a 
sentence is one of last resort. The alternative is a very long extended sentence. 
In  my  judgment  justice  and  protection  of  the  public  can  and  should  be 
achieved by such a very long sentence. 

The sentences on your offences with B must be consecutive to the sentences 
on your offences with P. But I have to bear in mind totality. 

I therefore adjust sentences in this way.  

The sentences on counts 1 and 2 will be 15 years. 

 
The sentences on counts 8 and 9 will be 14 years consecutive. Custodial term 
29 years. 

There will be an extended period of licence under section 226A of 6 years on 
those counts. 

All other sentences will be concurrent. Your total sentence is therefore one of 
35 years. 

 
In your case that means you will have to serve 2/3 of the custodial term before 
you can be considered for release by the Parole Board. If you are released you 
will remain on licence for the extended period.  

 

 

Page 12
--------
R V Watkins and P and B.  Sentencing remarks.

In your case B and P the usual rule will apply. You will be eligible for release 
after  serving  half  your  sentence.  You  will  then  be  on  licence.  The  detailed 
provisions will be explained to you by your counsel. 

Other orders. 

Forfeiture of exhibits.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE BURNETT 

 

On Monday afternoon, on the first day of what was to be your trial for the murder of 
Sergio Marquez, you entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished 
responsibility. The unanimity of view amongst the psychiatrists in this case is that you 
suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and that the influence of that illness had the effect 
of reducing substantially your responsibility for the killing of Mr. Marquez. In those 
circumstances, after careful thought and having explained the position to the family of 
Mr. Marquez, the Crown accepted your plea. It has been recognised in many cases, a 
number of which have been drawn to my attention by both Mr Pascoe QC and Mr 
 
 
Nsugbe  QC  in  their  helpful  written  and  oral  submissions,  that  sentencing  in  these 
circumstances poses acute difficulty. 
 
 
Mr. Nsugbe QC submits on your behalf that a hospital order under section 37 of the 
Mental  Health  Act  1983  with  an  indefinite  restriction  on  your  release  pursuant  to 
section 41 meets the justice of this case. I should say immediately that the technical 
requirements  necessary  for  a  disposal  under the  Mental  Health  Act  have  been  met. 
 
Additionally, very recent reports from your treating clinicians at Broadmoor, where 
you  have  been  for  the  last  year,  confirm  the  nature  of  you  illness  and  that  a  bed 
continues to be available there. The submission made on your behalf is supported by 
written and oral evidence, from Dr. David Morton. I also have reports from Professor 
 
Greenberg.  Mr. Pascoe Q.C. has properly recognised the limits of his role on behalf 
of  the  Crown  on  questions  of  sentence.  Nonetheless,  Dr.  Richard  Badcock,  who 
prepared a report for the Crown and also gave oral evidence, suggested that this was a 

 

1
--------
case which called for a prison sentence alongside a Mental Health Act disposal. In 
 
other words he raised the possibility of a sentence contemplated by section 45A of the 
Act.  Mr.  Pascoe  has  reminded  me  of  the  need  to  consider  dangerousness,  and  by 
implication to consider the question whether a life sentence alongside an order under 
section  45A  is  appropriate. 
It  is  common  ground  that  you  are  dangerous.    Mr 
Nsugbe’s submissions were directed towards that issue and recognised the very real 
choice available to the court. 
 
I must touch upon the facts of this deeply tragic case, upsetting though it will be for 
Sergio Marquez’ mother and family. He was a bright 23 year old Spaniard who was 
living and working in Bournemouth. In particular, he wished to improve his English 
and so his general prospects not least because of the very difficult economic position 
of Spain in recent years. He shared a flat in Lansdowne Road, Bournemouth with two 
Spanish friends and with you. You did not know them before you moved into the flat 
in  May  2012.  The  flat  was  owned  by  Mr  Lui.  You  behaved  in  an  anti-social  way 
towards  your  flatmates.  Mr.  Marquez  eventually  wrote  you  a  note  asking  you  to 
change your ways, which you resented. The upshot was that the landlord asked you to 
leave. The date agreed for you to leave was 17 July 2012, the day on which you killed 
Mr Marquez.  
 
At lunchtime that day you and Mr. Marquez were alone in the flat. Your landlord was 
trying to contact you but you did not respond. He was able to contact Mr Marquez 
who told him you were in the shower. 
 
At 14.11 Mr. Marquez sent a text to Mr Lui saying you had finished. Mr Lui then 
spoke to you briefly to make arrangements to collect the key that evening. 
 
Although you later said that your imminent eviction and Mr Marquez’ part in it were 
coincidental, that is highly improbably.   
 
At about 15.30 a neighbour heard raised voices and an argument which went on for 
perhaps  15  or  20  minutes.    It  included  the  words  “please  Karl,  please  Karl”.    The 
neighbour heard you laughing. 
 

 

2
--------
It is at about this time that you killed Mr. Marquez with multiple stab wounds in what 
 
was a frenzied and deeply violent attack from which he tried to defend himself.   You 
 
then decapitated and disembowelled him. 
 
Your flatmates returned expecting to be let in by Mr. Marquez.  There was a birthday 
party planned for one of them.  When they could not raise him on his phone, a builder 
 
gained entry to the flat via scaffolding. He encountered you in the flat. Your clothes 
 
were covered in blood although he did not realise that at the time. The builder left the 
flat and you closed the door after him. When your flatmates came up they could see 
you through the letterbox going back and forth to the bathroom, apparently trying to 
wash  you  clothes  and  filling  a  rucksack.    You  opened  the  door  and  ran  past  them. 
They then encountered the nightmarish scene you had created. 
 
The police soon caught you. You said that you did it because you were attacked. I 
make  clear  immediately  that  there  is  no  support  for  that  whatsoever.  Amongst  the 
things you took with you when you fled the scene were Mr. Marquez’ computer and 
phone. 
 
 
I  have  read  and  take  into  account  the  deeply  affecting  statement  provided  by  Mr 
Marquez’ mother, parts of which were referred to by Mr Pascoe.  The brutal killing of 
this young man has had a profound and lasting impact upon his mother and family.  
 
I do not propose to rehearse the psychiatric evidence in great detail. It is contained in 
the  comprehensive  reports  of  the  three  psychiatrists  I  have  mentioned.  Both  Mr. 
Nsugbe and Mr. Pascoe have summarised its effect in their written material.   There is 
a long psychiatric history dating back to your teenage years which includes references 
to  previous  violent  action.    At  the  end  of  September  2011  you  were  admitted 
voluntarily to a psychiatric unit under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. You were 
recommended for detention under section 3 but immediately absconded. In October 
2011  a  tribunal  ruled  that  you  should  be  detained,  but  you  had  disappeared.    You 
 
undoubtedly lack insight into your condition but from time to time have recognised 
In  June  2012  you  made  contact  with  a  GP  with  a  view  to  a

urological investigation but you did not seek any psychiatric help.   The reality is that 
 
you knew that you had psychiatric problems and you chose to deny yourself treatment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
after  October  2011.  That  may  not  have  been  the  calculated  decision  of  a  rational 
person, but you must have appreciated the risks you were running for yourself and 
others. 
 
I  have  already  noted  the  unanimity  of  view  amongst  the  doctors  concerning  your 
underlying condition.   It is very serious.  It has manifested itself in a belief that there 
existed a gang, with special powers, who had harmed you in the past and remained a 
 
threat to you.  The psychiatrists conclude that you became convinced, at least on 17 
 
July, that Mr Marquez was a member of that gang and that is why you killed him. 
 
The mutilation was to ensure that he could not recover from his injuries.   You gave a 
detailed account of what you said occurred to two of the psychiatrists which included 
an elaborate description of an attack upon you.  To the third you denied the killing 
altogether.  Whilst your mental illness and irrational belief in the existence of the 
gang and the threat it posed to you provides an explanation for your conduct, I do not 
understand the psychiatrists to be saying that you had at the time, or since, a genuine 
belief that Mr Marquez actually attacked you, as opposed to a belief that he would do 
so. That question was explored in evidence with Dr Morton.  It is one thing to have a 
delusional belief that someone is going to attack you. It is another to have a delusional 
belief that one was attacked.  I conclude that part of your account was a construct, 
first apparent when you were arrested, to deflect responsibility.  It was an elaboration 
 
which  when  set  alongside  your  attempt  to  flee  shows  some  insight  into  your 
understanding of what you had done at the time and your underlying culpability.   It 
remains a mystery why, having concluded irrationally that Mr Marquez posed a threat 
to you, you remained in the flat with him for so long and did not leave.      
 
The psychiatrists considered not only the question of manslaughter but also whether 
you were fit to take part in any trial and the defence of insanity.  By your plea you 
accept  culpable  responsibility  for  the  killing  of  Mr  Marquez,  albeit  diminished 
responsibility.  As Dr Morton observed in his report, you knew what you were doing 
 
when you stabbed him to death.  You knew that the act of killing was wrong, even 
though  you  had  convinced  yourself  of  a  conspiratorial  threat  from  the  gang.    I  am 
unable  to  accept  Mr  Nsugbe’s  submission  that  you  have  no,  or  almost  no, 
responsibility  for  what  occurred.  I  consider  that  whilst  substantially  reduced,  your 
responsibility  remains  significant.    Mr  Nsugbe  recognised  the  force  of  recent 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
authority, which has supported the imposition of a life sentence alongside a hospital 
order  in  cases  with  some  common  features.    Such  sentences  provide  some  added 
 
protection  for  the  public  and  play  a  part  in  maintaining  public  confidence. 
Importantly,  and  in  the  context  of  a  dangerous  offender,  they  reflect  an  element  of 
punishment beyond the question of treatment.   
 
It may be, as Dr Morton suggested, that the reality of your medical condition is that 
you are likely to remain in a secure hospital for a very long time indeed, perhaps for 
ever. 
 
But given the significant underlying culpability which the entire circumstances of this 
case suggest, I am satisfied that the appropriate sentence is one of life imprisonment, 
 
together with a direction under section 45A of the Mental Health Act 1983 that you be 
removed to Broadmoor Hospital and an indefinite restriction under section 41.   
 
I must set a minimum term.  I accept Mr Nsugbe’s submission that were this a case of 
murder the statutory starting point would be one of 15 years, albeit with aggravating 
features,  and  that  a  significant  allowance  must  be  made  for  the  substantially 
diminished  responsibility.    The  weighing  of  aggravating  features  and  mitigating 
features  referred  to  by  Mr  Nsugbe  in  a  case  of  this  nature  is  difficult,  as  is  the 
assessment of your underlying culpability.   In particular, the aggravating features of 
using  knives  and  the  post  death  injuries  you  inflicted  are  tied  up  with  your  mental 
illness.  But I accept that there must be a substantial reduction in what would be the 
starting point had you been convicted of murder.  The prosecution accept that your 
guilty plea should attract a full discount of one third.  This is because until recently 
you  were  not  in  a  position  to  give  instructions  to  your  lawyers.    Furthermore,  the 
psychiatric position, including whether a defence of insanity should be run, was under 
investigation.  Taking all into account my conclusion is that the minimum term should 
 
be  one  of  six  and  a  half  years.    The  time  spent  on  remand  will  count  towards  that 
minimum term.  The result of the sentence I have imposed is that the public now has 
the double protection provided by the Mental Health Act and the involvement of the 
 
Parole Board.  You will be detained for at least six and a half years but will not be 
released unless the relevant authorities conclude that it is safe to do so.  Given all that

 PETER REDFERN
 

16 JANUARY 2014 


 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE MALES
 

 
Peter Redfern, you have pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of your wife Jean and the 
murder of your daughter Sarah. 
 
You  married  your  wife  in  1968  and  lived  all  45  years  of  your  married  life  at  131 
Sandygate in Wath. Your daughter Sarah was born in 1980 and so was 33 when you 
killed  her.  She  was  your  only  child.  The  three  of  you  formed  a  close  and  reserved 
family unit with little or no outside social life. To all appearances you were a loving, 
self sufficient and contented family with no known problems or conflicts. 
 
You are now aged 70 having retired some years ago from your job as a gas fitter, a 
job  which  you  held  all  your  working  life.  In  May  2013  you  were  diagnosed  with 
multiple  myeloma,  a  form  of  bone  cancer  which  is  incurable.  You  underwent 
 
chemotherapy  and  participated  in  a  national  trial  for  treatment  with  particular  drug 
 
combinations, but this produced unpleasant side effects which led to you ceasing this 
 
treatment. I need to emphasise that according to the information which I have been 
given,  the  drugs  which  you  took  were  not  in  any  way  experimental  but  were 
recognised  drugs.  The  nature  of  the  trial  was  to  determine  the  most  effective 
combination  of  such  drugs  for  treating  your  form  of  cancer.  Studies  have  shown, 
however, that in a very small percentage of cases the drugs which you took can lead 
to an adverse psychiatric reaction, which when it occurs is generally mild or moderate 
but in a very small number of cases can be serious. Tragically, that was to prove to be 
so in your case.
--------
On 22 July 2013 you were at home with your wife, while your daughter was at work. 
At some point in the afternoon you killed your wife Jean by strangling her. When her 
body was found by the police, there was a plastic carrier bag over her head, secured 
 
with white electrical flex wrapped round her neck and knotted tightly at the front. It is 
not clear whether you strangled her with this flex or, as I understand to be your case, 
you strangled her with your hands and put the bag over her head afterwards, using the 
 
flex  to  secure  it.  Why  you  would  have  done  this  if  you  did  strangle  her  with  your 
hands is a mystery which you have not explained. 
 
The prosecution have accepted that your killing of your wife constituted manslaughter 
on the basis of diminished responsibility. They have done so on the basis that there is 
expert medical evidence to the effect that as a result of the drugs which you had been 
taking you were suffering from depression, which is a recognised medical condition, 
that this can lead to impulsive conduct and impairment of judgment, and that on the 
balance  of  probabilities  you  killed  your  wife  on  impulse  when  your  mental 
functioning was abnormally affected in this way. Precisely how or why this happened 
may never be known. 
 
 
After  you  had  killed  your  wife,  you  realised  that  your  daughter  Sarah  would  be 
coming home from work and would see what had happened to your wife, to whom 
 
she  was  particularly  close.  They  have  been  described  as  ""best  friends""  as  well  as 
 
mother and daughter. You decided that this could not be allowed to happen. When 
 
Sarah arrived home you surprised her, with a carrier bag, electric flex and hammer 
which you had got ready for use. After managing to put the carrier bag over her head, 
 
you killed her by hitting her repeatedly on the head with severe force. In her case too, 
the bag was secured with the flex. 
 
You then changed your clothes and made a telephone call to the police in which after 
giving your name and address you said, ""I’ve just killed my wife and daughter”.  
 
Although the lifestyle which you and your wife and daughter had chosen means that 
they  did  not  have  many  friends,  it  is  important  to  recognise  that  they  do  not  go 
unmourned. There are other family members who loved them and miss them, and will 

 

2
--------
continue to do so. Nothing I say or do can restore the loss which your conduct has 
 
caused, or can fill the gap which has been left. I have taken into account in particular 
 
the dignified and generous statement of Jean’s brother, Sarah’s uncle, who describes 
 
the  impact  which  their  deaths  has  had  on  him  and  his  struggle  to  understand  what 
happened on that dreadful day. 
 
I will deal first with the sentence for count 2, the murder of your daughter Sarah. 
 
The sentence for murder is fixed by law and is a sentence of imprisonment for life, 
 
but  I  must  also  set  the  minimum  term  which  you  must  serve  before  you  can  be 
considered for release on licence. In your case the setting of a minimum term is in one 
 
sense academic, because your age and the cancer from which you suffer make it as 
certain as anything can be that you will die in prison whatever minimum term I set. 
Indeed I am told by your counsel that your condition has deteriorated notably in the 
 
months you have been in prison. Nevertheless it is important that the minimum term 
should mark the gravity of your crime.  
 
It  is  common  ground  that  the  appropriate  starting  point  in  your  case,  applying  the 
principles laid down by statute, is a minimum term of 15 years, although any starting 
point is subject to adjustment to take account of the particular circumstances of the 
case. Here there are both aggravating and mitigating circumstances which need to be 
taken into account. 
 
The killing of your daughter was aggravated by your use of a weapon, the hammer, 
and by the fact that it took place in your daughter's own home, where she was entitled 
to feel secure and protected. Instead she suffered a cruel death at the hands of her own 
father. We cannot imagine how she must have felt in what must thankfully have been 
 
those  brief  moments  before  she  died,  with  a  bag  over  her  head  and  hammer  blows 
raining down. Her killing involved also a degree of planning, as you assembled the 
items  which  you  would  use  to  kill  her  and  laid  in  wait  for  her  return.  There  is  no 
 
question here of acting on impulse. The killing was aggravated too by the fact that 
you had just killed your wife. If you had been convicted of the murder of your wife, in 
which case it would have been a double murder, I would have been required to take a 

 

3
--------
starting  point  of  the  order  of  30  years.  As  it  is,  your  killing  of  your  wife  was 
manslaughter and not murder, but it still represents a significant aggravating factor. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  there  are  also  mitigating  factors.  You  had  hitherto  lived  a 
 
blameless life and I accept that on the evidence these tragic events would never have 
taken  place  if  not  for  the  side-effects  of  the  drugs  which  you  had  been  taking. 
Although  in  the  case  of  your  daughter's  killing,  there  is  no  question  of  a  plea  of 
diminished responsibility, the fact that you were suffering from depression as a result 
of  these  drugs  and  acted  in  all  probability  under  the  influence  of  that  depression 
 
reduces your culpability to some extent. That this may be so is a factor which the law 
recognises.  In  the  present  case,  however,  the  reduction  in  culpability  is  limited. 
Having killed your wife apparently on the spur of the moment, you made a deliberate 
and dreadful decision that you would kill your daughter too. She was a young woman 
with most of her life before her, happy in her job as a shop assistant, and appreciated 
by those with whom she worked. Even though you were depressed, you knew what 
you were doing, you planned how you would do it and you had time to think about it 
 
while  you  waited  for  your  daughter  to  come  home.  So  although  I  can  reduce  your 
 
minimum  term  to  some  extent  to  take  account  of  your  depression  and  its  effect,  I 
cannot do so by much. I take into account also by way of mitigation your age and the 
devastating blow which the diagnosis of your bone cancer represented, transforming 
as  it  did  a  contented  family  life  and  amounting  already  to  a  different  kind  of  life 
 
sentence. I recognise also that although you only pleaded guilty on the first day of 
your  trial,  you  have  never  denied  that  you  killed  your  wife  and  daughter,  and  that 
from the outset your telephone call to the police acknowledged that you had. 
 
Balancing these considerations, and before taking specific account of your guilty plea, 
I would have concluded that the appropriate minimum term would be 18 years. I shall 
reduce this by one year to take account of your plea. 
 
Accordingly  the  sentence  on  count  2  for  the  murder  of  your  daughter  Sarah  is  life 
imprisonment with a minimum term of 17 years less the time that you have spent on 
remand in custody. 
 

 

4
--------
I turn now to deal with count 1, the manslaughter of your wife Jean. For this I propose 
to pass a determinate sentence. Even without your conviction for murder on count 2, 
 
there would be no question of any alternative disposal on count 1. I bear in mind that I 
have already taken Jean’s killing into account as an aggravating feature in fixing the 
 
minimum term for the murder of your daughter. Sentences for manslaughter are not 
fixed  by  law  in  the  way  murder  sentences  are,  and  the  statutory  aggravating  and 
mitigating factors do not apply in quite the same way. Nevertheless the harm done by 
manslaughter, namely the loss of a life and the devastating impact which that loss has 
on friends and family is much the same as in cases of murder. The culpability of an 
offender is less than in a case of murder, but is by no means extinguished. Although 
 
your  responsibility  was  diminished,  you  did  still  intend  to  kill.  The  sentence  for 
manslaughter must therefore bear some relationship to what the sentence would have 
 
been for murder and I must and do have regard to the statutory factors to the extent 
that they are capable of applying. I bear in mind also that in the case of a determinate 
sentence, only half of the sentence would be served in prison, so that the minimum 
term  of  17  years  which  I  have  fixed  in  the  case  of  count  2  is  equivalent  to  a 
determinate sentence of 34 years. 
 
 
In  your  case  the  sentence  on  count  1  is  in  a  sense  academic  in  view  of  the  life 
sentence which you must serve on count 2, but once again the sentence is important in 
order to mark the gravity of your offence and the precious and irreplaceable nature of 
human life. 
 
 
Taking all these matters into account, and taking account also of your guilty plea on 
the first day of the trial, I conclude that the sentence on count 1 will be 12 years.  
 
Peter Redfern, the sentences which I pass on you are, on count one, 12 years, and on 
count 2, a life sentence with a minimum term of 17 years less time served on remand. 
The sentences will of course be concurrent. 
 
I order the destruction of the hammer, flex and carrier bags.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF HH JUDGE HILLIARD QC
 

 

1.	  Alan Ostler, you have pleaded guilty to one offence of committing misconduct in a public 

 

 

 

office. You pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity and so you will receive full 
 

credit for that. 

 

 

2.	  You  were  employed  by  Broadmoor  hospital  as  an  Assistant  Technical   Instructor.  You 
 

 

 

 

 

had been employed there for 6 years when in 2008 you made contact with a newspaper 

 

 

 

 

 

because you wanted to sell a story about a patient at the hospital where you worked and 

 

 

 

where as a result, you had obtained information which you passed on about the patient’s 

 

gender re-assignment process. It is quite plain from all the material I have seen that your 
 

 

 

 

motivation  was  financial,  although  in  the  event  you  did  not  receive  any  money  for  the 

 

 

information about this patient. Your offence is aggravated by the fact that you sought to 

 

 

 

establish  a  relationship  with  another  newspaper  for  which  the  motivation  was  also 
 

 

commercial.
--------
3.	  Offences of misconduct in a public office are always serious. The public are entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expect that those who hold a public office and are paid by the public will not abuse that 

 

 

 

 

 

 
trust  for  money  as  you  sought  to  do.  This  offence,  however,  is  at  the  lower  end  of  the 

 

 

 
scale.  You  did  not  hold  a  senior  position  and  were  not  in  fact  paid  money  for  the 

 

 

 
information  which  is  the  subject  of  the  charge  to  which  you  have  pleaded  guilty. 

 

 
Nonetheless,  offences  of  this  kind  will  usually  warrant  a  sentence  of  immediate 

 

 

 

 
imprisonment. Your Counsel accepts that this offence crosses the custody threshold. 

 

 

 
4.	  You are 32 years old. You have no previous convictions. Your previous good character is 

 

 

 

 

 

underlined by the character references I have read. In particular, you  have not been in 

 

 
any other trouble in the 5 and a half years or so since you committed this offence. The 

 

  
time which has elapsed is significant. 

 

 

 

5.	  In all the circumstances of this particular case which I have outlined, in my judgment the 

 

 

 
proper  course  is  to  suspend  the  sentence  of  imprisonment  which  must  be  passed.  In  

 

 

 

addition,  you  must  be  further  punished  by  a  requirement  that  you  do unpaid  work  for 

 

 

 

 

 

  
the community. 

 
6.	  The sentence is one of 7 months imprisonment which will be suspended for a period of 

 

 

 

18 months. In addition, you must perform 150 hours of unpaid work.",2014-01-17 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales : 

Introduction 
 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
1.	 

These two appeals are being heard together as they raise issues of principle in relation 
 
to the level of fines to be imposed for breaches of safety and environmental protection 
legislation  on  very  large  companies  –Sellafield  Limited  (Sellafield  Ltd)  with  a 
turnover  of  £1.6bn  and  Network  Rail  Infrastructure  Ltd  (Network  Rail)  with  a 
turnover of £6.2bn. 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

Sellafield  Ltd  was  fined  £700,000  at  the  Crown  Court  at  Carlisle  on  7 
February 2013 for offences arising out of the disposal of radioactive waste. 

Network Rail was fined £500,000 in the Crown Court at Ipswich on 27 June 
2013 for an offence arising out of a collision at an unmanned level crossing, 
 
causing very serious injuries to a child. 

 
2.	 

Both  companies  seek  leave  to  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  fines  were  manifestly 
excessive.  We grant leave. 

The general principles 

 
3.	 

It is important at the outset to recall the provisions which Parliament has enacted in 
the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  (CJA  2003)  in  relation  to  the  duty  of  the  courts  in 
sentencing, as these principles are applicable to all offenders, including companies: 

 
i) 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

The  courts  must  have  regard  in  dealing  with  offenders  to  the  purposes  of 
 
sentencing which Parliament specified as (a) the punishment of offenders (b) 
the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence), (c) the reform 
and  rehabilitation  of  offenders,  (d)  the  protection  of  the  public,  and  (e)  the 
making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences (s.142 
of the CJA 2003). 

In considering the seriousness of the offence the court must have regard to the 
culpability of the offender and the harm caused or which might foreseeably be 
caused (s.143 of the CJA 2003). 

If a court decides on a fine it must approach the fixing of fines having regard 
not only to the purposes of sentencing and the seriousness of the offence, but 
 
must also take into account the criteria set out in s.164 of the CJA 2003:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
(1) Before fixing the amount of any fine to be imposed on 
an offender who is an individual, a court must inquire into 
his financial circumstances. 

(2) The amount of any fine fixed by a court must be such as, 
in  the  opinion  of  the  court,  reflects  the  seriousness  of  the 
offence. 

(3)  In  fixing  the  amount  of  any  fine  to  be  imposed  on  an 
offender  (whether  an  individual  or  other  person),  a  court 
must  take  into  account  the  circumstances  of  the  case 
including, among other things, the financial circumstances of 
 
the offender so far as they are known, or appear, to the court. 

(4)  Subsection  (3)  applies  whether  taking  into  account  the 
financial  circumstances  of  the  offender  has  the  effect  of 
increasing or reducing the amount of the fine. 

There  can  be  no  doubt  as  to  the  objective  in  applying  these  principles  when 
sentencing  a  company  for  offences  against  health  and  safety  and  environmental 
legislation.  As Scott Baker J stated in giving the judgment of this court R v F Howe 
& Son (Engineers) Ltd  [1999] 2 All ER 249 at 255, [1999] 2 Cr App R (S) 37 at 44 

“The objective of prosecutions for health and safety offences in 
the work place is to achieve a safe environment for those who 
work  there  and  for  other  members  of  the  public  who  may  be 
 
affected. A fine needs to be large enough to bring that message 
home where the defendant is a company not only to those who 
manage it but also to its shareholders.” 

Where a fine is to be imposed a court will therefore first consider the seriousness of 
the  offence  and  then  the  financial  circumstances  of  the  offender.    The  fact  that  the 
defendant to a criminal charge is a company with a turnover in excess of £1 billion 
makes no difference to that basic approach.  

The fine must be fixed to meet the statutory purposes with the objective of ensuring 
that  the  message  is  brought  home  to  the  directors  and  members  of  the  company 
(usually the shareholders).  The importance of the application of s.164 in relation to 
corporate  defendants  was  reinforced  in  the  Definitive  Guideline  of  the  Sentencing 
 
Guidelines Council Corporate Manslaughter & Health and Safety Offences Causing 
Death, published in 2010.  It has been reflected in more recent decisions of this court: 
 
see for example: R v Tufnells Park Express Ltd [2012] EWCA Crim 222 at para 43 
(the fine after trial  on a company with a turnover of £100m and profitability of £7.7m 
was £225,000; this represented, as the court noted, 2.9% of its operating profit).  

It  will  therefore  always  be  necessary  in  the  case  of  companies  with  a  turnover  in 
excess of £1 billion to examine with great care and in some detail the structure of the

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
company, its turnover and profitability as well as the remuneration of the directors. 
 
Although the appellant companies are similar in that they are companies with such a 
turnover, they differ considerably.  Sellafield Ltd is an ordinary commercial company 
 
which makes profits for its shareholders who are large multinational companies.  In 
contrast,  the  parent  company  of  Network  Rail,  Network  Rail  Limited,  has  no 
shareholders who receive profits; its members derive no profit from the company.  It 
 
invests  its  profit  in  the  rail  infrastructure.    Both  discharge  important  services  of  a 
public nature that have from time to time been directly undertaken by the State.  This 
appeal illustrates the close analysis required.  We turn to that analysis at paragraphs 
 
52 and following after we have set out the facts and considered the seriousness of the 
 
offence; as this court has repeatedly stated, the size of the penalty will depend on the 
facts of each case. 

 

1.  THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING OF SELLAFIELD LTD 

 

(1)	 
 

 

The stringent standards of safety imposed by the legislative regime 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

The processing and storage of nuclear waste is a by-product of an activity of national 
 
economic importance: the generation of electricity by nuclear power.  

It carries with it potentially grave risks.  To mitigate those risks the most stringent 
 
standards  have  been  adopted  at  national  and  international  levels.    In  the  United 
Kingdom  they  have  been  laid  down  in  licences  granted  under  the  Radioactive 
 
Substances  Acts  1948,  1960  and  1993  and,  more  recently,  by  the  Environmental 
Permitting Regulations 2010.  The UK is also a signatory to the European Agreement 
 
for  the  International  Carriage  of  Dangerous  Goods  by  Road  –  an  agreement  made 
 
under UN auspices – to which effect is given by the Carriage of Dangerous Goods 
and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009.  These instruments 
 
set out detailed and specific provision for the sorting, carriage and disposal of nuclear 
waste. 

 
10.	 

The public rightly expects strict compliance with those standards.   

(2)  The offences committed 
 

 

 
11.	 

Between  15  November  2008  and  19  April  2010  Sellafield  Ltd  breached  those 
standards in a variety of ways in relation to the system for segregating non-radioactive 
waste from radioactive waste and for disposing of it.   

 

 
12. 

On  7  February  2013,  Sellafield  Ltd  had  pleaded  guilty  at  the  Magistrates’  Court  at 
 
Workington  to  seven  offences.  The  Magistrates  committed  Sellafield  Ltd  to  the

13.	 

Crown  Court  as  they  considered  their  sentencing  powers  were  insufficient;  the 
maximum penalty they could have imposed was £230,000.  

A fine of £700,000 was imposed on 14 June 2013 by HH Judge Peter Hughes QC at 
 
Carlisle  Crown  Court,  being  made  up  of  a  fine  of  £100,000  for  each  of  the  seven 
offences.  Five  contraventions  of  different  statutory  requirements  were  set  out  in 
seven charges.  Two pairs of charges covered the same factual allegations, but were 
 
separately laid because of change in the statutory regime which took effect on 5 April 
2010.  Sellafield Ltd 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

 
v)	 

Operated a regulated facility other than in accordance with an environmental 
 
permit  on  or  about  12  April  2010  by  disposing  of  radioactive  waste  at  a 
landfill  site  contrary  to  Regulation  38(1)  of  the  Environmental  Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010. 

Failed to comply with or contravened a condition of an authorisation or permit 
by failing to check the effectiveness of systems equipment and procedures for 
the  disposal  of  radioactive  waste  contrary  to  Section  13  of  the  Radioactive 
 
Substances  Act  1993  between  1  November  2009  and  5  April  2010  and 
Regulation 38(2) of the 2010 Regulations between 6 April and 19 April 2010. 

Failed to comply with or contravened a condition of an authorisation or permit 
by  failing  to  have  a  management  system,  organisational  structure  and 
 
resources  in  place  sufficient  to  achieve  compliance  with  their  conditions 
 
contrary  to  Section  13  of  the  1993  Act  between  15  November  2008  and  5 
April 2010 and Regulation 38(2) of the 2010 Regulations between 6 April and 
19 April 2010.

The processing of exempt waste and the failures by Sellafield Ltd 

(i) 

	Exempt waste
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
 
14.	 

 
Sellafield  Ltd  generates  substantial  quantities  of  waste  from  its  activities  at  its 
extensive site at Sellafield in Cumbria.  Much of it is not radioactive.  Such waste may 
be disposed of as non-toxic waste by ordinary means of waste disposal, principally in 
landfill sites.  This is known as “exempt waste”.   

(ii)  The new system for identifying exempt waste 

 

In  2009  Sellafield  Ltd  set  about  establishing  a  means  of  identifying  exempt  waste 
 
gathered  from  all  over  the  site  for  disposal  as  such.  The  template  was  a  system 
already  established  in  one  of  the  buildings  on  site  for  waste  generated  within  it  – 
 
B222.5.  Waste  was  to  be  sorted  by  a  so-called  “waste  route”  into  radioactive  and 
exempt  waste.    The  first  step  was  to  identify  categories  of  waste  likely  to  be 
classifiable  as  exempt  waste  –  for  example  mop-heads  and  office  equipment.    The 
next  was  to  measure  surface  radioactivity  by  handheld  monitors.    The  results  were 
logged on a form known as “F116/Form 2”.  The waste was then taken in bags to a 
 
purpose-designated building F116. 

In that building the waste was to be passed through two monitoring devices similar to 
those  operating  in  B222.5:  an  Initial  Segregation  Monitor  and  an  Exempt  Waste 
 
Monitor.  Each device contained two detector heads, set to measure the risk, if any, 
posed to humans by radiation in microsieverts per hour – the dosage of radiation: a 
G35 monitor head which measured radiation up to 20 microsieverts per hour, and a 
 
G64 head which measured radiation up to 100 microsieverts per hour.  The G35 head 
was so configured that it could not measure a dosage greater than 20 microsieverts per 
hour.  Waste  with  a  dosage  above  that  level  was  passed  to  the  G64  head  for 
measurement.   

Any waste passed through the Initial Segregation Monitor with a dosage level greater 
than zero (or, perhaps, greater than a fraction above zero) should have been set aside 
as low level radioactive waste – non-exempt waste.  Apparently exempt waste was 
then passed into the Exempt Waste Monitor for a second and final check.  It produced 
an assay report, retrievable at the press of a button, for each bag of waste.  If a bag 
was not radioactive, the measured dose should have been shown in microsieverts per 
 
If  the  detector  heads  in  both  devices  were  properly 
hour  as  zero  or  near-zero. 
calibrated, no waste other than exempt waste should have been passed for disposal as 
such. 

Unfortunately  they  were  not.  The  G35  monitors  were  correctly  calibrated  in  both 
devices and performed their function satisfactorily; but the G64 monitors were not. 
 
For them to function effectively, their software had to be adjusted to apply an Activity 
Conversion Factor – i.e. a multiplier – to the dosage which they were measuring.  As 
installed and delivered by the manufacturers, the multiplier was set at zero.  It had to 
be  re-calibrated  to  function effectively.    It  was  not.  Accordingly,  whatever  dosage 
was given off by waste bags passing the G64 heads, the dosage registered was zero.  It 
was, accordingly, possible for waste with a dosage over 20 microsieverts per hour to

be passed through the devices as if the dosage was zero and so set aside for disposal 
as exempt waste. 

 
(iii)  The extent of the failure in the system 

 

 
19.	 

 
20.	 

 
21.	 

 
22.	 

 
The system was installed in May 2009 and brought into full operation in November 
2009.  The first batch of exempt waste was dispatched from the site on 12 April 2010 
to  a  nearby  landfill  site.    Four  thousand  further  bags  of  supposedly  exempt  waste 
passed through the monitors with an apparent dosage of zero microsieverts per hour. 
 
In  fact  a  small  number  of  bags  –  five  out  of  five  thousand  –  had  dosage  levels  in 
excess  of  20  microsieverts  per  hour.    The  error  in  the  setup  of  the  devices  was 
discovered  by  chance  on  19  April  2010  when,  during  a  training  exercise,  a  bag  of 
waste  with  a  dosage  of  41  microsieverts  per  hour  was  passed  through  them  and 
wrongly classified as exempt waste.   

The  error  was  discovered  when  the  operator  checked  the  assay  produced  by  the 
Exempt  Waste  Monitor  and  saw  the  dosage  level  there  recorded.    This  led  to  the 
taking  of  immediate  steps  to  identify  the  problem  and  its  extent  and  to  alert  the 
relevant authorities and the operators of the landfill site to which the first batch of one 
thousand bags had been dispatched. 

Once alerted to the problem, Sellafield Ltd did all they could to ensure that no harm 
came  to  anyone.    It  is  as  near  certain  as  can  be  that  none  has.    Five  bags  were 
identified from the assay report with dosages of between 23 and 32 microsieverts per 
hour.  Four  had  been  dispatched  to  the  landfill  site  and  one  retained  on  site. 
Measurements taken at the landfill site vastly exceeded the low level permitted to be 
deposited at the site – 0.4 bequerels per gram (a measure of the radiation emitted by 
 
an object).  Three of the bags were within the lowest category of toxic waste – low 
level radioactive waste – and one was within the next category – intermediate level 
radioactive waste. 

 

There was expert evidence that exposure to the four bags by anyone who might have 
 
handled  them  would  have  been  no  greater  than  a  passenger  would  experience  on  a 
flight  to  Paris.    There  was  agreed  expert  evidence  that  had  the  problem  not  been 
discovered for a long time – years – and non-exempt waste of this category had been 
regularly handled, there would have been a very small but perceptible increase in the 
 
risk of death from cancer to those handling it.   

(iv)  The errors should have been avoided 

 

 
23.	 

The prosecution case, which was not disputed, was that the errors which led to this 
state  of  affairs  were  readily  avoidable  and  that  Sellafield  Ltd  had  numerous 
 
opportunities to avoid them, as follows:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
 
i)	  There  was  an  error  in  specification.  Sellafield  Ltd  ordered  two  Exempt  Waste 
Monitors  instead  of  one  Initial  Segregation  Monitor  and  one  Exempt  Waste 
Monitor.  In  consequence,  the  manufacturers  did  not  calibrate  the  G64  detector 
head on the Initial Segregation Monitor to enable it to perform its function.  

   

 

ii)  The  re-calibration  necessary of  the  G64  head  in  the  Initial  Segregation  Monitor 
(and as was carried out after 19 April 2010) of the G64 head in the Exempt Waste 
 
Monitor was not performed by the staff of Sellafield Ltd.  There was no system in 
place to ensure that it would be.   

 

iii) The G64 head in both monitors was not tested during trials.  If a test similar to that 
performed on 19 April 2010 or a simulated exercise replicating the conditions of 
that test had been performed, the miscalibration would have been revealed. 

 

iv)  No  comparison  was  ever  made  between  the  results  produced  by  the  handheld 
devices used to measure surface radiation on the bags recorded in F116/Form 2 
and the results produced by the Exempt Waste Monitor. 

 

v)	  No check of the assay reports produced by the Exempt Waste Monitor was made. 
 
If it had been, it would have alerted the operator to the dosage of the five bags of 
waste wrongly classified as exempt waste. 

vi)  No routine checking of the calibration of the detector heads was performed. 

 

(v) 

	Culpability and harm 

 
24.	 

The judge summarised the significance of the failures: 

“The mistake that was made in this case was a fundamental one 
in the setting up, the testing and the subsequent monitoring of 
the equipment. That such a basic mistake could possibly occur 
in  what  needs  to  be  an  industry  managed  and  operated  with 
scrupulous care for public safety and the environment is bound 
to  be  a  matter  of  grave  concern  to  everyone  and  particularly 
local  residents  in  Cumbria.  What  adds  significantly  to  the 
concern and the seriousness of the mistake is that it had been in 
existence  and  allowed  to  go  undetected  for  the  period  of  4 
months or so that the system had been in use.” 

 
25.	 

The  prosecution  alleged,  Sellafield  Ltd  accepted,  and  the  judge  found,  that  these 
 
failings 

“indicate  basic  management  failures  and  a  deeply  concerning 
lack of procedures formally established and rigorously enforced
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

 

to ensure that equipment was properly set up at the outset and 
regularly and routinely checked.” 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
26.	 

This led the judge to conclude that 

“The  management  failures  are  not  confined  to  specific 
individuals  or  failures  at  certain  levels  to  follow  established 
They  demonstrate…a  custom  within  the 
procedures. 
company which was too lax and…to a degree complacent, 
 
and senior management must bear its share of responsibility.” 
(Our emphasis). 

 

 

 
27.	 

He identified three aggravating features: 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

The failure was not isolated but systemic. 

It  potentially  exposed  those  who  handled  waste  off-site  and  the  public  to 
unnecessary risk. 

It was not a first offence.  A prohibition notice had been served on 28 June 
 
2008, one year before installation of the new monitors, by the Department of 
Transport for breach of Regulation 5 of the 2009 Regulations.  Sellafield Ltd 
had  been  fined  twice  for  incidents  involving  the  emission  of  radioactive 
material in 2005 and 2007 - £500,000 and £75,000 respectively.  

 
28.	 

He  also  took  into  account  the  mitigating  factors  already  mentioned.    The  breaches 
 
were not deliberate or reckless; no harm had been done and the actual risk of harm 
was relatively low; Sellafield Ltd had readily co-operated with the authorities and had 
pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.  

(4) The grounds of the appeal 

 
29.	 

It was submitted that the fine was manifestly excessive.  There was no actual harm 
and a very low risk of harm.  No credit was given for the guilty pleas and the degree 
 
of co-operation with the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. 
 
The  level  of  fine  imposed  equated  with  a  major  public  disaster  or  loss  of  life,  a 
significant nuclear event or an unmitigated environmental pollution incident.  There 
was no appeal against the order for costs. 

(5)  Our conclusion on harm and culpability
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
 
30.	 

 
31.	 

 
There was in effect no actual harm, as we have explained at paragraph 22.  There was 
a foreseeable risk of some perceptible harm if the failure had not been detected for a 
number of years; this risk can properly be characterised as very low.  We therefore 
take into account, as s.143(1) requires us to do, the fact that there was in effect no 
actual harm but there was a very small risk of some harm. 

The judge found that there had been a custom in the company Sellafield Ltd which 
was  too  lax  and  complacent;  that  senior  management  must  bear  a  share  of  the 
responsibility.  We can see no basis for criticising that finding.  The failure was easily 
avoidable  and  could  and  should  have  been  detected  very  quickly;  there  was  the 
 
clearest  negligence.    We  therefore  conclude  that  for  an  incident  of  this  kind  the 
culpability was medium. 

 

2.  THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING OF NETWORK RAIL 

 

(1)  The accident 

(i) 	

The level crossing at Wright’s Crossing 

 
32.	 

 
33.	 

Network  Rail  took  over  the  rail  infrastructure  in  2002  and  has  since  then  been 
responsible for the level crossings on that infrastructure.  One of these crossings is 
Wright’s  Crossing  on  the  East  Suffolk  line.  It  is  what  is  known  as  a  user  worked 
crossing.  It is on private land and provides access to a farm split into two distinct 
parts by the construction of the line.  At Wright’s Crossing the East Suffolk line is a 
single line with a speed limit for trains of 55mph.  About 19 trains a day pass over the 
 
crossing. 

The crossing is protected by gates across the road.  To cross the line in a car the gates 
have to be opened before the vehicle crosses and closed when it has crossed.  Safe use 
of the crossing depends on the user seeing an oncoming train.  However the sight lines 
are not good, as the track is curved with high vegetation on each side.  There was no 
telephone,  but  in  bad  weather  or  when  large  machinery  was  crossing  the  line,  Mr 
Wright,  the  farmer  whose  farm  was  accessed  by  the  crossing  would  telephone  the 
signal box at Saxmundham. 

(ii)  3 July 2010 

On  3  July  2010  at  about  8.30  in  the  evening,  Mr  Wright  drove  his  4x4  car  to  the 
 
crossing.  He was accompanied by his 10 year old grandson and his dog.  Mr Wright 
stopped at the crossing, opened the first gate looked both ways, crossed on foot and 
opened  the  second  gate.  He  looked  both  ways  again  and  then  re-crossed  the  track

back to his car.  He told his grandson to get out of the driver’s seat and back into the 
rear seats.  His grandson did so after about 15-30 seconds.  Mr Wright got into the car 
and drove towards the crossing. 

As  he  was  about  to  cross  the  line,  he  saw  a  train  coming  and  braked,  but  the  car 
slipped on the loose gravel and was hit by the train.  The grandson was thrown out of 
the car and his head struck the track.  Mr Wright was badly bruised but his grandson 
had suffered a brain stem bleed; despite extensive hospital treatment the accident has 
changed his life. 

The victim impact statement in respect of the grandson sets out the devastating effect 
 
that the accident had had.  The hospital had given him a 5% chance of survival.  He 
 
had  not  had  a  normal  childhood.    He  would  need  teaching  support,  a  scribe  and  a 
 
reader throughout his education; his brain’s processing speed was 50% of normal.  He 
 
had right side blindness, his peripheral vision was damaged and he had to avoid all 
contact sports.  He had a titanium plate in his head.  His future prognosis would not be 
known until he was 21 or 22. 

(2)  The proceedings 

(i)  Network Rail’s plea of guilty 

 
37.	 

 
38.	 

Network Rail accepted that it was guilty of significant failings in relation to the risk 
 
assessment of Wright’s Crossing; that, if a proper risk assessment of the crossing had 
been made prior to the accident, then a telephone connected to the signal box would 
have been installed.  One had been installed at the crossing after the accident.  

 

Network Rail therefore pleaded guilty, on a basis of plea, at the Lowestoft Magistrates 
Court on 13 March 2013  to an offence of failing to discharge a duty under s.3(1) of 
the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.  The basis of plea reflected the facts and 
aggravating  and  mitigating  features  to  which  we  will  refer.    It  apologised  to  the 
grandson  and  his  family.    The  magistrates  committed  the  case  for  sentence  to  the 
Crown Court at Ipswich, as the maximum fine it could impose was £20,000.  On 27 
June 2013 the sentencing hearing took place before Judge Holt sitting at the Crown 
Court at Ipswich. 

 

(ii)  The significant failures of Network Rail 

 
39.	 

In 1996 guidance was issued in the form of Railway Safety Principles and Guidance 
in respect of user worked crossings.  The guidance set out a number of factors that 
 
had to be taken into account in any risk assessment of such a level crossing.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
 
40.	 

 
41.	 

Prior to the accident there were risk assessments on 15 January 2000, 24 September 
2003, 4 March 2007 and 12 April 2009.  Those in 2007 and 2009 were carried out by 
Mobile Operations Managers for Network Rail.  There was a maintenance inspection 
on 28 January 2010. 

Elementary mistakes were made in the assessment.  It should have been obvious to 
those  conducting  the  risk  inspections  and  to  those  more  senior  persons  within 
Network Rail responsible for level crossings that, because of the nature of the use of 
the crossing and the sight lines, a telephone should have been installed so that anyone 
crossing the line could ring up and find out if a train was on its way.  The sight lines 
were such that, given the time it would take to cross and the speed of the trains on the 
line,  there  was  an  obvious  and  serious  risk  of  a  collision.    It  is  also  of  particular 
importance that in the risk assessment carried out in 2003 the assessor concluded that 
the crossing was not safe, but no steps were taken to remedy it over the following 6 
 
years, particularly by installing a telephone.  As we have noted, after the accident, a 
telephone was installed at Wright’s Crossing. 

 
42.	 

The judge found that there was that obvious risk and it was readily reducible.  He also 
found  that  the  risk  assessments  were  poorly  done;  there  were  repeated  failures  to 
follow the correct guidance.  In 2007, Network Rail had installed a computer system; 
 
the risk assessments in 2007 and 2009 were inputted into it, but the programme used 
did  not  spot  the  inconsistencies.  Network  Rail  were  unable  to  explain  this  failure. 
 
 
We consider that these findings were amply justified on the evidence. 

(iii)  The aggravating and mitigating factors 

 
43.	 

 
In  accordance  with  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  R  v  Friskies  Petcare  UK  Limited 
[2000]  2  Cr  App  R  (S)  401,  aggravating  and mitigating  features  were  identified  in 
what is commonly called a “Friskies schedule”.  The aggravating features were:-

 
i)	 

The injuries to Mr Wright and his grandson resulted from exposure to risk at 
Wright’s crossing. 

 
ii)	 

Serious injury was eminently foreseeable. 

 
iii)	 

The risk had been obvious for many years. 

 
iv)	 

Network  Rail’s  assessment  of  the  risk  and  its  implementation  of  control 
 
measures fell substantially below the standard expected. 

 
v) 

All users of the crossing had been exposed to risk.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

 
 
44.	 

There were the following mitigating features:- 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

 
v)	 

Network Rail pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. 

Network Rail has cooperated with the investigation. 

 
Network  Rail  acted  after  the  accident  to  improve  safety  by  implementing  a 
speed  restriction  and  the  installation  of  telephones.    It  made  changes  to  its 
level  crossing  teams  and  their  approach  to  the  assessment  of  risk  and 
implementation of control measures after the accident. 

Network  Rail  had  in  recent  years  taken  steps  to  improve  safety  at  level 
crossings. 

Network Rail took its health and safety responsibilities very seriously.  Safety 
performance had improved significantly in recent years.  In the context of its 
size and the complexity of its organisation, Network Rail had a good safety 
record. 

 
vi)	 

Network Rail’s failings did not arise from an attempt to save money or place 
profit before safety. 

vii)	  Network Rail’s income came from public funds and profit was reinvested in 

 

the network to improve safety and performance. 

 
45.	 

In his very clear sentencing remarks, the judge carefully examined this schedule; the 
 
fact  that  it  was  agreed  does  not  mean  that  the  judge  in  performance  of  his  duties 
 
should  accept  it  uncritically.  In  our  judgment,  he  was  quite  entitled  to  make  the 
 
following  observations  in  relation  to  the  mitigating  features  relied  on  by  Network 
Rail: 

 

(a)  As  to  (iii)  that  the  accident  was  a  poor  indictment  of  the  training  of  Network 
Rail’s staff who had a very important role in assessing the safety of unmanned 
level crossings which was a recognised source of danger nationally.  

 

(b)  As to (iv), the judge found it difficult to accept that the installing of the computer 
 
system in respect of level crossings was a panacea on the basis of what had been 
explained  to  him.
  This  conclusion  was  criticised  by  Network  Rail  as  the 
computer system had been approved by the Office of the Rail Regulation.  We do 
not consider this criticism of the judge’s view was justified.  It was no panacea. 
  
Network Rail had not, as we have set out at paragraph 42, explained how the use 
of  the  system  had  failed  to  expose  the  serious  inconsistencies  between  the
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

assessments,  which  would  have  demonstrated  the  lack  of  safety  at  Wright’s 
 
Crossing.  Moreover  as  the  Crown  rightly  pointed  out,  the  utility  of  the 
programme depended on the data inputted into it. 

 

(c)  As to (v), its safety record, the judge considered that that record had to be seen in 
the context of its previous convictions.  He concluded that Network Rail’s record 
was not unblemished; the size and complexity of an organisation was not much 
mitigation. 

 

(d)  As to (vi), he did not regard that as significant mitigation as tax payers and the 
 
public expected first call on public funds to be the safety of the public and those 
who used level crossings. 

We see no basis for any possible criticism of these clear findings. 

 (iv)  Network Rail’s previous convictions 

 

 
46.	 

The  list  of  previous  convictions  provided  to  the  Crown  Court  and  to  us  show  a 
number of convictions for breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act over the years 
 
from 1997.  Some were relatively minor such as inadequate maintenance of line side 
 
fencing and some very serious such as the fine of £3.5m imposed upon Network Rail 
 
in 2005 in respect of the deaths of 4 persons when a GNER passenger train derailed at 
Hatfield on 17 October 2000.  Four convictions for breach of s.3 of the Health and 
 
Safety at Work Act were of particular relevance as the events had occurred prior to 
the accident at Wright’s Crossing.

ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

A conviction on 16 July 2009 in respect of an incident when a passenger train 
was derailed at Croxton AHB level crossing in September 2006; Network Rail 
was fined £70,000. 

A conviction on 26 November 2010 when Network Rail was fined £75,000 in 
respect  of  a  fatal  accident  at  West  Lodge  footpath  crossing  on  22  January 
2008. 

A conviction on 15 March 2012 when Network Rail was fined £1m in respect 
of  the  killing  of  two  teenage  girls  when  crossing  a  station  footpath  in 
 
December 2005; Network Rail had failed to carry out proper assessment of the 
risk to safety of members of the public in the years 2001 and 2005. 

A  conviction  on  12  June  2012  when  Network  Rail  was  fined  £356,250  in 
respect  of  its  failure  to  act  on  evidence  that  pedestrians  using  a  crossing  in 
Wiltshire had insufficient sight of approaching trains.  A death had resulted in

The sentence at the Crown Court 

Network Rail was fined £500,000, ordered that they should pay £23,421.74 by way of 
costs  and  £15  victim’s  surcharge.    The  application  for  leave  to  appeal  was  only 
against the fine imposed. 

(3)  The grounds of the appeal 

 
48.	 

It was submitted that, as there had been a guilty plea at the first available opportunity, 
the starting point was far too high.  The judge had failed to take into account previous 
 
cases; in R v Network Rail [2010] EWCA Crim 1225 where this court had observed 
that a fine of £666,667 imposed where two had been killed was severe.  Reference 
was made to other cases where lower fines had been imposed such as R v TDG (UL) 
 
Ltd [2009] ICR 127,  R v John Pointon and Sons Ltd  [2008] 2 Cr App R (S) 82, R v 
Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd  [2012] EWCA Crim 270.  It was submitted that 
fines  with  a  starting  point  of  £750,000  would  only  be  appropriate  where  there  was 
more than one fatality (or there was some significant aggravating factor), or in cases 
 
involving a public disaster and where the defendant had been convicted of the offence 
of corporate manslaughter.

It  was  also  submitted  that  the  judge  had  also  failed  to  give  sufficient  credit  for 
Network Rail’s record, its commitment to safety and that it had taken steps in recent 
years to improve safety. 
 

(4)  Our conclusion on harm and culpability 

 

 
50.	 

 
51.	 

The actual harm caused in the present case was, as is evident from the facts we have 
 
set out, serious; much greater harm was foreseeable.  

As  to  the  level  of  culpability  of  Network  Rail,  there  was  no  evidence  of  specific 
senior management failures.  The failures, serious and persistent though they were, 
were at lower operational levels. 

3.	  THE LEVEL OF FINE TO BE IMPOSED IN RESPECT OF THE SERIOUSNESS 

 

OF THE OFFENCES 

 

52.	  We  turn  to  consider  how,  in  the  light  of  our  conclusions  on  the  seriousness  of  the 
 
offences committed by the two offenders and their financial circumstances, each of 
the statutory purposes of sentencing can best be achieved.

(1)  The provision of financial and corporate information to the sentencing court 

 
53.	 

 
54.	 

To enable us to consider the financial circumstances of the offenders, we called for 
 
the accounts of both companies prior to the hearing of the appeal. 

It is important that well in advance of the sentencing hearing there is provided to the 
sentencing court the accounts of the offending companies and any other information 
(including information about the corporate structure) necessary to enable the court to 
assess the financial circumstances of the company and the most efficacious way of 
giving effect to the purposes of sentencing.  The provision of that information to the 
 
court and to counsel for the Crown will enable counsel for the Crown to present the 
information to the sentencing court so that it can carry out the analysis required. 

(2)  The corporate structure of Sellafield Ltd and its finances

56.	 

The site at Sellafield, Cumbria is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
on  behalf  of  the  State.  The  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Authority  has  awarded 
Sellafield Ltd a contract to operate the relevant part of the site.  Sellafield Ltd is a 
company  owned  by  Nuclear  Management  Partners,  a  consortium  of  three  major 
shareholders  –  the  multinationals,  URS  Corporation,  Amec  plc  and  Areva  Group. 
 
Sellafield Ltd holds the site licence. 

its  shareholders  on 

Sellafield Ltd is therefore an ordinary company owned by corporate shareholders with 
a Board of Directors.  It seeks like other commercial companies to make a profit for 
the  benefit  of 
the  Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority.  In 2012, it had a revenue of £1.6bn and made a profit of 
£29m.  Its profits go to its shareholders by way of dividend.  A financial penalty will 
therefore  directly  affect  the  shareholders.    As  it  is  such  a  narrowly  held  company, 
 
there  is  no  difficulty  in  the  three  shareholders  holding  the  directors  to  account  and 
requiring them to remedy the failures which resulted in the criminal convictions.

(3)  The corporate structure of Network Rail and its finances 

Network Rail is entirely owned by Network Rail Limited.  Network Rail Limited is a 
 
“not for dividend company”.  It has members who appoint the directors and to whom 
 
the directors are accountable.  As it has no shareholders who receive profits by way of 
 
dividend, it is in reality quite different from Sellafield Ltd. 

Its revenue of £6.2bn in the year ended 31 March 2013 is derived almost entirely from 
fees  paid  by  the  train  operating  companies  which  utilise  its  track  and  from  grants 
provided by the Department for Transport.  The profit of £780m made is re-invested 
in the rail network.

The primary governance of Network Rail Limited is the responsibility of its Board 
which  comprises  substantially  the  same  persons  as  the  Board  of  its  subsidiary 
Network  Rail.  The  Board  is  appointed  by  the  members.    These  are  over  50  in 
number.    The  Department  for  Transport  is  a  member  with  special  rights;  the  other 
members  are  appointed  members  of  the  public.    The  members  are  responsible  for 
 
holding the Board to account. 

The  executive  directors  were  paid  in  the  year  beginning  1  July  2013  basic  pay  of 
between  £577,000  and  £348,000  with  the  addition  of  contributions  to  a  pension 
scheme and performance related bonuses.  According to the annual report, the purpose 
of  a  bonuses  is  to  allow  the  business  “to  target,  reward  and  recognise  exceptional 
performance  for  stakeholders”  through  an  annual  incentive  plan  and  a  long  term 
incentive plan.  The amount of the additional remuneration (which can be up to 60% 
 
of annual salary under the annual incentive plan) is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee  by  reference  to  a  number  of  factors  such  as  passenger  and  freight 
performance, cost efficiency and passenger and customer satisfaction.  As to safety, 
the position of the Board of Network Rail Limited, as set out in its annual report for 
the year ended 31 March 2013, is: 

“Safety  of  the  workforce,  passengers  and  general  public 
remains the paramount consideration. We believe that it is not 
appropriate  to  include  safety  as  a  specific  performance 
measure. The executive directors already treat safety measures 
 
as  a  priority  as 
improve 
performance  in  this  area.  Nevertheless  the  remuneration 
committee  retains  a  wide  discretion  to  adjust  any  award 
 
downwards  for  poor  safety  performance,  particularly  in  the 
case  of  a  catastrophic  accident  for  which  Network  Rail  was 
found culpable”.

(4)  Our conclusion 

(a)  Sellafield Ltd 

61.	  We  approach  the  fine  imposed  as  an  overall  total  fine  for  the  course  of  conduct 

 

reflected in the offences charged. 

 

62.	  We  have  set  out  at  paragraphs  30-31  our  conclusions  on  the  seriousness  of  the 
offending by Sellafield Ltd – medium culpability extending to management but with 
 
no actual harm and a very low risk of harm.  We take into account the guilty pleas 
made  at  the  first  available  opportunity  and  the  very  considerable  cooperation  that 
Sellafield Ltd displayed after the discovery of the failures.  Both these factors deserve 
very considerable credit.  We also take into account the previous offences.

It is not appropriate, as was submitted on behalf of Sellafield Ltd, to consider a fine of 
£1 million as apposite only to a major disaster.  To accept that submission would be to 
ignore  the  court’s  obligation  under  s.164  of  the  CJA  2003  to  have  regard  to  the 
 
financial circumstances of the offender and the approach made clear in the Sentencing 
Guidelines Council Guideline to which we have referred at paragraph 6 above. There 
 
is no ceiling on the amount of a fine that can be imposed. 

In considering those financial circumstances, we have regard to its turnover of £1.6 
billion  (or  £30.7  million  per  week)  and  its  annual  profit  of  £29m  (or  £560,000  per 
week). 
It  is  clear  that  viewed  in  the  light  of  the  financial  circumstances  of  this 
company, a fine of £700,000 after a guilty plea is a fine which reflects a case where 
the culpability was moderate, the actual harm in effect nil and the risk of harm very 
 
low.  It must be viewed against the requirement that those engaged either as directors 
 
or shareholders of companies engaged in the nuclear industry must give the highest 
priority to safety as Parliament has directed.  

 

A fine of the size imposed, even though only a little more than a week’s profit and 
about 2% of its weekly income, would, in our view, in the circumstances achieve the 
statutory purposes of sentencing by bringing home to the directors of Sellafield Ltd 
and  its  professional  shareholders  the  seriousness  of  the  offences  committed  and 
provide a real incentive to the directors and shareholders to remedy the failures which 
the judge found existed at the site at Sellafield as we have set out at paragraphs 24-27, 
particularly  the  custom  within  the  company  which  was  too  lax  and  to  a  degree 
complacent.  If it does not have that effect, then, as in the case of any other offender, 
 
the sentence of a court for any further culpable failure would have to reflect that a fine 
 
of the size imposed for the current offences had not achieved some of the statutory 
purposes of sentencing. 

66.	  We therefore see no grounds for in any way criticising the level of fine imposed by 
 

 

the judge.  We dismiss the appeal. 

(b)  Network Rail 
 

 

67.	  We  have  set  out  at  paragraphs  50-51  our  conclusion  on  the  seriousness  of  the 
 
offending by Network Rail.  The actual harm was serious and even greater harm was 
foreseeable.    The  culpability  of  local  management  was  serious  and  persistent,  but 
there  was  no  specifically  identified  failure  by  senior  management.    However  those 
 
failures  must  be  judged  in  part  in  the  context  of  Network  Rail’s  poor  previous 
 
offending in respect of level crossings (which reflect on the senior management) but 
 
also in the light of Network Rail’s expenditure of £130m on level crossing safety – a 
 
fact that was agreed before us.  We take into account the guilty plea, the remedying of 
the  safety  failures  at  Wright’s  Crossing  and  the  other  mitigating  and  aggravating 
factors we have set out.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 

 
 
68.	  We reject the submission made on behalf of Network Rail that a fine of £750,000 was 
appropriate only where there had been a fatality.  As we have explained in respect of 
Sellafield Ltd that would be to ignore the statutory obligation to consider the means of 
 
the offender – in the case of Network Rail a turnover of £6.2 billion (or £119m per 
week) and annual profitability of £750m (or £14.4m per week).  

 
69.	 

However,  a  significant  fine  imposed  on  Network  Rail  would,  unlike  the  case  of 
Sellafield, in effect inflict no direct punishment on anyone; indeed it might be said to 
harm  the  public.    That  is  because  the  company’s  profits  are  invested  in  the  rail 
infrastructure for the public benefit; the profits make an addition to the state funds that 
are  otherwise  provided  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  provision  of  that 
infrastructure.  It is likely that any shortfall in the requirements as a result of a fine 
will have to be met from public funds or in a reduction in the investment.  That is a 
factor which a court must take into account: see R v Milford Haven Port Authority 
 
[2002] 2 Cr App R 423; R v Network Rail [2011] Cr App R (S) 44, [2010] EWCA 
Crim 1225 at para 24. 

 
70.	 

A fine will, nonetheless, serve three other purpose of sentencing if it reduces criminal 
offences of the kind committed by Network Rail, reforms and rehabilitates Network 
Rail as an offender and protects the public.  To ensure that a fine will achieve these 
statutory purposes of sentencing, the fine must be such that it will bring home to the 
directors and members of Network Rail these three purposes of sentencing.  

 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

We were told that the Members of Network Rail would not be involved with 
issues  of  safety  at  level  crossings.    However  although  the  extent  of  the 
 
responsibility of the Members was unclear, it is clear that their responsibilities 
must  include  appointing  to  the  Board  executive  and  non-executive  directors 
who  put  at  the  forefront  of  their  duties  compliance  with  Network  Rail’s 
 
responsibilities  for  the  safety  of  people’s  lives  from  the  risks  of  their 
operations and the reduction of offending by Network Rail. 

As  we  have  set  out  at  paragraph  67,  Network  Rail  has  invested  substantial 
funds in level crossing safety.  Nonetheless the record of Network Rail reflects 
the fact that accidents at level crossings were prevalent.  That makes clear the 
 
necessity for all the directors to pay much greater attention to their duties in 
 
this respect.  

 

iii)	  We have set out in paragraph 60 the statement by the non-executive directors 
as to how they will reduce bonuses if safety performance is poor; it appears to 
concentrate  on  a  catastrophic  accident  and  not  accidents  of  the  kind  with 
which this appeal is concerned which has had such a devastating effect on a 
child.  There was evidence before us (but not the judge) that the bonuses of the 
 
directors had been adjusted downwards to a minor (though inadequate) extent 
in  part  because  of  the  poor  level  crossing  safety  record  to  which  we  have 
referred.  Plainly  the  bonuses  should  have  been  very  significantly  reduced. 
 
For  the  future,  it  will  be  important  for  Network  Rail  to  ensure  that  full
--------

R  v Sellafield Limited 
R v Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
 

 
information is provided to the sentencing court, as it is highly material to the 
assessment  of  the  response  of  the  board  of  the  company  to  the  statutory 
purposes of sentencing in a case where a fine inflicts no direct punishment on 
anyone.  If, as is accepted by the board of Network Rail, a bonus incentivises 
an executive director to perform better, the prospect of a significant reduction 
 
of a bonus will incentivise the executive directors on the board of companies 
 
such  as  Network  Rail  to  pay  the  highest  attention  to  protecting  the  lives  of 
those who are at real risk from its activities.  In short, it will demonstrate to the 
court  the  company’s  efforts,  at  the  level  of  those  ultimately  responsible,  to 
address its offending behaviour, to reform and rehabilitate itself and to protect 
the public. 

 

71.	  We can infer from the fact that Network Rail has invested £130m in level crossing 
safety and there was some minor adjustment downwards of the directors’ bonuses that 
it is attempting to reduce its offending behaviour, is being reformed and rehabilitated 
in this aspect of its offending behaviour and is taking steps to protect the public whose 
 
lives have been at risk at level crossings. 

 
72.	 

Nonetheless, the fine of £500,000 imposed on a company of the size of Network Rail 
can  only  be  viewed  as  representing  a  very  generous  discount  for  the  mitigation 
advanced; we would observe that if the judge had imposed a materially greater fine, 
there would have been no basis for criticism of that fine.  Indeed, were it not for the 
 
matters to which we have referred, a fine of the size imposed would have been very 
significantly  below  that  which  should  be  imposed  for  an  offence  committed  by  a 
company of this size where the harm was relatively serious and the culpability at local 
operational management was serious and persistent.

‐v‐ 

Francis Paul Cullen (T20137258 and T20140092) 

 

In the Crown Court sitting at Derby 

 

24 March 2014 

 

Sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Jonathan Gosling 

 
Background 
 
Francis Cullen, you are now 85 years old. You were ordained a Catholic priest in 1953 when 
you were 24. You were assigned to the parish of Mackworth very shortly afterwards. You 
soon began sexually abusing boys as young as 7 years old. The abuse continued throughout 
your ministry, spanning a period of no less than 34 years, in your successive parishes of 
Mackworth, then Buxton, and finally in Nottingham. If anyone were ignorant of the 
irrevocable damage which sexual crimes by an adult – more particularly by a man in your 
position – has on a child, how fully they would be informed by hearing the victim impact 
statements in this dreadful case. 
 
You carried on the abuse, undeterred by the gossip and rumour you were beginning to 
generate. As early as 1964, you were challenged by the parents of one of your victims, S.  
That complaint was reported to the diocesan hierarchy. A senior member of the clergy had a 
meeting with the boy’s parents. Nothing was done to remove you from the parish. You went 
on, notwithstanding that complaint, to commit, in the same parish, the most serious forms 
of abuse against your principal victim, M. 
 
You were able to continue getting away with your crimes for two reasons. First, because of 
the position you held. In the years that you practised in the Catholic ministry, devout 
parishioners – adults and children alike – revered the priest, and of course trusted him 
without question. Secondly, you were, as it is variously expressed by the witnesses, held 
personally in the highest esteem: formidable, charismatic, very intelligent and extremely 
popular. Apart from your duties in the church, you were closely involved in other activities 
with children of the parish. The parents, many of whom had no car of their own, were happy 
to allow you to take their children swimming, and on other activities they enjoyed. You were 
also welcomed into the parents’ homes. They could never have guessed that in truth you 
were a predatory paedophile – a term which was at that time unknown to the vocabulary. 
You were in reality cunning, devious, arrogant – in the word of one of your victims, 
despicable. I have read a letter sent to me by a teacher who worked alongside you all those 
years ago. She wrote it in good faith, portraying your qualities as a priest, and in the way she
--------
saw you behave towards children. But that letter simply reinforces the point: you led a 
double life, your public persona and behaviour belying your revolting behaviour in the 
sacristy, the presbytery, and elsewhere when you were alone with one of your victims. 
 
You took full advantage of your position, and the trust in which you were held, to satisfy 
your perverted lust. The children were all young, and had, understandably, been 
indoctrinated in such a way that some did not think that what you were doing was wrong. 
Others did realise it could not be right, but had no idea how to report it, or to whom. It was 
not that they simply feared not being believed. It was that the issue was too monstrous for 
them. All your victims have, to different degrees, continued – some now in their retirement 
– to have difficulty discussing the abuse, even with those very close to them. I have read 
their impact statements, which have been referred to in the course of the Crown’s careful 
and detailed opening. Their whole lives have been blighted. In a number of instances, 
relationships between the victims and their parents, devout Catholics, suffered terrible 
damage. All have had their ability to enjoy normal relationships disorientated.  It is 
impossible to reconcile the fact that you were administering the sacraments of the Catholic 
Church – baptism, confession, communion, confirmation ‐ at the same time as you were 
indulging yourself with these children, some of whom served on the altar at which you 
celebrated Mass. To say that you were a disgrace to your cloth understates your activity. 
This was gross hypocrisy. In a sentence, your entire life was a lie. 
 
Arrest in 1991 
 
In 1991, your crimes at last caught up with you. One of your victims, H, then only 12, stayed 
with you for a fortnight at the presbytery in Nottingham. His parents had gone on holiday. 
Plainly intending what you had in mind, you offered to look after the boy in his parents’ 
absence. Of course his mother was grateful. After the holiday, the boy told his mother what 
you had done. You were arrested, charged, and put before the Magistrates. They bailed you. 
Far from owning up to your crimes, you left your victims to their fate, skipped the country 
and went and hid in Tenerife for the next 22 years. 
 
Delay in passing sentence 
 
You can have no complaint that you are now having to face sentence so late in your life. You 
have brought that entirely on yourself. More importantly, you have brought it on your 
victims, now themselves in their late middle age. It is well recognised that those of very 
advanced years should ordinarily have a modest reduction of their sentence on that 
account. But I have to balance against that not only the fact that the delay in sentence is 
your own doing, but that you have been on the run all these years. There is no separate 
charge to reflect that. It is a significant aggravating factor in this sentencing exercise. Your 
victims have been cheated of justice all that time, with no idea where you were, or whether 
you were still alive. The letter prepared by Dr Henry, who has several times assessed you on 
remand, tells me that, in spite of your age, you are in good health. 
 
Credit for pleading guilty 
 
You receive little credit for pleading guilty now in relation to the complainants A(m), M and 
H. You were brought back into this country in August last year. Only one week before the 
trial hearing, on 24th February, did we hear that you may now plead guilty to those crimes. 
That only came about after the additional witnesses, S, B(m), A(f) and B(f) came forward, 
which no doubt brought home to you the futility of continuing your denials. But prior to
--------
that, you made your position clear. You dismissed the allegations as a fabrication. You filed a 
Defence Statement to that effect. You ignored an invitation by me, in open court after the 
new complaints had emerged, that you should carefully consider your position. I was told 
that your denials were maintained. The case had by then been set down for trial for many 
months. It is true that you waived your right to specialty in relation to the recent 
complainants, but it is almost inevitable that the Spanish authorities would have consented 
to the fresh charges. As far as those recent additional complainants are concerned, you have 
pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and I will allow you full credit of one third from the 
sentence you would otherwise have received. In relation to the original complainants, I will 
discount the sentences on account of your late guilty pleas by 15%. I take full account of 
your carefully advanced mitigation. In particular, your victims have not, in the end, had to 
enter the witness box. For them, at last, there will be comfort from your guilty pleas. You 
have not re offended in the last 22 years. I can not, however, give weight to your good 
character, given that your offending started when you were so young, and spanned all those 
years. 
 
 
Sentence 
 
Count 10 
 
I start with Count 10, by far the most serious charge in the Indictment. When M was 14 
years old, after prolonged lesser abuse I shall address in a moment, you tried to enter the 
boy’s anus. He was naked on the floor of the presbytery. I have to consider, for the purpose 
of this, and all these counts, the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline for sexual 
offences, published in 2007. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that the guideline 
applies to the activity in question, whatever the date of offence, provided the court has 
regard to the maximum sentence applying at the time the offence was committed. Then, as 
now, this offence was subject to a maximum of life imprisonment. The act is now called 
attempted rape. The description of this crime by M is graphic, and comes as close as is 
possible to the completed offence. Given the gross breach of trust accompanying the 
offence, this falls within category 2 of the guideline, with a starting point of 10 years and a 
range of 8 to 13 years. This was a single offence, not repeated on this or any other victim. 
The sentence had you been tried by jury, given the enhanced degree of trust and the 
devastating effect on that boy, later man’s, life, would have been 11 years imprisonment,  
reduced, to reflect your plea of guilty, to 9 years 3 months. However, to allow a 
proportionate sentence in relation to your other victims, 6 in all, I reduce that term to 8 
years. 
 
Counts 6, 7, 8 & 9 
 
On other occasions, reflected in counts 6, 7, 8 and 9 in relation to this same victim, you 
repeatedly masturbated to ejaculation in front of him. You made him share a bed on holiday 
in Ireland, and again in a caravan on a cub camp. You indulged in open mouthed kissing with 
the boy on other occasions, all that activity I have described when he was as young as 8 to 
12 years old. You told that little boy not to tell his parents what you were doing to him. On 
those counts, (6, 7, 8 and 9), reducing the sentence appropriate to the same extent, there 
will be concurrent sentences of 12 months.  But that sentence must be consecutive to the 
sentence on count 10.
--------
The remaining counts 
 
In sentencing you for the remaining offences, I must have careful regard to totality of 
sentence. The individual sentences would have been significantly longer otherwise, but, as I 
have already made clear, the requirement that I must keep the overall sentence 
proportionate means I can not pass in relation to each victim the sentence I would have 
passed were that offence to stand alone. I explain this so that the victims, in particular the 
three present in Court today, understand the sentences in their individual cases. I am 
required to apply the principles clearly set out in the Definitive Guideline issued by the 
Sentencing Council on Totality of Sentence. I have reminded myself of those principles.  In 
my judgment, the proper sentence overall is 15 years imprisonment, notwithstanding your 
age and frailty. 
 
Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 18 
 
For the offences in counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 18, subjecting your victims to open mouthed 
kissing and placing your hand on the penis of the boys concerned, and the girl’s thigh, 18 
months concurrently for each offence, but consecutive to the other terms. 
 
Counts 11, 12, 13, 19, 20 &21 
 
For the offences in counts 11, 12, 13, 19 and 20, getting the boys to masturbate you, and 
hugging one whilst you had an erection, 3 years concurrently on each count, but again 
consecutive to the other sentences. On Count 21, a concurrent sentence of 12 months. 
 
Counts 14, 15, 16 & 17 
 
For the offences in counts 14 to 17, which involved you touching the girl’s vagina and getting 
her to rub your penis, the sentence is 18 months concurrently on each count, consecutive to 
the other terms, making a total of 15 years.  
 
You will be due for release at the half way point of your sentence. If you are released, you 
will be on licence for the whole of the remaining term, and liable to recall to prison if you 
breach the licence or commit any other crime. 
 
Ancillary Orders 
 
The Independent Barring Service will confirm your lifetime disqualification from working 
with children in any capacity. 
 
The Sex Offender registration requirements remain in force in your case for life. 
 
I decline to make a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. No such order is appropriate given 
your likely age and infirmity if you are released as I have indicated. 
 
 
Commendations 
 
The Police Officers involved in this long and difficult enquiry are to be commended for their 
tenacity, and their sensitive dealings with the many victims in the case. The Officers have let 
it be known publicly that their breakthrough came as a direct result of the help they received
--------
from the Nottingham Catholic Safeguarding body, Family Care. That body was able to 
discover Francis Cullen’s whereabouts, and having done so, immediately alerted the 
Nottinghamshire Police to this fresh lead. 
 
There have been a number of efforts over the years by the police to trace Francis Cullen and 
bring him to justice. The victims of this man’s abuse have found it extremely hard to come 
forward and maintain their determination to see justice done. This must have been acutely 
difficult, in particular, when some of them discovered, as surely they did, that, following his 
extradition, he was proposing to fight the allegations. I have not sought to refer in detail to 
their victim statements, which are deeply personal accounts of the profound effect this man 
has had on their lives, carefully presented by Miss Knight in her opening. Everyone in Court 
who has had to listen to what they endured would, I am quite certain, wish their strength 
and determination to be publicly recognised. I hope that the conclusion of this case will 
enable them to come to terms with what they suffered over many decades.",2014-03-24 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

MEHMET OZEN 

LINCOLN CROWN COURT 

18 DECEMBER 2013 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE FLAUX 

 

 

 

1.	  Mehmet  Ozen  you  have  been  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Darren  Harwood  and 
Charlotte Piccaver. By its verdict the jury has rejected your defences of self-defence 
and loss of control. What is clear from the evidence and, in particular the nature of the 
 
wounds inflicted, is that this was a brutal attack on two young people who, at the time 
you attacked them, were unarmed.  
 

2.	  At  about  4.40  in  the  morning  of  21  April  2013,  the  argument  between  you  and 
Keyleigh Wright about the rent money which had precipitated the incidents on 18 and 
 
19 April flared up again. On the basis of the evidence of Ashley Gadbury, you came 
out of your bedroom when Keyleigh Wright came downstairs to the kitchen and you 
were shouting and arguing with her in the kitchen. I accept that when you went back 
 
to your bedroom she followed you into the room to continue the argument and that 
she had the kitchen knife, not to kill you but to threaten you so you would return her 
£420. When you were both inside the room but close to the door, not as you suggested 
 
in evidence on or near your bed, you wrested the knife from her, cutting the webbing 
between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand in the process. In the struggle you 
 
stabbed her with the knife cutting her arm. 

 

 
3.	  At the very moment you were struggling with Keyleigh Wright, Charlotte Piccaver 
and  Darren  Harwood  came  into  the  room.  Seeing  what  was  going  on,  Darren 
Harwood  stepped  between  you  and  Keyleigh  to  protect  her  and  stop  the  argument 
between the two of you, acting as the peacemaker then, as he had earlier that night in 
 
Boston. His terrible fate for trying to be the peacemaker is that, infuriated and almost 
certainly in revenge for what had happened two nights before, when he had stepped in 
to break up a fight between you and Charlotte as you were trying to push her down 
the  stairs,  you  stabbed  him  in  the  neck.  You  deliberately  targeted  one  of  the  most 
 
vulnerable  parts  of  the  human  body,  intending  to  kill  him.  Almost  certainly  as  he 
 
turned instinctively away from your attack you brutally stabbed him in the back.  He 
never had a chance to defend himself.  

1
--------
4.	  You  then  turned  your  fury  on  Charlotte  Piccaver.  Given  the  pandemonium  in  that 
 
room, she was understandably shouting at you, but I reject any suggestion that she, 
 
any  more  than  Darren  Harwood,  posed  any  sort  of  physical  threat  to  you.  You 
attacked her in a temper and in revenge for her having hit you on the nose two nights 
 
before. Your attack on her was similar to that on Darren Harwood. You deliberately 
targeted her neck, stabbing her there, then when she was fatally injured, you stabbed 
her in the back. She too never had a chance to defend herself. 
 
 

5.	  For a matter of seconds Darren Harwood must have been down in your room before 
 
he  got  up  and  staggered  out  towards  the  kitchen,  where  he  was  seen  by  Ashley 
Gadbury, as was Keyleigh Wright pushing past him. During the short time he was on 
 
the  floor  in  your  room,  Charlotte  Piccaver  had  been  stabbed  and  bled  onto  him. 
 
However,  whatever  the  sequence  of  these  attacks,  what  is  clear  is  that,  contrary  to 
your story in interview and in evidence, there was no struggle with your victims in 
your bedroom, whether on or near the head of the bed or anywhere else in the room. If 
there had been a struggle on or near the head of the bed, there would have been signs 
of that struggle, bed clothes disrupted, blood stains on the bed or floor and the orange 
 
juice  carton  overturned,  yet  there  were  no  such  signs  at  all.  Equally  if,  as  you 
suggested in evidence, you were struggling and grappling with Darren Harwood or 
 
Charlotte Piccaver whilst you had the knife, it is inconceivable that they would not 
 
have sustained defensive injuries to their hands and arms and yet they had no such 
injuries.  Had  there  been  the  life  and  death  struggle  you  described,  you  would  also 
have sustained far more serious injuries than you did and your blood would have been 
in the bedroom. 
  
 

6.	  The  reality  is  that  there  was  no  struggle  and  there  was  no  threat  to  your  life  from 
either of them or, once she was disarmed, from Keyleigh Wright. The injuries Darren 
Harwood  and  Charlotte  Piccaver  sustained,  straight  in  and  out  stab  wounds,  are 
wholly inconsistent with a struggle or with lashing out at your victims in a frenzied 
loss of control, but are consistent with a deliberate targeted revenge attack, albeit in 
anger, on two unarmed people. That is what this was.  
 

 

 

7.	  The psychological and emotional impact of the murder of these two young people on 
their  parents  and  their  siblings  has  been  truly  devastating.  I  have  read  the  moving 
family  impact  statements  of  Charlotte’s  mother,  father  and  sisters  and  of  Darren’s 
 
father.  In a very real sense you have destroyed their lives as well. 
 

8.	  The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment and that is the sentence of 
 
the Court upon you. However, under Section 269 and Schedule 21 of the Criminal 
Justice Act 2003 I have to determine the minimum term you should serve before you 
will be eligible to be considered by the Parole Board for release. 
 

 

 

9.	  Clearly  this  case  falls  within  paragraph  5  of  Schedule  21,  since  the  seriousness  of 
your offending is particularly high and involves the murder of two people, for which 
the starting point in determining the minimum term is 30 years. I emphasise though 
that is only the starting point and I have to consider what aggravating and mitigating 
factors there are in order to determine the appropriate minimum term. Paragraphs 10 
and 11 of Schedule 21 set out some of the aggravating and mitigating factors which 
may be relevant to the offence of murder, but neither list is intended to be exclusive 

 

2
--------
and  what  may  aggravate  or  mitigate  the  offence  will  depend  upon  all  the 
circumstances of the particular case.  

 
10. None  of  the  statutory  aggravating  factors  set  out  in  Paragraph  10  is  present  in  this 
case, but the very nature of this savage and targeted attack on two unarmed people is 
of such seriousness as put this case at or just above the 30 year starting point.  
 
 
11. So far as the mitigating factors in paragraph 11 are concerned, sub-paragraph (a) does 
not apply because you clearly intended to kill all your victims, not just to cause them 
 
serious bodily injury. So far as sub-paragraph (b), lack of premeditation, is concerned, 
on  my  assessment  of  the  evidence,  you  did  not  have  the  knife  at  the  outset  of  the 
 
argument with Keyleigh Wright. It was she who brought it into the bedroom and you 
then wrested it from her. The fact that you did not take the knife into the room, which 
means there was no premeditation, is a mitigating factor which justifies bringing the 
 
minimum term down below the 30 year starting point.  

 
12. In my judgment, there is no provocation to be considered under paragraph 11(d). By 
its verdict the jury rejected your defence of loss of control and, in your own evidence 
in cross-examination, you accepted more than once that you had not lost your self-
control, saying that, had you done so, you would have followed Keyleigh Wright and 
Darren Harwood out of the room and would not have called the emergency services. 

 
13. On my assessment of the evidence, paragraph (e): “the fact that the offender acted to 
any extent in self-defence or in fear of violence” is not a mitigating factor available to 
you or if it is available, only to a limited extent. I say that because whilst when you 
wrested  the  knife  away  from  Keyleigh  Wright,  you  may  have  been  acting  in  self-
defence or acting in fear of violence from her, there never was any attack on you by 
Darren Harwood and Charlotte Piccaver except in her case possibly verbal abuse and, 
once you had the knife, they were all unarmed. In killing them, you did not act in self-
defence or in fear of violence but in anger and revenge.  

 
14. Whilst it is true that you were essentially of previous good character, that can have 
little if any impact upon the severity of the sentence in view of the barbaric nature of 
these  killings.  As  for  the  question  of  remorse,  having  seen  and  heard  you  give 
evidence, your lack of respect for your victims led me to have some doubt whether 
you had any genuine remorse as opposed to feeling sorry for the situation in which 
you find yourself. Nonetheless, given that immediately after the attack you summoned 
the emergency services, I accept you had some remorse. However, the gravity of your 
 
offending is so serious that remorse can only play a very limited role in mitigation. 

 
15. I have also borne in mind your age and the fact that the minimum term you will serve 
will inevitably mean that you will be quite an old man before the Parole Board will 
consider whether you are eligible for parole. However, in a very real sense, that is an 
inevitable consequence of the seriousness of your offending.  

 
16. Balancing the savage nature of this killing of two unarmed people with a knife against 
the  mitigating  factors  I  have  identified,  in  my  judgment  the  appropriate  minimum 
term is one of 27 years.  

 

3
--------
17. From  that  will  be  deducted  the  days  you  have  spent  in  custody  in  relation  to  this 
offence.  What  this  means  is  that  the  minimum  amount  of  time  you  will  spend  in 
 
prison  from  today  before  the  Parole  Board  can  order  early  release  is  27  years  less 
 
those days on remand. If it remains necessary for the protection of the public, you will 
continue  to  be  detained  after  that  date.  If  the  Parole  Board  does  decide  to  direct 
release you will remain on licence for the remainder of your life and may be recalled 
to prison at any time.  

 
 
18. The statutory surcharge provisions will apply.

DENIS MACSHANE 

 

23 DECEMBER 2013 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE SWEENEY 

 
 

You are aged 65 and of positive previous good character. 
 
 
You have pleaded guilty to an offence of false accounting which encompasses a 
total of 19 expenses claims made by you in the period from 6 January 2005 to 
11 January 2008 when you were a Member of Parliament.  The offence thus 
covers four successive financial years - 2005 to 2008.  In each instance you 
produced and made use of an invoice purporting to come from an 
organisation called the European Policy Institute (“EPI” for short) which 
invoices you knew to be false misleading or deceptive in a material particular 
in that each represented that EPI had been commissioned by you to carry out 
research and translation services; that you were liable to pay EPI for the 
provision of those services; and that you had been invoiced in respect of the 
services by one EJ Matthews on behalf of EPI.  The reality was that you were 
the person behind EPI and that you created each invoice yourself – signing 
the invented name EJ Matthews on each, and even going to the length of using 
9 different variations of your own name in order to minimise the risk of 
suspicion by giving the impression that the invoices had been addressed to 
you by different individuals at EPI with whom you had no connection  In the 
result you obtained, by way of cheques or bank transfers paid to EPI, a total of 
£12,900 from the House of Commons authorities. The money was eventually 
paid back. 
 
The Prosecution have accepted your written Basis of Plea.  It is in the 
following terms: 
 
“(i) 	 …the false invoices submitted were intended to recoup some expenses 
genuinely incurred in respect of the defendant’s business as a Member 
of Parliament; 
there was no intention on the part of the defendant to make a financial 
profit from the submission of these invoices; 

 
(ii)
--------
(iii)	 
 

the Crown accept that there was in fact no such personal profit in the 
defendant’s case; 

(iv) 	 The defendant’s record keeping was chaotic and the reclaiming of 
 

expenses was not regarded by him as a priority, not least since in the 
period during which such invoices were submitted he was under 
significant personal pressure” 

 
I make clear that I will sentence you upon that Basis. 
 
It follows that your case is different to that of other members of the legislature 
who have been sentenced for offences arising from what has become known as 
the “expenses scandal”.  The Prosecution accept that each of the others was 
sentenced upon the basis that his claims were wholly false, whereas you must 
 
be sentenced upon the basis that there were other genuine expenses that you 
had incurred and paid in broadly the same sums and which you could have 
reclaimed legitimately in the proper manner, but which you chose instead to 
recoup by dishonest false accounting (hence the reference in your Basis of 
Plea to no personal profit). 
 
However, notwithstanding your Basis of Plea, the dishonesty involved was 
considerable and was repeated many times over a long period. 
 
As a Member of Parliament you were entitled, within prescribed rules, to 
claim for expenses incurred by you in the course of fulfilling the 
responsibilities of your office – in particular in relation to office and surgery 
accommodation, equipment and supplies for the office and surgery, work 
commissioned and bought in services (including interpretation, translation 
and research services), communications and certain travel and staff related 
costs. The relevant rules were set out in a document known as the Green Book, 
which emphasised that each Member of Parliament was responsible for 
ensuring that their claims were legitimate, above reproach and in accordance 
with the rules.  For claims of less than £250, in effect the word of the Member 
of Parliament was good enough.  Claims for items in excess of that sum (such 
as each of the relevant claims in your case) had to be supported by 
documentary evidence.  In particular, a Member of Parliament could request 
direct payment to the supplier by submitting a form C2 and accompanying 
invoice.  There was a different form and process for reimbursing monies 
already paid to a supplier. 
 
When you submitted your first dishonest claim on 7 January 2005 you had 
been a Member of Parliament for more than a decade, and had been the 
Minister for Europe since 2002.  You submitted a further three dishonest 
claims whilst still the Minister for Europe, and the remaining 15 dishonest 
claims after your return to the Back Benches following the General Election in 
May 2005. 
 
You must therefore have been aware throughout that it was an essential 
feature of the expenses system then in operation that Members of Parliament 
 
were invariably treated as honest trustworthy people, and that the unwritten 
assumption was that only claims for expenses genuinely incurred in
--------
accordance with the rules would be made, and using genuine documentation.  
Yet you acted in flagrant breach of that trust. 
 
 
You had set up EPI in 1992, and opened a bank account in its name with 
yourself as the signatory.  Evidence from your brother indicates that you set 
up EPI in order to publish books and run conferences, but that after your 
election to Parliament in 1994 it became dormant. 
 
In relation to each dishonest claim you created an invoice to yourself from EPI 
for costs incurred in the provision of research and translation.  Each invoice 
bore the address 100 New Kings Road (which was in reality a postal address 
and no more) and purported to be signed by the General Manager EJ 
Matthews.  Each invoice was submitted with a form C2 in which you declared 
either “I certify that the expenses shown above have been wholly exclusively 
and necessarily incurred on parliamentary business” or (after the form 
changed in mid 2005) “I confirm that the payments requested are in respect 
of costs incurred wholly exclusively and necessarily in performance of my 
Parliamentary duties”.  The relevant funds were then sent, whether by cheque 
or BACS transfer, to EPI.  To state the obvious, the Parliamentary authorities 
had no idea that they were, in reality, sending the money to you or that you 
were reimbursing yourself from it.  There was, after all, a different form and 
process for reimbursement claims. 
 
It is your case that EPI had continued to function after you became an MP; 
that you had first used the name ‘EJ Matthews’ as a nom de plume long before 
the 19 claims, because you thought that being associated with a pro-European 
think-tank might hinder your Parliamentary career within the Labour Party; 
that you had used EPI when publishing material on Europe and organising 
related events (some of which had been requested by the then Prime 
Minister); that you commissioned research and translation services from third 
parties and on an ad hoc basis and paid for them in cash; and that you did not 
keep receipts but instead tried to guess the amount spent and then aggregated 
 
the costs and submitted a claim.  However none of that justifies the fact that 
your dishonesty was considerable and repeated many times over a prolonged 
period. 
 
 
As the Prosecution put it in Opening, you were an MP (and, I repeat, a 
Minister at the time of four of the claims) and knew that you were required to 
act with probity and transparency in the making of expenses claims; you 
deliberately created misleading and deceptive invoices and then used them in 
order to procure payments of public money; by doing so proper scrutiny of the 
legitimacy of the expenditure and the amount of the expenditure was avoided 
– indeed made impossible; the deception used was calculated and designed to 
avoid suspicion falling on your claims; and those claims were intended to 
mislead the House of Commons authorities as to the true nature of the 
expenditure and the true identity of the supplier of the services. 
 
On your behalf Mr Milliken-Smith QC rightly concedes that your offence 
crosses the custody threshold, but submits (in short) that given the difference 
between your case and those of the others who have been sentenced already in
--------
relation to the expenses scandal, a significantly lower starting point is 
required; that the sentence should be further reduced to reflect a number of 
mitigating features and then full discount for your plea of guilty; and that 
looked at overall an immediate loss of liberty would be disproportionate - 
rather, he submits, a suspended sentence is sufficient. 
 
In furtherance of those overall submissions Mr Milliken-Smith placed 
reliance, amongst other things, upon the following: 
 
(1) 	

The Basis of Plea – and in particular the fact your offence was not 
committed out of greed or for personal profit (in the sense that I have 
already described) 
Your positive previous good character – as demonstrated by your years 
of otherwise distinguished Trade Union and public service, and as 
attested to in the numerous character testimonials before the court 
from across the political spectrum and beyond – all of which I have 
 
taken into account. 
The view of the Standards and Privileges Committee of the House of 
Commons, expressed at paragraph 54 of its Report, which (having 
noted your undoubted expertise on European Affairs and engagement 
with European matters before the House) accepted that your 
motivation in making the claims was to maintain that expertise, to 
promote the work of an All-Party inquiry, and to carry out informal 
work on behalf of the then Prime Minister – albeit that that view must 
be seen in the context of the strong criticisms made at paragraphs 45, 
47-49 and 57-58 of the Report including the observation that yours was 
“the gravest case which has come to us for adjudication, rather than 
being dealt with under the criminal law”. 
The fact that the claims were made at a time of turmoil in your personal 
life when you buried yourself in work – in particular after your divorce 
in 2003 (albeit that was some considerable time before the first claim 
in January 2005), the tragic death of your daughter Clare in an 
accident in March 2004 (albeit that was nine months before the first 
claim), your return to the Back Benches in May 2005, the death of your 
mother in 2006, and the sudden and to an extent unexpected death of 
Carol Barnes (your former partner and Clare’s mother) in March 2008. 
The fact that the offending resulted in the loss of your employment as a 
Member of Parliament, and the loss of your reputation – albeit that 
that is entirely your own fault. 
The fact that the false claims were made between five and almost nine 
years ago, that since your part in the expenses scandal has been 
revealed you have been subject to prolonged criticism and pressure, 
including investigations by the Parliamentary Commissioner, the 
Standards and Privileges Committee and the Police. Thus you have had

(albeit that you did not admit dishonesty), indicated as much again at 
the Magistrates’ Court, and at the preliminary hearing at this court on 
27 September (albeit again not admitting dishonesty), and eventually 
pleaded guilty at the Plea and Case Management Hearing on 18 
November. 

 
In the end, sentence in each case of this type necessarily depends on its own 
facts, but set against the background that the Court of Appeal made clear in 
respect of your former colleague David Chaytor that the Sentencing Council’s 
Definitive Guideline on Fraud is of little relevance.  In your case, you have no 
one to blame but yourself. However chaotic your general paperwork was, 
there was deliberate, oft repeated and prolonged dishonesty over a period of 
years - involving a flagrant breach of trust and consequent damage to 
Parliament, with correspondingly reduced confidence in our priceless 
democratic system and the process by which it is implemented and we are 
governed. 
 
Balancing the aggravating features with the Basis of Plea I identify a starting 
point of 12 months’ imprisonment.  I reduce that by four months to reflect 
(subject to the qualifications that I have identified) your other points in 
mitigation.  In my view yours was plainly not a plea at the first reasonable 
opportunity, but rather one which should attract a discount of 25%, thus 
reducing the sentence to one of 6 months imprisonment.  In my view, and in 
all the circumstances, particularly given the deliberate and the prolonged 
nature of the dishonesty involved, it is not appropriate to suspend that 
sentence. 
 
Stand up please. Denis MacShane I sentence you to 6 months’ imprisonment.  
If not released before, you will serve half that sentence. 
 
Finally you will pay costs of £1500 – all of which is to be paid within two 
months.",2013-12-23 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Graham Richardson, you have been convicted by the jury of the murder of Peter Battle. You 
 
 
have in addition pleaded guilty to the robbery of Michael Cleaver and to theft. You have 
 
 
been acquitted of possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply. 
 
 
Murder 
 
 
I will deal first with the sentence on you, Graham Richardson, for murder. 
 
 
 
You are aged 27 and have one previous conviction, for the possession of Class B and C drugs 
 
 
with intent to supply. 
 
 
Peter Battle was a dealer in gold, silver and coins who lived alone at his cottage in Full 
 
Sutton, not far from York. You had bought items from him in the past and he was, in your 
 
own words and as you accepted in evidence, a nice bloke who had always been straight with 
 
you. He knew you and he trusted you. Although it was not easy for them to do so, his 
 
daughters have spoken movingly in their statements of what a good, friendly and helpful 
 
man he was, how his death has affected them and others in his family, and how much they 
 
miss him and always will. Nothing I say or do can restore their father to them or compensate 
 
for the cruel way in which you took him from them, but I pay tribute to the dignity with 
 
which they have conducted themselves during this trial and I have taken their statements 
 
into account. Their courage, love for their father and genuine feelings contrast starkly with 
 
 
your cowardice, selfishness and lies. 
 
 
In December 2012 you were desperate for money. You had been arrested for the robbery of 
 
Michael Cleaver, to which I will come later; your cash had been seized by the police; the 
 
drugs you had ordered from suppliers in China and hoped to sell for a large profit had also 
 
 
been seized; and you owed money to a considerable number of people, including your 
 
Chinese suppliers. In addition, you were increasingly addicted to heroin and needed money 
 
to feed that addiction. 
  
 
Faced with that situation you attempted to persuade Peter Battle to allow you to take items 
 
away on credit, promising on your son’s life to repay him promptly once you had sold them, 
 
or to persuade him to allow you to pay by bank transfer or by cheque. It is clear that you 
 
always intended to cheat him, but it is less clear when you formed the intention that if he 
 
would not give in to your persuasions, you would take the items you coveted away by force.
--------
Be that as it may, Peter Battle made it clear, both in emails and in person, that he was not 
 
prepared to do as you wished, and would need to be paid in cash, cash which you did not 
 
have. You must have known that when you visited his home on the afternoon of 30 
 
December. Exactly what happened in Whisker Cottage that afternoon is unknown, but 
 
 
whether you went there hoping to make one last attempt to persuade him to give you credit 
 
 
 
and lost your temper when he refused, or whether you went there intending from the 
 
 
outset to rob him, it is clear that a time came when you launched a savage attack upon him. 
 
First you attacked him with a knife or other sharp instrument and he sustained a number of 
 
wounds. Then you attacked him with a heavy blunt instrument of some sort, hitting him with 
 
great force on the back of his skull, which would have caused him to go to the ground and 
 
very quickly to lose consciousness. You did not leave it there, but continued to hit what by 
 
now was a defenceless and unconscious man in a vicious and sustained attack. In all he was 
 
hit at least six times on the back of the head, smashing and shattering his skull so that his 
 
brain was exposed and beginning to decompose when the police eventually found his body, 
 
in addition to other injuries elsewhere on his body. 
  
 
When you had completed this attack, you stole a quantity of gold, silver, coins and other 
 
valuables, you hung a sheet from Peter Battle’s bed over the door so that visitors could not 
 
see in and you left. Either then or later you fixed a note to the door to say that Peter Battle 
 
had gone away. In an attempt to cover your tracks you sent him an email, knowing that he 
 
was dead, to say that you had called round but that he had not been in. 
  
 
Over the next five weeks until the body was found by the police you returned to Whisker 
 
Cottage many times to ransack its contents, when all the time the body of the man you had 
 
 
killed was lying there. 
  
 
The sentence for murder is fixed by law and is a sentence of imprisonment for life, but I must 
 
also set the minimum term which you must serve before you can be considered for release 
 
on licence. I emphasise that this is a minimum term. It does not mean that you will be 
 
released after that time. Whether or when you will be released will be for the Parole Board 
 
 
to determine. You will only be released if the Board is satisfied that you can be released 
 
without risk to public safety and, in any event, once you are released you will remain on 
 
licence for the rest of your life and liable to recall if you offend again or breach the terms of 
 
your licence. 
  
 
All murder is very serious, but the seriousness of this offence was particularly high. It was a 
 
murder done for gain, committed in the victim’s own home, and involved a savage and 
 
brutal attack on Peter Battle with gratuitous violence continuing well after he was bleeding 
 
and unconscious on the floor. You demonstrated extreme callousness by leaving his body to 
 
lie for five weeks before it was found while you stole repeatedly from his home, a factor 
 
which has understandably increased the suffering of his family. The murder was committed 
 
while you were on bail for the robbery of Michael Cleaver. In a case with that combination of 
 
 
aggravating features I consider that the appropriate starting point is a minimum term of the 
 
order of 30 years, although any starting point is subject to adjustment to take account of the 
 
particular circumstances of the case.

I can find very little mitigation in your case. I have no doubt that you intended to kill and not 
 
 
merely to cause harm. The number and extent of Peter Battle’s injuries and the way in which 
 
they were inflicted leaves no room for doubt about that. I accept, however, that even if you 
 
did intend from the outset to rob, the killing itself was not premeditated. As you said 
 
yourself in evidence, albeit in a different context, you thought that Peter Battle would be an 
 
 
easy target who would not resist. I will make a modest reduction to the minimum term 
 
which I would otherwise have imposed to reflect the lack of premeditation. 
  
 
Moreover, although you have no previous history of or convictions for violence, this murder 
 
was committed only a few weeks after your participation in a violent robbery, to which I 
   
 
shall turn in a moment. 
 
 
In all the circumstances I conclude that the appropriate minimum term in your case is 27 
 
years less the time that you have spent on remand in custody. 
 
 
Robbery – Graham Richardson 
 
 
I turn now to the robbery of Michael Cleaver to which you have pleaded guilty. 
  
 
 
Michael Cleaver was another dealer in gold, silver and coins with whom you had dealt in the 
 
 
 
past. In early December 2012 you were back in contact with him, initially perhaps with a 
 
 
view to doing business together, but you very quickly formed the intention to rob him 
 
instead. To that end you recruited Darren Archer, your heroin supplier and a man you know 
 
 
to have a criminal record including previous convictions for robbery and attempted robbery, 
 
together with a third man. Although the jury have acquitted your co‐defendant Peter Egan of 
 
being that third man, I have no doubt on the evidence that this was a robbery carried out by 
 
three men and not just two. I sentence you on that basis. 
  
 
The robbery was carried out by luring Michael Cleaver to a dark street at night, Carnot Street 
 
in York where you used to live. It was carefully planned, with a series of texts designed to 
 
lead Michael Cleaver to believe that you had a significant amount of gold to sell so that he 
 
 
would bring as much money as possible with him. However, you failed to think through that 
 
 
you would inevitably be suspected as the robber and that the texts sent on your phone 
 
would just as inevitably incriminate Darren Archer. 
  
 
When Michael Cleaver arrived you attacked him concealing your faces with hoods and 
 
scarves. The third man was carrying an axe which was used, not just to threaten but to strike 
 
 
your victim. I am satisfied that you knew that this third man had brought this axe with him 
 
and was prepared to use it. Fortunately, the physical injuries which Michael Cleaver 
 
sustained were fairly minor, and much less serious than might have been expected from an 
 
 
 
axe attack. That was not for any want of trying, but was due in part to Michael Cleaver’s 
 
determination and presence of mind, grabbing the axe man in a bear hug so that he could 
 
not swing the axe easily. However, he was struck on the head in two places and it was a 
 
terrifying experience for him, made more so by the fact that the axe man called out to you, 
 
“shoot him”, and that one or other of you and Darren Archer then stuck something in his 
 
back. What this was is not apparent, and there is no evidence that any of you had a gun, but 
 
 
Michael Cleaver thought you did and that was what you intended him to believe. He thought

that he was going to die and the fear which this understandably engendered in him was 
 
exactly the same as if you did have a gun or an imitation firearm. In the event, you seized the 
 
 
money he had brought with him, a total of £4,100, and ran off, making good your escape. 
  
 
This is an extremely serious offence with the aggravating features which I have mentioned – 
 
 
group offending, a street robbery at night, planning and premeditation, luring the victim to 
 
the scene with a large quantity of cash, the use of an axe, a threat implying the presence of a 
 
 
gun, inducing fear of death in the victim, and concealing your faces with hoods and scarves. 
  
 
There are guidelines for street robberies published by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, 
 
although those guidelines apply to a first time offender who has not been assessed as 
 
dangerous within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The guidelines might suggest 
 
 
that this was a level 2 case, since no serious  physical injury was caused, but that was not for 
 
 
want of trying on your part and in my judgment the many aggravating factors to which I have 
 
referred mean that this was a much more serious offence. I take into account also the victim 
 
statement made by Michael Cleaver which speaks, not surprisingly, of the significant 
 
psychological and emotional scars which the three of you inflicted on him, not to mention 
 
the impact on his ability to carry on his lawful business. 
 
 
In your case the question whether you are a “dangerous offender” within the meaning of the 
 
provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is largely irrelevant in view of the sentence which 
 
I have to pass on you for the murder of Peter Battle. I record, however, that although you 
 
 
have no previous convictions for violence but only one conviction for a drug offence, you 
 
 
carried out this robbery recruiting others whom you knew to be violent and you went 
 
through with it knowing that the third man had brought an axe to the scene which he was 
 
 
prepared to use. Your only concern was your own financial gain. You cared not at all for your 
 
victim. While I would not have made a finding of dangerousness against you if the robbery 
 
had stood alone, those who have to deal with you in future will need to take account of all 
 
 
this when considering your case. 
  
 
I shall pass a determinate sentence on you for the robbery. I give you credit for your plea of 
 
 
 
guilty to the robbery, but you did not plead guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. You 
 
only did so after giving two no comment interviews and after you had been charged with the 
 
 
murder of Peter Battle. You did so in circumstances where you faced overwhelming evidence 
 
against you on the robbery charge. Moreover, in order to provide yourself with some kind of 
 
defence to the even more serious charge of murder, you needed not only to admit your 
 
participation in the robbery but also to incriminate Darren Archer so that you could falsely 
 
blame him for the murder. Accordingly I consider that you are entitled to no more than 10% 
 
 
 
credit for your plea. Giving you that discount, I sentence you on the robbery charge to 9 
 
 
years. 
  
 
Theft – Graham Richardson 
 
 
The final count on the indictment is concerned with the theft of items from Whisker Cottage, 
 
to which you have pleaded guilty. The ransacking of a dead man’s home with his body lying 
 
 
there is despicable conduct, made worse by the way in which it was repeated over an 
 
extended period, but I have to some extent already taken it into account in fixing the

minimum term which you must serve for the murder count. The way in which you used your 
 
own mother to dispose of some of the stolen property shows the depths to which you were 
 
prepared to stoop. Taking all this into account and giving you full credit for your plea, the 
 
sentence on this count will be one year. 
 
 
The recovered items of stolen property will be restored to the estate of Peter Battle. 
 
 
 
Financial orders 
 
 
Finally I must consider an order for restitution of the money stolen from Michael Cleaver 
  
 
I am satisfied that the £900 in cash found at your house was money stolen from Michael 
 
 
 
Cleaver. I order that this be restored to him. 
  
 
I will defer dealing with the £1000 found behind the microwave at Christine Baker’s flat and 
 
 
 
with the £690 found on Darren Archer until I have sentenced him. 
   
 
 
Summary 
 
 
To summarise, therefore: 
 
 
Graham Richardson, on court 3 (murder) I sentence you to life imprisonment with a 
 
minimum term of 27 years less time on remand in custody; on count 1 (robbery) the 
 
sentence will be 9 years; and on count 4 (theft) there will be a sentence of one year. All of 
 
 
these sentences will be concurrent. 
  
 
I order the restitution to Michael Cleaver of the £900 which was seized from you. 
 
 
 
There will be an order for forfeiture and destruction of the drugs which are the subject of 
 
count 2. 
 
 
The recovered items of property stolen from Whisker Cottage will be restored to the estate 
 
 
of Peter Battle. 
 
 
The statutory surcharge provisions will apply. 
 
 
 
Direction – sentencing remarks 
 
 
I direct that a copy of these sentencing remarks should be kept with your prison file so that 
 
 
they are available to those who have to consider your case in future, and that copies should 
 
 
also be provided to the family of Peter Battle and to Michael Cleaver. 
  
 
You may go down.

MICHAEL ADEBOLAJO 

(Mujaahid Abu Hamza) 

and 

MICHAEL ADEBOWALE 

(Ismail Ibn Abdullah) 

Central Criminal Court 

26 February 2014 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Sweeney 

  

Michael  Adebolajo  (also  known  as  Mujaahid  Abu  Hamza)  and  Michael  Adebowale  (also 

known as  Ismail Ibn Abdullah) you have both been convicted, on overwhelming evidence, of 

the barbaric murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Artillery Place in Woolwich in the early afternoon 

of Wednesday 22 May last year.  

 

You are British citizens, aged 29 and 22 respectively.  Adebolajo you are married with four 

step children and two children of your own 

 

Having presided over your trial I am sure of the following facts.  

 

You  each  converted  to  Islam  some  years  ago.  Thereafter  you  were  radicalised  and  each 

became an extremist – espousing a cause and views which, as has been said elsewhere, are 

a  betrayal  of  Islam  and  of  the  peaceful  Muslim  communities  who  give  so  much  to  our 

country. 

 

 

1
--------
You  decided,  between  you,  and  in  order  to  advance  your  extremist  cause,  to  murder  a 

soldier  in  public  in  broad  daylight  and  to  do  so  in  a  way  that  would  generate  maximum 

media coverage, including getting yourselves killed by armed officers who would be bound 

to  attend  the  scene  in  the  aftermath  of  the  murder  –  thereby  expecting  that  you  would 

become martyrs and each gain a place in paradise. 

 

The  planning  took  place  over  a  period  of  time.  You  Adebolajo  acquired  an  old  handgun 

which, although it did not work, was to be used at the scene to keep the public at bay and to 

threaten  the  armed  officers  with  when  they  arrived.  The  day  before  the  murder  you 

Adebolajo bought five knives and a knife sharpener – which you used to sharpen some of 

the knives in preparation for their use in the murder. 

 

On  the  day  of  the  murder  the  two  of  you  met  up  some  hours  in  advance.  Eventually 

Adebolajo drove you both to Woolwich in his car, where you parked up in Wellington Street 

and waited to spot a soldier to murder. You had with you a total of eight knives and the gun. 

It was whilst you were waiting that Lee Rigby walked past. He was instantly recognisable as 

being a soldier as he was wearing a “Help for Heroes” top and carrying his Army day sack. He 

was 25 years old, had joined the army in 2006, and amongst other postings had seen active 

service in Afghanistan in 2009. An outgoing and popular personality, he was by the time you 

saw him in a recruiting post dealing with young people and involved in other duties at his 

Regimental  HQ  at  the  Tower  of  London.  Indeed,  he  was  on  his  way  from  his  HQ  to  the 

Woolwich Barracks when you saw him. He had done absolutely nothing to deserve what you 

went on to do to him. 

 

You stalked him in the car as he walked along Wellington Street, crossed the South Circular 

Road and went into Artillery Place where he crossed the road in front of you. Seizing your 

opportunity Adebolajo, and once he was no longer looking in your direction, you accelerated 

hard  to  30‐40  mph  and  ran  him  down  from  behind.  The  impact  carried  him  up  onto  the 

bonnet of the car breaking five vertebrae in his back and five ribs. The speed of the car was 

such that it carried up onto the pavement and crashed into the support of a road sign and 

stopped, depositing Lee Rigby in the area between the front of the car and an adjacent wall. 

He was unconscious and certainly unable to defend himself. 

 

 

2
--------
You  both  exited  the  car  armed  with  knives  and  over  a  period  of  around  2‐3  minutes  you 

butchered  Lee  Rigby  –  going,  as  you  were  well  aware,  far  beyond  what  was  needed  to 

murder him. You Adebolajo concentrated on his neck – hacking at it repeatedly with first a 

substantial cleaver type knife and then another knife, all in an attempt to decapitate him for 

maximum  horrific  effect.  In  the  end  you  failed  but  in  the  process  you  caused  horrendous 

injuries  as  shown  in  the  materials  before  the  court.  You  Adebowale  concentrated  on  Lee 

Rigby’s  torso  stabbing  him  a  number  of  times  in  the  chest  in  frenzied  fashion  and  with 

severe force. It is no exaggeration to say that what the two of you did resulted in a blood 

bath.  Aspects of all this were seen, as they were intended to be, by members of the public. 

 

Once you had finished, and again in order to achieve maximum effect, you then carried and 

dragged  Lee  Rigby’s  body  into  the  road  in  Artillery  Place  and  dumped  it  there  –  thus 

eventually bringing the traffic to a halt.  

 

In the thirteen minutes that passed between then and the arrival of the armed officers, the 

number of members of the public at the scene grew. You both gloried in what you had done. 

Each  of  you  had  the  gun  at  one  point  or  another  and  it  was  used  to  warn  off  any  male 

member of the public who looked as though he might intervene. 

 

Those who saw the gun believed that it was real and loaded. 

 

You  Adebolajo  handed  out  a  pre‐prepared  written  statement  seeking  to  justify  your  joint 
cause and actions. In addition, carrying the bloodied cleaver in your equally blood y hands, 

and  knowing  that  you  were  being  filmed,  you  made  a  political  statement.  Images  of  that 

filmed statement were broadcast around the world. The effect of the two statements was to 

seek to justify your joint actions as being retaliation for deaths in Muslim lands, and to incite 

the removal of the Government in this country.  

 

Your  sickening  and  pitiless  conduct  was  in  stark  contrast  to  the  compassion  and  bravery 

shown  by  the  various  women  at  the  scene  who  tended  to  Lee  Rigby’s  body  and  who 

challenged what you had done and said. 

 

The  armed  police  officers  arrived  in  a  marked  police  vehicle.  At  that  time,  you  Adebolajo 

were  still  armed  with  the  cleaver  and  the  other  knife,  and  you  Adebowale  (by  agreement 

 

3
--------
between  the  two  of  you)  were  armed  with  the  gun  and  a  knife.  You  Adebolajo  sprinted 

towards  the  officers  jettisoning  the  knife  and  carrying  the  cleaver  above  your  head  as  if 

intent  on  attacking  one  or  more  of  them,  whilst  you  Adebowale  went  down  the  adjacent 

pavement and pointed the gun at the officers. 

 

The  officers  shot  you  both.  They  were  clearly  entitled  to  do  so.  It  is  thanks  to  their 

professionalism, including the speed with which they rendered First Aid, that neither of you 

was killed – especially in your case Adebowale, given that you pointed the gun at them again 

even after you had been shot for the first time. 

 

As  is  clear  from  their  moving  Victim  Personal  Statements,  and  unsurprisingly,  the 

consequences of the murder, its brutality and the publicity, have had a severe and lasting 

impact on those close to Lee Rigby. 

 

You  Adebolajo  were  the  leader  of  this  joint  enterprise  ‐  albeit  that  Adebowale  played  his 

part enthusiastically.  It was you who provided much, if not all, of the equipment and the 

car, and you were the mouthpiece on the day. 

 

That said, neither of you, I am sure, has any real insight into the enormity of what you did, 

nor any genuine remorse for it either – only regret that you did not succeed in your plan to 

be shot dead, which has resulted in you being brought to justice before the courts.  

 

Equally you, Adebolajo, who I have observed at length, have (I am sure) no real prospect of 

rehabilitation. 

 

Sentence for murder is mandatory – it must be one of life imprisonment. 

 

But I must also identify the minimum term that you must serve. 

 

The prosecution assert that, in each of your cases, this was (in the terms of paragraph 4(c) of 

Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003) a murder done for the purpose of advancing a 

political, religious, racial or ideological cause. 

 

 

4
--------
The  prosecution  equally  assert  that,  in  each  of  your  cases,  and  in  accordance  with  the 

provisions of the Counter Terrorism Act 2008, this was a murder with a terrorist connection. 

 

Hence  the  prosecution  submit  that  this  is  an  offence  the  seriousness  of  which  is 

exceptionally high, and that thus my starting point should be a whole life term. 

 

The prosecution also submit, obviously correctly, that in the light of the recent decision of 

the Court of Appeal in Attorney General’s Reference (No.69 of 2013) [2014] EWCA Crim 188 

it is open to me to go on to impose a whole life term in relation to each of you. They draw 

my attention, in particular, to the public nature of what happened, to the fact that there was 

a  significant  degree  of  planning  or  premeditation,  that  Lee  Rigby  was  providing  a  public 

service or performing a public duty, and to the treatment of his body. 

 

As to the starting point it is submitted, amongst other things, on your behalf Adebolajo that I 

should  not  be  bound  by  the  reasons  that  you  yourself  have  given  for  your  actions,  but 

should regard this offence as being one motivated by simple religious hatred actions, or the 

equivalent of the murder of a police officer, and thus the equivalent of an offence requiring 

a starting point of less than a whole life term.  It is urged, although it is accepted that there 

is not much evidence to support it, that you are someone who can be rehabilitated in time.  

As I have already indicated, I am sure that is wrong.   It is urged that I should be flexible in 

my approach to the provisions of Schedule 21 – which I am.  It is further submitted that it is 

of significance that there is no evidence that you were part of a wider group, that there was 

no  intention  to  physically  harm  more  than  one  victim  who  was  chosen  purely  at  random 

because of his profession, and that there is no evidence that the plot was part of a wider 

network or support group, and that thus this is not a case to take the sentence of last resort 

as my starting point.  

 

Similar points are urged in relation to you, Adebowale, together with other points which in 

my judgment come more appropriately into consideration in deciding what the appropriate 

actual sentence is in your case. 

 

I am sure that this was (in the terms of paragraph 4(c) of Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice 

Act  2003)  a  murder  done  for  the  purpose  of  advancing  a  political,  religious,  racial  or 

ideological cause. 

 

5
--------
I am equally sure that, in each of your cases, and in accordance with the provisions of the 

Counter  Terrorism  Act  2008,  this  was  a  murder  with  a  terrorist  connection  –  though  I  am 

careful to avoid double counting in that regard. 

 

I  equally  have  no  doubt  that  this  is  an  offence  the  seriousness  of  which  is,  in  fact, 

exceptionally high, and thus my starting point in relation to it should be a whole life term. 

 

Whilst I agree with Mr Lakha that there are three aggravating features, namely a significant 

degree of planning and premeditation, the fact that the victim was performing a public duty, 

and the way that the body was treated, I have included all of these in the overall facts that I 

have found. 

 

I must however go on to consider my actual sentence. 

 

In your case Adebolajo there is no mitigation, and whilst to state the obvious, this is not a 

case of mass or repeated murder it is nevertheless one of those rare cases where not only is 

the seriousness exceptionally high but the requirements of just punishment and retribution 

make a whole life term the just penalty.  Accordingly in your case I propose to impose such a 

term. 

 

In your case Adebowale I am persuaded that the combination of your lesser role, your age 

and  your  pre‐existing  and  continuing  mental  condition  mean  that  it  is  not  appropriate  in 

your case to impose a whole life term. Nevertheless in your case there must still be a very 

substantial minimum term. The term that I propose to impose is one of 45 years less 272 

days spent on remand.  

 

Michael Adebolajo I sentence you to life imprisonment with a whole life order. 

 

Michael Adebowale I sentence you to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 45 years 

less 272 days spent on remand. 

 

In both your cases I make a Notification Order for the maximum of 30 years. 

 

 

6
--------
There  will  be  no  separate  penalty  in  relation  to  the  firearms  offences  to  which  you  have 

pleaded guilty. 

 

In each of your cases there will be an appropriate victim surcharge.

SUMMARY OF JUDGMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT 

 

LONDON BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON AND OTHERS  

v  

THE MAYOR OF LONDON AND OTHERS 

 

Case No: CO/14653/2013 

 

This summary summarises the judgment handed down in this case.  It forms 

no part of the judgment which should be read in full for a complete 

understanding of the reasons for the decision.  It is available on

References below in square brackets are to paragraph numbers in the 

judgment 

 
1. 
The  application  by  7  London  boroughs  and  Mrs  Ingrid  Richardson  ('the 
Claimants') for permission to apply for judicial review of  the decision made by The 
London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (‘LFEPA’) on 12 September 2013 to 
adopt  LSP5  (‘London  Safety  Plan  5’)  was  heard  by  Mr  Justice  Foskett  on  26-29 
November.   
 
2. 
The decision under challenge was made following a direction from the Mayor 
of London ('the Mayor') in August 2013 that LEFPA was obliged in law to follow. The 
Mayor's  direction  was  based  on  the  recommendation  to  adopt  the  plan  by  the 
London  Fire  Commissioner  ('the  Commissioner').  The  Claimants  sought  an  order 
quashing the decision.

The judgment handed down today explains why the judge decided not to make 

Given  the  urgency,  all  parties  asked  the  judge  to  give  judgment  before 

The Claimants have indicated that they do not intend to appeal.
--------
6. 
LSP5  was  developed  because  of  the  need  to  make  substantial  cuts  in 
expenditure  for  the  fire  services  in  London  from  the  financial  year  2012/13  into 
2013/14.    Similar  cuts  have  had  to  be  made  by  other  fire  services  throughout  the 
country  because  of  reduced  support  from  central  government.    This  was  the  first 
occasion  when  cuts  to  front-line  services  in  London  had  to  be  considered  and  the 
principal effects of LSP5 are to reduce the number of fire stations in London from 112 
to 102, the number of fire appliances from 169 to 155 and the number of fire-fighters 
by 552. 
 
7. 
The judge emphasised that the role of the court was not to decide whether the 
decision to which the three parties named in paragraph 1 above contributed was right 
or  wrong  or  whether  the  court  agreed  with  it  or  not,  but  to  decide  whether  the 
process by which it was reached was lawful or unlawful.  At [7] he said this: 
 

“It is important that anyone interested in this case and its outcome should 
understand  the  extremely  narrow  basis  upon  which  the  court  is  being 
asked to interfere with the decision made.  The hearing does not constitute 
a  public  inquiry  into  the  fire  safety  proposals  for  London  and  it  has  not 
involved  an  evaluation  of  competing  evidence  about  the  proposals.    The 
case  is  also  not  about  whether  the  court  agrees  or  disagrees  with  the 
proposals.    What  is  the  subject  of  legal  challenge  in  these  proceedings is 
primarily  the  process  by  which  that  decision  was  reached.    Whatever 
conclusion may be reached by the court in relation to this challenge, it is 
important  to  understand  that  the  court’s  focus  is  primarily  upon  the 
process leading to the making of the decision, not upon the merits of the 
decision itself or any individual aspect of it, or indeed upon how relevant 
factors  were  weighed  in  reaching  the  decision:  those  have  always  been 
matters  of  judgment  for  the  elected  decision-makers  with  the  help  of 
advice  from  those  with  expertise  in  the  field.    The  court  is  not  the  place 
where any such decision is made and, of course, any political issues that 
may arise are not matters for the court either.  The issue for the court in 
this case is primarily whether the process by which the decision was made 
has  led  to  an  unlawful  decision,  as  is  contended  by  the  Claimants  (and 
supported by the Fire Brigades Union - ‘the FBU’), or to a lawful decision, 
as is contended by the decision-makers.” 
 

The judge clarified who the “decision-makers” were in this context at [8]: 

8. 
 

“The principal decision-makers for this purpose were the Mayor … and … 
LFEPA.    The  substantive  reality  is  that  it  was  the  Mayor  who  made  the 
decision  based  upon  advice  from  and  the  recommendations  of  the  … 
Commissioner ….”   
 
As indicated above, the Mayor directed LFEPA to adopt the plan. 

 
9. 
For  the  Claimants  to  succeed  in  the  case  it  was  necessary  for  them  to 
demonstrate  that  in  the  process  that  led  to  the  decision  the  Commissioner's  advice 
and recommendation (i) failed to take into account material considerations, (ii) took 
into  account  immaterial  considerations  or  (iii)  recommended  a  decision  that  no 
reasonable decision-maker could reach [72].  The test for (iii) is whether the decision 
is  ""so  outrageous  in  its  defiance  of  logic  or  of  accepted  moral  standards  that  no
--------
(i) 

(ii) 

This summary cannot deal with all the arguments and points raised, but the 

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have 
arrived  at  it.""  [218]    The  other  ways  in  which  the  Claimants  sought  to  attack  the 
decision was to suggest that LSP5 breached the National Framework on fire services, 
breached  the  public  sector  equality  duty  under  the  Equality  Act  2010  and  that the 
consultation process undertaken by the Commissioner was flawed.  
 
10. 
main submissions on behalf of the Claimants were - 
 
 
that the way in which the LSP5 was formulated failed properly to take 
account of ""local risk"" and that it failed to have sufficient regard to those areas in the 
Claimant boroughs where there was a substantial number of vulnerable groups (e.g. 
the elderly or disabled) and where there was a high proportion of high-rise buildings; 
 
 
that  the  application  of  ""the  principle  of  equal  entitlement""  (i.e.  that 
Londoners should have equal entitlement to the fastest possible attendance times of 
fire  engines,  irrespective  of  whether  they  live  in  an  area  in  which  there  is  a  higher 
likelihood  or  a  lower  likelihood  of  a  fire  occurring  in  the  first  place)  in  developing 
LSP5 meant that a “one size fits all” approach was adopted that did not take account 
of local risk factors. 
 
11. 
As  to  (i),  the  Commissioner's  case  was  that  the  sophisticated  modelling 
process  (undertaken  by  a  well-established  company  that  advises  many  fire 
authorities throughout the country) that led to the formulation of LSP5 did take into 
account all relevant local risk throughout the whole of London because ""fed into"" the 
modelling process at the outset was the 5-year record (April 2007 to March 2012) of 
all  genuine,  non-false  alarm,  serious  dwelling  fires.  In  his  witness  statement  the 
Commissioner explained as follows: 
 

""The  model  considers  the  location  of  all  serious  incidents  across 
London for the last five years. Given that serious incidents includes 
any incident to which two or more fire appliances have attended that 
is not a false alarm, the model will take account of any fires that have 
taken place in high-rise buildings, high profile buildings and heritage 
buildings  across  London  over  the  last  five  years.  Given  the  strong 
correlation between the locations of these incidents year on year, the 
modelling process optimises the location of resources in order to best 
respond to these serious incidents, including, for example, high-rise 
buildings, heritage buildings, or high profile buildings.""  

 
He went on to say this: 
 

""The Claimants appear to be advocating an approach which looks at 
the  theoretical  likelihood  of  a  fire  occurring  at  a  particular  type  of 
premises,  for  example  high-rise  buildings  or  high  profile  buildings.  
However,  the  approach  adopted  by  the [London  Fire  Brigade]  is  to 
look at actual evidence as to the likely locations of serious incidents 
based on historical data and to plan by reference to this."" 
 
The judge was satisfied - 

12.
--------
(a)  

(b) 

 
that although the phraseology of the documents made available to the 
public during the consultation process may have been hard to follow in this respect, 
the  documents  did  confirm  what  the  Commissioner  said  and  that  the  modelling 
process was as he had described.   This meant that a large quantity of highly relevant 
information about the likely location of serious fires throughout the whole of London 
was fed into the modelling process from the outset.  [194-196]  
 
 that whilst (as the Commissioner himself recognised) there were other 
 
ways  in  which  ""local  risk""  could  have  been  identified,  this  was  a  perfectly  rational 
way of ensuring that when LSP5 was formulated the likely areas where serious fires 
were likely to occur were factored into the process accurately and thoroughly.   
 
13.    As  to  (ii),  the  Commissioner’s  case  was  that  the  ""the  principle  of  equal 
entitlement""  was  not  a  parameter  fed  into  the  modelling  process  and  that, 
accordingly,  it  had  no  direct  impact  on  the  formulation  of  LSP5.    The  model  was 
asked to produce a plan that minimised the aggregate (i.e. the total) of 1st and 2nd 
appliance  response  times  to  serious  accidents across  the  whole  of  London  which  is 
what it did.  The principle of equal entitlement was then used as a means to assess 
the  impact  of  the  proposed  plan,  but  did  not  affect  the  actual  response  times 
generated by the recommendations of the model. 
 
14. 
 

The Commissioner’s witness statement said this on this issue: 

“It  is  important  that  I  emphasise  that  compliance  with  the 
attendance  standards  at  a  London  level  was  not  an  objective  or 
criteria  input  into  the  [model].  As  I  have  explained  above,  the 
optimisation  process  [of  the  model]  sought  to  minimise  first  and 
second  appliance  attendance  times  to  all  serious  incidents  across 
London, irrespective of the attendance standards. Although 6 and 8 
minute attendance standards were used as a reference point to judge 
the effect of making particular changes in the simulation stage of the 
model  …,  London-wide  attendance  standards  did  not  directly 
influence the optimisation process which sought to allocate resources 
in  a  way  which  reduced  attendance  times  across  London  to  the 
maximum possible extent, whether this be to 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 
or 6 minutes. In short, the optimisation process would produce the 
same suggested outcomes at this stage irrespective of the attendance 
standards. To this extent, the Claimants’ suggestion that the first and 
second  attendance  standards  formed  the  basis  of  the  decision  as  to 
where to make the cuts betrays a fundamental lack of understanding 
of  the  modelling  process,  which  was  set  out  in  Draft  LSP5  and  the 
supporting documents ….”  (Emphasis added.)    

 
15. 
The  judge  again  [204]  said  that  the  language  of  the  supporting  documents 
presented during the consultation presented “challenges”, but they did confirm what 
the Commissioner said.  It followed, therefore, that the principle of equal entitlement 
did not influence directly the plan produced by the model.  The judge concluded on 
the  evidence  that  “the  modelling  process  was  not,  as  the  Claimants  suggest, 
configured  to  produce  results  that  had  to  be  consistent  with”  the  6-  and  8-minute 
attendance target times for the 1st and 2nd appliances.
--------
16. 
The  judge  accepted  [206]  that  “the  principle  of  equal  entitlement  has 
undoubtedly  had  some  influence  on  deciding  whether  the  Plan  was  an  acceptable 
way of achieving the necessary budgetary savings” and observed that “this has never 
been denied by the Commissioner.”  The judge addressed the question of whether it 
was irrational to permit the principle to have any influence on the acceptability of the 
plan – in other words, could it be said that “no reasonable organiser of London’s fire 
services  could  reasonably  have  applied  the  principle  in  any  part  of  the  process  of 
formulating or approving the Plan”? [225]  
 
17. 
observations [215-216]: 
 

The  judge  prefaced  his  consideration  of  this  issue  by  the  following 

“… It would be that it is possible to conceive of almost any number of 
permutations  of individual  and  collective circumstances  throughout 
Greater  London  that  could  promote  a  discussion,  possibly  a  lively 
one, about what is a “fair” or “the safest overall” arrangement for the 
emergency fire services.   There will be “hard questions” to address 
from almost any angle.  At the end of the day, someone or some body 
has to make a judgment about how best to allocate limited resources.  
Similar  considerations  will  arise  in  any  other  fire  service  authority 
area  in  the  country,  whether  in  rural  or  urban  communities.  
Judgments have to be made.   It is unlikely that everyone will agree 
with the judgments made.  
  
This, of course, leads to the issue of where the court can step in and 
demand  reconsideration  of  a  judgment  made.    As  I  emphasised  at 
the outset … and as I shall repeat before I conclude … the court does 
not replace such a judgment with its own appraisal of such an issue: 
it  can  only  direct  a  reconsideration  of  such  a  judgment  if  it  can  be 
shown that the process leading to it was unlawful and/or irrational. 

 
 
18.  His conclusion was expressed in these terms [226]: 
 

“ … there would appear to be at least two approaches to the influence 
of attendance times on evaluating the Plan: the utilitarian approach 
advocated by the Claimants and the egalitarian approach adopted in 
the past by the LFEPA (and supported in principle by the FBU) and 
felt  by  the  Commissioner  still  to  have  a  role  to  play  in  the  present 
situation.    He  recognises  the  legitimacy  of  the  former  as  one 
approach,  but  believes  the  latter  to  be  more  appropriate.    The 
Claimants  contend  that  the  former  is  the  only  approach  in  the 
present context.  It is at this point that I cannot agree.   I would agree 
that, if its adoption had the effect of causing all local  risk factors to 
be  ignored  or  so  devalued  in  the  process  as  to  have  no  meaningful 
impact,  there  would  certainly  be  grounds  for  concern  that  the 
National Framework had not been properly reflected in the process 
and  indeed  that  a  rational  approach  was  not  being  followed.  
However, for the reasons I have given (see paragraphs 194-196 …), I 
have not been persuaded that that is indeed the effect of its adoption.  
As I have previously indicated (see paragraphs 204-205), the actual
--------
influence  of  the  principle  on  the  Plan  is  less  potent  than  the 
Claimants  contend.    Whether  the  Commissioner’s  approach  to  its 
influence  at  the  stage  in  the  process  at  which  it  was  considered  is 
right or wrong is not for me; but I cannot see how its influence can 
fairly be described as irrational.”

General observations 

 
The law recognises that right and protects it. 

 

 
Our privacy is, for good reason, important to all of us. 

 
The law permits intrusion into what would otherwise be private information only in 

 
 
1. 
 
 
1.1 
 
 
 
1.2  What a person has in his or her bank account, what a person chooses to write  and to 
 
whom, what telephone calls a person chooses to make and to whom and other matters of 
 
that kind are, save in exceptional circumstances, the business of the individual and of 
 
nobody else. 
 
 
1.3 
 
 
 
1.4 
 
very limited circumstances – for the detection or prevention of crime, for example – and 
 
only then under strict judicial control. 
 
 
 
Those whose privacy is unlawfully intruded upon feel and are entitled to feel a sense 
1.5 
 
 
of violation. It is clear that in ways to which I will return that in this case a number of people 
 
were subjected to intrusion and were greatly affected by it, emotionally, for some financially 
 
and for others in terms of reputational damage.

the gravity of your offending while, on the other hand, not imposing fines which you are 
 
unable to pay, with the result that you would have to serve prison terms in default of 
 
 
payment. To do that would be effectively to impose custodial sentences for offences which 
 
Parliament has deemed to be worthy of a fine and no more. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
I must perform the difficult function of, on the one hand, imposing fines which mark 

 
You have all pleaded guilty to offences under s.55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. 

 
The only punishment available to me for such offences is a fine. 

 

 

   
 

 
 

 
The charges and the available penalties
--------
The offences and their effect 
 

You did this for financial gain. 
 

You had full control over this project. 
  

You engaged others to do your dirty work for you. 
  

As events have shown, there was no basis for such allegations. 
 

 

Some of the information which you sought to gather was in the public domain. A 
 

You, Richard Forrest and Lee Stewart, were the agents through whom this 
 
   

 
 

You, Howard Hill, were employed to gather intelligence and information about a 
 
 

3. 
 
 
3.1 
 
number of other people. Your object was to find ways of discrediting them and of levelling 
 
allegations of dishonest conduct against them. 
  
 
3.2 
 
 
3.3 
 
great deal of it, however, was not. It was your intention from the outset to gain information 
 
 
by means which you knew to be unlawful. 
  
 
3.4 
 
 
3.5 
 
 
3.6 
 
 
3.7 
 
information was obtained. You variously invaded the privacy of 10 individuals. If I deal with 
 
you together, it is to paint an overall picture. But I recognise that you do not accept acting in 
 
 
concert together and that you plead guilty on particular bases. I do not lose sight of that and 
 
will sentence each of you on that basis. 
 
 
3.8 
By various devious strategies, you accessed emails, phone records, bank records and 
 
 
in one case details of where the child of one your victims went to school The birth certificate 
 
 
of that child was obtained. Surveillance was carried out. Credit reports were obtained. It 
 
 
hardly needs stating that you had no right to any of this information. 
 
 
3.9 
 
 
3.10  One of them says this: 
  
 
3.10.1  “It is a horrible feeling that an unauthorised person has been through my phone 
 
records and looked at who I had phoned and who I had sent messages to. It feels like you 
 
have been intruded and very personal information was looked at by people who had no right 
 
 
to do so…” 
 
 
3.11  Others echo this in different words, speaking of stress and anxiety, of feelings of 
 
insecurity and vulnerability. 
 
 
3.12 
 
number of people. 
 
 
3.13 
 
persistence and practising considerable deceit. 
 
 

In short, what you did caused and continues to cause real harm to a significant 
 
 

You did these things for reward. You carried out your acts with considerable

Approach to sentence 
 

 

 

The involvement of the defendants 
 

I intend to adopt this approach to sentence. 
 
 

You, Howard Hill, were the guiding hand over these activities. 
 

 

First, I will decide in the case of each defendant what fine would be appropriate, 
 

   

I bear in mind in respect of each defendant the references which I have read, the 
 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

4. 
 
 
4.1 
 
 
4.2 
You, Richard Forrest and Lee Stewart, acted on his instructions. Whilst your precise 
 
 
involvement varied, in each of your cases it was significant. I sentence you, Lee Stewart, on 
 
 
the basis which you have put forward – that your involvement was limited to two of the 
 
victims. 
  
 
5. 
 
 
5.1 
 
 
5.2 
 
taking account of the degree of involvement of individual defendants, the overall gravity of 
 
 
the offence and all relevant mitigating factors, including the time these proceedings have 
 
been hanging over the defendants. 
 
 
5.3 
 
previous good character of two of the defendants and, in the case of Lee Stewart, the time 
 
which has elapsed since his last conviction. I also bear in mind all the other matters drawn to 
 
 
my attention. 
 
 
5.4 
 
 
on the first occasion that these counts appeared on the indictment. 
 
 
 
5.5 
 
 
exceeds the notional fine, then that fine must be paid. If it does not, then you must pay so 
 
 
much of that as you can reasonably be expected to afford. 
 
 
5.6 
 
 
5.7 
It will also, I recognise, produce a result which might appear disproportionate as 
 
 
between defendants, in that a defendant who has means will pay a greater fine than one 
 
who does not. 
 
 
6. 
 
 
6.1 
 
 
Appeal. The fines must punish and equally must deter. They must also take account of the 
 
gain made by each defendant from his misconduct. 
 
 
6.2 
 
made from it, the harm caused by him and his culpability in causing that harm, both of which 
 
are high, a fine of £150,000 would have been appropriate. Reduced by 1/3rd, the notional 
 
fine would be £100,000. 
 
 

Thirdly, I will reflect on what income and capital is available to you. If it equates to or 
 
 
 

I must set the fines without any guidance from the Sentencing Council or the Court of 
 
 
 

Secondly, I will reduce that figure by one third to reflect the pleas of guilty entered 
 

In the case of Howard Hill, given his central role in this enterprise and the profit he 
 

All counsel agree that this is an approach which is both logical and fair.

Howard Hill:

The means of the defendants 
 

In those circumstances, you must pay a fine of £100,000 
 

In the case of Richard Forrest, his role was lesser and the harm and culpability 
 

In your case, you have income available to pay a fine in the sum of £450 per month. 
 
 

In the case of Lee Stewart, whose involvement is limited in the way I have set out

correspondingly lower. His gain was limited to £6,600. In his case a fine of £25,000 would 
 
have been appropriate. The notional fine, reduced as I have indicated, would be £17,500

already and whose gain was a little over £6000, a slightly lower fine of £20,000 would have

the appropriate fine in your case.

I am satisfied that you at least have some means of raising money from selling such 
 
 

 

In your case, there is no doubt that you have the means to pay the sum I have set as 
 

   

You have a low income and a high level of debt. 
 

 

You also have income and the potential to earn. 
 

 

You must, therefore, pay a fine of £13,250

MR JUSTICE FOSKETT: 
  

 

 

Introduction 
 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Against the background of a need to make significant savings of expenditure in 2013­
 
4  (in  the  region  of  £29.5  million)  and  2014-5  (in  the  region  of  £35.5  million)  in 
relation  to  the  cost  of  the  provision  of  fire  and  emergency  services  in  London, 
 
 
decisions  were  taken  in  August  and  September  this  year  which,  if  implemented, 
would have the following principal effects: 
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  closure  of  10  London  fire  stations  (reducing  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) 
  
number from 112 to 102); 
  

 
 

 

 

the  decommissioning  of  14  fire  appliances  (in  other 
 

(b) 
  
words, reducing the number of fire engines from 169 to 155); 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the reduction by 552 in the number of fire-fighters in 
(c) 
  
London  (a  reduction  of  approximately  10%  of  the  total  fire-
fighting force). 
   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
If  implemented,  the  impact  of this  decision across  the  whole  of  London will  be  to 
increase the average attendance time of the first fire engine at an incident to 5 minutes 
 
33  seconds  (an  increase  of  13  seconds  from  the  current  position)  and  the  average 
 
attendance time of the second fire engine to 6 minutes 32 seconds (an increase of 10 
 
seconds from the current position).  However, it is the specific effect upon the seven 
Claimant  boroughs of increased attendance times  generally that  underlies the  claim 
 
made in these proceedings. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

During the period from 2009/10 to 2012/13 budget savings of £52 million had been 
made  across the  London fire  and rescue services  necessitated by the  Government’s 
 
2010 ‘Comprehensive Spending Review’ which required the fire service nationally to 
save 25% over the 4-year period to April 2015. Savings totalling £71 million had been 
made over the five years prior to the consideration of the proposals under challenge in 
these  proceedings.  The  savings  thus  made  had  not  hitherto  affected  “front  line” 
 
services in London, but the need to make yet further significant savings in the light of 
 
the  provisional  Local  Government  Finance  Settlement  for  2013-14  (which  set  out 
 
Government grant funding for every local authority), published for consultation on 19 
 
December 2012, made this a necessary consideration for the first time. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The need to make the cuts in expenditure is not under challenge in these proceedings.

The  formal  decision  under  challenge  in  these  proceedings  is  embodied  in  what  is 
 
known as the “Fifth London Safety Plan 2013-16” (‘the Plan’ or ‘LSP5’).  Prior to its 
 
ultimate acceptance it was known as “the draft Fifth London Safety Plan” (‘the draft 
 
 
Plan’). 
   

 
  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  hardly  needs  stating  that  the  decision  and  the  process  that  led  to  it  have  been 
 
controversial and that the issues surrounding the decision are sensitive from a number 
 
of points of view.  People are, understandably,  very concerned when they hear that

It is important that anyone interested in this case and its outcome should understand 
 
the extremely narrow basis upon which the court is being asked to interfere with the 
decision made.  The hearing does not  constitute a public inquiry into the fire safety 
 
proposals  for  London and  it  has  not  involved  an  evaluation of competing  evidence 
 
 
about the proposals.  The case is also not about whether the court agrees or disagrees 
 
with the  proposals.  What  is  the  subject  of  legal  challenge  in  these  proceedings  is 
primarily the process by which that decision was reached.  Whatever conclusion may 
be reached by the court in relation to this challenge, it is important to understand that 
 
the court’s focus is primarily upon the process leading to the making of the decision, 
 
not upon the merits of the decision itself or any individual aspect of it, or indeed upon 
how relevant factors were weighed in reaching the decision: those have always been 
 
matters  of  judgment  for  the  elected  decision-makers  with  the  help  of  advice  from 
 
those with expertise in the field.  The court is not the place where any such decision is 
 
made and, of course, any political issues that may arise are not matters for the court 
 
either.  The issue for the court in this case is primarily whether the process by which 
the  decision  was  made  has  led  to  an  unlawful  decision,  as  is  contended  by  the 
 
Claimants  (and  supported  by the  Fire  Brigades  Union - ‘the  FBU’),  or  to  a  lawful 
 
 
decision, as is contended by the decision-makers.

The  principal  decision-makers  for  this  purpose  were  the  Mayor  of  London  (‘the 
 
Mayor’)  and  the  London Fire  and Emergency Planning  Authority (‘LFEPA’).  The 
 
substantive reality is that it was the Mayor who made the decision based upon advice 
 
 
from  and 
(‘the 
 
Commissioner’) although that fact may not be conclusive as to who should have been 
made parties to the present proceedings (see paragraphs 403-410 below) and the relief 
 
sought.  The  Commissioner  is  employed  by  LFEPA  and  may  only  exercise  the 
 
functions delegated to him by LFEPA: he does not have a statutory role as such.  The 
 
report  and  recommendations  of  the  Commissioner  upon  which  the  decision  of  the 
 
Mayor was founded are criticised by the Claimants and the FBU in these proceedings.

The FBU represents over 90% of the uniformed staff of the United Kingdom fire and 
 
rescue service and has in the region of 41,000 members. They include fire-fighters, 
 
area  managers,  emergency  fire  control  staff  and  fire-fighters  working  in  what  is 
 
known as  the  retained  duty system.  (Retained  fire-fighters  have  other  occupations 
 
than merely that of fire-fighter, but respond to an emergency call to become part of a 
 
 
team that attends an incident.)  The FBU has over 5000 members in London. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

It is right to observe that LFEPA as a body was not in favour of the Plan (in the sense 
 
 
that  a majority of  its  members  voted  against  its  adoption),  but  reluctantly accepted 
 
eventually that in law it had to comply with a direction from the Mayor to implement 
 
it. However,  notwithstanding that  background fact, LFEPA joins with the Mayor  in 
rejecting the criticisms made in the present proceedings of the process by which the 
 
ultimate decision was  made.  The  Commissioner  rejects the criticisms  of his  report 
 
and recommendations and contends that  it  is not open to the Claimants to bring, as 
 
 
indeed they seek to do, a free-standing claim for judicial review of his report.

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

11. 

The  parties  advancing  the  criticisms  are  seven  Inner  London  boroughs  (Islington, 
Southwark, Camden, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Lewisham and Greenwich) and one 
individual, Mrs Ingrid Richardson. Each of those boroughs claims that its residents, 
particularly  certain  vulnerable  sections  of  their  communities,  will  be  seriously 
affected  by  the  Plan  if  implemented.    I  will  say  more  about  the  position  in  each 
individual borough later (see paragraphs 101-128 below). 

12.  Mrs Richardson (the 8th Claimant) and her  husband  live  in the Brunswick ward of 
Southwark on the 7th floor of a 15-storey apartment block.  Mrs Richardson, who is 
housebound and moves about with a walking-frame, has severe Parkinson’s Disease 
and  her  husband  suffers  from  Alzheimer’s  disease.    Her  participation  in  the 
proceedings as a claimant  is designed to highlight and  illustrate the  impact that the 
Plan is said to be likely to have on older and disabled residents in Southwark. 

The  other  Interested  Parties  in  these  proceedings  are  listed  in  Appendix  1  to  this 
judgment.    Of  those  interested  parties,  as  I  have  indicated,  the  FBU  supports  the 
challenges made by the Claimants and makes its own submissions in support.  None 
of the other interested parties has played any part in the proceedings. 

The final decision in the process (that made by LFEPA) was made on 12 September 
following  the  direction  from  the  Mayor  dated  2  August  (see  paragraph  66  below).  
The claim for judicial review was received in the Administrative Court Office on 3 
October.  On 17 October Ouseley J directed a “rolled up” 3-day hearing commencing 
on  26  November  with  the  substantive  claim  for  judicial  review  to  proceed 
immediately if permission was granted.  He gave detailed directions in relation to the 
preparations for the hearing that were modified slightly on 29 October.  In the event, 
the hearing did go into a fourth day for an hour or so. 

Those directions were complied with by all parties and I express my appreciation for 
the way in which the papers in the case (running to over 3000 pages) were prepared 
and  collated  and  for  the  high  quality  Skeleton  Arguments  I  received  prior  to  the 
hearing.  When I describe those submissions as “Skeleton Arguments”, it should be 
noted that they totalled 140 pages in length.  The agreed bundle of authorities runs to 
over 1000 pages.  The Commissioner’s witness statement runs to over 100 pages with 
many pages of exhibits.  (I should say that I make no complaint about this given the 
importance  of  the  issues  at  stake,  but  it  demonstrates  the  nature  and  extent  of  the 
material that needs to be considered.) 

The 10 fire stations that would close if the Plan is implemented are due to close on 9 
January  2014.    However,  LFEPA  has  undertaken  not  to  take  any  irreversible 
implementation steps pending the outcome of these proceedings.   

The  outcome  of  this  case  will  affect  the  budgetary  position  of  the  Greater  London 
Authority (‘the GLA’) both in respect of the current financial year and the financial 
year  beginning  in  April  2014  and,  accordingly,  all  parties  have  expressed  the  wish 
that I should give judgment before Christmas if possible, particularly if there should 
be  any  appeal  from  it.    In  those  circumstances  it  is  inevitable  that  I  have  had  to 
prepare this judgment in a much shorter period than I might otherwise have wished to 
have available and the opportunity to edit it has been very limited.  I have had to be 
somewhat selective  in  my choice of areas to cover  in detail and I have  focused on

those  aspects  of  the  evidence  and  argument  that,  in  my  judgment,  advance  the 
position of each party with the greatest force. 

18. 

Although the proceedings were listed on a “rolled up” basis (see paragraph 14 above), 
the  reality  of  the  hearing  was  that  the  merits  of  the  judicial  review  claim  were 
examined in full, the primary issue being whether any of the grounds relied upon by 
the  Claimants  withstood  the  arguments  mounted  against  them.    Some  of  the 
arguments  advanced  by  Mr  Jonathan  Moffett  and  Miss  Heather  Emmerson,  for the 
Commissioner and LFEPA, were to the effect that permission ought not to be granted.  
I will address matters on that basis where appropriate. 

The statutory context, the institutions within it and the funding of the Greater London 
Authority 

19. 

20. 

Before  turning  to  the  substance  of  the  arguments  and  counter-arguments,  it  is 
necessary to review the statutory and institutional context within which the decision-
making process under scrutiny in this case was carried out and the broad nature of the 
funding issues that arose during the relevant period. 

LFEPA 

LFEPA is the ‘fire and rescue authority’ for Greater London established under section 
1(2)(c) of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (‘the FRSA’). It has 17 members, all 
of whom are appointed formally by the Mayor.  Eight are nominated by the London 
Assembly, seven are nominated by the London boroughs and two are nominated by 
the Mayor. LFEPA operates the London Fire Brigade (‘LFB’) which is managed by 
the Commissioner (see paragraph 8 above).  The LFB has no separate legal status of 
its own and is a name used colloquially by LFEPA to refer to the operational activities 
undertaken to meet LFEPA’s statutory duties. 

The FRSA 

21. 

Part  2  of  the  FRSA  prescribes  the  core  functions  of  a  fire  and  rescue  authority. 
Section 6(1) declares that such an authority “must make provision for the purpose of 
promoting fire safety in its area” and the balance of that section relates to how that 
duty may be fulfilled. 

22. 

Section 7 provides for “Fire-fighting” as follows: 

“(1) 
the purpose of - 

A  fire  and  rescue  authority  must  make  provision  for 

(a)  extinguishing fires in its area, and  

(b)  protecting  life  and  property  in  the  event  of  fires  in  its 

area.  

In  making  provision  under  subsection  (1)  a  fire  and 

(2) 
rescue authority must in particular—
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

(a)  secure  the  provision  of  the  personnel,  services  and 
all  normal 

efficiently 

equipment  necessary 
requirements;  

to  meet 

(b)  secure the provision of training for personnel;  

(c)   make arrangements  for dealing with calls  for help and 

for summoning personnel;  

(d)  make arrangements for obtaining information needed for 

the purpose mentioned in subsection (1);  

(e)  make arrangements for ensuring that reasonable steps are 
taken  to  prevent  or  limit  damage  to  property  resulting  from 
action taken for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1).” 

23. 

Other functions are prescribed in succeeding sections of the FRSA.   

24.  With effect from 1 October 2004 a new statutory scheme for fire and rescue services 
in England and Wales was introduced by the FRSA.  Until then the Secretary of State 
recommended national standards for the times within which appliances should attend 
incidents.  Expected response times varied across the country, but were dictated (or at 
least  recommended)  centrally.    The  Act  followed  from  the  recommendations  of  an 
Independent Review of the  Fire Service chaired  by Professor Sir George Bain who 
produced  a  report  in  December  2002  entitled  ‘The  Future  of  the  Fire  Service: 
reducing risk, saving lives’.  

25. 

So  far  as  Greater  London  was  concerned,  from  1985  to  2004  it  was  divided  by 
geographical  area  into  four  categories  (A  to  D)  based  on  property  characteristics: 
Category A represented the highest risk to property and Category D represented the 
lowest risk to property. In his witness statement, the Commissioner makes the point 
that  the  area  within  Category  A  constituted  2%  of  London  in  geographical  terms, 
Category B comprised 43%, Category C comprised 54% and Category D constituted 
17%.    Between  these  categories  there  were  differing  target  attendance  times.  For 
example, an area within Category A demanded a fast response time (i.e. 5 minutes for 
the first two appliances and a third appliance within 8 minutes) whereas in Category C 
areas  the  required  response  rate  was  one  fire  engine  in  8-10  minutes  and  in  some 
Category  D  areas  one  fire  engine  in  20  minutes.    He  makes  this  further  comment 
about the position in those earlier times: 

“Category  A  areas  were  generally  focussed  on  parts  of  inner 
London  which  had  main  shopping  centre  and  business 
buildings, theatres and other entertainment venues or high risk 
industrial  property;  significantly,  there  was  no  mention  of 
housing in the Government’s ‘A’ risk category.” 

26. 

The result of this prioritisation, according to the Commissioner, was as follows: 

“The effect of the Government’s targets was that prior to 2004, 
London’s  emergency  response  and  station  locations  were 
configured  to  provide  a  faster  response  in  central  and  inner

28. 

London than outer London and there was a cluster of resources 
in the inner London boroughs.” 

The main general purpose of the FRSA was to confer greater autonomy and flexibility 
on  the  new  fire  and  rescue  authorities  (which  were  to  be  locally  based)  and  the 
withdrawal  of  the  recommended  national  standard  attendance  times.    This  enabled 
LFEPA to take a fresh look at its own service and I will say more about the approach 
adopted from then on in due course (see paragraphs 79-94). 

Although there was at this time a perceptible shift from nationally-dictated standards 
to more locally-based assessments of risk and need, when the Act came into force the 
then  Office  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  issued  a  series  of  Guidance  Notes 
concerning the way in which a fire authority might wish to approach the formulation 
of  an  “integrated  risk  management  plan”  (‘IRMP’)  (see  paragraphs  36-40  below).  
Since reliance is placed upon Guidance Note 1 by the Claimants, this is a convenient 
point  at  which  to  note  those  parts  of  it  that  are  said  to  be  potentially  relevant.    I 
should, perhaps, record that Mr Moffett makes the point that this Guidance Note was 
produced in 2003 before any fire authority had actually produced an IRMP, that it is 
no longer generally available and is only available on National Archives website. That 
website  does  indeed  indicate  that  “[following]  the  change  of  government  we  are 
reviewing all content on this website”.  In those circumstances  he suggests that the 
Department for Communities and Local Government is unlikely to consider it to have 
much  ongoing  relevance.    It  is,  however,  fair  to  say  that  the  Commissioner,  in 
Supporting  Document  21,  described  the  guidance  documents  issued  as  “old  but  … 
still  regarded  to  be  current.”    I  will  return  to the  implications  of  this  later,  but  for 
present purposes will simply record those paragraphs that have formed the subject of 
some debate before me. 

29. 

Paragraph 1.1 of the Guidance Note says this: 

“This  is  the  first  of  a  series  of  Guidance  Notes  designed  to 
provide advice and assistance to fire authorities and those who 
are  asked  to  develop  Integrated  Risk  Management  Plans 
(IRMPs). It explains what you need to do to produce an IRMP 
and  what  it  might  contain.  The  guidance  is  intended  to  be 
neither  prescriptive  nor  exhaustive,  and  you  may  wish  to 
develop  your  own  arrangements  based  around  the  content  of 
this document.” 

30. 

The other provisions said to be of relevance are as follows: 

“1.2  The  Government  thinks  that  a  modern  and  effective  fire 
and rescue service should serve all sections of our society fairly 
and equitably by: 

  a.  reducing  the  number  of  fires  and  other  emergency 
incidents occurring; 

  b. reducing loss of life in fires and accidents;
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

  c. reducing the number and severity of injuries in fires and 
other emergency incidents; 

  d. reducing the commercial, economic and social impact of 
fires and other emergency incidents; 

  e. safeguarding the environment and heritage (both built and 
natural), and 

 

f. providing value for money. 

1.3  It  does  not  believe  this  can  be  done  on  the  basis  of  the 
present  prescriptive  and  formulaic  national  approach 
to 
providing  fire  cover.  Instead,  the  fire  service  needs  a  more 
modern,  flexible,  and  risk-based  approach  that  can  deliver 
improvements in community safety based on locally identified 
needs.  This  is  the  purpose  of  asking  each  fire  authority  to 
develop an IRMP. 

1.4  The  Government  thinks  effective  IRMPs  will  do  the 
following fundamental things: 

 

identify  existing  and  potential  risks  to  the  community 
within the authority area 

  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  current  preventative  and 

response arrangements 

 

identify  opportunities  for  improvement  and  determine 
policies and standards for prevention and intervention 

  determine resource requirements to meet these policies 

and standards 

1.5  IRMPs  are  not  only  about  replacing  national  fire-cover 
standards  with  local  ones.  They  involve  shifting  the  focus  in 
planning to put people first, looking at the risks arising from the 
full  range  of  fires  and  other  emergency  incidents,  and  at  the 
options  for  their  reduction  and  management.  To  be  effective, 
IRMPs  will  need  to  provide  a  fully  integrated,  risk-managed 
approach  to  community  safety,  fire  safety  inspection  and 
enforcement,  and  emergency  response  arrangements  that  will 
contribute to a safer environment. In order to provide a fair and 
equitable  service  it  will  be  necessary  for  fire  and  rescue 
authorities  to  take  into  account  in  their  IRMPs  the  diverse 
needs  of  the  population  they  serve  and  to  assess  how  best  to 
meet these needs, particularly in relation to community safety 
provisions.  Local  authorities  already  have  a  duty  to  prepare 
strategies  and  plans  for  a  number  of  other  purposes,  e.g. 
community  strategies, Equality  Action Plans, etc. IRMPs will

need  to  be  co-ordinated  with  these  and  the  plans  of  other 
relevant agencies if they are to have maximum effect. 

… 

2.5 As some people become aware that fire authorities will be 
setting  locally  determined  response  standards  to  replace  the 
nationally prescribed fire cover standards, it may initially cause 
some  concern.  You  will  need  to  explain  that  this  process 
provides for the first time an opportunity for fire authorities to 
achieve a real step-change in the provision of community safety 
activities to meet locally determined needs. You will need to be 
able to show that the intention of the policies and standards you 
propose  to  introduce  will  have  a  net  effect  of  improving 
community safety. 

… 

3.3  Identify  existing  and  potential  risks  to  the  community 
within the authority area  

3.3.1  The  first  task  in  preparing  an  IRMP  is  to  identify, 
characterise and prioritise the existing and potential risks within 
your fire authority’s area. You will need to look in some detail 
at  what  has  happened  in  recent  years,  and  what  might 
reasonably be expected to happen. This will include examining 
the number, type, geographical location and time of day of all 
incidents  attended  in  recent  years  (fires,  RTAs,  other  special 
services  e.g.  flooding,  co-responder,  etc).  While  risk  to 
property, the environment and  heritage will  continue to be of 
importance,  risk  to  life  will  in  future  be  given  the  highest 
priority. 

… 

include  risks 

3.3.4 You should be aiming to produce plans, maps, summaries 
or tables  that  show  actual  incidents  and  identifies  areas,  time 
periods, community groups, etc in terms of their relative risks. 
This  may 
that  have  not  previously  been 
considered.  You  may  also  identify  in  this  part  of  the  process 
data that it would be helpful to collect or improve, or research 
you  would  like  to  do  into  correlation  between  incidents  and 
possible  causal  factors.  These  needs  could  feed  into  the  first 
Action Plan so that work is undertaken over the year to fill the 
gaps.

response arrangements

3.4.4 Given the way the current risk assessment categories are 
defined  and  the  way  the  national  recommended  standards  of 
fire  cover  work,  you  may  find  that  some  aspects  of  current 
response  arrangements  are  not  the  optimum  for  the  risks 
identified. In evaluating risk to life, you will take into account 
where the priorities lie. For example the risk to life from fires is 
highest in residential premises, especially higher density, lower 
quality  housing, while there  is a  lower risk of  injury or death 
from  fire  in  commercial  premises,  reflecting  the  massive 
in-built  detection,  suppression  and  public 
investment 
protection  measures.  You  will  need 
to  make  adequate 
arrangements  to  ensure  your  plans  are  based  on  knowledge 
rather than assumptions.

3.5 Identify opportunities  for improvement and determine 
policies and standards for prevention and intervention 

… 

3.5.9  In  setting  response  standards  for  those  incidents  the 
authority  has  decided  to  attend,  you  will  need  to  identify  the 
attendance times to be  met and the resources to be deployed, 
the net effect of any change being improved community safety. 
You may wish to set different standards for fires and for other 
emergency incidents. Because of the geographical variation in 
risks,  it  is  expected  that  emergency  response  standards  will 
vary throughout the authority area and be proportionate to the 
risks.  They  should  not  be  constrained  by  artificial  boundaries 
(such as existing fire station areas). 

Appendix 

This appendix provides some more detailed suggestions about 
questions  to  ask  and  issues  to  consider  at  each  stage  of 
developing IRMPs. It is organised in sections to correspond to 
the main guidance. The list is not intended to be exhaustive, but 
is  indicative  in order to promote consideration of  local  issues 
based  upon  what  has  happened  in  the  recent  past,  and  what 
might possibly occur in the future 

… 

A.1. Identify existing and potential risks to the community 
within the fire authority area

A.4. Determine resource requirements to meet these policies

A.4.1 In following this risk management process you will have 
recognised  the  need  to  adopt  a  flexible  and  proportionate 
approach  to  providing  and  deploying  resources  to  meet  the 
local  standards  you  have  set  for  preventative  action  and  to 
provide a dynamic emergency response. In practice, of course, 
you are not starting with a blank sheet of paper, and you will 
need  to  consider  carefully  how  existing  policies  and  resource 
allocation can best deliver improvements in small stages rather 
than seeking to implement a ‘grand plan’. A ‘one size fits all’ 
approach is unlikely to be appropriate.

As I have indicated, I will return to the implications of this Guidance Note later where 
relevant.  

The National Framework 

32. 

The  role  of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  context  of  the  Fire  and  Rescue  National 
Framework (‘the National  Framework’)  is prescribed  in  section 21 of the FRSA as 
follows: 

“(1) 
National Framework.  

The Secretary of State must prepare a Fire and Rescue 

(2) 

The Framework -  

(a)  must set out priorities and objectives for fire and rescue 
authorities in connection with the discharge of their functions;
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

(b)    may  contain  guidance  to  fire  and  rescue  authorities  in 

connection with the discharge of any of their functions;  

(c)  may contain any other matter relating to fire and rescue 
authorities  or  their  functions  that  the  Secretary  of  State 
considers appropriate.  

The  Secretary  of  State  must  keep  the  terms  of  the 
(3) 
Framework  under  review  and  may  from  time  to  time  make 
revisions to it.  

The  Secretary  of  State  must  discharge  his  functions 
(4) 
under subsections (1) and (3) in the  manner and  to the extent 
that appear to him to be best calculated to promote -  

(a)  public safety,  

(b)  the  economy,  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  fire  and 

rescue authorities, and  

(c) economy, efficiency and effectiveness in connection with 
the matters in relation to which fire and rescue authorities have 
functions.  

(5) 
In  preparing  the  Framework,  or  any  revisions  to  the 
Framework which appear to him to be significant, the Secretary 
of State -  

(a)  must  consult  fire  and  rescue  authorities  or  persons 

considered by him to represent them;  

(b)  must  consult  persons  considered  by  him  to  represent 

employees of fire and rescue authorities;  

(c) may consult any other persons he considers appropriate.  

(6) 
The Framework as first prepared, and any revisions to 
the  Framework  which  appear  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to  be 
significant,  have  effect  only  when  brought  into  effect  by  the 
Secretary of State by order.  

Fire  and  rescue  authorities  must  have  regard  to  the 

(7) 
Framework in carrying out their functions.” 

The  extant  National  Framework  is  the  Fire  and  Rescue  National  Framework  for 
England (July 2012).   

The  Ministerial  Foreword  to  that  National  Framework  presaged  in  the  highlighted 
passage below the economic context in which some of the issues that have fallen for 
consideration by the decision-makers involved in the present case have to be viewed:

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

“The  fact  that  fire  deaths  in  the  home  have  halved  since  the 
1980s, and that since 2007 the number of accidental fire deaths 
in  the  home  has  stabilised  at  around  210  per  year,  is  a 
significant  testament  to the  commitment  to  prevention  shown 
by fire and rescue authorities.  

There are  new challenges.  Fire  and rescue  authorities  need to 
be  able  to  deal  with  the  continuing  threat  of  terrorism,  the 
impact  of  climate  change,  and  the  impacts  of  an  ageing 
population, against the need to cut the national deficit.  

It  is  against  this  background  that  we  launch  this  revised 
National Framework. One of the key principles of which is to 
acknowledge the proficiency and experience of fire and rescue 
authorities;  and  to  allow  them  the  freedom  and  flexibility  to 
deliver the services for which they are respected and renowned 
without  being  hampered  by  Whitehall  bureaucracy  and  red 
tape.  

The  National  Framework  will  continue  to  provide  an  overall 
strategic  direction  to  fire  and  rescue  authorities,  but  will  not 
seek  to  tell  them  how  they  should  serve  their  communities. 
They are free to operate in a way that enables the most efficient 
delivery  of

Government, that fire and rescue authorities are accountable.” 

their  services.  This  may

35. 

36. 

The  first  paragraph  in  the  above  extract  from  the  National  Framework  highlights 
another factor said to be of relevance in this case (see, e.g., paragraph 282 below). 

As will be apparent from paragraphs 28-30 above, a key concept within the National 
Framework is the “integrated risk management plan” (‘IRMP’).  At paragraph 1.3 of 
the National Framework the following appears: 

“Each fire and rescue authority must produce an integrated risk 
management  plan  that  identifies  and  assesses  all  foreseeable 
fire  and  rescue  related  risks  that  could  affect  its  community, 
including  those  of  a  cross-border,  multi-authority  and/or 
national nature. The plan must have regard to the Community 
Risk Registers produced by Local Resilience Forums and any 
other local risk analyses as appropriate.”  

37. 

Paragraph 1.10 provides as follows: 

“Each  fire  and  rescue  authority  integrated  risk  management 
plan must:  

  demonstrate  how  prevention,  protection  and  response 
activities will best be used to mitigate the impact of risk

in 
accordance  with  the  principles  of  better  regulation  set 
out in the Statutory Code of Compliance for Regulators, 
and the Enforcement Concordat” 

38. 

Paragraph 1.11 is as follows: 

“Fire and rescue authorities must make provision to respond to 
incidents such as fires, road traffic accidents and emergencies 
within their area and in other areas in line with their mutual aid 
agreements, and reflect this in their integrated risk management 
plans.”  

39. 

Paragraph 2.3 provides as follows: 

“Each  fire  and  rescue  authority  integrated  risk  management 
plan must:  

  be easily accessible and publicly available  



its

The  decision  under  challenge  in  these  proceedings  finds  expression  in  an  IRMP 
(namely, the Plan) adopted by LFEPA. 

Public sector equality duty 

41. 

The ‘public sector equality duty’ imposed upon a public authority by section 149 of 
the Equality Act 2010 is as follows: 

 “(1)  A  public  authority  must,  in  the  exercise  of  its 
functions, have due regard to the need to - 

(a) 

eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and 

 
any other conduct that is prohibited by or under this Act;
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

(b) 

 
advance equality of opportunity between persons who 
share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not 
share it; 

(c) 

 
foster  good  relations  between  persons  who  share  a 
relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share 
it. 

(2) 
A  person  who  is  not  a  public  authority  but  who 
exercises  public  functions  must,  in  the  exercise  of  those 
functions,  have  due  regard  to  the  matters  mentioned  in 
subsection (1). 

(3) 
Having due regard to the need to advance equality of 
opportunity  between  persons  who  share  a  relevant  protected 
characteristic and persons who do not share it involves having 
due regard, in particular, to the need to - 

(a) 

 
remove or minimise disadvantages suffered by persons 
who share a relevant protected characteristic that are connected 
to that characteristic; 

(b) 

take  steps  to  meet  the  needs  of  persons  who  share  a 
 
relevant  protected  characteristic  that  are  different  from  the 
needs of persons who do not share it; 

(c) 

encourage  persons  who  share  a  relevant  protected 
 
characteristic to participate in public life or in any other activity 
in  which  participation  by  such  persons  is  disproportionately 
low. 

(4) 
The  steps  involved  in  meeting  the  needs  of  disabled 
persons that are different from the needs of persons who are not 
disabled include, in particular, steps to take account of disabled 
persons’ disabilities. 

(5) 
Having due regard to the need to foster good relations 
between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic 
and persons who do not share it involves having due regard, in 
particular, to the need to - 

 

 

(a) 

tackle prejudice, and 

(b)  promote understanding. 

(6) 
Compliance with the duties in this section may involve 
treating some persons more favourably than others; but that is 
not to be taken as permitting conduct that would otherwise be 
prohibited by or under this Act. 

(7) 

The relevant protected characteristics are -

42. 

There is no suggestion in this case of any direct discrimination, but the suggestion is 
that there is indirect discrimination (see paragraphs 344-379 below).  Section 19 of 
the Act defines the circumstances in which this may occur: 

“(1) 
A  person  (A)  discriminates  against  another  (B)  if  A 
applies  to  B  a  provision,  criterion  or  practice  which  is 
discriminatory in relation to a relevant protected characteristic 
of B’s.  

(2) 
For  the  purposes  of  subsection  (1),  a  provision, 
criterion or practice  is discriminatory  in relation  to a relevant 
protected characteristic of B’s if—  

(a)  A applies, or would apply, it to persons with whom B 

does not share the characteristic,  

(b) 

it puts, or would put, persons with whom B shares the 
characteristic at a particular disadvantage when compared with 
persons with whom B does not share it,  

(c) 

it puts, or would put, B at that disadvantage, and  

(d)  A  cannot  show  it  to  be  a  proportionate  means  of 

achieving a legitimate aim.  

The  relevant  protected  characteristics  are  [as  defined 

(3) 
above].”

So far as the powers of the Mayor in relation to the fire services in Greater London 
are concerned, section 328A of the  Greater London Authority  Act 1999 (‘the 1999

The Greater London Authority’s budgetary arrangements 

45. 

So  far  as  the  funding  of  the  GLA  is  concerned,  the  witness  statement  of  Martin 
Clarke, Executive Director of Resources, indicates that the “major sources of revenue 
are council tax, grants paid by the Secretary of State, retained business rates, fares, a 
business rate supplement  levy, and other sources such  as  advertising and road user 
charging.”    He  explains  the  way  in  which  the  GLA’s  budget  is  determined  in  the 
following way: 

“9. 
In accordance with sections 85-93 and Schedule  6 of 
the GLA  Act, the Mayor  is responsible  for the preparation of 
the annual budgets for the GLA (which comprises two separate 
components for the purposes of budget setting – the Mayor and 
the  London  Assembly)  and  its  functional  bodies  (LFEPA, 
Transport for London, Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, 
and  the  London  Legacy  Development  Corporation).    Under 
paragraph  1  of  Schedule  6  the  Mayor  and  Assembly  are 
responsible  for  the  preparation  of  (i)  a  component  budget  for 
each “constituent body”, that is, the Mayor, the Assembly, and 
each of the functional bodies, and (ii) a consolidated budget for 
the GLA. The  Mayor  must prepare a draft component budget 
for  each  constituent  body,  consulting  the  Assembly  before 
preparing the draft component budgets  for the Mayor and the 
Assembly,  and  the  functional  bodies  before  preparing  their 
draft component budgets. (These component requirements are 
amounts  to  be  raised  from  London’s  council  tax  payers  for 
these bodies and it is these that the London Assembly has the 
power to amend.) The Mayor must then prepare a consolidated 
budget for the GLA, consisting of the component budgets for 
each  of  the  constituent  bodies,  which  together  constitute  the 
consolidated  budget  for  the  GLA.  This  comprises  the  first 
stage,  described  as  the  ‘draft  consolidated  budget’,  i.e.  a 
statement  of  the  amount  of  the  component  council  tax 
requirement for each body and the calculations which give rise 
to  this  amount,  and  a  statement  of  the  aggregate  of  these 
component  council  tax  requirements,  called  the  consolidated 
council tax requirement.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

10. 
After the draft consolidated budget has been approved 
(amended by the Assembly or not) the Mayor has to prepare a 
‘final  draft  budget’, 
i.e.  a  final  draft  of  the  proposed 
consolidated  budget.  This  may  be  the  same  as  the  draft 
consolidated budget, or the draft consolidated budget amended 
by the Assembly or the Mayor. The final draft budget is then to 
be  presented  to  the  Assembly  for  consideration  at  a  further 
public meeting, and for approval with or without amendment. 

11. 
The  process  of  determination  of  the  component  and 
consolidated  budgets  is  expected  to  take  place  between 
December,  when  central  Government’s  provisional  financial 
settlement is published, and the end of February, when the final 
draft budget must be approved by the Assembly in accordance 
with paragraph 8(7) of Schedule 6. 

12. 
Under  section  110  of  the  GLA  Act,  the  Mayor  may 
request  any  information  relating  to  the  financial  affairs  of  a 
functional  body  to  be  provided  to  the  GLA  where  such 
information  is  required  for  the  purpose  of  any  functions 
exercisable by the Mayor or the Assembly.   Under section 125, 
the Mayor may serve a notice on a functional body requiring it 
to provide him with such specified information as he needs for 
the  purpose  of  deciding  whether  to  exercise  his  powers  and 
how 
to  perform  his  functions  concerning  revenue  and 
accounts.”   

46. 

That  process  helps  to  explain  some  of  the  timing  issues  that  will  become  apparent 
when dealing with the more detailed background to the decision-making process. 

The background to the decision-making process 

47. 

As will be apparent from the Introduction to this judgment (see paragraph 2), there 
was a somewhat more prolonged history to the process that led to the adoption of the 
Plan than is simply reflected in the period from December 2012 to September 2013 
although that is the important period. 

48.  Mr Clarke’s statement indicates that “[key] public expenditure decisions affecting the 
GLA  Group  over  the  Government’s  Comprehensive  Spending  Review  Period  of 
2011/12  to  2014/15  were  announced  in  October  2010.”    He  comments  that  at  that 
stage there were published cuts in the grant funding for Transport for London for the 
four year spending review period, “but only two year figures at most were available 
for  other  members  of  the  GLA  Group”  which  included  the  fire  services.  The 
Comprehensive  Spending  Review  provided  for  an  average  total  reduction  in  grant 
funding of 25% to fire authorities in England, but its distribution amongst individual 
authorities had not been determined.  This led to uncertainties about what would be 
available through this source for LFPEA which were, he says, “compounded by the 
impending impact of changes to the local government finance system for 2013-14.”  It 
was only when the Local Government Finance Settlement for 2013-14 was published 
for  consultation  on  19  December  2012  (which  set  out  proposed  government  grant 
funding for every local authority) that the position became clearer.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

Some pre-planning, however, had to be undertaken in view of the anticipated cuts in 
funding from central government for the fire services.  In June 2012 the Mayor issued 
budget  guidance  for  2013-14  and  2014-15  for  LFEPA  and  the  other  “functional 
bodies”  of  the  GLA.    For  the  purpose  of  preparing  the  budgets,  the  June  2012 
guidance  set  out  the  Council  Tax  requirements  for  LFEPA  and,  according  to  Mr 
Clarke,  “based  on  those  requirements  estimated  savings  to  be  made  by  LFEPA  of 
£29.5 million in 2013/14 and £35.3 million in 2014/15.”  Because of the uncertainties 
over  the  level  of  central  government  funding  for  the  future,  no  final  budget  for 
LFEPA could be set in accordance with the usual timetable and, accordingly, it was 
agreed  that  this  should  await  the  publication  of  the  provisional  Local  Government 
Finance  Settlement  which  was  anticipated  in  December.    As  indicated  above 
(paragraphs 3 and 48), it was published on 19 December 2012 and following a period 
of consultation the  final Local Government Finance Settlement was published on  4 
February  2013  and  the  associated  2013/14  Local  Government  Finance  Report  was 
approved by Parliament on 13 February 2013. 

The  likely  position  in  relation  to  central  government  funding  was  not,  therefore, 
known until shortly before Christmas 2012, but the Commissioner had already started 
looking  at  how  the  necessary  savings  might  be  made.  On  22  November  2012  he 
presented his preliminary proposals for LSP5 to LFEPA which at that stage did not 
contain any reductions in the number of fire stations or fire appliances.  In his witness 
statement, the Commissioner says that he “advised Members that officers [had] been 
working on potential changes to the numbers of fire stations and pumping appliances 
but that that work was not complete [and that he] made clear that the work anticipated 
that  the  [LFB]  would  have  diminished  financial  resources  in  the  future,  but  also 
responded to the diminished demand on the [LFB’s] services over the last ten years.”  
He records also that LFEPA “agreed an initial draft for pre-consultation engagement 
with key stakeholder organisations and staff, including the FBU.” 

In the light of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement (see paragraphs 
3 and 48 above), the Mayor wrote to the Chairman of LFEPA on 20 December 2012 
with  revised  guidance  on  the  budget  proposals  for  2013/14  confirming  that,  after 
allowing for the impact of the revised savings target for 2013/14, there would need to 
be  a  savings  target  for  2014/15  of  a  similar  scale  to  that  previously  notified  for 
2014/15.    He  stated  that  the  indications  were  that  the  settlement  for  LFEPA  for 
2014/15  would  reduce  by  at  least  £21.5  million,  that this  would  not  necessarily  be 
LFEPA’s savings target for that year and that “further substantial savings will need to 
be made … including the rationalisation of the fire estate”.  He stated that the impact 
of  the  settlement  gave  LFEPA  greater  flexibility  to  manage  the  reduction  in 
Government support over the next two years and that “it is imperative that [LFEPA] 
brings back proposals in early 2013/14 to manage the scale of reductions anticipated 
in 2014/15”.  He requested the submission of plans for both 2013/14 and 2014/15 in 
time  to  conclude  the  preparation  of  his  draft  consolidated  budget  for  the  London 
Assembly meeting on 8 February 2013. 

There seem to be two conclusions to be drawn from this: (i) that there was to be no 
escape  from  significant  cuts  to  the  fire  service  budget  across  both  2013/14  and 
2014/15;  (ii)  that  urgent  consideration  had  to  be  given  to  the  finalisation  of 
appropriate  plans  to  secure  these  savings.    The  first  was  effectively  a  decision 
imposed upon the GLA by central government as it was upon other local authorities

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

around the country.  The second was a  function  of the way the central government 
cuts were announced and the way the GLA’s budgetary arrangements were organised. 

The  Commissioner  then  prepared  a  further  draft  of  the  Plan  for  consideration  by 
LFEPA at its meeting on 21 January 2013.  In summary, he suggested that the best 
way forward, given the financial constraints, was to allocate resources on the basis of 
151 appliances at 100 fire stations (usually referred to as the ‘151/100 option’) – in 
other words, suggesting the closure of 12 fire stations (Clerkenwell, Clapham, New 
Cross,  Southwark,  Bow,  Kingsland,  Downham,  Belsize,  Knightsbridge,  Silvertown, 
Westminster and Woolwich) and the decommissioning of 18 appliances.  I will say 
more about how this recommendation emerged in due course.  That, however, was the 
draft  Plan  upon  which  the  Commissioner  was  inviting  LFEPA  to  embark  upon  a 
consultation process. 

It  is,  perhaps,  not  surprising  that  there  was  considerable  resistance  to  any  proposal 
that any front-line service cuts should be made (such cuts, as I have said, not having 
been necessary before) and at the meeting on 21 January 2013 LFEPA voted to amend 
the  draft  Plan  that  the  Commissioner  had  formulated  to  remove  all  references  to 
reducing  the  number  of  fire  stations  and  appliances  in  Greater  London.    This,  of 
course, would have emasculated any cost-cutting exercise of the sort contemplated by 
the budget guidance given by the Mayor. 

There was an exchange of letters between the Mayor and the Commissioner on 28 and 
29 January.  The Mayor had asked the Commissioner whether there were any viable 
alternatives to the proposals in the draft Plan presented at the meeting on 21 January.  
His answer was that the proposals represented his “preferred approach to achieving 
cost  reductions  and  preserving  compliance  with  London-wide  targets”  and  that  he 
recommended them for consultation. 

In  consequence  on  30  January  2013  the  Mayor  issued  a  direction  under  section 
328A(1)(c) of the 1999 Act requiring LFEPA to adopt the draft Plan as proposed by 
the  Commissioner  and  presented  to  the  meeting  on  21  January  2013  without 
amendment as its Draft Fifth London Safety Plan “for all purposes and to begin public 
consultation on the Draft LSP5 within 14 calendar days of his direction” (i.e. by 14 
February 2013).   

On 11 February, at an extraordinary meeting of LFEPA, a bare majority resolved not 
to  comply  with  the  direction  notwithstanding  the  advice  of  Mr  Peter  Oldham  QC 
given  on  4  February  2013  that the  authority  had  no option  but to  comply  with  the 
direction.      On  18  February  the  Mayor  told  LFEPA  that  he  would  seek  immediate 
legal  redress  in  order  to  ensure  that  his  direction  was  followed.    On  26  February 
LFEPA’s  Appointments  and  Urgency  Committee  met  and  agreed  to  proceed  with 
consultation on the draft un-amended Plan.  

On  4  March  LFEPA  began  a  public  consultation  on  the  draft  Plan  which  was 
supported  by  a  number  of  “supporting  documents”.    I  will  be  referring  to  some  of 
those  supporting  documents  in  due  course,  but  they  are  listed  for  convenience  in 
Appendix  2  to  this  judgment.    All  documents  up  to  and  including  Supporting 
Document  21  were  issued  on  4  March  when  the  consultation  started.    Supporting 
Document  22  was  issued  on  7  May,  Supporting  Document  23  on  29  May  and 
Supporting  Document  24  on  14  June.  The  consultation  ran  until  17  June.    The

supporting  document  entitled  ‘Third  appliance  response  times  by  wards‘  was 
published on 27 June and thus after the consultation had closed. 

I will return to the criticisms sought to be  made of the consultation process  in due 
course  (see  paragraphs  275-343),  but  I  will,  in  the  first  instance,  complete  the 
chronology of the decision-making process. 

After  the  conclusion  of  the  consultation  process,  the  Commissioner  produced  a 
revised plan for the purpose of a meeting of LFEPA on 18 July.  The new draft Plan 
was released on 10 July.  For present purposes, the ‘headline’ changes to the original 
draft plan would result in the retention of two fire stations previously earmarked for 
closure  (Clapham  and  New  Cross)  and  the  retention  of  four  further  appliances 
resulting  in the overall reduction  in appliances to 155 rather than 151 as originally 
proposed.   The revised draft Plan proposed to reduce the number of fire-fighter posts 
by 552 instead of the 520 proposed in the original draft Plan.  The revised draft Plan 
also proposed the reduction from 16 to 14 of the number of fire rescue units (‘FRUs’) 
available in London and to reduce to 4 from 5 the minimum crewing levels on FRUs.  
(A  FRU  is  a  purpose  built  vehicle  designed  to  provide  specialist  rescue  functions 
which include incidents that involve line rescue, water rescue, road traffic accidents, 
people  trapped  in  machinery  and/or  hazardous  materials.  A  FRU  also  provides  an 
extended duration breathing apparatus role for use in large complex building fires and 
to support or rescue fire-fighters in need of assistance.)  

This latter recommendation had no equivalent predecessor in the original draft Plan 
and was thus a new proposal.  It forms the subject of one part of the FBU’s challenge 
to the decisions under challenge (see paragraphs 325-343 below). 

The  day  before  the  revised  Plan  was  released  the  Mayor  had  issued  his  budget 
guidance for 2014/15 which indicated that budget plans should be prepared reflecting 
the impact of a £21.5 million reduction in LFEPA’s estimated Revenue Support Grant 
for 2014/15.  The budget guidance contained the following paragraph: 

“Although  the  Government’s  Spending  Round  announcement 
reduces further the funding for the fire service in 2015-16, the 
funding figure above for LFEPA includes additional support to 
offset  this  reduction.  Therefore,  LFEPA’s  previous  savings 
targets remain unchanged.” 

The  “funding  figure  above”  was  a  reference  to  the  total  funding  for  LFEPA  from 
Council  Tax,  Council  Tax  Freeze  Grant,  Retained  Business  Rates  and  Revenue 
Support  Grant  totalling  £379  million  in  2014-15  compared  with  £400.8  million  in 
2013-14. 

This was considered and noted at the meeting of LFEPA on 18 July where the revised 
draft  Plan  was  also  considered.    At  the  same  meeting  LFEPA  again  decided  (by  9 
votes to 8) to delete from the draft Plan all references to station closures, appliance 
reductions  and  reductions 
instructed  the 
Commissioner to tell the Mayor of its decision and to ask the Mayor to allocate full 
funding in line with the draft Plan as amended.  This the Commissioner did by a letter 
dated 19 July. The  Mayor replied on 23  July  indicating that he was  not  minded to 
provide additional funding.

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

65. 

66. 

67. 

68. 

A meeting of LFEPA’s Appointments and Urgency Committee on 24 July resolved to 
establish  a  Working  Group  to  examine  how  the  budget  gap  could  be  met  without 
closing  stations,  removing  fire  appliances  or  making  fire-fighters  redundant  and  to 
report by 12 September. Following  further exchanges of  letters between the Mayor 
and  the  Commissioner  (see  paragraphs  381-382  below),  on  2  August  the  Mayor 
directed  LFEPA  to  adopt  the  revised  Plan  the  Commissioner  had  proposed  at  the 
meeting on 18 July. 

The Executive Summary of the  ‘Request  for Mayoral Decision’ stated that LFEPA 
had “resolved to remove all references to reductions in numbers of firefighters, fire 
stations and appliances from [the] proposals, leaving LFEPA with savings in the order 
of £35m to find for 2014-15 of which in excess of £29m (over 80% of the savings 
required) directly relate to the changes made to the Plan by LFEPA Members on 18 
July  2013”  and  that  the  Mayor  could  not  “allow  this  situation  to  continue  and  has 
indicated that, in the knowledge that  frontline savings can be made without affecting 
public safety, he wishes to direct LFEPA to adopt and publish the final Plan in the 
form  put  forward  by  the  Commissioner  and  to  authorise  the  Commissioner  to 
commence  implementation.”    (The  underlined  expression  is  one  upon  which  the 
Claimants place reliance in support of their case: see paragraphs 380-389 below.) 

On  23  August  the  local  authority  Claimants  invited  the  Secretary  of  State  for 
Communities  and  Local  Government  in  writing  to  issue  a  direction  to  the  Mayor 
under section 328B(2) requiring the revocation of his direction on the basis that it was 
inconsistent  with  the  National  Framework,  but  by  a  letter  dated  10  September  the 
Secretary of State declined to do so on the basis that the Mayor’s decision did  not 
appear to have been inconsistent with the National Framework. 

Further  legal  advice  was  obtained  by  LFEPA  about  the  need  to  comply  with  the 
Mayor’s  direction  and  similar  advice  to  that  given  previously  (see  paragraph  57 
above)  was  given  by  Mr  Gavin  Millar  QC.    As  a  result,  on  12  September  2013  it 
resolved by the Chairman’s casting vote to comply with the direction. 

The essential challenges made by the Claimants 

69. 

In a nutshell, there are challenges to the decisions on traditional public law grounds 
(whether in the context of “standard” scrutiny or “heightened” scrutiny by the court), 
on the basis of an alleged breach of the public sector equality duty (‘PSED’) imposed 
by  section 149 of the Equality  Act 2010 and on the  basis of an  alleged unfair and 
flawed consultation process.  There is inevitably some overlap between these various 
approaches and compartmentalising the submissions under one heading or another has 
been difficult. 

70.  Mr  Daniel  Stilitz  QC  and  Miss  Hannah  Slarks,  for the  Claimants,  contend  that the 
effect of the decision will have a systematic and disproportionately adverse impact on 
the Claimant boroughs and their residents, reducing  fire-fighting resources  in Inner 
London, whilst maintaining and in some cases improving resources in Outer London.  
In his oral submissions Mr Stilitz asserted that, taken as a whole, these proposals, if 
implemented,  would  result  in  “a  decimation  of  the  London  Fire  Service”,  namely, 
“roughly a 10% cut to London’s front-line fire-fighting capability”.
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

71.  Whether that broad contention is or is not justified is, of course, essentially irrelevant 
to  the  court’s  decision  on  the  challenge  made  by  the  Claimants.    Subject  to  the 
question of whether “heightened scrutiny” is called for in this situation (see paragraph 
72  and  227  below),  for  the  court  to  be  able  to  intervene  the  Claimants  must 
demonstrate that the decision was flawed on classic public law grounds and/or that the 
process  of  consultation  was  unfair  in  such  a  way  as  to  render  the  final  decision 
following the consultation invalid. 

72. 

So  far  as  the  challenge  based  upon  “classic  public  law  grounds”  is  concerned,  in 
summary Mr Stilitz contends that the decisions taken (i) failed to take into account all 
essential  material  considerations,  (ii)  failed  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the 
National  Framework  to  take  into  account  all  foreseeable  risks  and  (iii)  were,  by 
“treating  manifestly unlike  boroughs alike”,  irrational.  These arguments reflect the 
established Wednesbury approach (see Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v 
Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223) that the court may intervene only if it can 
be  demonstrated  that  the  decision-maker  failed  to  take  into  account  material 
considerations,  took  into  account  immaterial  considerations  or  otherwise  reached  a 
decision  that  no  reasonable  decision-maker  could  reach.    I  will  return  to  further 
articulations of the appropriate approach in that context in due course (see paragraph 
218 below), but, as I have already indicated (see paragraph 71 above), it is also to be 
noted  that  Mr  Stilitz  also  contends  that  because  fire-fighting  resources  are  being 
reduced  by  10%,  potentially  matters  of  life  and  death  are  at  stake  and  that, 
accordingly, a heightened level of scrutiny should be adopted in such cases.  He relies 
on R (Rogers) v Swindon NHS PCT [2006] 1 WLR 2649, per Sir Anthony Clarke MR 
at [56] and R (Hillingdon LBC) v Lord Chancellor [2008] EWHC 2683, per Dyson LJ 
at [67].  Again, I will return to this contention in due course (see paragraph 218). 

73. 

The ground of claim alleging an unfair and flawed consultation process is based on 
the  suggestion  that  the  most  controversial  and  unpalatable  implications  of  the  cuts 
were  not  disclosed  fairly  and  that  relevant  information  was  masked,  delayed  and 
misrepresented and in one case simply withheld from the public.  It is suggested that 
“a fair consultation process might have made a difference to the direction of travel of 
the consultation on these highly controversial and divisive cuts” which, relying upon 
R (Smith) v North Eastern Derbyshire PCT [2006] 1 WLR 3315, is said to be all that 
needs to be established. 

74. 

It is alleged against the Mayor that (a) he relied upon a flawed recommendation and, 
in  any  event,  (b)  misdirected  himself  about  its  effect  by  believing  that the  savings 
could “be made without affecting public safety” (see paragraphs 380-389 below). 

The essential answer of the Defendants 

75.  Mr Moffett and Miss Emmerson, on behalf of the Commissioner and LFEPA, and Mr 
Richard Drabble QC and Mr Charles Banner, on behalf of the Mayor, reject all these 
arguments. 

In summary, so far as the merits are concerned, Mr Moffett says that the Claimants 
have misunderstood or misrepresented the modelling process involved in formulating 
the Plan and the sensitivity analysis conducted in relation to the emerging Plan.  As a 
result of those processes all relevant risks were identified and factored into the final 
Plan with the result that both the National Framework and the public sector equality

duties were complied with. The ultimate Plan took account of all those matters and 
the  matters  raised  in  the  consultation  process  and  also  reflected  the  professional 
judgment of the Commissioner who has immense experience in the field.  There is, he 
submits,  no  possible  basis  for  suggesting  that  a  decision  based  upon  the 
Commissioner’s recommendations passes any of the Wednesbury thresholds such as 
to  justify  the  court’s  intervention.    An  irrationality  challenge  does  not,  he  submits, 
“even get off the ground”. 

77. 

In  relation  to  the  criticisms  of  the  consultation,  Mr  Moffett  contends  that  the 
criticisms  are  inextricably  linked  to  the  substantive  case  and  are  unfounded.    This 
was,  he  submits,  a  consultation  where  the  Commissioner  was  entitled  to  decide  on 
what issues appeared to him to be of substantial importance, but that when asked for 
further information as part of the consultation process he provided it.  Nothing was 
masked  or  concealed,  he  contends,  and  everything  that  was  necessary  to  enable  a 
meaningful response by the consultees and the public was provided. 

78.  Mr Drabble adopted these submissions, supplementing them with some of his own, 
and contended that the Mayor was entitled to rely upon the professional judgment and 
recommendations  of  the  Commissioner.    He  also  submitted  that  there  was  no 
misunderstanding by the Mayor of the effect of the Plan. 

The approach to the provision of fire services in London after 2004 

Before  turning  to  the  detail  of  the  challenges  made  and  the  response  to  those 
challenges,  it  would  be  helpful  to  describe  briefly  the  way  in  which  fire  service 
provision  for  Greater  London  had  been  organised  after  the  new  dispensation 
introduced  by  the  2004  Act  came  into  being  (see  paragraph  21  et  seq  above).  
Inevitably, any more locally-based approach from that date had to take account of the 
existing  infrastructure  (buildings,  appliances,  manpower  and  so  on)  and  the  more 
flexible  approach  permitted  following  the  Act  necessarily  involved  re-visiting  the 
standards  that  had  applied  across  London  hitherto.    I  summarised  the  effect  of  the 
application of those standards in paragraphs 25-26 above.  

The current Commissioner, Mr Ron Dobson CBE, was not the Commissioner at the 
time.    He  became  London  Fire  Commissioner  from  1  October  2007.   Nonetheless, 
basing the following account largely on his undisputed evidence, it should be noted 
that  the  first  IRMP,  the  London  Safety  Plan  (‘LSP1’),  was  adopted  by  LFEPA  in 
March 2004.  This stated that the LFB would continue using the former recommended 
attendance  times  on  a  temporary  basis  whilst  consideration  was  given  to  what  the 
appropriate standard should be.  Since then LFEPA has adopted three further LSPs, 
excluding  the  Plan  under  consideration  in  these  proceedings.  The  Second  London 
Safety  Plan  2005/2008  (‘LSP2’)  was  approved  in  March  2005,  the  third  for 
2008/2011  (‘LSP3’)  was  approved  in  March  2008  and  the  fourth  for  2011/2013 
(‘LSP4’) in March 2011. 

Since LSP2, LFEPA has applied broadly to the organisation of fire services in London 
what  has  come  to  be  known  as  “the  principle  of  equal  entitlement”.    The 
Commissioner  describes  how  the  principle  came  to  be  adopted  in  his  witness 
statement and I will return to that briefly (see paragraphs 84-85 below) after spelling 
out  what  it  involves.    Since  the  adherence  to  the  principle  in  the  Plan  under 
consideration  in  these  proceedings  is  heavily  criticised  by  the  Claimants,  it  is 

79. 

80.

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

important to understand its implications.  The Commissioner describes it in this way 
in his witness statement at [23]: 

“The [LFB] plans the allocation of its resources on a London-
wide  basis.  By  this  I  mean  that  we  plan  the  location  of  fire 
appliances (and other resources) so they can arrive at incidents 
as quickly as possible, wherever the incident occurs in London. 
Since LSP2, the [LFB] has adopted as a guiding principle the 
concept  that  Londoners  should  have  equal  entitlement  to  the 
fastest possible attendance times,  irrespective of  whether they 
live in an area in which there is a higher likelihood or a lower 
likelihood of fire occurring in the first place. The [LFB’s] view 
is that in the event of a serious incident, each person should be 
entitled  to  expect  a  broadly  similar  response  in  terms  of 
resources deployed and the time to arrive. Just because a person 
lives in an area with a lower likelihood of fire occurring, this 
does  not  mean  that  they  should  have  a  slower  response  time 
when  a  fire  actually  does  occur.  For  convenience,  this  is 
referred to in this witness statement as the principle of “equal 
entitlement”.  This  is  a  guiding  but  not  overriding  principle 
because  it  is  subject  to  a  number  of  other  objectives  and 
operational  constraints  as  I  explain  below.  However,  it  is 
important  to  appreciate  at  the  outset  that  one  of  the  [LFB’s] 
guiding principles since 2004 has been to organise ourselves in 
such a way that one person receives broadly the same response 
as another, regardless of where they are located in London.”  

82. 

He expands on it in the following paragraphs: 

The  overriding  aim  of  the  [LFB]  in  responding  to 
“64. 
emergencies is to arrive at the scene of the incident as soon as 
possible. Arriving quickly at an incident is an important factor 
which affects the [LFB’s] ability to protect the public from fire, 
however there are complex and difficult judgment calls to make 
as to how to balance a desire for a fast response with the fact 
that  in  some  areas  the  demand  for  emergency  responses  is 
lower.  

65. 
For  example,  if  Camden  has  better  attendance  times 
than  Harrow,  but  Camden  has  more  incidents,  how  should 
resources be allocated where it is necessary to make changes to 
the overall service in line with a budget reduction? In allocating 
resources  should  greater  weight  be  accorded  to  improving 
attendance  times  in  Camden,  reflecting  the  higher  incident 
numbers there, or, should greater weight be accorded to making 
improvements in Harrow where attendance times are poorer?  

66. 
There  are  a  number  of  different  approaches  which  a 
fire and rescue authority could adopt in relation to protection of 
the  public  and  which 
in  allocating 
resources.  

influence  decisions
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

67. 
One  possible  approach  is  to  differentiate  between 
different  geographical  areas,  affording  priority  (and  therefore 
allocating more resources) to responding to incidents faster in a 
particular  area.  If  this  principle  was  adopted,  a  fire  service 
could take  into account any  number of  factors in determining 
its  “priority  areas”,  for  example,  a  service  could  decide  to 
prioritise  attendance  times  in  areas  which  have  the  most 
significant public  buildings, or the  most valuable property, or 
the  highest  population  density,  or  the  highest  numbers  of 
people  with  particular  characteristics,  or  any  combination  of 
these factors. This may well involve difficult judgement calls as 
to which categories of people or premises should benefit from 
faster attendance times and thus be prioritised over others. Such 
an approach, in particular the prioritisation of particular groups 
of people, may practically be very difficult to organise because 
any identified “priority” areas would be likely to be dispersed 
around London.  

Another option, and the one that has been adopted by 
68. 
the  [LFB]  since  2004,  is  the  principle  of  seeking  to  achieve 
similar attendance times across the whole of the  area covered 
by  the  service,  without  prioritising  attendance  times 
in 
particular areas. … this is referred to as the concept of “equal 
entitlement”.  Equal entitlement means that one of the [LFB’s] 
aims  is  to  deliver  the  fastest  attendance  times  to  the  widest 
possible coverage of London’s population, or, put another way, 
one of our guiding principles is to respond to every incident in 
the  best  time  possible  wherever  the  incident  occurs  within 
London.   

69. 
In practice, the guiding principle of equal  entitlement 
means that people in similar situations living in different parts 
of London can expect reasonably similar attendance times. For 
example,  an  elderly  disabled  person  living  in  a  high-rise 
building in Camden can expect a similar attendance time to an 
elderly  disabled  person  living  in  a  high-rise  building  in 
Croydon. In my opinion, both individuals are entitled to expect 
similar attendance times from a [LFB] that serves the whole of 
London, in so far as reasonably practicable.”  

83. 

He goes on to explain his opinion as follows: 

“In my opinion a person in Barking & Dagenham (for example) 
should not have to wait longer for an appliance than a person in 
Islington (for example) in the event of a fire, just because the 
former happens to live in an area with (for example) less high-
rise  buildings,  less  high  profile  buildings,  or  less  vulnerable 
people than the latter (and vice versa). Further, in my opinion, a 
person  in  London  should  not  be  treated  as  being  a  lower 
priority for the [LFB] in the event that a fire does occur, simply 
because  they  live  within  an  area  in  which  the  number  of
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

incidents  is  statistically  lower.  This  is  an  opinion  that  was 
shared  by  my  predecessor  as  Commissioner  when  LSP2  was 
introduced. As a result, the critical point that drives the [LFB’s] 
guiding principle is the desire to minimise attendance times to a 
fire wherever  it occurs  in  London, subject to other objectives 
and operational constraints.” 

84. 

As I have indicated (see paragraph 81 above), the principle of equal entitlement first 
found expression in the approach to London’s fire services in LSP2. Although it was 
not his personal responsibility at the time, the Commissioner has drawn attention to a 
Corporate  Management  Board  paper  of  8  June  2004  prepared  for  the  purposes  of 
LSP2 which was couched in the following terms: 

“There  is  a  powerful  argument  that  at  the  point  when  a  fire 
actually  breaks  out  (notwithstanding  those  control  measures 
that  have  been  put  in  place)  the  risk  is  broadly  the  same 
whatever  its  location.  In  other  words  a  fire  in  a  bedroom  in 
Westminster has the same potential consequence as a fire in a 
bedroom in Sutton or Bromley. In risk terms it is also difficult 
to argue that, just because one person  is  less  likely to have a 
fire that it follows they should receive a slower response if they 
do  have  one.  If  this  logic  is  accepted  it  moves  us  towards 
developing a single set of attendance standards across London.” 

85. 

He indicates that consultees on the draft LSP2 were largely supportive of the principle 
of  developing  more  even  patterns  of  emergency  cover  across  London  with  74% 
strongly  or  largely  agreeing  with  the  proposal  to  provide  a  more  even  response  to 
emergency incidents wherever they occurred in London.  That indeed was so although 
it  is right to observe that 20% “largely or strongly disagreed”, with 6%  not having 
enough  information  or  had  no  preference.    History  also  shows  that  none  of  the 
Claimant boroughs objected to the proposal and indeed Islington and Tower Hamlets 
(the  only  two  of  the  Claimant  boroughs  to  respond  to  the  consultation)  expressed 
positive approval. 

86. 

The  Commissioner  also  records  that  the  FBU  has  historically  not  opposed  the 
principle  of  trying  to  equalise  attendance  times  across  London.  Indeed  in  its  first 
response to the consultation on LSP5 in June 2013 it said this: 

“We applaud the current Commissioner Ron Dobson for trying 
to  equalise  attendance  times  across  London.  But  we  do  not 
accept reducing station numbers in inner London arrears is an 
acceptable  method.  We  believe that  if there  is a requirement 
for equalisation, the same level of response currently received 
by  Londoners  in  inner-city  areas  should  also  be  delivered  to 
those outer London areas as well.  Where we differ is that it is 
our belief the only  way this can  be achieved  is  by  increasing 
resources in the areas that are not meeting the attendance times.  
For  instance,  the  Commissioner  recognised  this  problem  in 
LSP4, by the opening of a new fire station at Harold Hill on the 
outskirts of east London.  Why?  Because the [LFB] could not 
meet a suitable attendance time in a high area of life risk.  This

therefore proves that in areas where standards in outer London 
cannot  be  reached,  the  [LFB]  should  either  increase  staff 
numbers or build new fire stations as a blueprint to ensure the 
equality of service across London.” (Emphasis added.) 

87. 

In  its  final  observations  on  the  draft  Plan  dated  14  July  the  FBU  stated,  in  almost 
identical terms, as follows:  

“We  understand  the  need  to  equalise  attendance  times  across 
London.    But  we  do  not  accept  reducing  station  numbers  in 
inner London arrears is an acceptable method.  We believe that 
if  there  is  a  requirement  for  equalisation,  the  same  level  of 
response  currently  received  by  Londoners  in  inner-city  areas 
should also  be delivered to those outer London areas as well.  
Where we differ is that it is our belief the only way this can be 
achieved  is  by  increasing  resources  in  the  areas  that  are  not 
meeting the attendance times.  For instance, the Commissioner 
recognised this problem in LSP4, by the opening of a new fire 
station at Harold Hill on the outskirts of east London.  Why?  
Because the [LFB] could not meet a suitable attendance time in 
a  high  area  of  life  risk.    This  therefore  proves  that  in  areas 
where standards in outer London cannot be reached, the [LFB] 
should either increase staff numbers or build new fire stations 
as a blueprint to ensure the equality of service across London.” 
(Emphasis added.) 

In other words, the FBU continues to support the principle,  but  is of the  view that 
resources  (manpower  and  fire  stations)  should  be  made  available  to  enable  the 
principle  to  operate  satisfactorily  in  all  parts  of  London.    The  Claimant  boroughs 
would  appear  to  challenge  the  continued  applicability  of  the  principle  in  Greater 
London although it needs to be noted that no submissions, either in favour or against, 
have been made by the other 26 boroughs that have been made interested parties to 
the proceedings. 

I will return to consider the arguments concerning the applicability of this principle in 
the context of the Plan when analysing the challenges made to it. 

There is, however, one further practical aspect of the principle that needs to be noted 
at  this  stage,  namely,  the  level  of  response  time  that  was  adopted  as  the  objective 
across London during the post-2004 period. 

LSP2  had  apparently  proposed  that  the  then  existing  attendance  times  would  be 
maintained,  but  set  the  target  of  achieving  them  on  a  London-wide  basis.    Those 
response  times  were  attendance  of  the  first  appliance  within  5  minutes  65%  of  the 
time and within 8 minutes 90% of the time and attendance of the second appliance 
within 8 minutes 75% of the time and within 10 minutes 90% of the time.   

Since LSP3 three attendance standards have been adopted by the LFB: (i) to get the 
first appliance to an incident within an average attendance time of 6 minutes; (ii) to 
get  the  second  appliance  to  an  incident  within  an  average  attendance  time  of  8 
minutes; and (iii) to get an appliance to an  incident anywhere  in London within 12

minutes  on  95%  of  occasions.    The  manner  in  which  these  attendance  times  were 
taken into account in the modelling process for the draft Plan, to which I will refer in 
more  detail  later  (see  paragraphs  165-195),  lies  at  the  heart  of  one  feature  of  the 
Claimants’ case (see paragraphs 197-204). 

Given  another  criticism  made  by  the  Claimants,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the 
attendance times are calculated by reference to a period starting at the time when the 
crew is mobilised at the fire station and ending at the time when the appliance arrives 
at the incident.  The period does not commence when the 999-call is received.  I will 
return to this matter in due course (see paragraphs 140-146). 

I  will  have  to  return  to  the  issues  arising  from  the  continued  adoption  of  these 
attendance  standards  for  the  purposes  of  the  Plan,  but  it  is,  perhaps,  appropriate to 
record at this stage that the attendance standards are seen by the Commissioner (and, 
by  virtue  of  the  acceptance  of  his  view,  by  the  LFB  and  LFEPA)  as  performance 
indicators, not as measures for assessing risk.  The Commissioner makes the point in 
his witness statement that “it would be incorrect to assume … that an attendance time 
of 5:59 will prevent adverse outcomes from fire whereas an attendance time of 6:01 
(or even 7:01 or 8:01) will not.”  The Claimants have a different view of the matter to 
which I will turn later. 

The detailed challenges 

(i) 

the fundamental challenge 

 

(a) 

the “high level” challenge 

95. 

The  most  fundamental  challenge  made  to  the  Commissioner’s  report  and,  in 
consequence, to the Mayor’s decision is put in a number of ways and various factors 
are  embraced  within  it.    However,  in  short,  it  is  that  the  formulation  of  the  Plan 
commenced from the wrong starting-point.  It is said that the National Framework and 
the extant Guidance (on the assumption that it was extant and relevant) demanded that 
LFEPA should prepare an IRMP having identified and assessed “all foreseeable fire 
and  rescue  related  risks  that  could  affect  its  community”  and  which  also  then 
demonstrated how “prevention, protection and response activity will best be used to 
mitigate  the  impact  of  risk”.    In  other  words,  it  is  said  that  a  comprehensive  risk 
assessment of “all foreseeable risks” must be carried out before considering how those 
risks are to be addressed.  If that had been done, it is argued, in respect of the seven 
Claimant  boroughs,  certain  vulnerable  sections  of  the  community  would  have  been 
identified as being at higher risk than others elsewhere in London and more extensive 
and  intensive  provision  would  or  should  have  been  provided  in  relation  to  those 
“higher risk” sections of the community such that the response (or attendance) time to 
deal with a fire would be shortened.  By adopting an approach to the Plan predicated 
upon  seeking  to  achieve  uniform  attendance  time  targets,  it  is  argued  that  the 
Commissioner’s approach was “back to front”.   The Claimants submit that the proper 
approach is look at the risk first and then decide what the appropriate attendance times 
should be rather than adopting the attendance times as parameters before looking at 
the risk.   

96. 

It is argued that the adoption of the principle of equal entitlement results in a “one size 
fits all” approach which is not what the National Framework and the Guidance Notes

98. 

contemplate and is, in any event, irrational:  a plan that does not take account of local 
risk factors cannot, it is contended, be one in which increasingly scarce resources can 
be said to be deployed rationally and proportionately. 

I will turn to what might be termed the “high level” features of this argument in due 
course, but it is necessary, in the first instance, to set out why the Claimant boroughs 
say  that  their  residents  (or  at  least  sections  of  their  communities)  are  particularly 
adversely affected by the Plan.  The principal, though  not exclusive,  focus of each 
borough  is  upon  the  number  of  high-rise  dwellings  in  their  area  and  upon  the 
proportionately  greater  number  of  elderly  people  than  elsewhere  in  London.  
Compared  with  the  Outer  London  boroughs,  it  is  said  that  they  have  far  higher 
population  densities,  far  higher  levels  of  social  deprivation,  more  social  housing 
(much of it of a high-rise nature), more high profile buildings and concentrations of 
high-risk groups with certain “protected characteristics” (see the Equality Act 2010 at 
paragraphs 41-42 above) such  as the disabled,  young people  living alone and older 
people living in social housing. 

The  Claimants  acknowledge  that  the  principle  of  equal  entitlement  might  be 
justifiable if Greater London were a broadly homogenous city, with little variation in 
terms of population and risk factors across its neighbourhoods, but assert that that is 
not so.  Drawing on the  Commissioner’s Report, the draft Plan and the Supporting 
Documents, they highlight the facts that (i) London includes city, suburban and semi-
rural areas, (ii) population density varies from 82,000 people per square kilometre in 
parts of Inner London to 100 people per square kilometre in parts of Outer London, 
(iii)  approximately  50%  of  London’s  population  is  concentrated  in  just  20%  of  its 
total area and (iv) nearly 40% of Greater London is classified as green open space. 

99.  Within  that  unevenly  spread  population  there  are  groups  with  particular  lifestyle 
characteristics who are assessed to be at greater risk than others and to whom LFEPA 
have  ascribed  “priority  postcodes”  (sometimes  referred  to  as  “P1s”).    The  lifestyle 
characteristics  include  those  fitting  the  description  of  young  people  renting  flats  in 
high-density  social  housing,  elderly  people  reliant  on  state  support,  lower  income 
workers  in  open  terraces  in  often  diverse  areas  and  young,  well-educated  city 
dwellers.  The Claimants rely upon the fact that the majority of these postcodes are in 
Inner  London  and  that  in  the  Inner  London  boroughs  priority  postcodes  make  up 
around 56% of homes and account for 63% of dwelling fires and 71% of casualties 
whereas  in Outer London boroughs, priority postcodes  make up only 2% of  homes 
and account for only 5% of dwelling fires and 5% of casualties.  The source of those 
statistics  is  Supporting  Document  5  to  the  Plan  and  the  Claimants,  accordingly, 
contend that the Commissioner’s own documents show the highly variable risk profile 
across London, with high risk factors being heavily concentrated in the Inner London 
boroughs.    I  will  be  returning  to  the  question  of  priority  postcodes  and  the 
Commissioner’s response to the kind of argument being advanced in due course (see 
paragraphs 184-185), but will continue for present purposes to outline the Claimants’ 
case. 

100.  The broad pattern to which reference is made in the preceding paragraph is, it is said, 
borne out by an analysis of the risk areas in each of the individual Claimant boroughs.  
I will deal briefly with the demography of each as it has been presented, but it may be 
helpful to record initially what the effect of the Plan will (according to the Plan) be

upon attendances times both for 1st and 2nd appliances and then for 3rd appliances, 
both matters of importance to the cases presented on behalf of each borough. 

101.  Supporting  Document  16  indicates  as  follows  in  general  terms  about  the  151/100 

option being proposed in the draft Plan: 

“10.  

In absolute terms for 1st appliance attendance times:

I do not understand there to be any issue about what is asserted.  (It should be noted 
that  with  the  ultimate  acceptance  of  the  155/102  option,  the  above  times  varied 
somewhat.  A  table  showing  the  effects  is  included  in  the  Commissioner’s  witness 
statement and is reproduced in Appendix 3.) 

Islington
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

104.  According to the witness statement of Lela  Kogbara, the Assistant Chief Executive 
(Strategy  and  Community  Partnerships),  Islington  is  the  most  densely  populated 
borough in the UK (13,862 people per square kilometre) and has “a rising population 
and  a  high  concentration  of  buildings  requiring  multiple  response  times,  and  many 
high-profile sites.”   The population has grown by 17% between 2001 and 2011 with 
growth being greatest among young, single people.  She says that it is “the 14th most 
deprived borough in the country, has the second highest rate of child poverty, and the 
4th highest rate of older people living in poverty.”  Of the 206,000 resident population 
she says that “more than 8,000 are over 75 years old, 60% of residents are single, 39% 
of  households  are  single-person,  34%  are  deprived  in  at  least  one  [of  the  four 
dimensions  of  deprivation  used  to  classify  households,  namely,  employment, 
education, health/disability and housing] 8% in at least 3 dimensions and 46% of the 
borough live in high density social housing.”  She says that the “20 to 39 year old age 
group accounts for the largest proportion across all wards, ranging between 38% and 
50%.”    

105. 

Islington is in the top five London Boroughs (behind Southwark and Lambeth) for the 
largest amount of social rented housing units from the local authority.  

106.  Ms  Kogbara also says this in her witness statement:  

“The  revised  Plan  …  continued  to  include  the  closure  of 
Clerkenwell Fire Station in the south of Islington.  This is one 
of the  five  busiest  fire stations  in  London and  covers an area 
with a  very  high  incidence of  high rise  buildings, including a 
substantial  amount  of  student  accommodation  and 
two 
residential blocks of 25 and 27 stories respectively.  Fire crews 
from Clerkenwell could also be expected to assist at incidents 
in very high profile sites such as the Emirates Stadium, Kings 
Cross/St  Pancras  Station,  the  Royal  Courts  of  Justice,  the 
British Museum and numerous other important and high-profile 
sites.”  

107.  So far as appliance attendance times are concerned at ward level, Ms Kogbara says as 

follows of the 16 wards in Islington: 

“First appliance response times would increase by 2:07 minutes 
(49%) in Clerkenwell ward to 6:26.  In Barnsbury ward, second 
appliance  response  times  would  increase  by  2:21  to  8:27 
(38.5%)  and  in  St  Peter’s  ward  by  1:57  to  7:48  (33.3%)  …. 
Three  of  sixteen  wards  would  have  first  appliance  response 
times above 6 minutes (Caledonian – 6:17, Clerkenwell – 6:26 
and Mildmay – 6:41) and one ward would have a 2nd appliance 
response time above 8 minutes (Barnsbury – 8:27).” 

Southwark 

108.  Mr Jonathan Toy, the Head of Community Safety and Enforcement, says in his first 
witness statement that Southwark has an above-average number of fires, deaths and 
injuries compared with any London borough.  He says that in contrast to the national 
trend,  the  number  of  fire-related  fatalities  in  Southwark  has  risen  over  the  last  10
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

years even allowing for the Lakanal tragedy in July 2009 when 9 people died.  The 
numbers of fires, injuries, rescues and mobilisations in Southwark are all above the 
London average.  Southwark has a population density of 9988 residents per square 
kilometre and is the largest social landlord in London.  75% of the council housing 
stock  consists  of  high  rise  flats  or  maisonettes  (i.e.  four  floors  or  over)  and  he 
estimates that “at least 37% of dwelling fires in Southwark over the past 5 years were 
in high-rise buildings which required 3 appliances to arrive before the fire could be 
tackled.”  He also says (and I do not understand it to be disputed) that by reference to 
the ‘P1’ postcode assignment, Southwark houses “a far greater density of people at 
high  risk  from  fire  than  outer  London  boroughs.”    He  also  foresees  a  significant 
increase in the number of elderly and disabled residents, and those with mental health 
problems, which is projected in the years to 2020. 

In Southwark there are 21 wards.  It is asserted in the Statement of Facts and Grounds 
that the impact upon attendance times is such that first and second response times will 
increase in all 21 wards, with six missing the target for first response time.  If I read 
the detailed information correctly, 17 wards see an increase of less than 30 seconds 
for 1st appliances (but that does include College ward that already has a 1st appliance 
response time of just over 7 minutes), but there are 4 wards where the increases are 
essentially 1-1½ minutes.  The 2nd appliance response times all appear to increase, in 
one or two cases by 1½-2 minutes and in most other cases by 30-60 seconds. 

Camden 

In her witness statement, Ms Sarah Moyies, Head of Emergency Management, says 
that Camden has experienced a higher number of fire-related fatalities since 2002/3 
until 2011/12 than the average for London.  (This is indeed correct, though it is to be 
observed that in the period from 2004/5 the number, 14, was closer to the average, 12, 
than for the longer period.)  She also indicates that the number of fire-related injuries 
from 2004/5 were higher (376) than the London average (352).  Camden had the third 
highest number of pump mobilisations in London in 2011/12 (totalling 9868) and the 
second highest of mobilisations into the borough for the same year (totalling 3169).  It 
has the largest student population in London (24,300), 31% of whom live in flats or 
halls of residence.  

109. 

110. 

111.  Ms  Moyies  also  draws  attention  to  the  level  of  social  deprivation  in  Camden  by 
reference  to  the  proposition  that  58  out  of  133  Lower  Layer  Super  Output  Areas 
(small  geographical  areas  used  by  the  Office  for  National  Statistics  to  improve  the 
reporting  of  small  area  statistics  usually  called  ‘LSOAs’)  are  in  the  30%  most 
deprived areas in the country. 

112.  She  also  draws  attention  to  the  fact  that,  as  a  local  authority,  it  owns  over  238 
buildings  that  are  6  storeys  or  higher  and  that  their  4  tallest  high-rise  residential 
buildings are three at 23 storeys and one at 25 storeys.  Incidents in such buildings 
demand, she says, the attendance of a minimum  of 3 appliances (but see paragraph 
260 below).  

113.  Ms  Moyies  helpfully  tabled  the  effects  on  attendance  times  at  a  ward  level  in  her 

witness statement and I reproduce those tables at Appendix 4 to this judgment. 

Tower Hamlets
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

114.  Mr  Stephen  Halsey,  the  Head  of  Paid  Service  and  Corporate  Director  of 
Communities, Localities and Culture, says that Tower Hamlets has the third highest 
number of dwelling fires in London – based upon the 3-year average from 2009/10 to 
2011/12.   The number of primary fires has reduced more slowly in Tower Hamlets 
than  across  London  as  a  whole  over  the  previous  six  years  (by  4.6%  compared  to 
9.3% London-wide).  79% of all households in the borough are within purpose-built 
blocks of flats or tenements, the second-highest proportion nationally after the City of 
London.  It is estimated that at least 50% of these blocks are of six storeys or more 
and thus require attendance by a third appliance (see paragraph 260 below).  14% of 
primary  fires  in  Tower  Hamlets  occur  in  high-rise  buildings.    Approximately  one-
third of residents of Tower Hamlets do not have English as their main language and   
nearly one-third of residents are in the 18-30 age group.   

115.  There are 17 wards in Tower Hamlets.  Mr Halsey highlights four in his statement that 
will  experience  significant  changes  in  appliance  attendance  time.    Helpfully,  he 
highlighted them in a table which I reproduce as Appendix 5 to this judgment. 

Hackney 

116.  Ms Sonia  Khan, Head of Policy, says  in  her witness  statement that Hackney  is the 
second-most deprived local authority in the country and all of its wards are in the 10% 
most deprived nationally.   

117.  She also gives details of the profile of Hackney’s population as follows: 

“… 

  There  are  67,925  young  (18-30)  people  in  Hackney, 

28% of the population. 

  There  are  157,240  non  White-British  people 

in 
Hackney, 63% of the population. According to the 2011 
census,  14%  of  local  households  in  Hackney  reported 
that English  was  not  a  main  language.  Hackney  has  a 
low  proportion  of  English 
language  households 
compared  with  the  national  average  (91%)  but  sits  in 
line with the London average (74%). The proportion of 
English speakers is significantly lower than the national 
figure  of  92%  and  two  points  lower  than  London’s 
figure which stands at 77.9%, and can  be attributed to 
Hackney’s diverse migrant population.  

  There are 22,526 full time students in Hackney aged 16-
74, 9% of the population. In the 2011 Census, 14.6% of 
Hackney respondents said they a long-term illness that 
limited their daily activities. In February 2012, 15,240 
people,  6.1%  of  Hackney’s  population,  were  claiming 
Disability Living Allowance or Attendance Allowance.” 

118.  The rates of fire casualties and mobilisations in Hackney are higher than the London 
averages, but the rate of fatalities, certainly since 2006/7, appears to be slightly less
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

than the London average.  It is the fourth borough in the top five London Boroughs 
for the largest amount of social rented housing units from the local authority.  

119. 

In  her  witness  statement,  Elizabeth  Hughes,  Head  of  Safer  Communities,  says  that 
there are 263 high rise blocks within the borough (namely, those with 6 storeys and 
over). 

120.  Hackney has 19 wards.  Ms Khan highlights Dalston where the 1st appliance response 
time will be 25.85% slower than the London average and De Beauvoir where the 1st 
appliance response time will be 37.24% slower than the London average and the 2nd 
appliance response time will be 30% slower than the London average.  A glance at the 
table shows that there are two other wards where there are measurable increases in 1st 
appliance time attendances, but otherwise the increases are generally measured in a 
few  seconds.  A  glance  at  the  table  for  2nd  appliance  times  also  demonstrates  that 
Dalston  and  De  Beauvoir  both  experience  fairly  significant  increases,  as  does  to  a 
lesser  degree  Queensbridge,  but  in  most  others  the  increase  is  also  measured  in 
seconds.  

Lewisham 

121.  The witness statement of Geeta Subramaniam-Mooney, Head of Crime Reduction and 
Supporting  People,  indicates  that  in  Lewisham  there  are  43,221  residents  (over the 
age  of  3  years)  for  whom  English  is  a  second  language.    This  is  16%  of  the  total 
population.   

122.  There  are  1061  ‘P1’  postcodes  in  Lewisham.    Its  fire  fatalities  are  higher  than  the 
London  average  and  its  number  of  fire-related  injuries  is  also  greater  the  London 
average. 

123.  Within  the  borough  there  are  177  high  rise  buildings  which  are  classified  as  five 

storeys or above. 

124.  Lewisham  has  18  wards.    Ms  Subramaniam-Mooney  says  that  6  wards  will  fall 
outside  of  the  average  6-minute  first  appliance  response  time:  Bellingham  (6:55), 
Catford  South  (6:13),  Downham  (7:38),  Grove  Park  (6:27),  Sydenham  (6:21)  and 
Whitefoot (7:57).  She says also that a further two of these wards will fall outside the 
8-minute response time: Downham (8:18) and Whitefoot (8:02).  

Greenwich   

125.  Matthew  Norwell,  Director  of  Community  Safety  and  Environment,  speaks  of  two 
wards  (out  of  seventeen  wards)  within  the  borough  (Woolwich  Common  and 
Woolwich Riverside) which have a particularly high concentration of people whose 
main  language  is  not  English  and  who  cannot  speak  English  either  well  or  at  all. 
There are particularly high concentrations of young people in those wards also.  For 
the three performance years 2009/10 to 2011/12 those two wards were amongst five 
in the borough where three appliances were most called. 

126.  He speaks also of three prisons (HMP Belmarsh, HMP Thameside and HMP & YOI 
Isis)  and  the  associated  high-security  Crown  Court  at  Belmarsh,  together  with  the 
other  tourist  attractions  such  as  the  Greenwich  World  Heritage  Site,  the  Maritime

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

Museum, the Greenwich Observatory, Queen Anne’s House and the Cutty Sark, all of 
which are within the borough. 

127.  Although Mr Norwell’s  statement does not indicate the present prevalence of  high-
rise buildings within the borough, he does suggest that the Plan fails to take account 
of several proposed high rise buildings, all of which have planning permission, in the 
Woolwich Common and Woolwich Riverside wards.  These include 16 storeys (100 
units)  at  Mast  Pond  Wharf  (Woolwich  Riverside),  11  storeys  (177  units)  at  Callis 
Yard  (Woolwich  Riverside),  The  Warren  Masterplan  (including  Crossrail  station) 
(Woolwich  Riverside)  comprising  mostly  6/7  storeys  high,  although  several  blocks 
will  include  towers  of  16-25  storeys  (3,711  units)  and  Love  Lane  (Woolwich 
Common) comprising up to 27 storeys (960 units).  

128.  Greenwich has 17 wards.  Mr Norwell says that under the Plan, 8 will not meet the 
target  first  response  time  and  the  first  response  time  for  3  wards  will  be  over  7 
minutes.    4  wards  will  not  meet  the  target  second  response  time.    He  highlights 
Woolwich Common which currently has a first response time of 5 minutes 32 seconds 
(5.32).  Under the Plan this would increase by 58 seconds to 6:30 minutes.   He also 
refers specifically to Woolwich Riverside which has a current first response time of 
4:57 minutes which would increase to 7:21 minutes, Shooters Hill from 6:35 minutes 
to  7:00  minutes  and  Thamesmead  Moorings  from  7:07  to  7:13.    Those  latter  two 
wards are mentioned in the context of 2nd appliance response times with the former 
increasing from 7:54 minutes to 8:22 minutes and the latter from 7:51 to 8:15.         

129.  That, in a nutshell, represents the broad profile of each of the Claimant boroughs from 

the perspectives said to be relevant for present purposes. 

130.  Attached to the Claimants’ Skeleton Argument were some tables extracted from the 
borough statistics to be  found on the  LFB website which  show fatalities, casualties 
and pump mobilisations in all the London boroughs over a 10-year period or so.  Mr 
Stilitz  submits  that  they  demonstrate  generally  consistently  higher  levels  of  pump 
mobilisations, fire fatalities and fire casualties in the Claimant boroughs compared to 
the  London  average.    I  cannot  reproduce  those  tables  in  this  judgment,  but  his 
comment  is  broadly  justified  although,  as  with  all  figures  of  this  nature,  there  is 
considerable variation from year to year.  It is equally to be observed that there are 
other non-Claimant London boroughs where the annual levels in the respects he has 
highlighted are usually higher than the overall London average.  Inevitably, of course, 
there are boroughs where the levels are ordinarily lower than that average.  There is, 
of course, the countervailing suggestion that it is the more recently identifiable trends 
in what is occurring that is the important consideration, not what an average over a 
lengthy period reveals. 

131. 

In order to illustrate the nature of this evidence, I have appended as Appendix 6 and 
Appendix 7 to this judgment the raw material from the same source as that used by 
the  Claimants  for the  purposes  of  the  tables  referred to  in  the  preceding  paragraph 
demonstrating the numbers of dwelling fires and fire fatalities respectively for each 
London borough for the period from 2006/07 to 2012/13.  Had it been possible to do 
so, I would have attached the equivalent table for fire-related injuries. 

132.  Casting  an  eye  down  Appendix  6  would  show  that  all  the  Claimant  boroughs 
generally  do  see  more  dwelling  fires  per  year  than  the  average,  although  Islington
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

usually appears to be relatively not far above the average when it is above average, 
although Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham and Hackney do always seem to be 
well  above  average.    It  does,  however,  have  to  be  observed  that  there  are  a  good 
number of other boroughs that are not Claimants in these proceedings which regularly 
experience dwelling fires significantly, or at least materially, in excess of the annual 
London average. 

133.  Performing the same exercise in relation to the fatalities does, fortunately, record that 
the average annual fatality rate for all of London never exceeds 2 per borough and the 
average figure is usually 1 or 2 per borough.  There will obviously be the occasional 
tragedy such as Lakanal that will put a particularly high figure into the statistics for 
one  year  (as  that  particular  tragedy  did  for  Southwark  in  2009/10),  but  the  picture 
does  broadly  reveal  that,  for  example,  Southwark  is  usually  (though  not  always) 
above average, as from time to time is Tower Hamlets, but there is a variation across 
all the Claimant boroughs as indeed there is across many of the other non-Claimant 
boroughs. 

134.  One trend that even a layman can discern from these figures appears to be a general 
reduction in the number of dwelling fires in London over the 6-7 year period which is 
reflected  in  the  reduction  of  the  average  figure  from  215  in  2006/07  to  196  in 
2012/13. I will have to return later to what the Commissioner says about the calls on 
the fire service (see paragraph 135), but the observation I have just made does chime 
with what he said in his witness statement that “[there] is a strong decreasing trend in 
relation to all types of incidents which demand a response from the [LFB] in London, 
including the number of dwelling fires.” 

135. 

In  order  to  put the  figures  relating  to  dwelling  fires  (which,  of  course,  represent  a 
significant  risk  to  life  and  limb)  into  context,  the  Commissioner  in  his  witness 
statement draws attention to the comparative infrequency of dwelling fires as a source 
of  “incident  type”  requiring  the  active  intervention  of  the  fire  service.    Supporting 
Document  2  demonstrates  that  the  10  most  common  incident  types  in  London,  in 
descending order of frequency, are false alarms from automatic fire alarms (‘AFAs’), 
outdoor  fires,  false  alarms  from  members  of  the  public  (made  with  good  intent), 
releasing people from passenger lifts, gaining entry to people locked in or locked out, 
flooding, dwelling fires, road traffic accidents, other building fires and road vehicle 
fires.    The  figures  for  2009/10  to  2011/12  show  that  of  these  10  most  frequently 
attended incidents (accounting for about 90% of the incidents attended in those three 
periods) dwelling fires accounted for only 6% whereas, for example, AFAs accounted 
for 35%, outdoor fires 12% and good-intentioned false alarms from members of the 
public 11%.  It will be appreciated that the fire service will send differing numbers of 
appliances  to  an  incident  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  incident  and  the  type  of 
premises. Each type of  incident has what  is  called the “pre-determined attendance” 
(“PDA”) which is the initial response to a 999-call.   The PDA for a dwelling fire is 
always two appliances. It can be higher for more complex situations. 

136.  Having  thus  identified  the  nature  of  the  Claimant  boroughs  and  the  relevant 
demography of each in the way it has been highlighted by Mr Stilitz, I should return 
to the  main argument he advances about the way the Commissioner  formulated the 
Plan.  He contends that applying uniformly the target times referred to in paragraph 
92 above pursuant to the “principle of equal entitlement”, irrespective of the particular
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

features of the particular borough, necessarily involved an analysis that did not take 
into account the local risk factors peculiarly associated with each borough. 

137.  That is, as I have sought to characterise it, the “high level” argument he advances.  It 
pervades  the  more  detailed  criticisms  he  seeks  to  make  of  the  decision-making 
process in which, he asserts, material matters were left out of account.  Leaving those 
matters  out of  account  resulted,  he  argues,  in  a  flawed  reasoning  process  that  also 
(and,  as  I  understood  the  argument,  independently  of  the  “high  level”  argument) 
would justify the court’s interference with the ultimate decision reached. 

138. 

I  will  endeavour  to  address  these  contentions  in  the  way  that  they  have  been 
advanced.  However, it seems to me to be somewhat unreal to take the “high level” 
argument at this stage and to endeavour to deal with it before at least examining the 
way in which the other criticisms are advanced.  Those criticisms, if justified, are said 
to  underline  and  confirm  the  failure  of  the  Commissioner  to  address  the  particular 
factors within each borough (of the nature identified above) that demand a different 
response to the provision of fire services in those boroughs from the provision to be 
provided elsewhere.  Dealing with the issues in this way will enable the rather bigger 
picture to be viewed than it would be if each individual component of the Claimants’ 
case was isolated and considered separately.  

(b)  other criticisms of the decision-making process (other than arguments concerning 
the consultation process) 

139. 

In addition to the general contention that the principle of equal entitlement should not 
have been applied, there are four specific matters that the Claimants argue were left 
out of account in the formulation of the Plan that could, if taken into account, have 
made a material difference.  Mr Stilitz identified them as follows: 

 
 

 

 

“Drive time” should not have been equated with “response time” -  

(i) 
in other words, the full time from the 999-call to active fire-fighting  
should have been considered; 

(ii) 

third appliance attendance times should have been taken into account, but 
were not; 

(iii) 

the  effect  on  risk  of  “ring-fencing”  and  protecting  from  closure  28  fire 
stations was left out of account; 

(iv) 

the effect of the temporary closures of fire stations in Southwark was left 
out of account. 

Drive time/response time 

140.  As  I  have  already  indicated  (see  paragraph  93  above),  the  attendance  time  (or 
response time) targets utilised in considering the Plan were constituted by the period 
from when the crew is mobilised at the fire station to the time when the appliance first 
arrives at the incident.  The period does not commence when the 999-call is received 
nor does it end when active fire-fighting begins: it starts later and ends earlier than 
either of those events.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

141.  For  that  reason  Mr  Stilitz  characterises  the  period  used  for  this  purpose  as  “drive 
time” and says that the impression given by its adoption is that appliances will arrive 
much more quickly than they will in practice.  The suggestion is that there is more to 
the whole period of response time than simply the  “drive time”.  In the  first place, 
there is the duration of the 999-call.  He submits that the extent to which significant 
sections of the local populations may not speak English (a factor likely to be linked to 
race) is left out of account and that it should be considered when assessing the risks in 
a  community  where  significant  parts  of  the  population  may  not  speak  English  or 
where  English  is  their  second  language.    In  the  second  place,  there  is  the  issue  of 
high-rise buildings. 

142.  As to that second factor, he submits that in a high-rise or complex building, there is 
likely to be a delay before fire-fighters can physically get to the location of the fire 
itself and commence active fire-fighting.  Use of “drive time”, he contends, operates 
to understate the delay in commencing fire-fighting in the Claimant boroughs because 
each  has  a  far  higher  concentration  of  high-rise  and  more  large  and  complex 
buildings.    It  follows,  he  submits,  that  when  deciding  which  stations  to  close  and 
appliances  to  decommission,  the  Commissioner  has  under-estimated  the  risks 
occasioned by fires in the Claimant boroughs. 

143.  Mr Stilitz drew my attention to what appears in the ‘Fire Incidents Response Times: 
England, 2012-13’, published by the DCLG.  It says that “Response times are from 
the time of call to the arrival of the first pumping appliance.”  That would appear to 
take account of the time of the telephone call, but not the time needed to prepare for 
engaging in active fire-fighting.  Mr Antony White QC and Ms Sarah Hannett, for the 
FBU, who also referred to the DCLG publication, say that the measure of response 
time  used  by  the  Commissioner  (a)  masked  differences  in  call  time  that  can  vary 
substantially (for example, if a caller’s first language is not English) and (b) makes 
comparison  with  other  fire  and  rescue  services  more  difficult  (contrary  to  the 
requirement in the National Framework that “communities need to be able to access 
information in a way that enables them to compare the performance of their fire and 
rescue authority with others”). 

144.  Mr Halsey, whose witness statement was lodged in support of Tower Hamlets’ case, 

said this: 

“In  calculating  response  times  accurately,  this  should  include 
call  time  as  well  as  driving  times.    Call  times  can  be  longer 
when callers speak English as a second language.  This appears 
not to have been taken into account in assessing the impact of 
increases in probable response times.  Two of the wards where 
first appliance response times will exceed the target are those 
with  the  highest  proportions  of  Black  and  Minority  Ethnic 
(BME) residents and limited English fluency.” 

145.  Distilling these  various ways of putting the  matter, it would seem that the  material 
factor thus alleged to have  been overlooked by the Commissioner  in  his report and 
recommendations was the “true” response time for boroughs with significant high-rise 
buildings and significant populations for whom English is not their first language.
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

146. 

I will return to the Commissioner’s response to this aspect of the case when I have 
dealt with the other three points relied upon in this context by Mr Stilitz. 

Third appliance attendance times 

147. 

Irrespective of the argument concerning what response time ought to have been taken 
into account when  formulating the Plan,  it is contended that the failure to factor in 
appropriate  attendance  times  for  third  appliances  represented  another  material 
omission in the decision-making process. 

148.  Supporting Document 20 referred to the need for 3rd appliance attendance in certain 
situations  (see  paragraph  149  below),  but  it  has,  Mr  Stilitz  submits,  “inexplicably 
been completely left out of account when determining which stations should close and 
which appliances should be decommissioned.”  The model upon which the Plan was 
formulated was, he said, designed to demonstrate particular outcomes for 1st and 2nd 
appliance attendance times only and it could not, he submits, have indicated that a 3rd 
appliance  attendance  time  was  too  great  because  it  was  not  something  being 
considered.  He  contends  that  an  “important  feature  of  fire-fighting  in  London  has 
been left wholly disregarded” and an essential relevant matter thus left out of account.  
This was particularly so in relation to the Claimant boroughs because the attendance 
of  a  third  appliance  is  a  disproportionately  greater  feature  of  operations  than  in 
London  as  a  whole  because  of  the  higher  concentration  of  high-rise  buildings.  
According to Mr Toy’s statement, he says that whilst it has not been easy to analyse 
the  number  of  high-rise  dwelling  fires,  “we  estimate  that  at  least  37%  of  dwelling 
fires in Southwark over the past 5 years were in high-rise buildings which required 3 
appliances to arrive before the fire could be tackled: Southwark is second highest in 
absolute terms for high-rise fires and third highest in terms of the proportion of high-
rise  fires  to  total  fires.”    In  Tower  Hamlets,  according  to  Mr  Halsey,  35%  of  all 
primary  fires  in  buildings  required  a  three  appliance  response,  compared  with  the 
London average of 32% (excluding false alarms and other incidents). 

149.  As  a  result  of  concerns  raised  about  this  during  the  consultation  process,  the 
Commissioner produced a new supporting document (Supporting Document 24) on 
14 June, very shortly before the consultation period ended, entitled “Third fire engine 
attendance  time  performance”  which  set  out  third  appliance  attendance  times  at 
London and borough level.   That supporting document referred to what had appeared 
in  Supporting  Document  20  concerning  third  appliance  attendance.    Supporting 
Document 20 had said this: 

“A 3rd appliance  is often needed as the  initial response to an 
incident, to ensure safe systems of work (e.g. a call to a fire in a 
high-rise domestic building), so we have looked at the impact 
on  the  arrival  of  the  3rd  appliance.  The  modelled  impact  on 
average 3rd appliance response (+23 seconds London-wide) is 
greater  than  on  both  1st  appliance  (+15  seconds)  and  2nd 
appliance (+16 seconds) response times, as to be expected with 
18  fewer pumping appliances. However, the 151/100 position 
does  provide  more  equitable  level  of  3rd  appliance  coverage. 
London-wide,  the  percentage  of  incidents  that  receive  a  third 
appliance  with  10  minutes  falls  by  2  percentage  points  (from 
84.6 per cent to 84.4 per cent).”
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

150.  This  was  laid  out  more  fully  in  Supporting  Document  24  and  that  document  also 
contained  an  appendix  that  showed  how  the  third  appliance  response  times  would 
change across the boroughs.  All the Claimant boroughs would experience an increase 
in  attendance  time  as  follows:  Camden  (55  seconds),  Greenwich  (57  seconds), 
Hackney  (52  seconds),  Islington  (26  seconds),  Lewisham  (17  seconds),  Southwark 
(33  seconds)  and  Tower  Hamlets  (44  seconds).   These  must  be  viewed  against  the 
London-wide  average  increase  of  23  seconds.    Simply  for  comparison  purposes,  it 
might  be  noted  that  Hillingdon,  Lambeth,  Waltham  Forest  and  Westminster  would 
also  experience  increases  in  the  broad  range  of  50-55  seconds.    4  boroughs  were 
shown by the model to have some reductions in time (only two, Barnet and Harrow, 
being  reasonably  substantial  reductions),  but  overall  most  boroughs  either  stayed 
about the same or saw an increase of up to 30 seconds.  Mr White makes the point 
that those boroughs that will experience a decrease in third appliance response time as 
a result of the Plan are those which had few or no high rise fires in 2011/12 (see the 
document  referred  to  in  paragraph  153  below).    He  cites  Barnet  as  gaining  a  20% 
improvement in third appliance response times,  but having had only 2  fires at high 
rises  in  2011/12  and  Harrow  as  gaining  a  43%  improvement  in  third  appliance 
response times, but having had no high rise fires in 2011/12. 

151.  There  had  been  a  request  for the  figures  in  Supporting  Document  24 to  be  broken 

down further by reference to the wards.  Supporting Document 24 said this:  

“The  production  of  ward  level  data  for  a  third  fire  engine 
attending  an  incident  is  complicated  by  the,  sometimes,  very 
small numbers of historic incidents in some wards (over the last 
five years) where a third appliance would attend. At this point 
in time, we are not certain that it is possible to produce reliable 
data  at  ward  level,  because  of  the  problem  of  very  small 
numbers. However, we are continuing to examine this.” 

152. 

It  was  apparently  not  possible  to  provide  this  information  until  27  June  (after  the 
consultation had closed), but at that stage ‘Third appliance response times by Ward 
2011/12’  were  set  out  in  a  table  in  the  document  supplied.      These  were  historic 
figures  and  no  figures  for  the  post-Plan  position  at  ward  level  are  given  so  that  a 
comparison of the pre-Plan and post-Plan situation is not revealed. 

153.  That document did, however, contain  information reflecting the numbers of  fires  in 
high-rise buildings (domestic and  non-domestic). In 2011/12, taking all the  London 
boroughs, the  largest  number  of  fires  in  high  rise  buildings  occurred  in  Southwark 
(24),  Tower  Hamlets  (20),  Westminster  (19),  Wandsworth  (14),  Islington  (13), 
Newham and Lambeth (each 12), Enfield and Hammersmith & Fulham (11 each) and 
Greenwich (10).  All other boroughs were between 0 and 10.  

154.  Again, I will return to the Commissioner’s response to this part of the argument in due 

course (see paragraphs 259-263 below). 

The effect of “protecting” 28 fire stations 

155.  The  argument  advanced  is  that  the  Commissioner  wholly  disregarded  the  risk 
implications  arising  from  the  decision  to  exclude  from  the  prospect  of  closure  28 
“protected stations”.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

156.  The decision concerning these 28 fire stations was described in Supporting Document 

20 in the following way: 

“22. 
Officers also needed to take into account the range of 
issues associated with the current estate. As is known, it is not 
generally  flexible  stock  and  the  introduction  of  so  many  new 
special appliances has been (and some cases continues to be) a 
challenge. Some 40 per cent of the stations are  more than 60 
years  old;  34  per  cent  are  listed  or  locally  listed  and/or  in 
conservation  area  and  18  of  these  are  Grade  II  listed.  In 
general,  it  is an expensive estate to maintain.  Accordingly,  in 
thinking about the issues addressed in this paper, officers took 
into account:  

•  That  some  stations  have  received  substantial  levels  of 
to  receive  such 

investment,  or  are  shortly  due 

 
recent 
investment;  

 

•   That some stations are in the PFI programme;  

•  That  Lambeth  fire  station  is  an  integral  part  of  the 

 
redevelopment plan for the site; and  

 
•  That some stations provide multiple or difficult to relocate 
functions.  For  example,  at  Barking  fire  station,  in  addition  to 
the pumping appliances, we also have a Command Unit; a Bulk 
Foam Unit; a Hose Layer Lorry; an HR advisor; the Borough 
Commander;  an  office  for  the  firefighters  charity  and  the 
protective equipment group.  

23.  
The  effect  of  this  consideration  was  that  officers 
identified 28 fire stations which, in the modelling, we identified 
as  “protected” i.e. no closure proposals were to be generated. 
However, they could go from two appliances to one, or from 
one appliance to two. (In LSP5, it might usefully be said that 
(eight of the nine) PFI stations  have  been  “future-proofed”  in 
terms of their physical capacity and are each capable of taking 
further appliances. If a  need  for savings persists well  into the 
future, consolidating resources in these new parts of the estate 
might become more important).” 

157. 

In an appendix to the document, the reason for protecting each of the identified fire 
stations  was  given  in  the  form  of  “10  years  old  or  less”,  “Rescue  Centre”, 
“Recent/planned investment - £1m in last 3 years (minimum)”, “Large/useful site” or 
“PFI station”. 

158.  Mr  Stilitz  argues  that  the  Commissioner  based  his  decision  on  a  series  of 
predominantly financial factors and that there is no suggestion that he considered the 
impact on risk of his decision to ring-fence these stations.  He submits that this was 
another example of the process being back-to-front: as with the incorporation within 
the  modelling  process  of  the  first  and  second  appliance  response  times,  the
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

Commissioner had decided in advance to ring-fence these fire stations and then let the 
modelling  process  proceed  on  the  fixed  premise  that  these  stations  were  to  be 
protected.   

159.  Mr Stilitz contends that the Commissioner ought to have considered any risks arising 
from ring-fencing these stations and then weighed those risks against the benefits of 
retaining them.    

Temporary fire station closures in Southwark 

160.  The  final  matter relied upon  in this context is what Mr Stilitz describes as  “a  local 
issue  to  Southwark.”    It  arises,  it  is  said,  from  the  fact  that  during  the  three-year 
lifetime of the Plan, two stations in Southwark (Old Kent Road and Dockhead) will be 
closed  for  refurbishment  under  PFI  schemes  for  18  months  successively  with  the 
consequence  that  one  or  the  other  of  these  stations  will  be  closed  throughout  the 
currency of the Plan.  That consideration was not factored into the modelling process 
which was run on the basis that those stations would be open.   

161.  The Old Kent Road station was apparently closed on 14 October 2013 and it is argued 
that  in  the  absence  of  a  risk  assessment  which  takes  into  account  the  temporary 
closure of Old Kent Road and later Dockhead the full impact of the Plan has not been 
considered. 

(ii)  The Commissioner’s response to the fundamental challenge 

162.  A strong legal argument has been advanced by Mr Moffett that this is simply not the 
kind of decision-making area in which the court ought ordinarily to intervene and that 
indeed  no  legitimate  case  has  been  made  out  for  any  such  intervention.    I  will,  of 
course, address these legal issues in due course, but it is again unrealistic to isolate the 
propositions of law from the decision-making matrix to which they are said to apply 
and, accordingly, I need to examine that matrix in the first instance. 

163. 

I would merely preface that review by recording that the Commissioner’s position as 
a  general  proposition  is  that  all  relevant  factors  were  considered  in  the  decision-
making  process,  a  process  to  which  he  also  applied  his  experienced  professional 
judgment  in  weighing  up  relevant  factors,  including  those  required  directly  or 
indirectly by statute, and that he formulated a recommendation upon which the Mayor 
was justified in relying. 

164.  The timescale within which to prepare a report and recommendations for savings of 
the amounts required will  have  been apparent  from paragraphs 47-60 above.  Even 
allowing  for  some  advance  warning  of  the  need  for  further  savings,  the  time  for 
producing a comprehensive package of measures, for consulting upon them and then 
producing a  final recommendation was  short.  Starting with a  blank  sheet of paper 
was not an option, nor, of course, could it have been unless resources were unlimited 
and the timescale for making recommendations extremely generous.  However, over 
the years an electronic modelling process had been developed and refined which was 
designed  to  incorporate  the  many  complex  facets  of  organising  fire  and  rescue 
services  across  the  whole  of  Greater  London  for  which,  of  course,  the  LFB  is 
responsible.    It  was that  model  that  was  brought  into  play  in  formulating  the  draft 
Plan.

165.  Supporting Document 11 gives details of the nature of the modelling process and the 
Commissioner’s witness statement describes its essential elements.  I need not go into 
great detail about this because there is no suggestion that the decision-makers were 
wrong to place  intrinsic reliance on the results of the  modelling exercise.    What  is 
contended  is  that  some  of  the  fixed  parameters  fed  into  the  modelling  process  as 
inputs (for example,  it  is  said, the attendance times  for 1st and 2nd  appliances, the 
assumption that 28 fire stations would not close and so on) resulted in the assessment 
of local risk being ignored with the result that the output failed to reflect this aspect 
also.  I will return to that aspect later.  However, I should say a little about the way the 
modelling process works. 

166.  The Commissioner indicates that since 2004 the LFB has worked closely with ORH 
Ltd  (‘ORH’),  an  experienced  company  that  specialises  in  providing  modelling 
processes  and  analysis  in  order  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of 
emergency services.  ORH appears to have provided much, if not all, of the content of 
Supporting Document 11.  There is a paper within Supporting Document 11 in which 
the company describes itself in this way: 

“ORH  has  been  working  with  the  emergency  services  in  the 
UK and overseas, using these modelling techniques, for over 26 
years,  and  in  that  time  has  undertaken  about  600  studies  for 
over  100  clients.  ORH  has  worked  with  14  Fire  and  Rescue 
Services  using  this  modelling  approach,  typically  supporting 
their IRMP process.” 

167.  Of its modelling approach, it says this: 

“ORH provides a  bespoke  modelling service based on proven 
Operational Research (OR) techniques. ORH models have been 
designed to help understand the complex relationships between 
demand,  performance,  resources  and  efficiency,  for  services 
involving  emergency  response  (Fire,  Ambulance  and  Police) 
and public access to facilities. 

The  modelling  process 
(accurately 
representing the current situation), optimisation (identifying the 
‘best’  solutions),  simulation  (asking  ‘what  if?’  questions)  and 
sensitivity modelling (testing that solutions are robust) ….” 

involves  validation 

168.  The Commissioner says that the “modelling process has been used in order to assist 
decisions as to how to allocate the [LFB’s] resources to maximise the efficiency and 
effectiveness  of  the  service  that  we  provide  to  Londoners.”    He  gives  some  more 
detail  of  what  it  involves  which,  in  the  first  instance,  I  can  summarise  briefly  as 
follows. First, the ‘validation’ part of the process ensures that the model accurately 
reflects  the  operational  responses  of  the  LFB’s  appliances  in  terms  of  response 
performance  and  appliance  utilisation.    He  describes  the  model  as  “an  electronic 
representation of the [LFB]”. He also says that it “reflects the demand on the [LFB] at 
any particular time.” Second, the ‘optimisation’ part of the process seeks to identify 
the “best” options for allocating resources, where what is “best” is determined by the 
objectives and constraints that the LFB places on the model.  Third, the ‘simulation’ 
part of the modelling process helps to assess the workload and performance impact of
--------

any  change  in  appliance  and  station  deployment,  taking  account  of  appliance 
availability. At this stage, incidents are generated electronically at particular locations 
across London and vehicles are assigned to respond based on the LFB’s rules relating 
to  crew  skills,  type  of  incident  and  so  on,  and  the  likely  effects  of  different 
deployment  scenarios,  without  having  to  test  it  in  the  real  world.    This  stage  also 
assesses how any changes impact on attendance times to all incidents over a particular 
period  and  produces  information  about  the  attendance  times  both  at  London  and 
borough  levels.    Finally,  the  sensitivity  analysis  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the 
solutions identified are robust and that factors which have not been input directly into 
the optimisation process are considered in the process. It takes account of the impact 
of any changes proposed in the optimisation stage in relation to particular factors (for 
example,  attendance  times  to  high-rise  buildings,  attendance  times  to  areas  of 
deprivation)  to  ensure  that the  outcome  that  has  been  proposed  in  the  optimisation 
process is acceptable as against these factors. 

169.  Before  looking  at  the  components  of  the  modelling  process  that  are  said  by  Mr 
Moffett to afford an answer to the Claimants’ criticisms,  it  is, perhaps, pertinent to 
recall that the historical approach to the provision of fire and rescue services prior to 
2004 had resulted in what the Commissioner described in his witness statement as “a 
cluster of resources in the inner London boroughs” (see paragraph 26 above) resulting 
in faster response times in central and inner London than outer London.  It has not 
been easy to reproduce in this judgment some of the pictorial representations of the 
locations  of  incidents  in  relation  to  the  location  of  fire  stations,  but  reference,  for 
example, to the illustration at Appendix B5 to Supporting Document 11 (which can be 
found 
http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/Documents/Sup11-Fire-service-
modelling.pdf) demonstrates the location of existing fire stations in Greater London 
superimposed on the plan showing the distribution of the most serious incidents (i.e. 
non-false alarms receiving two or more appliances as a response) that occurred in the 
period from April 2007 to March 2012 (see paragraph 172 below) and the “cluster” to 
which the Commissioner refers can be identified clearly.  A scanned version of this 
plan can be found at Appendix 8 to this judgment. 

at 

170.  The  Claimants’  suggestion  that  “local  risk”  has  not  been  properly  considered  is 
refuted strongly by the Commissioner by reference to one fundamental feature of the 
modelling process.  I will record his own words and those of ORH about this below 
(see paragraphs 171-172), but in summary (and put very simply) what is said is that at 
the initial validation and optimisation stage of the process, the history of where the 
most serious incidents (as defined in paragraph 169 above) for the previous five years 
have  occurred  is  fed  into  the  modelling  programme  to  inform  the  programme  of 
where this aspect of the demand upon the LFB’s services is likely to emerge in the 
future.  Because the definition of a  “serious  incident”  for this purpose  involves not 
less than two appliances being sent out, because the PDA for a dwelling fire is always 
two appliances (see paragraph 135 above) and because excluded from the history are 
false alarms, what is thus fed into the programme is the history of the true demand for 
“real”  fires  that  threaten  life  and  limb.    The  history  will  include  all  “real”  fires  in 
high-rise dwellings, whether in the Claimant boroughs or elsewhere in London. The 
Commissioner’s  position  is  that  this  will  almost  certainly  represent  an  accurate 
measure of the true demand and the modelling programme will thus “know” where 
the demand has to be met (and its intrinsic frequency) when it is asked to put forward 
various options in the light of other factors fed into the modelling exercise.  It follows,
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

he asserts, that the true measure of “local risk” of any sort involving a dwelling fire, 
including  those  in  high-rise  buildings,  has  been  reflected  in  the  modelling  process 
from the outset.  This  is  not, of course, the only  factor injected  into the  modelling 
process, but it is the principal  factor that the Claimants are suggesting was  ignored 
totally. 

171.  The Commissioner put the general position in this way in his witness statement: 

“97. 
In  the  context  of  the  claim  that  is  brought,  it  is 
important  to  understand  that  emergency  cover  for  London  is 
planned  on  a  risk-based  approach.  One  of  the  ways  in  which 
this is achieved is through populating the model with historical 
data  about  incidents.  There  is  a  strong  correlation  between 
where we have attended incidents in the recent past and those 
we  currently  attend,  so  we  know  that  the  historical  data  is  a 
very strong predictor of future demand on the service given the 
strong year-on-year correlation between incident locations. For 
the  purposes  of  the  optimisation  process,  the  model  is  run 
against all serious  incidents occurring over the  last five  years 
that are not false alarms (i.e. those incidents that receiving two 
or more appliances in attendance).  However, all incidents are 
considered  when  the  model  is  simulating  the  outcomes  that 
have  been  proposed  during  the  optimisation  stage  in  order  to 
see the real effect of any changes on the [LFB]. This approach 
means  that  the  options  generated  during  the  optimisation 
process are not influenced unduly by the number and location 
of automatic false alarms, however all incidents are considered 
when the simulation process is run to ensure that true impact of 
the proposals are measured.  

98. 
Historical  data on  serious  incidents  are  a  good  proxy 
for  risk  as  they  represent  all  the  occasions  over  a  five  year 
period  where  risk  has  given  rise  to  an  actual  incident 
(likelihood)  and  a  response  of  two  or  more  fire  engines  was 
sent (consequence). The location of serious incidents is highly 
correlated  between  the  five  years  of  incident  data  used  for 
optimisation  modelling  and  is  a  sound  basis  for  predicting 
where the [LFB] might get called in the future ….” 

172.  He  went  on  to  say  that  the  correlations  were  dealt  with  in  a  section  of  Supporting 
Document  11  entitled  ‘Model  Revalidation  in  2012’.    The  three  paragraphs  that 
appear to deal with this are as follows: 

“9.  To  validate  against  periods  when  normal  operational 
activity  is  being  carried out is  essential as the primary use of 
the model will require comparison to the base position of 169 
appliances  across  112  stations.  The  most  recent  complete 
financial  year (April 2011 to March 2012) can be confidently 
taken  as  a  reliable  sample  period  for  demand  rates  and 
performance measurement.
--------

10. The geographical distributions of incidents (for each of the 
five  incident  types  …)  are  mapped  in  Appendices  B1  to  B5 
using  a  five  year  sample  period  (April  2007  to March  2012). 
The  distribution  of  false  alarm  incidents  …  are  highly 
concentrated  around  Central  London.  The  most  evenly 
distributed incidents are one appliance fires …. 

11. A geographical correlation analysis (covering the five year 
sample)  is  presented  for  each  of  the  five  incident  types  in 
Appendix  B6.  As  expected,  false  alarm  incidents  have  the 
strongest  year  on  year  correlations.  For  all  incident  types  the 
analysis  shows  that  the  correlations  become  only  marginally 
weaker as the time period increases; this supports the use of a 
five  year  sample  for  incident  distributions  to  be  used  in  the 
model validation.” 

173.  The “five incident types” referred to are ‘False Alarm - 1 Appliance Attended’, ‘False 
Alarm - 2 Appliances Attended’, ‘Fire - 1 Appliance Attended (typically Secondary 
fires), ‘Other incident - 1 Appliance Attended (includes Flooding, Shut in Lifts, etc)’ 
and ‘Fire/Other Incident - 2+ Appliances Attended (Serious Incidents)’. 

174.  Mr Moffett makes the  legitimate point that this  correlation exercise  has never been 
challenged by the Claimants and no evidence contradicting its validity has been put 
forward.  It would, of  course, have  been  surprising  if any such  challenge  had  been 
mounted if, as ORH says, it has “worked with 14 Fire and Rescue Services using this 
modelling  approach,  typically  supporting  their  IRMP  process”  (see  paragraph  166 
above). 

175.  The Commissioner emphasised  his position  in the  following passage  in  his witness 

statement: 

“I  also  understand  that  it  is  said  by  the  Claimants  that  the 
decision in relation to resource allocation does not take account 
of  the  characteristics  of  particular  boroughs,  for  example  the 
types  of  premises  located  in  that  borough  such  as  high-rise 
buildings,  high  profile  buildings  and  heritage  buildings. 
However,  this  …  misunderstands  the  modelling  process.  The 
model  considers  the  location  of  all  serious  incidents  across 
London  for  the  last  five  years.  Given  that  serious  incidents 
includes any incident to which two or more fire appliances have 
attended that is not a false alarm, the model will take account of 
any  fires  that  have  taken  place  in  high-rise  buildings,  high 
profile buildings and heritage buildings across London over the 
last  five  years.  Given  the  strong  correlation  between  the 
locations of these incidents year on year, the modelling process 
optimises the location of resources in order to best respond to 
these  serious  incidents,  including,  for  example,  high-rise 
buildings, heritage buildings, or high profile buildings. To the 
extent that particular types of premises or particular groups of 
people  generate  demand  for  the  [LFB]  to  attend  to  serious 
incidents,  this  is  taken  into  account  in  the  model  through  the
--------

risk nodes. This means that the method adopted by the [LFB] is 
grounded  in  evidence  of  the  actual  likelihood  of  serious 
incidents  occurring  in  particular  localities.  The  Claimants 
appear  to  be  advocating  an  approach  which  looks  at  the 
theoretical likelihood of a fire occurring at a particular type of 
premises,  for  example  high-rise  buildings  or  high  profile 
buildings.  However, the approach adopted by the [LFB] is to 
look  at  actual  evidence  as  to  the  likely  locations  of  serious 
incidents  based  on  historical  data  and  to  plan  by  reference  to 
this.” 

176.  His  reference  to  “risk  nodes”  needs  to  be  understood.    ORH’s  modelling  process 
requires, amongst other things, input relating to “travel times” and the establishing of 
a “travel time matrix” for London.  At its simplest this matrix establishes the travel 
times  between  a  very  large  number  of  permutations  of  location  within  Greater 
London.  Once inputted into the modelling programme the programme will “know” 
how long, in a variety of traffic conditions, it will take to get from A to B, C to D and 
A to D and so on.  This  is obviously  important when computing response times to 
incidents from various fire stations. 

177.  The “travel time matrix” is constructed using sophisticated navigation technology data 
which  is  then  “calibrated  against  travel  times  actually  achieved”  (Supporting 
Document 11).  ORH describe the process thereafter as follows: 

“22. 
The  ORH  travel  time  matrices  are  developed  using  a 
node  system,  with  an  appropriate  geographical  distribution  of 
nodes essential for modelling purposes. The requirement for a 
large  number  of  nodes  to  improve  the  granularity  (and 
potentially the accuracy of travel times) must be balanced with 
the need to avoid introducing too many redundant nodes and to 
ensure a quick processing speed of the models. 

23. 
The travel time  matrix currently used  for the LFEPA 
models  is  based  on  the  distribution  of  Lower  Super  Output 
Areas  (LSOAs)  across  London,  of  which  there  are  4,765. 
Incident weighted centroids were defined  for each LSOA and 
nodes were therefore created at these  locations;  for the  larger 
LSOAs  (in  terms  of  size  and  incident  volumes),  additional 
nodes were placed to improve the relationship between incident 
locations  and  nodes.  This  gave  a  total  of  4,935  nodes  across 
London including the station locations. 

24.  Advancements 
to  computer  processing  power  and 
enhancements  to  the  models  used  by  ORH  have  enabled  an 
increase  in  the  number  of  nodes  for  the travel  time  matrix  in 
London. 

25. Although the LSOAs have remained the principal building 
blocks  in  terms  of  generating  an  appropriate  node  set,  the 
smaller census boundaries – Output Areas (OAs) – have been 
used across substantial sections of London with high demand,
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

or  where  the  underlying  LSOA  is  too  large  in  terms  of 
geographical  area.  As  a  result,  there  are  now  6,697  nodes 
within London to which incidents can be assigned, an increase 
of 40% from the previous travel time matrix ….” 

178. 

It will be recalled that the role of an LSOA was mentioned in the witness statement of 
Ms Moyies (see paragraph 111 above).  What, of course, is being said by ORH is that, 
compared with the information the model had about the location of localised demand 
in  previous  LSPs,  the  information  available  for LSP5  was  significantly  greater  and 
considerably more extensive. 

179.  The Commissioner takes this a  little  further  in his witness statement where  he says 

this: 

“The  optimisation  modelling  used  6,700  risk  nodes  across 
London  which  were  populated  with  the  analysed  demand  of 
serious  incidents.  In  this  respect,  the  size  of  a  node  does  not 
relate to the size of the geographical area to which it relates, but 
to the number of incidents in the area to which it relates.” 

180. 

In  his  witness  statement  a  map  appears  that  is  reproduced  in  Appendix  9  to  this 
judgment  which  the  Commissioner  says  “presents  the  analysed  demand  of  serious 
incidents.”  He goes on to observe that “a  larger number of serious  incidents occur 
within central London but that there are localised examples where higher demand is 
observed in outer London, for example, around Heathrow airport.”  A glance at the 
map would confirm the accuracy of that observation. 

181.  When  it  is  said  by  ORH  that  incidents  are  “assigned”  to  a  particular  node  (see 
paragraph 179 above), it means, as I understand it, that an actual incident is treated for 
modelling purposes as having occurred at a particular node.  It is a means of giving a 
broadly accurate geographical location within the model for each incident.  The more 
populated  with  serious  incidents  the  node  is,  the  greater the  need  for  the  model  to 
ensure  that  appliances  can  reach  the  location  of  the  node  within  an  appropriate 
response time. 

182.  Responding  to  the  suggestion  made  on  behalf  of  the  Claimants  that  his  approach 
failed to descend to the detail of the needs of local areas with sufficient particularity, 
the Commissioner said this in his witness statement: 

“The  Claimants  argue  that  LSP5  and  the  methodology 
underlying the proposals do not take account of the likelihood 
of  fire at ward  level. This overlooks the point that the  model 
considers risk  at a  much  more detailed  level than even ward-
level as there are 6,700 risk points, and only 649 wards across 
London.  For  example,  there  are  ordinarily  a  number  of  risk 
points within each ward ….” 

183.  He exhibits to his witness statement (at RD/174) an enlarged map (which is a portion 
of  the  map  attached  as  Appendix  9  to  this  judgment)  where  the  seven  Claimant 
boroughs are highlighted and the ward boundaries of each ward can be seen within 
each borough.  It has not been possible to reproduce it in this judgment, but reference
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

to it does demonstrate clearly where the various nodes are within the individual wards 
and the Commissioner is correct when he says that virtually every ward has at least 
one node within it and in many there are many nodes, some to which a good many 
serious incidents are assigned (see paragraph 181 above). 

184.  On  the  Commissioner’s  case,  it  is  at  this  stage  of  the  modelling  process  that  the 
detailed local risk is fed directly into the process.  His evidence is that the next stage 
in the overall process when the local impacts of the proposals were considered - and 
thus  factored  into the  final  recommendation  and  the  ultimate  decision -  was  at  the 
sensitivity  analysis  stage  (see  paragraph  168  above).    This,  he  says  in  his  witness 
statement,  “involved  consideration  of  the  impact  of  the  proposals  on  nine  different 
areas of interest … those living at priority postcodes, the impact on accidental fires in 
the homes that were severe or significant, high-rise housing incidents, the impact on 
the top 10% of deprived lower super outputs areas, fatalities at fire, injuries at fire, 
rescues at fire, third appliance attendance times and heritage buildings.”  That stage 
comes  after  the  stage  at  which  the  issue  of  response  times  is  addressed  in  the 
modelling process, but I am endeavouring at present to focus on the issue of intrinsic 
local risk assessment and will return to the response time issue shortly (see paragraphs 
202-204).  The sensitivity analysis to which I am about to refer related, of course, to 
the “151/100” proposal that appeared in the draft Plan. 

185.  The source for the Commissioner’s evidence about this is to be found in Supporting 
Document 20 and, in particular, Appendix 14.  I will record those aspects that are of 
relevance  to  the  issue  of  “local  risk”.    The  first  relates  to  priority  postcodes.    In 
relation to “P1 households” the following is recorded: 

“Priority 1 postcodes used to identify and target the people 
with lifestyles which make them more at risk from fire  

The  Brigade’s  Incident  Risk  Analysis  Toolkit  (iRAT)  helps 
target  community  safety  activity  by  analysing  and  identifying 
those lifestyle characteristics which mean that people are more 
likely to experience a fire or suffer the consequences of the fire 
in  the  home.  We  call  these  P1  (priority  one)  households.  We 
have used this data to look at the impact of the option on those 
households. The impacts on range coverage are as follows:  

  Average  1st  appliance  range  cover  deteriorates  by  13 
seconds  (London-wide).  The  proportion  of  incidents 
within 6 minutes deteriorates by 5.0 per cent.  

  Average  2nd  appliance  range  cover  deteriorates  by  10 
seconds  (London-wide).  The  percentage  of  incidents 
within 8 minutes deteriorates by 1.1 per cent.”  

186. 

In  relation  to  the  issue  of  severe/significant  fires  in  the  home,  the  following  is 
recorded: 

“This sensitivity measure uses the fire severity index developed 
for fires in the home which uses a range of factors to categorise 
fires  as  severe,  significant,  moderate  and  slight.  The  analysis
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

has used data since 2008 and is the historic location of fires in 
the  home  with  a  fire  severity  categorisation  of  ‘severe’  or 
‘significant’  and  considered  range  cover  ….  The  impacts  on 
range coverage are as follows: 

  Average  1st  appliance  range  cover  deteriorates  by  11 
seconds  (London-wide).  The  percentage  of  incidents 
within 6 minutes deteriorates by 4.9 per cent.  

  Average  2nd  appliance  range  cover  deteriorates  by  10 
seconds  (London-wide).  The  percentage  of  incidents 
within 8 minutes deteriorates by 0.5 per cent.  

  Presently,  there  are  four  boroughs  where  average 
second appliance range cover to fires in the homes with 
fire  severity of significant  is greater than the 8-minute 
standard ….”  

187.  That  paragraph  goes  on  to  explain,  in  relation  to  the  8-minute  standard,  that  in 
Bromley, Harrow and Richmond-on-Thames there is improvement in 2nd appliance 
cover and no change in Kingston-on-Thames. 

188.  The next area considered is “High rise housing incidents”.  The appendix records as 

follows: 

“The  Brigade  records  where  appliances  are  mobilised  to  an 
incident where the  Control Officer knows that the  fire  is  in a 
high rise housing block. This historic data … has been used to 
look  at  the  impacts  on  these  fires.  These  incidents  are  most 
typically  found  in  areas  of  central  London  and  therefore  the 
London-wide  impacts  are  greater  than  those  observed  for  all 
incidents. The impacts on range coverage are as follows:

  There  are  three  boroughs  where  just  second  appliance 
average range cover to high rise  incidents greater than 
the 8-minute standard.  

  There  is  one  borough  where  both  first  and  second 
appliance  average  range  cover  to  high  rise  incidents 
falls  outside  of  the  standards  for  LFB-wide  first  and 
second response.  

The changes would mean:  

  Two  boroughs  would  improve  their  average  second 
appliance range cover to high rise incidents to within 8 
minutes,  and  two  boroughs,  already  within  8  minutes 
for their second appliance average range cover to high 
rise incidents, would further improve.  

  No  borough  would  deteriorate  from  within,  to  outside 
of, 6 minutes for the first appliance average range cover 
to high rise incidents.  

  One borough would deteriorate from within, to outside 
of,  8  minutes  for  the  second  appliance  range  cover  to 
high rise incidents, and one borough, already outside of 
8 minutes for second appliance range cover to high rise 
incidents, would deteriorate further.  

189.  The final area that is arguably of relevance in this context is that relating to LSOAs 

(lower super output areas).  The following is recorded: 

“This  sensitivity  analysis  has  looked  at the  Index  of  Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD) and has considered range cover to the lower 
super  output  areas  rated  as  being  the  top  10  per  cent  most 
deprived. The current position and impacts of our proposals on 
range coverage are as follows:  

Presently:  

  There  are  two  boroughs  where  just  first  appliance 
average  range  cover  is  greater  than  the  6-minute 
standard.  

  There  is  one  borough  where  just  second  appliance 
average  range  cover  is  greater  than  the  8-minute 
standard.  

  There  is  one  borough  where  both  first  and  second 
appliance  average  range  cover  falls  outside  of  the 
standards for LFB-wide first and second response.  

The changes would mean:

  No borough, already outside of either the first or second

  No  borough  would  deteriorate  from  within,  to  outside

190. 

In  relation  to  this  sensitivity  analysis,  the  Commissioner  said  this  in  his  witness 
statement: 

“127.  During  the  consultation  process,  sensitivity  analysis 
was  undertaken  in  relation  to  the  impact  of  the  151/100 
proposal  at  ward  level.  The  sensitivity  analysis  therefore 
focussed on the impact of the proposals on particular types of 
premises and particular sectors of the population. Whilst these 
factors had already been factored into the optimisation process 
indirectly  by  way  of  the  6,700  risk  nodes  representing  the 
likelihood  of  fires  in  particular  locations,  the  sensitivity 
analysis  was  a  method  to  ensure  that  the  direct  impact  on 
the  population,  particular  areas  or 
particular  sectors  of 
premises,  and 
the  fire  were  not 
unacceptably  worse  under  the  proposals.  I  therefore  do  not 
accept  the  Claimants’  argument  that  the  proposals  were 
formulated  without  regard  to  particular  characteristics  of 
particular areas.”  

the  consequences  of 

191.  The ultimate aim of the sensitivity analysis was to see whether the impacts of the draft 
Plan were unacceptable.  The Claimants submit that merely recording the effects of 
the  proposed  Plan  at  this  stage  in  the  process  in  the  way  set  out  above  does  not 
constitute  any  active  engagement  with  the  issues  and  demonstrates  that  the  issues 
were  not  considered  as  part  of  the  decision-making  process.    I  will  deal  with  this 
argument in due course.   

192. 

I  am,  as  I  have  indicated,  dealing  at  this  point  with  whether  the  Claimants  have 
established the argument that the draft Plan does not take into account “all foreseeable 
fire  and  rescue  related  risks  that  could  affect  its  community”  (the  essential 
requirement  of  the  National  Framework),  rather  than  the  argument  that  this 
requirement has been subverted by the adoption of the principle of equal entitlement.  
If  I  have  understood the  Claimants’  arguments  correctly,  these  contentions,  though 
related,  are to  be  treated  separately.    The  emphasis  of  the argument  at the  level  at 
which I am considering  it  appears to be that the Commissioner did  not incorporate 
local risk factors (such as high rise buildings, demographics, local deprivation and so 
on) in the analysis and thus that these factors simply did not feed into the decision as 
to where the cuts in service should be made.

193. 

I should also observe that I am not at this stage dealing with the alleged relevance of 
the role of fire prevention measures that, it is said, informs the way local risk is to be 
perceived.  I will return to that in due course (see paragraphs 233-246). 

194.  Mr Moffett on several occasions challenged the Claimants on the basis that they had 
ignored  a  fundamental  aspect  of  the  modelling  process,  namely,  that  reliable 
predictions of where  fires were  likely to occur in future had been  injected  into that 
process  from  the  outset  and  that  those  predictions  descended  to  a  very  localised 
geographical framework because of the adoption of the nodes to which I have referred 
above.   Mr Stilitz rejected the charge,  but I am  bound to say,  having reviewed the 
arguments  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  this  judgment,  it  is  difficult  to  find  any 
meaningful response to the contention that local risk was taken into account in this 
way and, subject to the argument concerning the principle of equal entitlement, that it 
was an entirely effective, rational and fair way of doing so.  If and to the extent that 
the Guidance Note issued by the ODPM (see paragraphs 28 et seq above) remains of 
relevance,  Mr  Moffett  suggests  that  this  approach  certainly  meets  the  spirit,  if  not 
indeed the letter, of paragraph 3.3.4 of the Guidance Note and indeed also paragraph 
3.4.4 of the same Note.  He submits that, subject to the argument about the principle 
of equal entitlement, the Commissioner was implementing the statutory framework or, 
more  accurately,  was  affording 
the 
Commissioner’s recommendation, for complying with that framework. 

if  he  accepted 

the  Mayor 

the  basis, 

195. 

If  one  adds  to that the  fact  that the  modelling  process  adopted  was one  previously 
adopted  by  the  Commissioner  (and  his  predecessor),  is  obviously  adopted by  other 
fire service authorities throughout the country and the consequences of its utilisation 
have  not  been  the  subject  of  any  adverse  direction  by  the  Secretary  of  State  since 
2004, it is quite impossible for the court to reach any conclusion other than that its use 
in the way it was used in formulating the draft Plan was entirely lawful and rational.  
It  did  address  in  arguably  the  most  meaningful  way  (namely,  by  reference  to  the 
detailed history of the previous 5 years) the local vulnerabilities to fire at a level at 
least  commensurate  with  ward  level  (though  in  fact  more  particularised  than  that).  
The National Framework and indeed the Guidance Notes are not prescriptive as to the 
means by which all foreseeable risks are identified – what is required is that they are 
addressed at a level of detail that enables proper planning of a response to the needs 
thus identified.  That, as it seems to me on the evidence, was done.   

196. 

I have not been persuaded that this aspect of the approach to the Plan was other than 
lawful  and  rational.    That  conclusion  is  independent  of  the  issues  arising  from  the 
application of the principle of equal entitlement. 

197.  Has  the  application  of  that  principle  subverted  what  is  otherwise  an  acceptable 
approach  to  the  modelling  or,  as  Mr  Stilitz  put  it,  has  its  adoption  “necessarily 
[disavowed]  local  risk  when  setting  the  uniform  targets  across  …  London”?    This 
question  needs  to  be  addressed  at  the  same  time  as  addressing  the  question  of 
whether,  as  the  Claimants  assert,  the  Commissioner  has,  in  practice,  treated 
attendance times as a proxy for assessing risk? 

198. 

In  relation  to  that  latter  question,  the  Commissioner  addressed  it  directly  in  his 
witness statement in the following way:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

“… it is important to understand that the attendance standards 
are  not  a  proxy  for  risk.  This  is  important,  because  the 
Claimants’  case  appears  to  proceed  on  the  wholly  mistaken 
assumption  that  it  was  the  attendance  standards  which  drove 
my  deployment  proposals,  as  an  alternative  to  risk.  This  was 
not the case. The Brigade’s overall aim is to get to emergency 
incidents  as  quickly  as  possible  anywhere 
in  London. 
Performance against this objective is measured by reference to 
the  attendance  standards,  which  operate  as  key  performance 
indicators.  Whilst  I  accept  that  the  speed  of  attendance  is  an 
important factor  in  mitigating the risk of casualties  from  fire, 
there is no clear dividing line in relation to the risk of casualties 
as  between  an  attendance  time  of  5:59  and  6:01.  Therefore, 
where  the  average  attendance  time  for  a  particular  borough 
exceeds  the  attendance  standard,  this  does  not  mean  that  an 
unacceptable  risk  is  therefore  posed  to  people  living  and 
working  in that  borough. The  same  can  be said  in relation to 
individual  wards  within  boroughs.    In  setting  the  attendance 
standards at 6 minutes for the first appliance and 8 minutes for 
the second appliance, I acknowledge that some responses will 
be  faster  and  some  will  be  slower  than  those  averages.  It  is 
inherent in the use of average attendance times that there will 
be some variability in performance either side of the average. 
In  short,  the  attendance  standards  are  principally  used  to 
measure  performance  on  an  ongoing  basis,  however  they  can 
also be used to feed into decisions in relation to reallocation of 
resources to ensure that proposals do not result in undesirable 
outcomes at borough level. One of the reasons for adopting the 
third  attendance  time  measure  in  LSP3  (i.e.  an  appliance  to 
arrive within 12 minutes in 95% of occasions) is to ensure that 
no incident has an exceptionally protracted attendance time.”  

199.  There  are  some  other  passages  in  the  Commissioner’s  statement  that  are  of  some 
relevance in this context.  Reverting to the modelling process, it is important to see 
what was “fed into” the initial stages of the process.  In relation to the optimisation 
part of the process (see paragraphs 168 and 171 above) the Commissioner said this: 

imposed  on 

“There were two overall objectives of the optimisation process: 
(i) the need to identify a particular level of savings and (ii) the 
need to  minimise attendance times to serious  incidents across 
London.  Three  constraints  were  also 
the 
optimisation  process:  (i)  protecting  particular  stations  from 
closure, (ii) maintaining a minimum of one fire station in each 
Borough,  and  (iii)  station  capacity  (those  stations  that  could 
take  a  second  appliance).  A  further  stage  was  to  apply 
particular rules to the model, namely protecting performance at 
borough level  by  ensuring that no borough that was currently 
outside of the attendance standards had poorer performance as 
a result of the reallocation of resources and any boroughs that 
were within the attendance  standards did  not move to outside
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

the  attendance  standards.  I  refer  to  this  as  the  application  of 
“borough rules”. (My emphasis.) 

200. 

In  relation  to  the  realisation  of  the  objective  of  minimising  attendance  to  serious 
incidents,  in  a  passage  in  his  witness  statement  that  followed  shortly  after  to  his 
reference to the plan at Appendix 9 to this judgment (see paragraph 180 above), he 
also said this: 

“I understand that one of the Claimants’ arguments is that the 
decision to allocate resources in a particular way was arrived at 
without  consideration  of  “risk”  and  that  the  allocation  was 
driven  simply  by  the  need  to  meet  standardised  attendance 
times  across  London.  This  is  incorrect.  It  is  important  that  I 
emphasise  that  compliance  with  the  attendance  standards  at  a 
London  level  was  not  an  objective  or  criteria  input  into  the 
optimisation  process.  As  I  have  explained  above, 
the 
optimisation  process  sought  to  minimise  first  and  second 
appliance  attendance  times  to  all  serious  incidents  across 
London,  irrespective  of  the  attendance  standards.  Although  6 
and  8  minute  attendance  standards  were  used  as  a  reference 
point  to  judge  the  effect  of  making  particular  changes  in  the 
simulation  stage  of  the  model  …,  London-wide  attendance 
standards  did  not  directly  influence  the  optimisation  process 
which  sought  to  allocate  resources  in  a  way  which  reduced 
attendance  times  across  London  to  the  maximum  possible 
extent, whether this be to 4 minutes, 5 minutes, or 6 minutes. In 
short,  the  optimisation  process  would  produce  the  same 
suggested outcomes at this stage irrespective of the attendance 
standards.  To  this  extent,  the  Claimants’  suggestion  that  the 
first  and  second  attendance  standards  formed  the  basis  of  the 
decision  as  to  where  to  make  the  cuts  betrays  a  fundamental 
lack of understanding of the modelling process, which was set 
out  in  Draft  LSP5  and  the  supporting  documents  ….”    (My 
emphasis.) 

201.  Notwithstanding  this  evidence,  Mr  Stilitz  contends  that  Supporting  Document  20 
shows  that  the  6-  and  8-minute  attendance  targets  did  not  arise  from  the  model  as 
outputs, but they represented inputs into it. Only once those targets had been inputted, 
he  submits,  did  the  model  identify  the  best  configuration  of  appliances  and  fire 
stations. 

202.  The  distinction  between  what  the  Commissioner  says  was  the  position  and  the 
position  adopted  by  Mr  Stilitz  may  seem  a  fine  one,  but  it  is  a  real  one.    As  I 
understand his submission, it is to the effect that the model was, in effect, “instructed” 
to  produce  a  resource  deployment  configuration  that  met  those  average  attendance 
targets.  However, reference to Supporting Document 20 does, in my judgment, show 
that  what  the  Commissioner  has  said  is  correct.    Paragraph  28  of  the  document 
referred  to  the  many  possible  combinations  of  appliances  and  fire  stations  that  the 
model  could,  for  example,  generate  in  order  to provide  savings  of  £50  million.    It 
continues thus:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

“ORH employed sophisticated optimisation techniques to find 
the best configuration – i.e. the minimum impact of 1st and 2nd 
appliance response times – for each of the combinations in the 
matrix. This approach ensured that for each level of savings the 
configurations put forward for further assessment were optimal 
in  terms  of  providing  emergency  cover  to  London.”  (My 
emphasis.) 

203.  Under a heading entitled ‘Modelling £25m for optimum London-wide performance’ 

the following three paragraphs appeared: 

“31.  In  the  case  of  the  £25m  target,  34  options  were 
summarised  (ranging  from  143  appliances  at  112  stations  to 
159 appliances and 80 stations). The summary identified seven 
different performance impacts, which were:  

•  average  1st  response  time  to  all  incidents  (target  is  6 

 
minutes).  

•  average  2nd  response  time  to  all  incidents  (target  is  8 

 
Minutes).  

• 1st appliance performance at 95th percentile (target is 95 

 
per cent within 12 minutes).  

•  appliance  utilisation  impacts  (how  busy  the  appliance  is 

 
attending incidents).  

• the number of boroughs that would achieve the 1st and 2nd 

 
appliance target (i.e. the ‘borough score’).  

the  combined  1st  and  2nd  appliance  performance 

• 

 
(average).  

• 

the  number  of  boroughs  achieving  1st  appliance 

 
performance within the 95th percentile.  

32. For each option, the optimisation model then identified the 
best  configuration  of  appliances  and  stations,  applying  the 
operational  objective  to  minimise  aggregate  London-wide  1st 
and 2nd appliance response times to serious incidents. This led 
to  the  identification  of  results,  reported  in  terms  of  the 
performance  criteria  described  above.  The  modelling  also 
ensured that a station could not be identified for closure at, for 
example, £10m and then be re-opened at £25m. At this stage, 
specific  deployment  options  were  still  not  identified  or  under 
consideration. 

33.  For  the  £25m  savings  options,  the  average  1st  response 
times ranged from 5:24 (143 appliances at 112 stations) to 6:02 
(159 appliances at 80 stations). The standards for average 2nd

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

In  considering 

the  “borough  score”  and 

response and the 95th percentile were comfortably met for all 
options. 
the 
combination  of  1st  and  2nd  average  response  times,  the 
deployment  options  of  152  appliances  at  95  stations  and  153 
appliances at 93 stations were identified in the ORH modelling 
as  providing  the  strongest  levels  of  performance.  However, 
because  the  performance  impacts  for  the  option  of  154 
appliances at 91 stations were also very strong and taking into 
account  the  benefits  of  larger  stations,  the  work  to  look  at 
actual  deployment  impacts  proceeded  on  the  basis  of  further 
examination  of  152  appliances  at  95  stations  and  154 
appliances at 91 stations.” (My emphasis.)  

204.  Whilst  the  phraseology  of  these  paragraphs  presents  its  challenges,  they  do,  to  my 
mind,  convey  tolerably  clearly  that  the  model  had  been  “instructed”  to  find 
configurations that minimised the aggregate (i.e. the total) of 1st and 2nd appliance 
response times to serious accidents across the whole of London.  When it had done so, 
each configuration (with its myriad of likely attendance times) was assessed against 
the  performance  criteria  identified  which  included  the  6-  and  8-minute  attendance 
targets  referred  to  above.    (Indeed  reference  to  the  succeeding  passages  in  this 
document, dealing with other configurations such as 152/95, 154/91 and so on, each 
speaks in terms of the objective of “minimising London-wide 1st and 2nd appliance 
times to serious incidents”.) 

205.  This approach does not, of course, render irrelevant the influence of those targets on 
the appraisal of the particular configuration generated by the modelling process (and 
does  not  mean  that  the  role  of  the  principle  of  equal  entitlement  on  the  overall 
outcome  is  rendered  irrelevant  either),  but  it  does  mean  that the  modelling  process 
was  not,  as  the  Claimants  suggest,  configured  to  produce  results  that  had  to  be 
consistent with those targets. To the extent that that argument is maintained, I do not 
consider it well-founded and it is not consistent with the evidence. 

206.  However,  because  the  output of  the  modelling  process  was  judged  by  reference  to 
what have been described as “pan-London” attendance time targets (as identified in 
paragraph 92), the principle of equal entitlement has undoubtedly had some influence 
on  deciding  whether  the  Plan  was  an  acceptable  way  of  achieving  the  necessary 
budgetary  savings.    Indeed  this  has  never  been  denied  by  the  Commissioner.    The 
important question, as it seems to me, is whether it was unlawful or irrational for the 
decision  to  adopt  the  proposed  Plan  to  be  made  when  the  assessment  of  the 
acceptability of the Plan was influenced by the application of that principle. 

207.  The essence of Mr Stilitz’s argument was outlined in paragraphs 95-98 above.  The 
essence of the Commissioner’s response was outlined in paragraphs 81-94.  I need not 
repeat those contentions other than to remind  myself that the Commissioner was at 
pains to emphasise that the principle of equal entitlement was a “guiding” principle, 
not an overriding one (see paragraph 81 above) and that what lies at its heart is the 
proposition  that  everyone  in  London  should  be  entitled  to  expect  a  broadly  similar 
response in terms of the arrival time of a fire appliance or appliances to the scene of, 
in particular, a dwelling fire irrespective of where they live and the likelihood of a fire 
in that particular locality.  Thus expressed, it is easy to see why such an egalitarian 
principle would resonate positively with a majority of those originally consulted about
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

its validity and applicability (see paragraph 85 above) and why it continues to attract 
significant, though not overwhelming, support. 

208.  Whatever formulation of the legal test might be adopted, it is quite plain that blind 
adherence  to  a  principle,  guiding  or  otherwise,  that  either  ignores  the  will  of 
Parliament,  expressed  in  clear  statutory  language,  or  has  become  so  obviously 
outdated or otherwise inappropriate as to make its invocation irrational, would be a 
matter  upon  which  the  court  might  be  driven  to  intervene  in  appropriate 
circumstances.  The question is whether the influence of the principle in the context of 
the formulation of the Plan falls within either of those two territories.   

209.  An  apparent  immediate  hurdle  for  the  Claimants  is  that  the  principle  has  plainly 
influenced previous plans for London since the FRSA and no-one has sought to argue 
that by doing so those responsible  for deciding to adopt those plans were acting  in 
breach  of  the  Act  (or  any  other  statutory  provision)  or  that  they  were  acting 
irrationally.  However, it is fair to say that none of those earlier plans involved cuts to 
front-line services and an interference with response times and that, accordingly, the 
context of the decision under review in the present case might be said to be different 
from the context of the decisions previously made.   Mr Moffett submitted that the 
context did not matter: the approach was either lawful or unlawful.  I am not sure that 
I can accept that proposition in quite the unequivocal terms in which it is advanced.  
That  no-one  has  mounted  a  challenge  previously  does  not  inexorably  lead  to  the 
conclusion that what had been done previously was lawful when examined carefully.  
However, in any event, of course, the arguments concerning the effect of the principle 
in  relation  to  the  Plan  under  consideration  in  these  proceedings  would  need  to  be 
addressed  irrespective  of  any  historical  perspective,  subject  only  to the  question  of 
whether  it  would  itself  have  been  irrational,  notwithstanding  the  need  to  look  at 
matters afresh, to ignore the way the fire services across London had been organised 
in the preceding 8/9 years. 

210.  As I have said, it is plainly necessary to examine the case advanced by the Claimants 
on its own merits.  The court is being asked only to evaluate that case and nothing 
more.  That being so reference to what happens in other fire authority areas will not 
be determinative and is of only passing relevance.  However, the Commissioner does 
draw attention in his witness statement to the 2013-2016 IRMP for Merseyside Fire 
and Rescue Authority which has adopted a county-wide attendance standard described 
as  the  “Single  Emergency  Response”,  namely,  10  minutes  for  the  first  attending 
appliance  and  also  West  Midlands  Fire  and  Rescue  Authority  which  has  adopted  a 
single  county-wide  attendance  standard  for  “life  risk  incidents”  in  its  2013/2016 
IRMP.   

211.  The Commissioner acknowledges that other metropolitan fire and rescue services do 
have policies that seek to prioritise attendance times for particular areas or particular 
incidents and thus set differential attendance standards by reference to particular areas 
or  incidents.    He  accepts  that  it  is  a  legitimate  view  that  if,  for  example,  there  is  a 
preponderance of high-rise buildings in an area greater resources should be devoted to 
that  area  (or  at  least  that  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  devotion  of  greater 
resources)  and  that  this  would,  in  principle,  be  one  way  in  which  to  approach  an 
exercise such as that which is the subject of challenge in this case.  However, he says 
that “a fire with serious consequences can occur anywhere in London” and that it is 
his  view  that  “pursuant  to  the  guiding  principle  of  equal  entitlement  …  such  fires
--------

should  receive  broadly  the  same  attendance  time  wherever  they  occur.”    He 
supplements that view with this example relating to the position of an elderly disabled 
person living at the top of a high-rise block:  

“…  the  potential  for  …  serious  consequences  are  the  same 
whether the elderly disabled person lives at the top of a high-
rise block in (say) Islington or (say) Barking & Dagenham. … 
crudely  put,  the  question  therefore  arises  whether  an  elderly 
disabled person living in Islington should benefit from a faster 
attendance  time  at  the  expense  of  the  elderly  disabled  person 
living in Barking & Dagenham because there are more elderly 
disabled persons living in high-rise blocks in Islington than in 
Barking  &  Dagenham.  I  accept,  and  have  recognised 
throughout, that it  is potentially  legitimate to answer “yes” to 
that question. However, my view (and the Brigade’s view since 
2004)  is  that  as  the  potential  consequences  that  might  be 
experienced by an elderly disabled person living at the top of a 
high-rise block are the same no matter where in London he or 
she  lives,  he  or  she  should  not  receive  a  slower  attendance 
times simply because of the nature of the milieu in which he or 
she happens to live.” 

212.  Mr Moffett also says, by reference to the modelling exercise to which I have referred, 
that  the  application  the  principle  of  equal  entitlement  does  not  prevent  the  model, 
when generating particular configurations of  fire stations and appliances  for  further 
evaluation,  from  allocating  emergency  response  resources  according  to  the  risk  of 
serious incidents occurring in particular localities.  Given the initial injection into the 
modelling process of the location of all serious  fires over the previous 5  years (see 
paragraph  170-173  and  195  above),  the  modelling  inevitably  results  in  more 
substantial  resources  being  allocated  to  inner  London  because  serious  incidents  are 
more likely to occur in inner London:  the model will try to ensure that sufficient fire 
appliances  are  allocated  to  attend  those  areas  however  many  serious  fires  are 
predicted to occur per day there, just as it will to ensure that sufficient fire appliances 
are allocated to attend those areas where a lesser number of serious fires are predicted 
to  occur  per  day.    The  principle  of  equal  entitlement  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  fire 
appliances arrive within broadly the same periods irrespective of where the fire may 
be. 

213. 

I will, of course, be dealing with the issue of the consultation process in due course, 
but  the  question  of  whether  the  principle  should  be  applied  did  provoke  some 
responses.  Of the 1465 members of the public who expressed a view on the question 
of whether there should be a single response time standard for the whole of London, 
47% agreed and 53% disagreed. 

214.  Before reaching a conclusion on this issue I should refer to an observation made by 
Mr  Stilitz  about  the  Commissioner’s  justification  for  the  principle  of  equal 
entitlement.  The paragraph of his witness statement that I quoted in paragraph 207 
above is similar to paragraph 69 of his witness statement that I quoted in paragraph 79 
above.    He  suggests  that  the  Commissioner’s  example  given  in  his  paragraph  69 
“dodges  the  hard  questions”  and  “means  that  a  fit  middle-aged  person  living  in  a 
semi-detached house in Croydon can expect the same attendance time as an elderly

disabled  person  living  at  the  top  of  a  high-rise  block  in  Camden.”    Mr  Moffett 
submitted  that  it  was  difficult  to  understand  the  point  being  made  here  and,  with 
respect  to  Mr  Stilitz,  I  agree.    Mr  Moffett  emphasises  that  the  Commissioner’s 
approach  is  to  try  to  ensure  that  similar  people  in  similar  circumstances  have  the 
benefit of similar response times if a dwelling fire occurs and, in order to see whether 
the principle works, endeavours to compare like-with-like.  Mr Moffett’s riposte was 
telling:  on  the  Commissioner’s  approach,  he  argued,  a  disabled  person  in  Camden 
benefits from the same response time as a fit person in Croydon, but if the argument 
advanced by Mr Stilitz is valid, a fit person in Camden would benefit from a better 
response time than a disabled person in Croydon. 

215.  Whether this kind of debate assists directly on the resolution of this issue is open to 
question,  but it does highlight one consideration  that, to my  mind, anyone standing 
back from looking at a particular local effect of the Plan would observe.  It would be 
that it is possible to conceive of almost any number of permutations of individual and 
collective circumstances throughout Greater London that could promote a discussion, 
possibly a lively one, about what is a “fair” or “the safest overall” arrangement for the 
emergency fire services.   There will be “hard questions” to address from almost any 
angle.  At the end of the day, someone or some body has to make a judgment about 
how best to allocate limited resources.  Similar considerations will arise in any other 
fire  service  authority  area  in  the  country,  whether  in  rural  or  urban  communities.  
Judgments  have  to  be  made.    It  is  unlikely  that  everyone  will  agree  with  the 
judgments made.   

216.  This,  of  course,  leads  to  the  issue  of  where  the  court  can  step  in  and  demand 
reconsideration of a judgment made.  As I emphasised at the outset (see paragraph 7), 
and as I shall repeat before I conclude (see paragraph 397), the court does not replace 
such  a  judgment  with  its  own  appraisal  of  such  an  issue:  it  can  only  direct  a 
reconsideration of such a judgment if it can be shown that the process leading to it 
was unlawful and/or irrational. 

217. 

I have so far only  made passing reference to the legal parameters within which the 
court  must  operate,  but  I  do  not think  I  can  proceed  further  in  the  present  context 
without referring  briefly to some  well-established principles and some authoritative 
articulations of the relevant approach. 

218.  Mr Moffett understandably referred to Lord Diplock’s articulation of the meaning of 
“irrationality” in this context in Council of Civil Service Unions and Others v Minister 
for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374, 410: 

“By  “irrationality”  I  mean  what  can  by  now  be  succinctly 
referred to as “Wednesbury unreasonableness” …. It applies to 
a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of 
accepted  moral  standards  that  no  sensible  person  who  had 
applied  his  mind  to  the  question  to  be  decided  could  have 
arrived at it.” 

219.  He referred also to a number of passages  in the  opinions of the House of  Lords  in 
Regina  (Ahmad)  v  Newham  London  Borough  Council  [2009]  PTSR  632,  a  case 
involving  a  challenge  to  the  lawfulness  of  the  policy  by  which  a  local  authority 
allocated the social housing within its control.  In 2002, following certain legislative
--------

London Boroughs v The Mayor 

 

changes,  the  local  authority  changed  its  housing  allocation  scheme  from  a  “needs 
based” points system to a “choice based” system under which all those with priority 
need, save for a limited number of exceptional cases who were made a direct offer of 
an  appropriate  property,  were  classified  in  one  group  and  entitled  to  bid  for  any 
available housing which matched their assessed needs. The house was then allocated 
to the bidder who had been on the housing list for the longest time. The scheme also 
allowed  existing  local  authority  tenants  who  wished  to  transfer  to  a  different,  but 
equivalent,  property  within  the  area  to  bid  on  equal  terms  with  priority  needs 
applicants,  but  provided  that  a  maximum  of  5%  of  available  properties  could  be 
allocated to such  bidders  in any one  year.  The  legislative changes (to be  found  in 
section 167(2) of the Housing Act 1996) required a local authority to have a scheme 
for allocating social housing which gave reasonable preference to those with urgent 
housing needs. 

220.  Whilst the context in that case was different from that in the present case, there are 
some parallels, principally on the issue of how choices are made between competing 
approaches to the way a statutory responsibility is carried out. 

221.  Lord Scott of Foscote said this directly of the issue in the case at paragraphs 4 and 5: 

“4.  It  would  be  impossible,  in  my  opinion,  to  challenge  the 
rationality  of  including  waiting  time  as  one  of  the  factors 
properly to be taken into account by a housing authority when 
deciding  to  whom  an  available  dwelling  should  be  allocated. 
But why should waiting time be the determinative factor? Why 
should  apparently  greater  needs  of  one  person  in  the  priority 
band  be  subordinated  to  apparently  lesser  needs  of  another 
person in the band simply because the latter had been longer on 
the  waiting  list?  This  was  the  question  that  [Counsel  for  the 
Claimant’s] submission posed for your Lordships. The question 
is, I think, best answered by posing a further question. What is 
the  alternative?  The  formulation  of  sub-bands  within  the  … 
priority  band,  with  the  sub-bands  being  placed  in  order  of 
priority,  has  been  suggested  as  a  preferable  alternative.  A 
points system, with points allocated for various types of special 
need  and  priority  accorded  to  the  person  having  the  highest 
number of points, has been suggested as another. But both these 
suggested alternatives have their drawbacks.  

5.  No  matter  how  many  priority  sub-bands  were  to  be 
formulated, and the  formulations would  be  far  from easy  and 
likely  to  be  contentious,  there  must  always  be  some  basis  on 
which to distinguish  between those within the same  sub-band 
who  are  in  competition  for  the  same  dwelling.  To  allow  the 
choice to depend upon the judgment of a council official, or a 
committee  of  officials,  no  matter  how  experienced  and  well 
trained he, she or they might be, would lack transparency and 
be  likely  to  lead  to  a  plethora  of  costly  litigation  based  on 
allegations of  favouritism or discrimination. The  waiting time 
criterion  constitutes  a  basis  of  selection  that  has  the  merit  of

certainty,  the  absence  of  any  subjective  evaluation  and  that, 
therefore, avoids these drawbacks.”  

222.  Baroness Hale of Richmond made two observations upon which Mr Moffett placed 
reliance.  In relation to the argument that the policy under challenge in that case was 
irrational she said this: 

“15. … even  if the  scheme  is  not unlawful  because  it fails to 
comply  with  section  167(2),  is  it  unlawful  because  it  is 
irrational? The earlier decisions in the High Court and Court of 
Appeal  … concluded that a policy  was  irrational  if  it did  not 
contain  “a  mechanism  for  identifying  those  with  the  greatest 
need  and  ensuring  that  so  far  as  possibl",2013-12-20 00:00:00,UK High Court

Anxiang Du, you have been convicted by the jury of the murder of Jifeng 
 
“Jeff” Ding, his wife Helen Ding and their two daughters Xing aged 18 and 
 
Alice aged 12 at their house in Pioneer Close, Wootton, Northampton on 
 
29  April  2011.  By  its  verdicts  the  jury  has  rejected  your  defences  of 
 
diminished responsibility and loss of control which might otherwise have 
 
reduced this to manslaughter. What is clear from the evidence and the 
 
verdicts is that these were cold‐blooded murders which in my judgment 
 
were  premeditated  and  were  considered  acts  of  revenge  in  which  you 
 
wiped  out  the  entire  family  of  the  couple  whom  you  considered  had 
 
ruined you financially in the acrimonious civil litigation in which you and 
 
they had been engaged for more than seven years.

The catalyst for these horrific crimes was twofold. First, on 20 April 2011 
 
you  heard  that  your  petition  to  the  Supreme  Court  for  permission  to 
 
appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal upholding the legality of the 
 
sale and leaseback arrangement whereby the Dings sold their house to 
 
Paul Delaney in May 2008 had been refused. That was essentially what 
 
you  saw  as  the  end  of  the  road  for  you  in  your  attempt  to  recover 
 
damages  and  costs  from  the  Dings  in  the  civil  proceedings.  Second,  at 
 
about 10pm on 28 April 2011, you and your wife Can Chen were served at 
 
your  home  address  with  a  freezing  injunction  obtained  by  Mr  Delaney 
 
urgently  at  a  without  notice  hearing  at  the  High  Court  in  Birmingham, 
 
restraining you from disposing of your assets including your house, which 
 
you or your son were in the process of selling to your niece to avoid the 
 
enforcement  against  you  by  Mr  Delaney  of  the  costs  orders  he  had 
 
 
obtained before His Honour Judge Purle QC and the Court of Appeal.

You evidently brooded over those matters overnight, fuelling your hatred 
 
for  and  anger  towards Jeff  and  Helen  Ding  and  Paul  Delaney. Although 
 
the predicament in which the litigation had placed you had caused you to 
 
have  moderate  depression,  I  am  quite  satisfied  it  was  that  hatred  and 
 
anger and the desire for revenge they generated that motivated you to 
 
act as you did on 29 April 2011, not the moderate depression you were 
 
suffering  which  neither  caused  nor  contributed  to  your  carrying  out  of 
 
these killings. 
 

 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

On  the  morning  of  29  April  2011,  you  travelled  from  your  home  in 
 
Coventry by train to your Chinese herbal medicine shop in Birmingham, 
 
where,  so  far  as  your  wife  was  concerned,  you  were  going  to  work, 
 
notwithstanding that it was a bank holiday, because your wife wanted to 
 
watch  the  Royal  Wedding.  However,  you  only  stayed  at  the  shop  for 
 
about ten minutes. You wrote your wife a farewell note which you left 
 
inside the appointments book and picked up the kitchen knife which was 
 
the murder weapon and was in a bag at the shop. You already had your 
 
passport in your pocket. It is clear that, by the time you left the shop in 
 
Birmingham that morning at the latest, you had already formulated a plan 
 
to go to Northampton to kill the Ding family with the knife and then to 
 
flee the jurisdiction. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

You travelled by train from Birmingham to Northampton and then took a 
 
bus to Wootton. You asked the bus driver for directions to Pioneer Close 
 
and  although  he  sent  you  in  the  wrong  direction,  you  found  your  way, 
 
asking a lady in the street for the directions. It is apparent from the CCTV 
 
of  your  movements  on  the  day,  confirmed  by  their  evidence,  that  you 
 
were calm and methodical, evidently a man on a mission. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

You  arrived about  3.15pm  and  went  through  the  open garage  doors at 
 
the house into the garden then through the patio doors into the kitchen 
 
where  Jeff  Ding  was  minding  his  own  business  in  his  own  home  on  a 
 
sunny bank holiday afternoon. You launched a frenzied attack upon him 
 
with the knife, stabbing him twenty three times. During the struggle that 
 
took place he tried to defend himself, sustaining defence wounds to his 
 
arms and hands, but the main stabs were to his chest and upper body, 
 
where you as a Chinese doctor would have known the vital organs were 
 
located. Those stab wounds to his chest indeed penetrated his heart and 
 
lungs  and  were  fatal.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  this  was  savage 
 
 
butchery on your part with intent to kill. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  your  interviews  with  the  psychiatrists  who  have  examined  you,  you 
 
have maintained that you lost your self control because when you asked 
 
him for your money, he laughed at you and called you stupid and a fool. 
 
Even  if  Jeff  Ding  behaved  like  that  and  said  those  things,  which  I  very 
 
much doubt, he was in his own home and you were an uninvited intruder. 
 
If  anyone  had  the  right  to  be  incensed  it  was  him  not  you,  but  in  any

event  by  its  verdict  the  jury  has  rejected  any  defence  of  loss  of  self‐
control.  You did not lose your self‐control in killing Jeff Ding: in effect you 
 
executed the man you hated. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Having  despatched Jeff  Ding  you  then  despatched Helen  Ding who was 
 
also in the kitchen. If she was already there or came in when she heard 
 
the struggle, only you know, but even if she tried to stop you by grabbing 
 
your arm, as you suggested in your account to the psychiatrists, that was 
 
no more than a natural instinct and cannot have caused you to lose your 
 
self‐control.  The  truth  is  that  you  attacked  and  killed  her  for  the  same 
 
reason you attacked Jeff Ding, as a pre‐planned act of revenge for your 
 
predicament in the civil litigation which you blamed on the Dings and Paul 
 
Delaney.  You  stabbed  her  thirteen  times,  mainly  to  her  chest  and  left 
 
arm,  again  penetrating  her  heart  and  lungs.  There  were  no  defence 
 
injuries, so she evidently did not even have time to defend herself. Once 
 
again  you  clearly  intended  to  execute  her,  as  you  had  her  husband,  as 
 
part of your campaign of revenge that day. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Not content with the slaughter of the parents downstairs, you then went 
 
upstairs  to  the  back  bedroom  where  the  two  young  Ding  girls  were 
 
cowering. It is apparent from the fact that Nancy’s mobile made the 999 
 
call,  that  they  had  heard  what  was  happening  downstairs  and  she  was 
 
frantically trying to ring the police for help. At that moment it seems you 
 
came  into  the  room  and  within  a  short  period  of  time  you  had  also 
 
murdered  those  poor  defenceless  girls.  It  is  clear  from  their  terrible 
 
haunting  screams  on  the  999  call  that  it  was  during  that  call  that  you 
 
murdered them. You stabbed Nancy eleven times, including a stab right 
 
through the hand she was evidently holding up in a desperate attempt to 
 
shield herself from your blows. Most of the stabbing was to the chest and 
 
left hand side of her body, again wounds some of which penetrated her 
 
heart  and  lungs.  She  died  kneeling  in  the  prayer  position,  on  the  floor 
 
next to the bed. Her little sister Alice, only 12 years old was on the bed 
 
curled  up,  no  doubt  in  a  futile  attempt  to  get  away  from  you.  You 
 
grabbed her by the arm and stabbed her four times in the front right side 
 
of her chest, one of those wounds penetrating her heart and being fatal. 
 
There was no struggle. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Having executed your victims, you washed all the blood off the knife at 
 
the kitchen sink and left it on the work surface. You then drove off in the 
 
Vauxhall  Corsa  which  the  Dings  had  as  a  courtesy  car,  having  stolen 
 
money  from  the  house.  Later  that  evening  you  bought  a  map  book  of 
 
Northamptonshire  at  the  Northampton  services  at  junction  15A  of  the 
 
M1, evidently because, not content with the execution of the Ding family, 
 
you  were  going  to  hunt  for  Paul  Delaney  whom  you  also  hated  and 
 
blamed  for  your  predicament,  with  a  view  to  killing  him  as  well. 
 
Mercifully, either you could not find his house or he was not at home, so 
 
 
he escaped your continuing calculated revenge.

You then drove the car to London and abandoned it off the Edgware road. 
 
You  then  fled  the  jurisdiction  to  evade  justice,  taking  a  coach  from 
 
Victoria  Coach  Station  to  Paris,  then  proceeding  to  southern  Spain  and 
 
taking the ferry from Algeciras to Tangier. There you evaded capture until 
 
your  employer  on  the  construction  site  at  which  you  were  working 
 
recognised you from the newspaper and reported you to the police in July 
 
2012.  You  were  arrested  and  extradited  to  the  United  Kingdom  in 
 
 
February 2013 to stand your trial. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

 
   

The psychological and emotional impact of the destruction of the entire 
 
Ding  family  upon  Jifeng  and  Helen  Ding’s  parents  and  the  rest  of  their 
 
families has been truly devastating. I have read the moving victim impact 
 
statements they have provided to the court. In a very real sense you have 
 
destroyed their lives as well. At a time of their lives when they might have 
 
expected to enjoy the success of their granddaughters and nieces, both of 
 
whom were talented young people with a bright future, their lives have 
 
been senselessly cut short by your murderous attack. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment and that is the 
 
sentence  of  the  Court  upon  you.  However,  under  Section  269  and 
 
Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 I have to determine whether 
 
you should be subject to a whole life order under paragraph 4 of schedule 
 
21  or,  if  not,  the  minimum  term  you  should  serve  before  you  will  be 
 
eligible to be considered by the Parole Board for release. 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 
 

I have considered carefully and anxiously whether the sentence should be 
 
 
a  whole  life  order.  However,  ultimately,  I  have  decided  that  is  not  the 
 
 
appropriate  order  for  two  separate  reasons.  First,  although  it  could  be 
 
said with some force that the gravity of this offence is exceptionally high, 
 
given that it involved the murder of four people and was premeditated 
 
I  have  in  mind  what  Lord  Judge  CJ  said  in 
with  a  degree  of  planning, 
 
     
giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in  R v Oakes [2012] EWCA 
 
 
Crim 2435 in relation to whole life orders at [29]: “the whole life order…is 
 
reserved  for  the  few  exceptionally  serious  offences  in  which,  after 
 
reflecting on all the features of aggravation and mitigation, the judge is 
 
satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the 
 
imposition of a whole life order. If that conclusion is justified, the whole 
 
life order is appropriate: but only then. It is not a mandatory or automatic 
 
or minimum sentence”. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Having reflected on all the features of this case and without in any way 
 
underestimating its gravity, it does seem to me that this is not a case in 
 
which a whole life order is appropriate, although for reasons I will come 
 
 
to a lengthy minimum term clearly is appropriate.

Second, like Sweeney J in his recent sentencing remarks in the case of R v 
 
McLoughlin, I consider that, in the light of the judgment of the European 
 
Court of Human Rights in the case of Vinter and others on 9 July 2013, 
 
particularly  at  [122],  the  passing  of  a  whole  life  sentence  within  the 
 
current  legislative  framework,  which  gives  no  right  of  review  of  such  a 
 
sentence, is in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human 
 
Rights. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

Nevertheless,  although  a  whole  life  order  may  not  be  appropriate,  the 
 
minimum  term of  years to be  served before  you  are  eligible  for  parole 
 
must  be  a  very  long  one,  even  for  a  man  of  54.  Clearly  this  case  falls 
 
within  paragraph  5  of  Schedule  21,  since  the  seriousness  of  your 
 
offending is particularly high and involves the murder of four people, for 
 
which the starting point in determining the minimum term is 30 years. I 
   
emphasise though that is only the starting point and I have to consider 
 
what aggravating and mitigating factors there are in order to determine 
 
the appropriate minimum term. Paragraphs 10 and 11 of Schedule 21 set 
 
out some of the aggravating and mitigating factors which may be relevant 
 
to the offence of murder, but neither list is intended to be exclusive and 
 
what  may  aggravate  or  mitigate  the  offence  will  depend  upon  all  the 
 
circumstances of the particular case. 
  

 
 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

In my judgment a number of the aggravating factors set out in paragraph 
 
10  are  present  in  this  case.  First,  there  was  a  significant  degree  of 
 
planning  and  premeditation.  Clearly  you  brooded  about  the  freezing 
 
injunction overnight on 28/29 April 2011 and if not then, certainly by the 
 
time you left your shop in Birmingham at about 11.15 on the morning of 
 
29  April  2011,  you  had  formulated  a  plan  to  go  to  Northampton  to 
 
murder the Dings with the knife which you took with you to the house 
 
and then to flee the jurisdiction to evade detection. You carried out that 
 
plan  with  ruthless  efficiency.  The  second  aggravating  factor  under 
 
paragraph  10  is  that  two  of  your  victims,  Nancy  and  Alice,  were 
 
particularly vulnerable because of their age, in particular Alice who was 
 
only 12 years old. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, in addition  to  those  statutory  aggravating factors,  the  overall 
 
circumstances of these murders aggravate the gravity of your offending: 
 
the fact that they were considered acts of revenge, that they amounted 
 
to the savage execution of an entire family of innocent people and that 
 
you then went looking for a fifth victim, Mr Delaney, before fleeing the 
 
jurisdiction. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

So far  as the  mitigating factors in  paragraph  11 are  concerned,  despite 
 
the submissions on your behalf by your counsel, I am satisfied that none 
 
of those is present. You clearly intended to kill all your victims. The killings 
 
were  premeditated.  Although  you  were  suffering  from  moderate 
 
depression, in my judgment, even if that was a mental disability, on the

--------
facts of this case it did not lower your degree of culpability. Your defence 
 
of  diminished  responsibility  based  on  the  evidence  of  Professor  Nigel 
 
Eastman,  the  defence  psychiatrist,  has  been  rejected  by  the  jury  and  I 
   
accept  the  evidence  of  Dr  Philip  Joseph,  the  psychiatrist  called  by  the 
 
Crown, that whatever depression you were suffering, it was incidental to 
 
 
the murders. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
21.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

There  is  no  provocation  to  be  considered  under  paragraph  11(d).  The 
 
predicament  in  which  you  found  yourself  on  29  April  2011  arose  as  a 
 
consequence of the due process of law in the civil courts. Although it is 
 
true  that  the  Dings  had  not  complied  with  various  court  orders  in  that 
 
civil  litigation,  your  remedy  lay  in  seeking  further  assistance  from  the 
 
court. Nothing they had done or failed to do could begin to amount to 
 
 
provocation  such  as  could  mitigate  let  alone  justify  your  destruction  of 
 
 
the entire family, including two innocent girls.

horrendous nature of these killings.

Your counsel has relied upon your remorse for these killings. Since you 
 
did  not  give  evidence,  the  court  can  only  go  on  what  you  said  to  the 
 
psychiatrists  about  being  sorry  and  what  your  counsel  says  on 
 
instructions.  I  have  some  doubt  whether  you  were  showing  genuine 
 
remorse as opposed to feeling sorry for the situation in which you find 
 
yourself, but even giving you the benefit of the doubt, the gravity of your 
 
offending is so serious that even genuine remorse could only play a very 
 
limited role in mitigation. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

   
 
 

In sentencing you, I have borne in mind the fact that any minimum term 
 
of 30 years or more will mean that you will grow old, if not die, in prison. 
 
However, as Hallett LJ said in R v  Symmons [2009] EWCA Crim 1304 at 
 
[21], having reviewed the earlier authorities on the age of the defendant: 
 
“the inevitable consequence of [a man of your age committing murder] is 
 
that he is going to grow old if not die in prison. His age, therefore, cannot 
 
be determinative of the finishing point: it is but one factor to be borne in 
 
mind  as  part  of  the  sentencing  process”.  Furthermore,  as  Sweeney  J 
 
recognised  in  R  v  McLaughlin  there  will  be  cases  of  sufficient  gravity 
 
where a very long minimum term is appropriate even though an almost 
 
inevitable consequence will be that the defendant dies in prison. 
   

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In my judgment, the present is such a case. Considering the particularly 
 
serious aggravating factors I have identified and in view of the absence of 
 
any real mitigation, the appropriate minimum term is one of 40 years. 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

From that will be deducted the days you have spent in custody in relation 
 
to this offence. What this means is that the minimum amount of time you

will spend in prison from today before the Parole Board can order early 
 
release is 40 years less those days on remand. If it remains necessary for 
 
the protection of the public, you will continue to be detained after that 
 
date. If the Parole Board does decide to direct release you will remain on 
 
licence for the remainder of your life and may be recalled to prison at any 
 
time.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE WILKKIE
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MURDER ‐ Count 1 
 

 

BHAYANI 
 

 

Rakesh Bhayani you have been convicted of the murder of Carole Waugh. By its 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict of Guilty in respect of you, but not in respect of Nicholas Kutner the Jury 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has made clear its conclusion that you murdered Carole Waugh, on the night of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16/17  April  as  you,  Bhayani,  admitted  to  witness  X,  arising  out  of  an  argument 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about money but not as a necessary precursor to the fraud upon which you then 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embarked.  It  follows  that  it  was  not  premeditated  or  preplanned  and  I  cannot 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume that you had as your intention an intention to kill 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is nonetheless clear to me, on all the evidence, and I so find, that, though not 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required by your fraudulent plan, you did murder her for gain. You had, ruthlessly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  without  compunction,  targeted  her,  a  woman  who,  though  self  made, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful and independently wealthy, was a risk taker and manifestly vulnerable

--------
to  the  machinations  of  professional  con  men  such  as  you  and  your  co‐fraudster 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner. 
 

 

Money was the occasion of the argument out of which you killed her and then, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without a second thought, you and Kutner, to whom I will turn in a moment, calmly 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and comprehensively set about: stealing her identity;  using it to defraud banks and 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other institutions, within three months, of over £250,000 worth of assets; set in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

train  processes  which  would  have  realised  much  greater  rewards  for  you  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

near future, and in the course of that emptied an account specifically set up for the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  her  niece  and  tried,  as  far  as  you  could,  to  denude  her  estate  at  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expense of her family. You took steps to ensure that her body would not be found 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a sufficient time not only to give you the best chance of evading detection for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having killed her, but also, and additionally, to enable you and Kutner to embark 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon and complete, if you could, the asset stripping of her persona. You dumped 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her body in a bag in the boot of an old car, you then left it in various car parks and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latterly left her body to rot in a bag, in a car, in a lockup garage. These actions, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissive  and  disrespectful  of  the  remains  of  a  woman  who  regarded  you  as  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend demonstrated your utter greed, callousness and total lack of any regard or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect for your victim. 
 

 

 

 

 

Your  actions  in  persisting  with  your  fraud  after  killing  her  were  breathtakingly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wicked and none  the  less  so  because  you  were  almost  bound,  eventually,  to be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  as  the  perpetrator.  Your  compulsion  to  feed  your  addictions  to  risk 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking and gambling and your amorality and selfishness overwhelmed any notion 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of decency or restraint. 
 

 

 

 

 

As you know the only sentence I can pass on you for the offence of murder is one 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of life imprisonment and I do so. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

I  must  fix  a  minimum  term  before  the  expiration  of  which  you  will  not  be 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered for release on life licence. The starting point where, as here, the killing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
has been motivated for gain is 30 years. The concealment of her body in the way 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and for the purposes to which I have alluded is an aggravating feature. 
  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As I have indicated, by the verdict of the jury, I recognise that I may not regard 
 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carole  Waugh’s  death,  as  a  premeditated,  essential,  part  of  the  fraud  so  as  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require her to have been killed , but must regard it as unplanned and committed 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the spur of the moment. It nonetheless remains the case that, as I find, you did 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kill her in the course of, or in anticipation of, the fraud with which you carried on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite her death and having taken prompt steps to conceal her body to enable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you to continue to do so. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Having regard to these matters the minimum term which you must serve before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can be considered for release on licence is one of 27 years. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  will  be  deducted  from  that  term  the  number  of  days  you  have  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded in custody which will be calculated administratively. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The effect of this is that until the expiration of the minimum term from today you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will not be considered for release on licence. Even then you will only be released, if 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all, when the Parole  Board has been satisfied that it is  safe and in  the public 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest for you to be released. After any such release and for the rest of your life, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you will be on licence and liable to be recalled to prison if you were to breach any 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the terms of the licence to which you were then subject. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also have to pass sentences on you on the offences in counts 2 and 3 and I will do 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so.  These  sentences  will  run  concurrently  to  this  life  sentence.  I  have  taken 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of them into account in determining the appropriate minimum term for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this offence. 
  

 

 

PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE ‐ Count 6 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
You Rakesh Bhayani have pleaded guilty to, and you Nick Kutner have been found 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty  of,  perverting  the  course  of  justice.  On  the  evidence  I  have  heard  I  am 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied, of each of, you that you did, and/or encouraged and assisted in, each of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following: disposing of the dead body of Carole Waugh, by putting it in a bag, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchased for the purpose, removing it from her flat, depositing it in the boot of a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car, purchased for the purpose, leaving it in various car parks for about a month 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then leaving it to rot in a lock up garage in New Malden having investigated 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  possibility  of  disposing  of  her  body  at  the  site  in  the  Cotswolds  which  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visited together.. Thereafter you arranged for clearing her flat of the vast majority 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  her  personal  possessions  and  you,  Nick  Kutner,  arranged  for  the  flat  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleaned and her remaining possessions removed and dumped. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All of this, I am satisfied, you both undertook well knowing that Carole Waugh was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dead  and  that,  by  your  actions,  you  would  obstruct  and  impede  the  search  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carole Waugh and for the person who was responsible for her death. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In your case, Kutner, I am satisfied, from all of the evidence, that you were present 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the flat when Bhayani murdered Carole Waugh, though you were not a party to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  and  did  not  encourage  or  assist  in  its  commission.  Nonetheless,  you  were 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately on board with the actions taken to conceal her death, and thwart the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation into her murder, by assisting Bhayani in the removal and disposal of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her body and clearing up the flat which I have described. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Putting her body in the bag, then removing it from the flat and putting it into the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boot of the car, was a job for two people and I am satisfied you both did it. You, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner, assisted Rakesh Bhayani in doing what he could not have done on his own, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, a month or so later, you made the arrangements for the trip to the Cotswolds. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am also satisfied that you were instrumental in assisting Bhayani find the lock up 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in New Malden though you fought shy of accompanying him when he first drove 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there and then later transported the body there. Later you organised the clearing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and cleaning of the flat well knowing that she had been murdered though those 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
actions were also in part motivated by seeking quickly to realise the value of her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flat one way or another by remortgage, sale, or renting to multiple tenants. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am satisfied in both your cases that not only were you motivated by the desire to 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceal  what  Bhayani  had  done  and  to  thwart  the  investigation  of  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disappearance and murder but also, and I regard this as a substantial aggravating 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor, you were both motivated by sheer greed. So greedy were you for what the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud would bring you that you did not allow the fact that Carole Waugh had been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murdered to stand in your way. You, Kutner, were already enjoying the fruits of it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 17 April at the Hilton Hotel and on the 18 April by gambling at the casino funded 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the proceeds of the fraud, her jewellery and the gold purchased with her money 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held by the bank. Thereafter you took the steps I have described to enable you to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  plunder  her  estate  with  impunity  for  a  number  of  months,  thereby 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gaining  for  yourselves  several  months  of  spending  her  money  on  what  you,  no 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt, regarded as the high life. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  offence,  which  you  knew  you  were  covering  up,  and  were  obstructing  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation of, was murder. Your course of conduct was not only persistent, over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  period  of  months,  and  comprehensive  but  it  went  to  the  heart  of  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation. The effect of moving and abandoning the body meant that, by the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  it  was  found,  it  was  in  such  a  state  of  decomposition  that  the  forensic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pathologist  was  unable  to  say  with  certainty  what  the  mechanism  of  death  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been and vital clues as to who the murderer might have been were irretrievably 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lost. Your wholesale removal and destruction of her possessions similarly robbed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the investigators into her murder of a potential source of important evidence. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a result, I have no doubt, of what you did, the investigation into her death was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so delayed and hampered that there was a risk, happily not realised, that no one 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  convicted  of  her  murder.  In  any  event,  your  actions  caused  Carole’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family to suffer the agonies of not knowing what had happened to her for several 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months which have been so eloquently described by Christopher Waugh, Carole’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother, in his statement to this court. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
As between the two of you, I find that you, Bhayani, took the lead and had the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater motive, namely to cover up your murder of Carole Waugh. You organised 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purchase of the bag, purchased the car, stored it in car parks and drove the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body to its temporary resting place in New Malden. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However you, Kutner, assisted and encouraged all this in order to ensure that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flow of gold from plundering Carole Waugh’s estate would not stop until it was all 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone and played a part, not far short in culpability, to that of Bhayani. No wonder 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could not sleep, showed signs of strain and, eventually, you, effectively, blew it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all by your multiple renting scam which was bound to be discovered. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Having regard to the authorities to which I have been helpfully referred, but taking 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account, in both your cases, of the aggravating features to which I have referred, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dismissive  and  disrespectful  way  you  dealt  with  her  body  over  a  period  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months and the additional motivation of greed which drove you both, the sentence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon you Rakesh Bhayani for this offence would, had you contested it, have been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of 9 years imprisonment. In light of your timely plea of guilty I sentence you to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 years 
 
 

 

To reflect your slightly lesser role and the fact that it was not you who was the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murderer whose crime you were covering up, but also to reflect the fact that you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were convicted after a trial, I sentence you Nick Kutner to 7 years imprisonment for 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this offence. 
   

 

 

CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD ‐ Count 2 
 

 

 

 

BHAYANI AND KUTNER 
 

 

 

 

 

 

You have both pleaded guilty to this offence. In your case Nick Kutner on the basis 
 
that  you  only  became  involved  from  the  16th  May  long  after  Carole  Waugh  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been killed. 
 

 

 

 

6
--------
I reject that contention. I am satisfied that you were involved in the fraud from the 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment it swung into action. You were spending the fruits of the fraud as early as 
 
the 17th April when you stayed in the Hilton Hotel, whereas previously you had no 
 
money  to speak  of.  You  were  gambling  on  the  18th  April  with  a  stake  far  above 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  had  previously  been  your  norm.  In  both  these  instances  the  irresistible 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference is that you were using money obtained from the fraud, from your sale of 
 
jewellery on the 17th and the sale of gold obtained in the fraud on the 18th. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I find that you, Bhayani, were the instigator and chief organiser of the fraud but 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  Kutner,  were  intimately  involved  as  confidant  and  adviser.  The  extent  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which each of you substantially benefited financially from the fraud as evidenced 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by your pattern of spending on hotels, casinos and escorts reflects the leading role 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of each of you. 
 

 

 

 

 

I emphasise that, in determining the appropriate sentence for each of you on this 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy, I leave out of account the fact that you well knew that the victim was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dead.  That  aspect  of  the  matter  is  reflected  in  the  sentence  I  have  passed  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect of perverting the course of justice. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  was  a  complex,  serious,  fraud  committed  over  a  period  of  months  in  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated  way  involving  a  number  of  individuals  playing  various  roles  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orchestrated carefully. As a result the identity of Carole Waugh was taken over and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripped  of  all  her  assets  in  a  number  of  different  ways  as  well  as  saddling  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identity with new debts from new sources of credit and, for the vast majority of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time. 
 

 

 

The goal of the fraud was to realise all of her assets, including her flat which was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth £650,000. The total potentially realisable was estimated by you Bhayani as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the order of a million pounds. Whilst that is, in my judgment, an exaggeration, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but for Kutner’s act of greed, or desperation, in letting her flat to two tenants at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  time,  a  sum  well  in  excess  of  half  a  million  pounds  might  have  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realised. As the crown points out, however, it is an aggravating feature that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7
--------
intended  subject  of  the  fraud  was  no  less  than  the  entirety  of  Carole  Waugh’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worldly goods including the provisions she had made for her niece. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have regard to the sentencing guideline applicable to banking and insurance fraud 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  which  I  have  been  referred,  as  well  as  to  the  fact  that  each  of  you  has  an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appalling record for offences of dishonesty the majority of which are for offences 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of fraud 
 

 

 

Bearing in mind all these matters but also bearing in mind, particularly in your case 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner, the principle of totality, in my judgment the appropriate sentence for you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bhayani after a trial would have been one of  9 years imprisonment and for you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner 7 years imprisonment. 
  

 

 

 

 

Bhayani, you are entitled to full credit for your plea of guilty, the sentence I pass is 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 years which will run concurrently to the sentence for perverting the course of 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice and to the life sentence which I have passed. In you case Kutner, your plea 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  guilty  was  on  a  specific  and  limited  basis  which  I  have,  after  hearing  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence in this trial, rejected. You are not therefore entitled to full credit for a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea of guilty, though you are entitled to some credit. As a result I sentence you to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  years  imprisonment  for  the  conspiracy  to  defraud.  That  sentence  will  run 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutively to the sentence of 7 years for perverting the course of justice. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also have to sentence you Kutner for the three specific offences of fraud to which 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have pleaded guilty in respect of the prospective sale of Flat 6 (count 3) and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the renting of that flat to two different tenants who paid you respectively £3,900 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and £7,000. (counts 4 and 5). 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

In respect of each of these you are entitled to full credit for your pleas of guilty.  I 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply the guidelines in respect of confidence fraud. For the fraud in respect of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prospective sale of the flat the stating point after a trial is 5 years, the sentence I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass is 40 months count 3. For the other two frauds, for each of them the starting 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point after a trial is 2 years, the sentence I pass is 16 months counts 4 and 5. Each 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------

Sanders v SST 
 

 

Mrs Justice Patterson : 

Introduction 
 

Peter  Sanders  and  Brian  Ross  are  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  Stop 
Stansted  Expansion  (“SSE”).  They  seek  to  challenge  decisions  on  the  part  of  the 
 
Airport Commission (“AC”) and the Secretary of State for Transport (“Secretary of 
State”) which relate to a time when Mr Geoff Muirhead CBE (Mr Muirhead) was a 
Commissioner with the AC.  

The claimants seek a declaration that the sift criteria adopted by the AC for use in 
assessing  proposals  for  long  term  capacity  at  UK  airports  are  infected  by  apparent 
bias,  an  order  quashing  the  sift  criteria  and  an  order  prohibiting  the  AC  from 
publishing its “short list” of proposals until such time as (i) the sift criteria have been 
re-determined,  (ii)  further  appointments  have  been  made  to  the  expert  panel  in  the 
light of the re-determined sift criteria; and (iii) the re-determined criteria have been 
used to produce the short list. 

On the 23rd October 2013 Mr Justice Ouseley ordered that the application was to be 
listed in court as a “rolled up hearing”, on notice to the defendants, for one day on the 
22nd  November  2013.  As  part  of  the  listing  directions  the  parties  were  ordered  to 
 
agree  a  timetable  enabling  oral  submissions  to  be  concluded  within  the  day  of  the 
 
hearing. It was noted also that the case had been put in at short notice because of the 
urgency. 

 
The urgency is because the Airports Commission has been set up by the Secretary of 
State under terms of reference which require it to publish an interim report by the end 
of 2013. As the report has been directly commissioned by government the latest day 
for  publication  is  the  18th  December  2013  as  the  House  of  Commons  rises  the 
following  day  and  it  is  inappropriate  to  publish  a  directly  commissioned  report  in 
parliamentary recess.  

The  Airports  Commission  has  been  given  the  task  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to 
examine the “scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain 
the  UK’s  position  as  Europe’s  most  important  aviation  hub.  It  is  to  identify  and 
 
evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and 
long term.” It is to report “no later than the end of 2013 on: 

Its assessment of the evidence on the nature, scale and timing of the steps needed to 
maintain the UK’s global hub status; and 

Its  recommendations  for  immediate  actions  to  improve  the  use  of  existing  runway 
capacity in the next five years – consistent with credible long term options.

The  assessment  and  recommendations  in  the  Commission’s  Interim  Report  should  be 
underpinned by a detailed review of the evidence in relation to the current forecast in the 
UK with regard to aviation demand and connectivity, forecasts for how these are likely to 
develop, and the expected future pattern of the UK’s requirements for international and 
domestic connectivity.”  

 
6.	 

A final report is to be published no later than the summer of 2015 on, 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

An assessment of the options for meeting the UK’s international connectivity 
needs, including their economic, social and environmental impact; 

Its recommendations for the optimum approach to meeting any needs; 

Its  recommendations  for  ensuring  the  need  is  met  as  expeditiously  as 
practicable within the required timescale; 
 

As part of the final report the AC is to provide materials based on a detailed 
analysis  which  will  be  contained  within  the  report  which  will  support  the 
government  in  preparing  a  National  Policy  Statement  to  accelerate  the 
resolution of any future planning applications for major airports infrastructure.  

The Commission was established on the 7th September 2012 under the chairmanship 
of Sir Howard Davies, former deputy governor of the Bank of England and director of 
the  London  School  of  Economics.  The  other  members  of  the  Commission  were 
 
announced  on  the  2nd  November  2012.  They  were  Sir  John  Armitt  CBE,  Professor 
Ricky Burdett, Vivienne Cox, Professor Dame Julia King and Geoff Muirhead CBE.  

In outline the claimants assert that the role of Mr Muirhead as a Commissioner tainted 
 
the activities and decisions of the AC by reason of apparent bias because of his links 
 
with Manchester Airports Group (MAG). 

In  fact,  Mr  Muirhead  stepped  down  from  his  role  as  a  Commissioner  on  the  20th 
 
September 2013. He has not been involved with the Commission since that date. It is 
said  by  the  defendants  that  the  reason  for  Mr  Muirhead  stepping  down  was  as  a 
 
precautionary  measure  as  there  was  a  risk  that  his  continued  involvement  on  the 
 
Commission  might  give  rise  to  an  appearance  of  bias.  That  is  because  his  former 
 
employers,  MAG,  submitted  a  proposal  concerning  the  long  term  expansion  of 
Stansted Airport which MAG had acquired on the 28th February 2013. 

 
7.	 

 
8.	 

 
9.	 

 
10.	 

The defendants’ case is that with Mr Muirhead stepping down the claimants achieved 
 
their  main  objective.  The  attempt  to  impugn  the  Commission’s  sift  criteria  which 
were adopted on the 3rd May 2013 is misconceived and is out of time.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 
11.	 

The claimants maintain that their claim is perfectly valid because of the retrospective 
 
operative effect of the apparent bias of Mr Muirhead. They did not know that he had 
participated in the determination of the sift criteria until the AC responded to its pre-
action protocol letter on the 20th September 2013. The claimants had asked the AC to 
look afresh at the sift criteria if it transpired that Mr Muirhead had been involved in 
their determination and likewise had asked the Secretary of State, as the sponsoring 
department,  to  require  the  Commission  to  do  so.    Both  have  refused.  If  the  court 
 
considers  the  more  appropriate  target  for  the  judicial  review  is  against  the  original 
 
decision  to  adopt  the  sift  criteria  then  the  claimants  ask  for  an  extension  of  time 
within which to do so. For reasons set out they lacked the necessary knowledge to 
bring such a challenge until receipt of the responses to the letters before claim. 
  

Factual background 
 

SSE  was  established  in  2002  in  response  to  the  government’s  consultation  on 
expanding  UK  airports  and,  in  particular,  to  address  the  threat  posed  by  expansion 
plans  for  Stansted  Airport.  Its  objective  is  to  contain  the  development  of  Stansted 
Airport within tight limits that are truly sustainable and, in that way, to protect the 
quality of life for residents over wide areas of Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire 
and  Suffolk,  to  preserve  the  heritage  of  the  area  and  to  protect  the  natural 
environment.  

The claimants are long standing and key members of SSE’s executive committee: Mr 
 
Sanders  is  chairman,  a  post  he  has  held  since  July  2004  and  Mr  Ross  is  SSE’s 
economic advisor, a position he has held since 2003.  

As set out the Commission is an advisory body set up by the Secretary of State for 
Transport  to  advise  the  government  on  the  need  for  additional  UK  airport  capacity 
and to provide recommendations based on an objective appraisal of the evidence. Its 
role is limited to that of an advisor based on the findings of its reports.  

The Department for Transport is the sponsoring department for the Commission and 
responsible for its creation and findings. It was the Secretary of State who appointed 
Sir Howard Davies as chair along with the other five Commissioners. The Secretary 
of State has not committed to be bound by the conclusions of the Commission but has 
 
said that he will take its conclusions into account. 

From 1994 until the 1st October 2010 Mr Muirhead was chief executive of MAG. He 
is  a  qualified  civil  and  structural  engineer  with  in  depth  experience  of  airports 
operations and management. He had worked at MAG from 1988.  

From his retirement from MAG until January 2013 Mr Muirhead was in receipt of 
consultancy fees from MAG. First, he had an arrangement whereby for a period of 
two years until the 1st October 2012 for the provision of consultancy services he was 
paid an annual sum of £75,000. In fact, he was not asked to provide any such services.

Second, he had an arrangement for a period of three years (until October 2013) during 
which he agreed to be nominated by MAG to be a member of, or to provide advice to, 
a number of regional and industry bodies. His responsibilities included membership of 
the  North-West  Business  Leadership  team  which  mainly  involved  promoting 
economic  investment  in  North-West  of  England,  acting  as  a  special  advisor  to  the 
Airports  Council  International  (ACI)  world  board  and  European  board,  which 
involved providing advice on international and European aviation legislation and as 
Chair of the North West Campaign for Rail which lobbied for rail investment across 
 
the north west England. The North West Business Leadership team nominated him to 
be a non-executive director on the board of the Atlantic Gateway project which is a 
body  promoting  various  investment  schemes  linking  the  ports  of  Liverpool  and 
Manchester. He continues with that work on a pro bono basis as chair of that project. 
For the second arrangement Mr Muirhead was paid an annual sum of £75,000. That 
arrangement terminated in January 2013 because his work with ACI, the North West 
Rail Campaign and the North West Business Leadership team had ended. None of the 
bodies  were  related  to  MAG’s  core  business  and  none  involved  access  to  any 
information  about  MAG’s  core  business.  No  contribution  is  made  by  MAG  to  the 
Atlantic Gateway project. 

 

18.	  Mr Muirhead was one of six members of the Commission. Commissioners were not 
appointed as specific experts in their field; it was expected that they would be able to 
contribute  broadly  to  discussions  across  a  full  range  of  issues  under  consideration. 
Whilst Mr Muirhead was the main Commissioner with significant aviation experience 
other Commissioners had some related experience.  

On  the  19th  of  November  2012  the  Commissioners  held  their  first  formal  meeting. 
Amongst other things they considered a draft guidance document which included a 
list of factors for assessing long term options.  

On  the  18th  December  2012  the  second  Commission  meeting  was  held  at  which  a 
second draft of the factors to be contained within the draft guidance document was 
considered. Under the factor headed “Local Environmental Impact” it is noted that, 
“proposals may also wish to highlight any other local environmental impacts such as 
implications for heritage buildings and towns, protected sites, bio-diversity and flood 
protection.” 

In January 2013 Mr Muirhead received the final payment under the second part of his 
consultancy agreement. 

On the 18th January 2013 MAG announced it had been successful in its bid to acquire 
Stansted Airport. The acquisition took effect on 28th February 2013. 

On the 1st February 2013 the Commission published Guidance Document 01 which 
set  out  key  dates  for  work  on  short,  medium  and  long  term  measures.  It  explained 
how  a  key  part  of  the  work  over  the  coming  months  would  be  to  develop  in  more 
detail the specific criteria to be used in identifying those options which merit more

detailed consideration. More was to be said once the AC had had an opportunity to 
consider  the  Government’s  final  Aviation  Policy  Framework.  At  that  time  the 
 
Commission  identified  “six  broad  categories  of  factors  which  we  would  encourage 
scheme  promoters  to  consider  in  developing  their  (long  term)  proposals.”  Those 
factors were, 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

economic factors; 

social factors; 

 
iii)	 

climate change impacts; 

 
iv)	 

local environmental factors; 

 
v)	 

accessibility;  

 
vi)	 

feasibility considerations.

The  Commission  invited  responses  to  proposed  sifting  criteria  by  the  15th  March 
2013. Proposals for providing additional airport capacity in the longer term required 
confidential expressions of intent to be submitted to the Commission by 28th February 
2013.  Outline  proposals  were  to  be  submitted  to  the  Commission  by  the  19th  July 
 
2013. 

On  the  4th  February  2013  in  light  of  the  announcement  that  MAG  was  to  acquire 
 
Stansted Airport SSE wrote to Sir Howard Davies copying the same to the Secretary 
 
of State expressing SSE’s concern about apparent bias in the light of Mr Muirhead’s 
position and stating that it was unclear when Mr Muirhead ceased to be employed by 
MAG. By that time Mr Ross had discovered, through his examination of the MAG 
annual accounts, about the consultancy agreement between Mr Muirhead and MAG.  

On  the  5th  February  2013  Mr  Muirhead  attended  a  Commission  meeting  and 
participated in the Commission’s consideration of the sift criteria.  

On the 20th February 2013 the claimants attended a briefing seminar with Mr Graham, 
 
head of the Commission’s Secretariat. At the end of the seminar Mr Sanders raised 
with  Mr  Graham  his  concerns  about  Mr  Muirhead  and  apparent  bias.  Mr  Graham 
confirmed that the earlier letter had been received and defended Mr Muirhead’s role 
on the Commission  

 
28. 

On  the  26th  February  2013  the  Commission  received  MAG’s  expression  of  intent. 
 
That was reported to the Commissioners on the 13th March 2013. The expression of
--------

Sanders v SST 
 

 

intent  was  vague  but  indicated  that  MAG  intended  to  submit  proposals  on  airport 
capacity  needs  and  options  to  the  Commission  in  accordance  with  its  timetable.  It 
recognised that, in the longer term, additional capacity will be required in the South 
East and looked forward to the Commission’s view on long term demand for aviation. 
It  intended  to  look  closely  at  how  its  airports  and,  in  particular,  Manchester  and 
Stansted could help to meet increasing aviation demand. MAG said it would be in a 
position  by  the  second  deadline  date  of  the  19th  July  to  make  a  more  substantive 
 
submission to the Commission.  

On  the  13th  March  2013  a  Commission  meeting  was  held  which  Mr  Muirhead 
attended. Commissioners were informed of expressions of intent via a summary paper 
including a narrative and table. Four other confidential expressions of intent had been 
received for expansion of Stansted, two of which proposed that it be made into a four 
runway hub airport. The meeting also considered a paper on the sift criteria which had 
been expanded to include an additional factor entitled “Strategic Fit”. The two criteria 
of  climate  change  and  local  environmental  impacts  were  amalgamated  under  one 
 
heading of “environment”. It was agreed that the criteria would be considered further 
at the next meeting. 

On  the  14th  March  SSE  wrote  again  to  Sir  Howard  Davies  reiterating  its  concerns 
about apparent bias, now heightened by the fact that MAG was the owner of Stansted 
Airport. It had not received a reply to its initial letter on the topic dated 4th February 
2013. A reply was subsequently received by way of a letter dated the 25th February 
but posted on the 11th March. 

On the 15th March 2013 SSE submitted a detailed consultation response on the criteria 
to  be  used  by  the  AC  for  assessing  long  term  options.  The  response  dealt  with  the 
sifting process and indicated that the intention to narrow down all the options in one 
 
step to a short list by the end of 2013 was ambitious and challenging. The short listed 
options would then need to be subjected to a far more detailed assessment including a 
Sustainability  Appraisal  and  Strategic  Environmental  Assessment  before  any  final 
recommendations are made. On the criteria to be used it emphasised the importance of 
taking  fully  into  account  the  landscape  and  cultural  heritage  impact  of  any  airport 
 
development  proposal.  It  stated  also  that  an  assessment  of  market  demand  at  the 
different  airport  sites  where  major  expansion  was  proposed  was  a  logical  starting 
point of the Commission’s work.  

 

On  the  19th  March  2013  SSE  sent  a  further  letter  expressing  its  concern  about 
apparent bias on the part of Mr Muirhead. 

On the 25th March 2013 the Commission met to consider the sift criteria in light of the 
public responses that had been received. Eight draft sift criteria were proposed and 
 
approved (adding accessibility to the earlier seven criteria).

On the 17th April 2013 Sir Howard Davies met with the new chief executive of MAG, 
Charlie Cornish. The notes record that MAG was still reviewing its position but that it

expected to provide input on traffic growth, the role of regional airports, the views on 
second runway and hub options of Stansted and options for funding.

On the 30th April 2013 the Commission met. Although not minuted it is likely that Sir 
Howard Davies reported to the Commission on his meeting with Mr Cornish. There 
was  no  time  to  comment  on  the  draft  sift  criteria  document.  Commissioners  were, 
therefore, invited to provide comments by email subsequently. Mr Muirhead did not 
but  Professor  Ricky  Burdett  and  Professor  Julia  King  communicated  further 
comments. 

 

On  the  3rd  of  May  2013  the  Commission  published  its  sift  criteria  with  the  eight 
 
criteria  that  had  been  approved.  Environment  was  expressed  to  include  air  quality, 
 
noise, designated sites, climate change and other environmental impacts. Those were 
 
described as follows, 

“Where  proposals  may  have  other  significant  environmental 
impacts beyond those outlined above, these should be identified 
and documented. This might include, for example, impacts on 
landscape  and/or  townscape,  water  availability  and  flooding, 
bio-diversity or historical and archaeological sites…” 

On  the  same  day  the  Commission  issued  a  press  release  announcing  a  new  expert 
panel to support the Commission in their assessment of options for expansion. They 
were  appointed  to  bring  a  wide  range  of  skills  and  experience  and  to  ensure  the 
Commission  had  access  to  a  broad  spectrum  of  quality  scientific  and  technical 
expertise as the work progressed. Some 13 experts were listed. None were described 
as having expertise on matters of landscape, countryside or cultural heritage.

On the 8th May 2013 Sir Howard Davies wrote to SSE in response to their concerns 
about  apparent  bias  on  the  part  of  Mr  Muirhead  indicating  that  there  was  nothing 
improper about Mr Muirhead’s involvement with the Commission.  

 
39.	 

On the 17th May 2013 SSE wrote again to the AC, copied to the Secretary of State as 
they had done before. The letter said, 

“I am very surprised that Mr Muirhead was still employed by 
MAG  until  January  this  year.  This  is  quite  contrary  to  the 
impression  given  to  Mr  Ross  on  the  2nd  November  last  year 
when he said he had retired from MAG two years ago. 

I note your conviction that there is nothing improper about Mr 
Muirhead’s involvement with the Airports Commission. I beg 
to differ. In any court proceedings however the test would be 
not  your  view  or  mine,  but  what  view  a  fair  minded  and 
informed observer would take.

Sanders v SST 
 

 

As yet, however, it may be that the question of operative effect 
has  not  arisen  -  whether  or  not  Mr  Muirhead’s  participation 
could  influence  your  Commission’s  deliberations  in  favour  of 
MAG.  We  are  aware  that  you  have  invited  those  with  an 
interest in developing proposals for airport expansion to submit 
expressions  of  intent  by  the  28th  February  2013  and  outline 
proposals by the 19th July 2013. We are also aware that you do 
not intend to publish the expressions of intent but that you do 
intend  to  publish  the  outline  submissions.  We  are  therefore 
reserving  judgment  on  the  question  of  apparent  bias  until  the 
outline  submissions  are  published.  When  we  have  an 
opportunity to review these we shall be better placed to form a 
 
view on whether it is appropriate and proper for Mr Muirhead 
to continue as a member of your Commission. I shall write to 
you again at that stage. 

Finally,  I  have  to  express  dismay  that  the  Commission’s  sift 
criteria relegate the impacts of landscape and cultural heritage 
 
to  the  final  residuary  line  of  the  environmental  section  i.e. 
other.  Are  there  other  significant  local  environmental  impacts 
 
which should be taken into account? 

Whenever the government has allowed an independent voice to 
be  heard  in  the  past…  the  conclusion  reached  has  been  that 
there should be no development at Stansted beyond the existing 
single  runway.  And  on  the  most  recent  occasion  when  the 
question was considered and rejected by Inspector Sir Graham 
Eyre  in  the  airports  enquiry  1981-1983  (reporting  1984)  he 
 
made  it  very  clear  that  the  special  character  of  the  local 
landscape  and  cultural  heritage  was  a  critical  factor  in  his 
 
decision.” 

 
40.	 

On the 29th May 2013 Sir Howard Davies replied to SSE. In relation to the sift criteria 
he said, 

“I can assure you that, as for all criteria in the decision making 
process,  local  environmental  impacts  will  be  given  full 
consideration in the course of our work.” 

In  relation  to  Mr  Muirhead  he  repeated  that  there  was  no  impropriety  involved 
 
through  Mr  Muirhead’s  role  with  the  Commission  but  advised  that  it  was  the 
 
Department  for  Transport  which  had  selected  and  recruited  Commissioners  and  if 
SSE wished to pursue the matter they should address their concerns directly to that 
Department.  

 
41.	 

On  the  12th  of  June  2013  SSE  wrote  to  Rosie  Snashall,  at  the  Department  for 
Transport, who Sir Howard Davies had suggested they communicate with referring 
her to previous correspondence.

On the 4th July 2013 the Commission published a discussion paper on aviation noise. 
That included their own analysis and contained the information that almost 50 times 
more  people  were  affected  by  aircraft  noise  at  Heathrow  per  passenger  than  at 
Stansted. 

 

On the 9th July 2013 at a Commission meeting a template was reviewed that was to be 
 
used to allow an equitable assessment against the sift criteria. The timetable proposed 
was for a first sift in September, a second sift in October and then agreement of the 
 
final list of options for the interim report in November. 

By the 19th July more than 50 proposals for long term options for new airport capacity 
had  been  received  by  the  Commission.  One  was  from  MAG  entitled  Capacity  for 
Growth. 

On the 26th July 2013 SSE wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport, copied to Sir 
Howard  Davies,  referring  to  the  MAG  submission  saying  that  the  apparent  bias 
previously brought to the attention of both the Commission and the Secretary of State 
had clearly now had an operative effect. The letter continued,  

“In  the  circumstances  we  consider  it  unacceptable  for  Mr 
Muirhead to continue to serve on the Airports Commission and 
the  longer  he  continues  to  serve,  the  more  the  process  risks 
being  tainted.  Mr  Muirhead  is  bound  to  have  significant 
influence within the Commission since he is the only member 
with  first  hand  knowledge  and  experience  of  the  aviation 
industry,  having  spent  24  years  with  MAG.  Moreover  as  its 
Chief  Executive,  he  led  MAGs  expansion  policy  and  the 
construction of the second runway and terminal at Manchester 
Airport. In the light of MAGs submission to the Commission 
on the 19th July, we regard it as imperative that Mr Muirhead 
 
steps down from the Commission forthwith. Failing this, and in 
the absence of any satisfactory commitment from you within 14 
days, we will take further legal advice with a view to initiating 
 
legal  proceedings  to  challenge  Mr  Muirhead’s  role  on  the 
Commission.” 

On the 7th August all of the long term options that had been received were published 
by the Commission with an invitation to the public to submit their views on them by 
 
the  27th  September  2013.  More  than  250  responses  were  received  by  that  date 
including one from SSE.  

On the 19th August the claimants sent pre-action protocol letters to the Commission 
and the Secretary of State. The letters stated that Mr Muirhead’s continued presence 
on  the  Airports  Commission  fatally  tainted  its  proceedings,  as  a  matter  of  law,  by 
reason of operative apparent bias. It sought;

“1. To require that Mr Muirhead ceases to have any role in the 
 
Airports Commission forthwith. 

2.  If  it  transpires  that  Mr  Muirhead  was  involved  in  the 
determination of the “sift criteria for long term capacity options 
UK  Airports”  to  require  the  Airports  Commission  to  look 
afresh at the said sift criteria upon Mr Muirhead’s ceasing to be 
a member of the Airports Commission.  

3. To require the Airports Commission’s “short list”, at present 
due to be published in December 2013 not to be published until 
it has been looked at afresh upon Mr Muirhead ceasing to be a 
member of the Airports Commission.” 

 
48.	 

On the 4th September 2013 the Commission met. The Chair updated the meeting on 
the  threat  of  judicial  review  to  the  membership  of  the  Commission.  Mr  Muirhead 
agreed to withdraw from those parts of the meeting which were to deal with the  

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

Surface Access Investments;  

The fiscal incentives to redistribute services between airports. 
  

This  was  because  both  of  these,  if  implemented,  could  have  specific  benefits  for 
Airports  owned  by  MAG.  The  Secretariat  and  the  Chair  did  not  consider  it  was 
necessary for Mr Muirhead to withdraw from the meeting’s discussion of long term 
options for new runways and airports, as the agenda focused only on removing the 
least credible options from consideration. In addition, as with the short term options, 
any  decisions  taken  would  be  provisional  and  would  need  to  be  re-confirmed 
 
following the end of the ongoing consultation period on 27th September.  

 
49.	 

The Commission provisionally agreed to sift out 23 proposals on the basis that they 
had significant flaws or were inconsistent with the Commission’s remit or there was 
 
another equivalent proposal which was more fully developed. It provisionally agreed 
to  remove  ten  surface  access  proposals  from  further  consideration  and  to  develop 
templates for a do nothing option and a maximum use of existing capacity option as 
comparative  to  the  aviation  based  options  under  consideration.  The  provisional 
 
conclusions were to be reviewed by the Commission at the October meeting in the 
light of any relevant submissions received through the ongoing consultation process 
on long term options.

On the 20th September 2013 the AC announced that Mr Muirhead had stepped down 
from the Commission by mutual consent with the Secretary of State. The press release

51.	 

On  the  same  day  the  Commission  responded  to  the  pre-action  protocol  letter.  That 
confirmed  that  Mr  Muirhead  had  stepped  down  with  immediate  affect.  The  letter 
continued, 

 

the  Commission  were  aware,  and 

“Mr  Muirhead  and  the  Secretary  of  State  for  Transport  have 
decided  by  mutual  consent  that  on  a  precautionary  basis,  and 
without any acceptance whatsoever of any bias towards MAG’s 
proposals,  the  prudent  course  is  for  him  not  to  continue  as  a 
Commissioner. …we do not consider that there can have been 
any operative bias prior to Stansted Expansion Proposals being 
under consideration by the Commission and accordingly, there 
is no need for the Commission to take any retrospective action 
 
in  respect  of  its  process  to  date.  ….  Mr  Muirhead  had  no 
involvement with MAG’s bidding process for Stansted Airport 
and was not aware of this until it was announced in the press. 
He  did  not  seek  advice  regarding  a  conflict  of  interest  at  this 
 
time  as  far  as 
the 
Commission does not consider that there was any such conflict. 
 
Manchester  Airport  Group  sent  an  expression  of  intent  to 
submit to the Commission on the 27th September 2013, but this 
was not specific as to the expected content of its submission. 
Mr  Muirhead  was  not  aware  of  what,  if  any,  proposals  for 
expansion  MAG  would  make  in  relation  to  Stansted  Airport 
until  its  submission  was  received  by  the  Commission  on  19th 
 
July 2013. …the sift criteria were agreed by the Commission as 
a  whole  in  the  course  of  the  Commission  meetings.  In  this 
regard, it is to be noted that these are generic objective criteria. 
Moreover, “local environmental considerations” are one of the 
environmental  criteria  which  the  Commission  will  be  using. 
 
The allegation is that these have somehow been “relegated” is 
not accepted; this criterion will be given appropriate weight in 
the decision making process according to its relevance in any 
given proposal… regarding the process of sifting the proposals 
received by the Airports Commission, the only discussion that 
has  so  far  been  undertaken  by  Commissioners  in  this  regard 
was  on  Wednesday  4th  September  2013.  This  preliminary 
discussion  has  focused  only  on  identifying  on  a  provisional 
basis options which are fundamentally unworkable, duplicatory 
or  outside  the  Commission’s  remit.  Mr  Muirhead  participated

in  this  sift.  Given  the  nature  of  the  initial  sift  it  was  not 
considered that it was necessary for Mr Muirhead to withdraw 
even  on  a  precautionary  basis.  No  substantive  discussion  of 
MAGs proposals at Stansted Airport took place at that meeting. 
The provisional sift results from the September meeting will be 
 
reviewed by the Commission in due course in the light of any 
relevant evidence submitted through the Commissions current 
consultation process.”

On the 26th September 2013 the Secretary of State for Transport sent his response to 
the claimants’ letter before claim. 
  

On  the  27th  September  2013  the  time  for  responding  on  the  long  terms  options 
expired.  SSE  provided  a  detailed  response  by  reference  to  the  sift  criteria  and 
including  comments  on  market  demand  and  commercial  viability,  landscape  and 
heritage impacts and historical and listed buildings. 

On  the  7th  October  2013  Sir  Howard  Davies  gave  a  speech  setting  out  the 
Commission’s provisional conclusion that some net additional runway capacity will 
 
be needed in the south east of England in the coming decades.

On the 10th October 2013 the Commission met to consider the second provisional sift 
 
of long term proposals following the closure of public consultation.

Legal framework 

 
57.	 

There is little dispute between the parties as to the correct legal approach.  

 

 
58.	 

The law on apparent bias has recently been summarised by the Court of Appeal in 
BAA Limited v Competition Commission (2010) EWCA Civ 1097 where Maurice Kay 
LJ said: 

“10. There is no dispute as to the relevant legal principles. In 
Porter v Magill [2002]UKHL 67, [2002] 2AC 357, Lord Hope 
 
expressed the objective test as follows (at paragraph 103):  

""Whether  the  fair-minded  and  informed  observer,  having 
considered  the  facts,  would  conclude  that  there  was  a  real 
possibility that the tribunal was biased."" 

11.  In  Helow  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department 
[2008] 1 WLR 2416, Lord Hope returned to the attributes of the
--------

Sanders v SST 
 

fair-minded and informed observer. He said (at paragraphs 2 to 
3): 

""The  observer  who  is  fair-minded  is  the  sort  of  person  who 
always reserves judgment on every point until she has seen and 
fully understood both sides of the argument. She is not unduly 
sensitive  or  suspicious,  as  Kirby  J  observed  in  Johnson  v 
Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488, 509, para 53. Her approach must 
not  be  confused  with  that  of  the  person  who  has  brought  the 
complaint.  The  'real  possibility'  test  ensures  that  there  is  this 
measure  of  detachment.  The  assumptions  that  the  complainer 
makes are not to be attributed to the observer unless they can be 
justified  objectively.  But  she  is  not  complacent  either.  She 
knows that fairness requires that a judge must be, and must be 
seen to be, unbiased. She knows that judges, like anybody else, 
have their weaknesses. She will not shrink from the conclusion, 
if it can be justified objectively, that things that they have said 
or  done  or  associations  that  they  have  formed  may  make  it 
difficult for them to judge the case before them impartially. 

Then  there  is  the  attribute  that  the  observer  is  'informed'.  It 
makes the point that, before she takes a balanced approach to 
any information she is given, she will take the trouble to inform 
herself on all matters that are relevant. She is the sort of person 
who takes the trouble to read the text of an article as well as the 
 
headlines. She is able to put whatever she has read or seen into 
its overall social, political or geographical context. She is fair-
minded,  so  she  will  appreciate  that  the  context  forms  an 
important part of the material which she must consider before 
passing judgment."" 

12.  Further  elucidation  was  provided  by  Richards  LJ  in 
National Assembly for Wales v Condron [2006] EWCA Civ 1 
573 (at paragraph 50): 

""The  court  must  look  at  all  the  circumstances  as  they  appear 
from the material before it, not just at the facts known to the 
objectors or available to the hypothetical observer at the time of 
the decision."" 

13. It is common ground that the question whether, on the facts 
found  by  the  CAT,  apparent  bias  exists  is  a  question  of  law: 
Gillies  v  Secretary  of  State  for  Work  and  Pensions  [2006]  1 
 
WLR  781,  per  Lord  Hope  at  paragraphs  2  to  7.  At  appellate 
level, it is for the courts  

""To  assume  the  vantage  point  of  a  fair-minded  and  informed 
 
observer with knowledge of the relevant circumstances. It must 
itself make an assessment of all the relevant circumstances and 
then decide whether there is a real possibility of bias."" (AWG

Sanders v SST 
 

 

Group Ltd v Morrison [2006] EWCA Civ 6 per Mummery LJ, 
at paragraph 20) 

14.  It  is  also  pertinent  to  keep  in  mind  the  words  of  Lord 
Bingham  in  Locabail  (UK)  v  Bayfield  Properties  Ltd  [2000] 
 
QB 451, 472, that, because proof of actual bias is very difficult,  

""The policy of the common law is to protect litigants who can 
discharge  the  lesser  burden  of  showing  a  real  danger  of  bias 
without requiring to show that such bias actually exists.""” 

 

 

59.	  Maurice Kay LJ then proceeded to consider the circumstances of the case by specific 
reference to different periods of time (at paragraph 15). He observed that “different 
 
considerations arise at different points along the temporal way” (at paragraph 16). 

 
60.	 

The judgment continues at paragraph 31: 

“It  is  important  in  this  regard  to  keep  in  mind  that  we  are 
considering  apparent  and  not  actual  bias  and  that,  for  this 
purpose,  ""appearances  are  not  without  importance"":  R  v 
 
Abdroikov [2007] UKHL 37, [2007] 1 WLR 2679, at paragraph 
16, per Lord Bingham. I accept Lord Pannick QC's submission 
that BAA ought not to be put in the position of having to prove 
operative effect once apparent bias has been established. That 
would  be  to  blur  the  distinction  between  actual  and  apparent 
 
bias...” 

 
61.	 

In Locabail (UK) Limited v Bayfield Properties Limited (2000) QB 431 it was stated, 
at paragraph 18: 

“When  applying  the  test  of  real  danger  or  possibility  (as 
opposed to the test of automatic disqualification under Dimes 
and Pinochet (No. 2) it will very often be appropriate to enquire 
 
whether the judge knew of the matter relied on as appearing to 
undermine  his  impartiality,  because  if  it  is  shown  that  he  did 
not know of it the danger of its having influenced his judgment 
is eliminated and the appearance of possible bias is dispelled. 
As the Court of Appeal of New Zealand observed in Auckland 
Casino Ltd v. Casino Control Authority [1995] 1 NZLR 142 at 
148,  if  the  judge  were  ignorant  of  the  allegedly  disqualifying 
interest:” 

 
62.	 

The other case relied upon is that of R v Secretary of State for the Environment and 
Another Ex Parte Kirkstall Valley Campaign Limited (1996) 3 All ER 304 at page 328 
(a) (b) where Sedley J said:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

“Participation  can  manifestly  be  more 
than  voting  or 
discussion.  A  justice  who,  on  retirement,  tells  his  colleagues 
that it is his car which the defendant is charged with taking and 
wrecking, and who then sits with arms folded while the other 
justices reach a conclusion, might not be regarded by this court 
as  having  abstained  from  participation  simply  by  having 
declared his or her interest and neither spoken nor voted.” 

 
Submissions 

 
63.	 

 

The  claimants  submit  that  it  is  clear  why  Mr  Muirhead  was  appointed  to  the 
Commission. They point to a letter from the Secretary of State for Transport dated 2nd 
 
September  2013  to  the  Right  Honourable  Sir  Alan  Haselhurst  MP,  whose 
constituency includes Stansted. It was in reply to one from the MP who had written 
expressing concerns about Mr Muirhead’s connection with the Manchester Airports 
Group. The Secretary of State said, 

“I note your concerns. However the Department for Transport 
is  satisfied  with  the  way  that  the  Airports  Commission  is 
conducting its assessment of all the options for maintaining the 
UK’s  international  connectivity.  Geoff  Muirhead,  who  is  no 
longer  an  ambassador  for  MAG, 
is  only  one  of  six 
 
Commissioners,  who  were  each  selected  to  bring  different 
perspective and areas of expertise. Mr Muirhead’s expertise in 
the Airport’s industry is the very reason he was appointed. We 
are content that he is well qualified to fulfil his role within a 
well balanced team of Commissioners.” 

It is clear the claimants say that with his background Mr Muirhead was likely to exert 
a disproportionate influence over the selection of the sift criteria.  

 
Any fair minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude 
that someone who had worked as a chief executive for 16 years and been involved at 
the highest level with a company for some 22 years could not cleanse his heart and 
mind  both  consciously  and  sub-consciously  of  all  his  loyalties  to  MAG  especially 
when he had continued to act as a highly paid ambassador for them. That is not to cast 
aspersions on Mr Muirhead but it is what a fair minded observer would conclude. As 
such the Secretary of State, the Commission and Mr Muirhead were right to agree that 
he should step down from the Commission as his presence tainted the Commission’s 
proceedings  in  respect  of  its  consideration  of  any  potential  expansion  of  Stansted 
Airport by apparent bias. 

If that was the case in respect of any future decision making by the Commission then 
the claimants assert that it must equally be so in respect of any past decision making 
on the part of the Commission. That means that there would be an impact upon the 
Commission’s  consideration  of  any  potential  airport  expansion,  including  the  sift

criteria adopted by the Commission to assist it as it progressed its work and appraised 
the various options including those for Stansted as submitted by MAG and others.

They  do  not  suggest  that  Mr  Muirhead  had  knowledge  of  the  MAG  proposals  to 
purchase Stansted until it became public. It was no secret that MAG was interested in 
 
the  purchase  for  some  three  months  or  so  before  Mr  Muirhead  joined  the 
 
Commission. The Financial Times carried an article on the 3rd of August 2012 setting 
 
out  that  MAG  had  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Industry  Funds  Management  to 
enable  it  to  raise  funds  to  bid  for  Stansted.  Mr  Muirhead  must  have  been  aware, 
therefore, that there was a strong possibility that MAG would own Stansted. 

The  claimants  accept,  also,  that  Mr  Muirhead  had  no  inside  knowledge  of  MAG’s 
intent to develop Stansted once MAG had purchased it. However, whilst Mr Muirhead 
 
did not know precisely what was intended he knew enough to recognise that there was 
 
a  strong  possibility  that  MAG  would  submit  proposals  for  additional  runways  at 
 
Stansted. 

On the 13th March 2013 Mr Muirhead was informed, alongside other Commissioners, 
of the expression of intent by MAG which had been submitted on the 26th February. 
 
By then, if not before, he must have recognised that there was a likelihood that MAG 
would make a submission involving additional runways at Stansted.  

By  the  30th  April  2013  Mr  Muirhead  received  a  brief  report  at  the  Commission 
meeting  of  an  earlier  meeting  of  the  17th  April  which  had  taken  place  between  Sir 
Howard Davies, Charlie Cornish and Phil Graham. It must have been obvious by then 
that there was a strong possibility that MAG would submit proposals for more than 
one additional runway at Stansted. 

On the 1st May 2013 the sift criteria were approved for publication. Mr Muirhead did 
not comment on them on or after the 30th April as some of his fellow Commissioners 
did  but  the  fact  that  he  remained  silent  was  indicative  of  his  consent  to  their 
formulation.  They  contained  no  criteria  relating  to  market  demand  or  historic  and 
cultural  interest.  Mr  Muirhead’s  silence  was  akin  to  a  passive  involvement  as  per 
Kirkstall (supra). 

 

 
72.	 

The sift criteria were published on 3rd of May 2013. They have an ongoing reach. Mr 
Muirhead has participated and played an active role in their determination. They set 
the direction of travel and have an enduring influence on aviation policy making.

Their importance is underlined by the contemporaneous appointment, on the 3rd May 
of an expert panel who were described by Sir Howard Davies as bringing, 

“A  wide  range  of  skills  and  experience,  and  will  ensure  the 
Commission  has  access  to  a  broad  spectrum,  of  quality 
 
scientific and technical expertise as we progress our work.”

Sanders v SST 
 

 

The claimants point out that no member of the expert panel had any qualifications in 
landscape  and  cultural  or  historic  heritage.  Yet  the  criteria  were  to  be  specific  and 
were designed to enable the Commission to discriminate between proposals. The slant 
of the sift criteria gives an impression that some environmental impacts were of lesser 
importance. Air quality and noise were the first items but listed and historic buildings 
were not present at all. They came in under a residual catch all under the heading of 
“other”. 

 

The approach of the Commission is seen in its other publications and announcements. 
It  had  published  discussion  papers  on  climate  change  and  noise  indicating  the 
 
importance  it  attached  to  those  criteria.  Within  the  latter  document  it  had  a  new 
category of assessment, those persons who were affected by noise on a per passenger 
 
basis.  That  was  bound  to  favour  proposals  for  development  at  Stansted  due  to  the 
lesser  population  around  it.  Sir  Howard  Davies  in  his  speech  on  7th  October  2013 
made  repeated  references  to  noise  but  no  mention  of  landscape,  countryside  or 
cultural heritage impacts. It is not possible to dismiss the approach to the criteria on 
 
the basis that they were dealing with generic factors only; they set the direction of 
travel. 

Indeed, the sift criteria have the strong appearance of having been designed to ensure 
that  Stansted  options  would  be  favourably  assessed.  It  is  not  right  to  say  that  Mr 
Muirhead’s involvement in the decision making process gave rise to no apparent bias 
of operative effect upon the basis that MAG did not commit to any specific proposal 
for the expansion on the 26th February 2013. First, that blurs the distinction between 
actual  and  apparent  bias  as  was  recognised  in  paragraph  31  of  BAA.  Second,  Mr 
Muirhead was conflicted when he was appointed due to his ongoing relationship with 
MAG. Third, it is not tenable for the Commission to claim that Mr Muirhead had no 
knowledge at all of MAG’s plans for the expansion of Stansted when the sift criteria 
were formulated and adopted because,

iii)	 

Whilst  MAG’s  expression  of  intent  on  the  26th  February  2013  was  not  as 
specific as Commission Guidance Note 1 had requested it recognised that in 
the longer term additional capacity would be required in the south-east; 

The  reference  to  additional  capacity  made  it  obvious  that  MAG  was 
contemplating  submitting  outline  proposals  for  additional  runways  and  not 
simply proposals to increase the utilisation of the existing capacity; 

At  the  meeting  on  the  17th  April  the  chief  executive  of  MAG  had  told  the 
 
Chairman  of  the  Commission  that  MAG  expected  to  submit  views  to  the 
Commission on both second runway and hub options at Stansted. Mr Graham, 
in his witness statement, expected that the Commission members would have 
been  informed  of  the  content  of  the  discussion  with  Mr  Cornish  at  their 
meeting  on  the  30th  April  2013.  Mr  Muirhead  confirms  in  his  witness 
statement that the matter was briefly mentioned;

v)	 

It was, therefore, absolutely clear to the Commission by the very latest on the 
 
30th  April  2013  that  steps  were  being  taken  that  had  the  potential  to  benefit 
MAG. All of that was before the sift criteria were determined; 

In view of that it is not credible for the Commission to say that it was caught 
by surprise by the proposals for additional runways at Stansted submitted by 
MAG on the 19th July 2013 as they do in their summary grounds of resistance. 
The information identified should have put them on notice as to the likelihood 
of such proposals. In those circumstances paragraph 18 of Locabail is not on 
point. There was sufficient knowledge of matters which appear to undermine 
the impartiality of Mr Muirhead.  

Fourth, in any event all Commissioners had been made aware of expressions of intent 
by other parties which related to proposals for additional runways at Stansted as well 
as the fact that consideration was being given to the same by MAG.  

Strikingly, even after submission of the specific proposals by MAG on the 19th July 
 
the Commission continued to defend Mr Muirhead’s position. He failed to resign in 
response  to  the  request  that  he  do  so  by  SSE  in  their  letter  dated  26th  July.  His 
departure  came  mainly  in  response  to  the  pre-action  protocol  letter  by  which  time 
there had been a sift of the proposals in which Mr Muirhead had participated. 33 of 
the submitted proposals were sifted out. All six for Stansted survived. 

The claimants contend that it makes no sense for the Commission to assert that Mr 
Muirhead withdrew from one part of the discussion on 4th September 2013 precisely 
 
because the matters had the “potential” for direct impact on Stansted Airport. If Mr 
Muirhead's involvement in the decision making process may have given rise to a risk 
of apparent bias then his participation in the determination of the sift criteria equally 
had that potential. 

From  the  speech  made  by  Sir  Howard  Davies  on  the  7th  October  2013  and  his 
response to questions afterwards when he said that there was no useful purpose to be 
served  by  replacing  Mr  Muirhead  at  that  stage  it  was  clear  that  the  Commission’s 
thinking  on  its  interim  report  was  already  at  a  “well  advanced”  stage.  The  interim 
report is expected to include the short list of options for long term airport expansion 
 
and the Commission’s recommendations for immediate action to improve the use of 
 
existing runway capacity in the next five years. Stansted is likely to be affected by 
both.  It  is  clear  that  the  Commission’s  thinking  reached  the  “well  advanced  stage” 
when  Mr  Muirhead  was  an  active  and  influential  member  of  the  Commission.  His 
retention  until  the  20th  September  was  a  striking  defect  in  the  decision  making 
process.

I deal with the issue of delay as a separate topic below.

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 
82.	 

The first defendant submits that the critical question is what Mr Muirhead knew about 
MAG’s proposals when the sift criteria were being formulated. It relies on paragraph 
18 in Locabail (supra). In the circumstances here, the Commission submits: 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

At the time of appointment Mr Muirhead’s witness statement makes it clear 
that his involvement with the core business at Manchester Airport ceased in 
 
October  2010.  Thereafter,  he  was  appointed  on  a  consultancy  basis  but 
separate  from  the  core  business.  At  all  times  he  had  nothing  to  do  with 
 
Stansted. That all goes to the question of remoteness.  

It is clear from Mr Muirhead’s witness statement that he made a disclosure to 
 
the Department for Transport of his ongoing work with MAG. At that time he 
 
did not consider that there was any conflict of interest. Mr Muirhead’s witness 
 
statement concludes,  

“As I have made clear above, at the time sift criteria were being 
considered  and  adopted  in  May  2013  and  prior  to  that,  I  was 
not aware of any proposal being made by MAG for expansion 
at Stansted Airport. I cannot therefore understand how it is said 
that  there  would  have  been  appearance  of  bias  in  my 
involvement  in  the  sift  criteria  at  that  time.  Moreover,  as  Mr 
Graham has explained in detail in his evidence, the sift criteria 
are  generic  objective 
local 
environmental factors in any event.” 

criteria  which 

included 

 
iii)	 

Elsewhere in his witness statement Mr Muirhead deals with his knowledge as 
follows,  

“As  I  confirmed  above,  I  had  no  knowledge  of  MAG’s 
purchase  of  Stansted  Airport  prior  to  that  which  was  in  the 
public domain. Once it had been announced on the 18th January 
 
2013  that  the  purchase  would  be  completed  by  MAG  on  the 
28th  February  2013  I  was  privy  to  no  information  other  than 
that  provided  to  the  Commission regarding  MAG’s  intentions 
for Stansted as set out below. 

… I did not become aware of the fact that these expressions of 
interest had been made until 13th March 2013 when a summary 
was  presented  to  the  Commission’s  meeting  of  that  date.  Mr 
Graham’s evidence deals with the summary and the paper. The 
relevant section of the paper regarding Stansted stated, 

“ The responses for proposals for Stansted including one from 
the Airport management saying they  would  like  to  submit  but 
have to wait for the new owners and one from the new owners 
mentioning that they have the intention of looking at options for 
all their airports, but particularly Stansted and Manchester…”

“I now understand that there was a further meeting between Sir 
Howard and Charlie Cornish, the MAG CEO, on the 17th April 
2013 but I was not present at this meeting. My recollection is 
that this was briefly mentioned at the Commission meeting of 
the  30th  April  2013,  in  line  with  Sir  Howard  Davies’  usual 
practice,  which  was  to  update  us  at  the  next  Commission 
meeting as to any stakeholder meetings which he had attended 
in the interim (but I understand that the minutes of that meeting 
do not specifically record this). I do not recollect discussing the 
content of the meeting in detail, however I now understand that 
 
in  fact  Charlie  Cornish’s’  position  was  MAG  had  not  yet 
reached a corporate position regarding airport expansion at this 
 
stage at any event. ….. 

Subsequently MAG and others made their outline proposals by 
the  deadline  of  the  19th  July  2013.  Stop  Stansted  Expansion 
have noted that this came as a “complete surprise” to them. As 
far  as  I  was  personally  aware,  the  extent  of  the  proposal  by 
MAG for expansion at Stansted Airport was not a matter that I 
 
had  anticipated  either  by  reference  to  the  summary  of 
expressions  of 
intent  which  we  had  been  provided  or 
otherwise.” 

 
iv)	 

The MAG letter of the 26th February 2013 did not give an indication of what 
 
would be forthcoming. The reference to additional capacity did not necessarily 
 
equate to runways in the long term. 

 

83.	  Mr Philip Graham is the senior civil servant working as the head of the Commission 
secretariat. He has filed witness statements in the proceedings which make it clear that 
 
when the expressions of intent were received by the secretariat they were summarised 
for the Commissioners in the table presented to their meeting on the 13th March. 

 

84.	  Mr Graham in his witness statement deals with how the Commission are investigating 
the  nature,  scale  and  timing  of  any  need  the  UK  might  have  for  additional  airport 
capacity. It is being considered through a series of short thematic consultations with 
discussion  papers  published  on  aviation  demand  forecasting  (published  1  February 
 
2013), aviation connectivity and the economy (8 March 2013), aviation and climate 
change (5 April 2013) and airport operational models (16 May 2013). Although the 
papers  show  significant  demand  pressures  in  London  and  the  south  east  a  key 
proposal  made  by  a  number  of  stakeholders  has  been  that  one  way  to  address  that 
 
would be to make better use of regional airports. Indeed, the claimants’ view was to 
encourage the Commission to take a less London centric view. As a result he was of 
the view that it was entirely possible that MAG’s submission might have argued in 
favour of investment at Manchester Airport as an alternative to expansion in the south 
east.

85.	 

By  the  time  of  the  meeting  of  the  Commission  with  MAG  on  the  17th  April  MAG 
were  still  reviewing  their  position.  There  was  nothing  tangible  at  that  stage  of  the 
process.  At  the  time  of  the  publication  of  the  sift  criteria  there  was  no  further 
information from MAG.  

 
86.	 

The secretariat continued to have meetings with various stakeholders. On the 5th June 
 
2013 they had a meeting with MAG. The notes of the meeting read, 

“TH (MAG) offered to talk in more detail about any aspects of 
their possible proposals but reiterated that the new owners were 
still deciding on their options. The purchase plan for Stansted 
did not rely on additional capacity but the airport was keen to 
play an active role in the future work of the Commission. Many 
options were possible at Stansted, both two and four runways 
were possible and depend somewhat on the decisions taken by 
the Commission with regards to whether or not the future relied 
on a hub or a dispersed model.” 

On  the  19th  of  June  2013  a  further  meeting  was  held  between  the  secretariat  and 
MAG.  The  meeting  notes  relate  to  MAG’s  submission  on  short  and  medium  term 
 
options.  The  meeting  focused  entirely  upon  Stansted  and  Manchester  operations 
within their current capacity limits.  

 

The critical moment, the defendant submits, is when MAG said that it was  going to 
 
pursue an option of expansion. Here, that critical moment is the 19th July. In so far as 
BAA suggests that there should be concern when there was a real “possibility” that 
was in the context of a much closer relationship. Here, Mr Muirhead was too remote 
from  MAG  prior  to  the  July  date.  It  is  not  possible  to  attribute  to  Mr  Muirhead  a 
position which is ahead of that of the MAG management.  

 
The MAG submission document is entitled Capacity for Growth. It points out that the 
maximum use capacity of Stansted's single runway is between 40 and 45 mppa. Based 
 
on current passenger throughput of about 17 mppa that means that Stansted has the 
potential  to  serve  around  25  million  more  passengers  every  year  than  it  does  now. 
Stansted  already  has  the  necessary  planning  consents  for  most  of  the  infrastructure 
needed to grow to 35 mppa. The Stansted options assessments were assessed against 
 
the criteria of strategic fit including maximum use of the existing runway, one new 
runway  and  a  hub  option.  A  section  of  the  document  dealt  with  cultural  heritage 
including landscape, character and archaeological and historic buildings. Each of the 
 
possible options was appraised in terms of their likely effect upon the cultural heritage 
interest. Under “next steps” the document concluded,  

“In view of this we are not at this stage putting forward a single 
fixed  option.  Rather,  we  have  concluded  that  Stansted  can 
deliver  additional  capacity  in  a  number  of  different  ways, 
ranging  from  maximum  use  of  its  single  runway  through  to 
development of an effective hub to replace Heathrow. We have

Sanders v SST 
 

 

explained why, at this early stage, MAG does not itself have a 
preferred view. Much more needs to be done before that point it 
reached.” 
 

Based on that document and earlier statements the first defendant submits that whilst 
there is a possibility of expansion at Stansted by MAG it was possible to achieve that 
within the existing physical infrastructure.   

In  so  far  as  there  were  other  expressions  of  interest  in  relation  to  expansion  at 
Stansted in February 2013 Mr Muirhead was far too remote from the proponents of 
those proposals for them to have any effect.  

On  the  sift  criteria  there  were  meetings  on  the  19th  November  and  18th  December 
 
2012.  On  the  1st  February  2013  the  Commission  published  a  guidance  document 
 
which  set  out  how  third  parties  could  engage  with  the  Commission’s  work 
programme. It contained also a preliminary list of six factors for sifting of proposals. 
Submissions on those criteria were invited by the 15th March 2013. 

A  paper  on  the  sift  criteria  was  provided  to  the  Commission  for  its  meeting  on  5th 
 
February  2013.  A  further  meeting  was  held  on  the  13th  March  2013  where  it  was 
suggested  that  an  additional  criterion  be  included.  On  the  25th  March  after  the 
 
consultation,  including  a  response  from  the  claimants,  a  further  criterion  was 
 
identified.  A  final  updated  draft  was 
then  circulated  and  comments  from 
Commissioners were requested. It is submitted that the process that was undertaken 
shows  a  gradual  procedure  whereby  the  criteria  were  settled  after  a  consultation 
exercise and with secretariat input. 

Against the background that Mr Muirhead did not know what MAG were going to do, 
the question is asked whether it was credible that he was going to go out of his way to 
 
influence proposals for sifting when he did not know what the MAG proposal was 
likely to be. 

The  claimants’  submission  that  the  sift  criteria  were  loading  the  dice  in  favour  of 
Stansted  was  moving  into  the  realms  of  fantasy.  Local  environmental  effects  were 
clearly  relevant.  It  was  a  broad  descriptive  category  to  cover  local  environmental 
considerations. What weight was to be attached to them was for the decision maker. 
That might be different at different stages. When Sir Howard Davies responded to the 
letter  from  the  claimants  dated  17th  May  about  Mr  Muirhead’s  membership  of  the 
Commission he had gone on to say, 

“Thank  you  for  your  comments  regarding  the  sift  criteria  for 
long term capacity at UK airports. I can assure you that, as for 
 
all criteria in the decision making process, local environmental 
impacts  will  be  given  full  consideration  in  the  course  of  our 
work.”

On the sift criteria there is nothing which indicated that there is any ranking between 
the various factors. On the expert panel a consortium of technical advisors had been 
retained by the Commission to advise generally including Jacobs UK Limited whose 
expertise, amongst other matters, included environmental assessment.  

The  White  Paper,  Aviation  Policy  Framework,  was  published  in  March  2013.  It  is 
clear that air quality and other local environmental impacts will be very much part of 
 
any  consideration  on  future  airport  capacity.  Having  dealt  with  the  prospect  of  the 
Commission’s Interim Report the White Paper continues, at paragraph 3.55, 

the  government’s 

“It  is  likely  that  any  proposals  for  a  new  hub  airport  or 
nationally  significant  infrastructure  would  be  taken  forward 
through  an  Airport  National  Policy  Statement  (NPS).  This 
would  take  a  similar  approach  to  existing  NPSs  and  be 
consistent  with 
stated  policies  on 
sustainability  and  environmental  protection.  Loss  of  protected 
habitats,  protected  species,  protected  landscape  and  building 
heritage  and  significant  impacts  on  water  resources  and  eco-
systems  would  only  be  advocated  if  there  were  no  feasible 
alternatives  and  the  benefits  of  proposals  clearly  outweighed 
those impacts. Any unavoidable impacts would be mitigated or 
compensated  for.  Our  policy  would  be  to  ensure  that  there  is 
 
full  consideration  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  most 
credible options for maintaining out international connectivity.” 

On market demand Mr Graham’s witness statement makes it evident that all proposals 
will  be  measured  against  an  emerging  assessment  of  demand.  Demand  therefore  is 
very much on the agenda as is evident from Sir Howard Davies’ speech on the 7th 
 
October 2013. 

On  the  4th  September  2013  meeting  Mr  Graham’s  witness  statement  makes  it  clear 
that the Commission did not engage in detail in most of the submissions at this point 
as public consultation on the proposals was ongoing until the 27th September 2013. 
Any views were provisional. A further sift was then carried out on the 10th October 
which  included  a  more  detailed  consideration  of  the  proposals  including  an 
independent assessment of scheme costs and impacts which involved the production 
of  maps  showing  potential  local  environmental  impacts  including  unprotected  sites 
 
and listed buildings.

Delay 

 

100.	  The  first  defendant  contends  that  the  claim is  a  collateral  attack  on  the  sift  criteria 
adopted by the Commission on the 3rd May 2013. The timing of the collateral attack is 
particularly  problematic  because  the  many  stakeholders  who  have  engaged  in  the 
Commission’s process have done so by reference to the sift criteria.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 

101.	  That it is a collateral attack is evident from the limited complaint that was made by 
the claimants about the sift criteria on the 17th May 2013 which was responded to by 
Sir Howard Davies on the 19th May 2013. Thereafter, the claimants were inactive on 
the  topic  for  over  three  months  while  all  other  participants  in  the  Commission’s 
 
process  were  treating  the  sift  criteria  as  the  relevant  criteria  against  which  any 
 
proposal  made  should  be  explained  and  as  the  framework  for  commenting  on 
proposals made by others.  

 

102.	  Although  the  claimants  say  that  they  now  know  that  Mr  Muirhead  was  actively 
involved  in  the  determination  of  the  sift  criteria  and  did  not  know  before  asking 
questions it was self evident that all  Commissioners would have been involved in the 
Commission’s decision making process. The pause in activity from the 3rd May 2013 
until the issue of proceedings is a delay which cannot be explained in a time critical 
process. 

 

103.	  The  claimants  submit  that  they  did  not  know  that  Mr  Muirhead  participated  in  the 
determination  of  the  sift  criteria  until  the  Commission  responded  to  its  pre-action 
 
protocol letter on the 20th September 2013. If they had made an earlier application for 
judicial  review  that  would  have  been  too  much  like  an  “unduly  sensitive  or 
 
suspicious” observer, someone who had not adopted the balanced approach of the fair 
minded observer.  

 
104.	 

 
105.	 

In  anticipation  that  Mr  Muirhead  might  have  been  involved  in  the  sift  criteria  the 
claimants asked the Commission to look afresh at them if that was the case. Both the 
 
Commission and the Secretary of State refused to accede to that request. They have 
therefore acted promptly in the challenge. 

 

If  the  court  does  find  there  is  a  risk  that  Mr  Muirhead  may  have  tainted  the 
 
Commission’s determination of the sift criteria with the potential to impact adversely 
 
millions of citizens it would be wrong for the court to exercise its discretion to refuse 
relief by reason of delay. 

 

106.	  Alternatively, if the court considers the more appropriate target is to challenge the sift 
 
criteria  then  the  time  for  bringing  the  claim  should  be  extended  as  the  claimants 
lacked  the necessary knowledge to bring such a  challenge until confirmation of the 
involvement  of  Mr  Muirhead  which  was  given  in  the  response  to  the  pre-action 
protocol letter of the 20th September.

Discussion 
 

Approach 
 

 

108.	  Before examining the timeline of events I remind myself that I am in the role of the 
fair  minded  and  informed  observer  who  is  neither  unduly  sensitive  nor  suspicious, 
exercising an objective approach to the relevant circumstances as they appear from 
material before me.  

 
109.	 

I  am  informed,  in  the  sense  described  by  Lord  Hope  in  Helow.  My  exercise  is  to 
consider whether, as a fair minded and informed observer, in all the circumstances, 
there was a real possibility of bias on the part of Mr Muirhead in his position with the 
Airports  Commission.  In  carrying  out  that  exercise  I  bear  in  mind  that  different 
circumstances  arise  at  different  points  along  the  temporal  way  as  is  made  clear  in 
BAA. I bear in mind also the words of Lord Bingham in Locabail that because proof 
of actual bias is very difficult, 

“The policy of the common law is to protect litigants who can 
discharge  the  lesser  burden  of  showing  a  real  danger  of  bias 
without requiring to show that such bias actually exists.” 

110.	

 

 Further, influence can be exerted by silence; see Kirkstall. 

 
111.	 

In considering apparent bias appearances are not without importance. Once apparent 
 
bias  has  been  established  a  claimant  should  not  be  put  in  the position  of  having  to 
prove operative effect. 

 

112.	  Given  the  changing  circumstances  over  time  from  the  establishment  of  the 
Commission I have set out the following section in different parts dealing with the 
relevant circumstances of each part whilst coming to a conclusion as the fair minded 
 
and informed observer. 

Appointment of Mr Muirhead 
 

In his witness statement Mr Muirhead says that he was approached by the Department 
for  Transport  regarding  the  possibility  of  becoming  involved  with  the  work  of  the 
Airports Commission on the 25th September 2012. By that time he had been retired 
from MAG for almost two years. He began his employment there in 1988 as Director 
of Development and Planning and then held the post as Chief Executive for 16 years 
 
from 1994. Before his retirement Mr Muirhead had made it clear within the company 
that he was not likely to bid for Stansted should the airport come up for sale.  By the 
 
time BAA did announce its intention to sell Stansted in July 2012 Mr Muirhead had 
been retired for almost two years. Notwithstanding that, by the time of Mr Muirhead’s 
 
retirement  MAG  owned  Manchester  Airport,  Bournemouth  and  East  Midlands

Airports and had a majority shareholding in Humberside International Airport. On any 
view  a  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  would  regard  MAG  as  a  sizeable  and 
significant player in the UK aviation industry. Inevitably, it would have an interest in 
the development of UK aviation policy. 

 

114.	  Upon  Mr  Muirhead’s  retirement  on  the  1st  October  2010  he  entered  into  two 
consultancy agreements with MAG. The first was for two years expiring in October 
2012  for  the  payment  of  £75,000  per  annum.  The  second  was  a  role  of  being 
nominated by MAG to be a member of, or to provide advice to, a number of regional 
and industry bodies. Again, that was for the payment of £75,000 per annum. That was 
to  be  for  a  three  year  term  until  October  2013.  Mr  Muirhead’s  membership  of  the 
various bodies was not related to MAG’s core business and did not involve access to 
any information about MAG’s core business. His work, as he set out in his witness 
statement,  involved  attending  meetings  of  the  various  bodies  and  participating  in 
discussions and providing an industry view based on his previous experience. He had 
no involvement with, or access to, information on MAG’s core business or long term 
 
plans.  He  did  meet  MAG’s  chief  executive  a  few  times  after  his  retirement  but  on 
each  of  those  occasions  they  had  short  discussions  covering  Mr  Muirhead’s 
involvement with external bodies and social events.  

 

115.	  When  approached  by  the  Department  for  Transport  in  the  autumn  of  2012  Mr 
 
Muirhead  informed  them  of  his  ongoing  consultancy  work  with  MAG.  He  did  not 
consider  that  that  constituted  any  conflict  of  interest  which  ought  to  preclude  him 
from acting as a Commissioner.  

 

116.	  Mr Philip Graham deals with the process of appointment in his first witness statement. 
 
He says that the consideration of candidates was organised around a range of fields 
that were considered relevant to the work of the Commission and in which knowledge 
 
and experience on the part of the Commissioners would be of value. Commissioners 
were not, however, appointed solely as experts in a given field. It was expected that 
they would be able to contribute broadly to discussions and decision making across 
the full range of issues under consideration.  

 
117.	 

In  seeking  candidates  with  experience  of  the  aviation  sector  a  challenge  was  to 
identify candidates who had neither recently worked for an organisation with a direct 
 
interest  nor  publically  expressed  clear  views  on  the  issues  under  consideration. 
Having  retired  in  October  2010  Mr  Muirhead  was  considered  to  be  a  credible 
candidate with in depth experience of airport operations and management and did not 
appear to present any issues in terms of prior involvement or public pre-disposition to 
 
any specific outcome. Further, he was able to bring a regional perspective which was 
thought to be of value to the Commission’s deliberations. His continuing consulting 
relationship with Manchester Airports Group was not considered to be so significant 
as to constitute a conflict of interest.

118.	  When  Mr  Muirhead’s  appointment  was  announced  on  the  2nd  November  2012  the 
Department for Transport published a short CV for Mr Muirhead which contained no 
reference to his consulting arrangements with MAG.  

 

119.	  By the time Mr Muirhead was appointed his first consultancy with MAG, which had 
in any event not yielded any work, had concluded. The second consultancy involving 
representation for MAG on various boards was of a different nature and by way of 
providing  advice  to  the  regional  and  industry  bodies  based  on  Mr  Muirhead’s  past 
experience. Knowing that and being cognisant of the fact that Mr Muirhead had no 
knowledge of MAG’s ongoing core business, nor had he had since his retirement, a 
fair minded and informed observer, not being unduly suspicious or sensitive, would 
not  have  concluded  that  there  was  a  real  possibility  of  bias  upon  Mr  Muirhead’s 
 
appointment.  

 

120.	  Undoubtedly  it  would  have  been  better  for  the  press  release  concerning  Mr 
 
Muirhead’s  appointment  to  have  been  more  transparent  about  Mr  Muirhead’s 
 
consultancy  arrangements.  Failure  to  be  so  was  likely  to  engender  suspicions  on 
behalf of the claimants. Notwithstanding that, the failure to be as open as might be 
desirable,  would  not  in  the  eyes  of  the  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  raise 
suspicions  to  the  appropriate  degree  to  support  a  finding  of  apparent  bias.  It  is 
material that one consultancy arrangement had finished and the other was terminated 
in January 2013. 

 

121.	  There was, by way of ongoing background, at the time of Mr Muirhead’s appointment 
the prospect of a sale of Stansted Airport. It is said by the claimants, supported by 
newspaper articles, that MAG was the front runner as purchaser. That may well have 
been the case: by 18th January 2013 MAG made an announcement that they were to 
purchase Stansted Airport. In the autumn of 2012, however, whilst MAG may have 
had an interest in acquiring Stansted and taken steps to arrange for the funding of that 
purchase that interest was unrealised and it was uncertain whether it would be. Any 
purchase of Stansted was, in any event, taking the company in a different business 
 
direction to that which Mr Muirhead had indicated when he was chief executive when 
he had expressed clear views within MAG that he would not purchase Stansted. The 
fact that Mr Muirhead had been retired for almost two years and had been absent from 
 
MAG’s core business and long term plans for what would be a lengthy period of time 
in a dynamic industry meant that he was too distant from a main bidder for Stansted 
for that factor not to play in any significant way in the mind of the fair minded and 
informed observer. It follows that the fair minded and informed observer would not 
regard the appointment and initial presence on the Commission of Mr Muirhead as 
giving rise to a real possibility of apparent bias.   

 
From appointment until March 2013 

122.	  Mr  Graham’s  witness  statement  explains  that  the  Commission’s  term  of  reference 

 

required three distinct work streams ahead of the interim report:

assessment of need (does the UK need more airport capacity?), 

a  study  of  short  and  medium  terms  measures  for  making  the  best  use  of 
existing airport capacity, 
 

a  process  for  determining  the  most  plausible  options  for  adding  new  airport 
capacity in the longer term, should any be needed. 

 

123.	  The first meeting of the Commission took place on the 19th November 2012. There 
was a discussion at that meeting of a draft guidance document which was due to be 
published in January 2013 setting out a timetable for the Commission’s work, how 
third parties could engage with that work and the nature of that work. It was minuted 
as follows: 

“There  were  suggestions  that  the  document  was  not  clear 
enough in its intent and that the timing for receipt of proposals 
needed to be clearer along with the fact that the thematic papers 
would  allow  for  further  submissions  at  a  later  date.  Ricky 
Burdett  suggested  that  as  this  would  be  the  first  paper  of  the 
Commission,  it  needed  to  be  taken  as  an  opportunity  to 
demonstrate that the Commission would be looking at a range 
of issues and needed to open the door to taking a fresh look at 
the matrix of criteria used to evaluate proposals.” 

 

124.	  The  next  Commission  meeting  was  held  on  the  18th  December  2012  when,  again, 
 
there was discussion about the Commission’s guidance document. It is minuted that 
key points discussed were that the proposed factors for consideration for long term 
options  did  not  focus  enough  on  the  social  impacts.  No  mention  is  made  of  any 
contribution  from  any  particular  Commissioner.  There  was  an  accompanying  paper 
entitled “Long term options - factors for consideration”. Amongst the various factors 
 
was one entitled “local environmental impacts”. Included within the bullet points for 
consideration under that heading were the following, 

 
	  “Proposals  may  also  wish  to  highlight  any  other  local 
environmental impact, such as implications for heritage 
 
buildings  and  townscape,  protected  sites,  bio-diversity 
 
and flood protections.” 

 
	  Detailed  environmental  assessment  of  short  listed 
 
proposals will be required following publication of the 
interim report.” 

125.	  As  set  out,  on  the  18th  January  2013  MAG  announced  that  they  were  to  purchase 

 

Stansted Airport.

126.	  On  the  1st  February  2013  Guidance  Document  number  one  was  published  by  the 
 
Commission.  That  set  out  the  Commission’s  timetable.  In  terms  of  proposals  for 
making the best use of existing capacity in the short and medium term submissions 
 
were sought by the 17th May 2013. For proposals providing additional airport capacity 
in the longer term expressions of intent were sought by the 28th February 2013 and 
outline proposals by the 19th July 2013. Those proposals were asked to give a view on 
the level of additional capacity that would be provided, along with some of the key 
economic, social and environmental considerations. The Commission indicated that it 
would be publishing details of their sifting criteria in the spring in time to inform the 
July  submissions.  For  the  time  being  the  Commission  had  identified  six  broad 
categories  of  factors  which  they  encouraged  scheme  promoters  to  consider  in 
developing  their  proposals.  Those  were  listed  as  economic  factors,  social  factors, 
climate  change  impacts,  local  environmental  factors,  accessibility  and  feasibility 
considerations. The Commission welcomed suggestions for criteria that might be used 
to identify the most plausible options ahead of the interim report and asked that they 
be submitted by the 15th March 2013.  

 

 

127.	  On the 4th February 2013 the claimants wrote to Sir Howard Davies about the position 
of Mr Muirhead and, assuming that completion of the purchase of Stansted Airport by 
MAG  took  place  on  the  28th  February  2013,  questioned  whether  it  would  be 
appropriate for him to continue as a member of the Commission in view of his long 
standing association with MAG. 

 

128.	  On the 5th February 2013 the next Commission meeting was held. Under the heading 
“sift criteria” the minutes record that the Commission were taken through a suggested 
approach to the sift criteria by the secretariat which was consistent with established 
Government  methodology.    That  meant  that  when  recommendations  were  made, 
assurances  could  be  given  that  the  proposals  had  been  considered  within  a  broadly 
comparable assessment framework to that used by Government. It was suggested that, 
in order to balance the assessment framework appropriately, six criteria be used under 
which the relevant sections of the Department for Transport’s analysis guidance could 
be  applied.  The  criteria  were;  environment,  economy,  people,  cost,  value,  delivery. 
Finally, the Commission felt it was important to consider the impact of proposals on 
other  airports  in  the  UK.  Again,  no  Commissioner  is  recorded  as  making  any 
particular input. 

 

129.	  On the 26th February 2013 MAG expressed an interest as requested under Guidance 
Document one. At the time the letter was confidential but has been disclosed during 
the current proceedings. It included the following,  

“In  responding  to  recent  government  consultations,  MAG  has 
consistently argued that a long term aviation policy should take 
account  of  the  available  airport  capacity  at  key  UK  sites, 
thereby  reducing  pressure  on  congested  London  airports. 
However,  we  recognise  that,  in  the  long  term,  additional 
 
capacity will be required in the South-East and we look forward 
to  the  Commission’s  view  of  long  term  demand  for  aviation. 
Similar  to  other  forward  thinking  in  aviation  bodies  MAG  is
--------

Sanders v SST 
 

 

supportive of the need to ensure all viable options are explored 
and tested against agreed criteria.  

You will appreciate that our position is slightly unusual in that 
we  will  not  own  Stansted  Airport  until  the  end  of  February 
2013.  On  completion  of  the  acquisition  process,  we  intend  to 
look closely at how our airports, and in particular, Manchester 
and Stansted can help to meet increasing aviation demand. We 
expect to complete this work in the coming months and be in a 
position  to  make  a  more  substantive  submission  to  the 
 
Commission by the second deadline date of the 19th July 2013. 
In  accordance  with  your  guidelines,  we  will  present  outline 
proposals,  highlighting  additional  capacity  taking  account  of 
economic,  social  and  environmental  considerations.  Our 
 
proposals will also consider surface access links.” 

130.	  On the 27th February 2013 Stansted’s managing director wrote and said, 

 

“The  changes  in  ownership  at  the  airport  mean  it  will  not  be 
 
possible for us to respond to the notification of intention until 
MAG  has  had  an  appropriate  opportunity  to  review  its  long 
term  strategy  of  Stansted  Airport.  However,  Stansted  Airport 
remains committed to a full and active role in the Commissions 
work and we will endeavour to respond to the various calls for 
evidence  in  a  timely  and  consistent  manner.  We  will  inform 
 
you of the airport’s intentions as soon as possible.” 

 

131.	  On the 13th March 2013 the Commission held its next meeting. There was a summary 
paper including a narrative overview of the expressions of interest as well as an annex 
 
providing  a  fuller  summary.  The  individual  letters  were  not  forwarded  to  the 
 
Commissioners.  The  position  on  Stansted  was  summarised  to  Commissioners  as 
 
follows, 

“The  responses  for  proposals  for  Stansted  included  one  from 
 
the  airport  management  saying  they  would  like  to  submit  but 
have to wait for the new owners and one from the new owners 
mentioning  that  they  have  the  intention  of  looking  at  options 
their  airports,  but  particularly  Stansted  and 
for  all  of 
 
Manchester.  We  also  received 
intent  from  MAKE,  an 
 
architectural  group  and  one  from  a  private  individual  both  of 
whom are looking at extending Stansted to a four runway hub. 
There  was  also  a  piece  of  correspondence  from  Transport  for 
 
London (TFL) on behalf of the Mayor of London stating their 
intent is to submit a list of proposals, one of which may include 
Stansted. TFL have been clear they are doing a large piece of 
work on possible options for a South-East hub airport.”

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 

132.	  On the 15th March 2013 the claimants sent in their response on the sift criteria. It was 
a  detailed  document  which  included  a  section  on  aspects  which  needed  to  be 
addressed and the assessment criteria. It made the point that the logical starting point 
was to consider the level of market demand at each site. Further, matters of landscape 
and heritage impacts were amongst those which needed express consideration.  

 

133.	  On the 19th March 2013 the claimants wrote to the Commission with a copy to the 
Department for Transport querying the continued involvement of Mr Muirhead and 
questioning  whether  the  date  of  his  termination  of  consultancy  with  MAG  as  2013 
 
was, in fact, a typographical error. 

 

134.	  At  the  next  Commission  meeting  of  the  25th  March  2013  the  sift  criteria  were  the 
subject of discussion. Submissions of particular interest which had been received from 
the public were also considered. They were to be the subject of further thinking and 
analysis. The minutes for the meeting are heavily redacted but there is no reference to 
 
any Commissioner making any comment on the sift criteria. 

 

135.	  By  the  end  of  March  Mr  Muirhead  had  attended  five  meetings  of  the  Commission 
when  the  sift  criteria  had  been  on  the  agenda.  Three  of  those  meetings  had  been 
before the completion of the purchase of Stansted Airport by MAG although by the 
 
time of that on the 5th February the announcement had been made that the purchase 
was due to be completed by the end of that month. The minutes of the meetings do not 
show  Mr  Muirhead  as  having  any  role  of  particular  influence  in  the  discussion. 
Indeed, the only person whose comments were noted, Professor Ricky Burdett on the 
19th of November 2012, points to Commissioners being open minded in terms of the 
matrix of criteria for evaluating the proposals.  

 

136.	  The  claimants  concern  prior  to  the  purchase  of  Stansted  by  MAG  was  that  Mr 
 
Muirhead,  as  a  result  of  his  aviation  expertise,  would  exert  an  influence  that  was 
disproportionate  and  would  secure  a  slanting  of  the  criteria  such  that  they  would 
favour development proposals at Stansted.  

 

137.	  For the meetings on the 19th November and the 18th December 2012 the fair minded 
 
and informed observer would see no basis for that concern. Mr Muirhead’s previous 
 
professional links had been with MAG so that if he was going to do anything it would 
be to slant the criteria in favour of regional airport development. There is nothing to 
suggest, even remotely, that occurred. The fact that he had, within MAG, expressed 
views against the purchase of Stansted would predicate against slanting sift criteria in 
favour of its development. The noted comment by Professor Burdett is indicative of 
the fact that the Commissioners were not going to be unduly swayed by one of their 
number: he wanted a fresh look at the matrix of criteria to evaluate the proposals. A 
fair  minded  and  informed  observer  would  regard  the  Commissioners  as  of  equal 
standing, with independent minds and a range of expertise to bring to the discussion 
in which they would participate with equal weight.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 

 

138.	  After the announcement on the 18th January 2013 that MAG was going to purchase 
Stansted there were three further meetings of the Commission at which the sift criteria 
were  discussed.  By  the  time  of  the  last  two  the  acquisition  of  Stansted  had  been 
completed.  There  is  no  record  of  Mr  Muirhead  in  the  minutes  of  those  meetings 
making particular comments. Throughout, the claimants contend that Mr Muirhead’s 
presence, even if silent and passive, would have a guiding role. The fair minded and 
informed  observer  would  not  be  so  persuaded.    The  other  members  of  the 
Commission,  namely  Sir  Howard  Davies,  Vivienne  Cox,  Professor  Ricky  Burdett, 
Professor Dame Julia King and Sir John Armitt were all selected for their particular 
expertise. However, there is nothing to suggest or to lead someone who is not unduly 
suspicious or sensitive to suspect that the other Commissioners gave undue deference 
to Mr Muirhead because of his experience in aviation operations. Again, a fair minded 
and  informed  observer  would  conclude  that  the  Commissioners  were  a  group  of 
people  of  substance  and  experience  who  would  regard  each  other  as  equals  as 
opposed  to  regarding  any  one  of  their  number  with  undue  deference  or  having 
disproportionate influence. 

 

139.	  The position is very different to that of Professor Moizer and the Greater Manchester 
 
Pension Fund considered in BAA. There, Professor Moizer had been a fee paid advisor 
to the fund since 1987 such that his advice and comments were frequently sought and 
would be sought on investment matters such as the purchase of Gatwick as a matter of 
course. “He was very well regarded by those who he advised at the fund, was trusted 
 
and  highly  influential,  a  wise  man.  His  influence  was  such  that  he  had  virtually  a 
power of veto over a proposed investment and his role was effectively at officer level 
in the fund.” The silent presence of the chief constable who had instigated charges on 
a committee discussing the charges in Cooper v Wilson cited in R v Secretary of State 
ex  p  Kirkstall  Valley  Campaign  Limited  (supra)  likewise  is  far  removed  from  the 
 
position  of  Mr  Muirhead.  In  both  examples  a  proximity  of  relationship  which  was 
continuing existed which is wholly lacking as between Mr Muirhead and MAG from 
February  2013  in  terms  of  closeness  and  continuity.  Up  until  January  2013  a 
relationship  was  present  but  tenuous  and  diminishing,  given  the  nature  of  Mr 
Muirhead’s  consultancy,  where  although  he  had  a  representational  role  it  was  one 
based upon his past experience and not upon any current or continuing knowledge of 
 
the  core  business  of  MAG  and  where  the  role  was  ended  prematurely  because  the 
work was completed. By February 2013 Mr Muirhead was too distant from the MAG 
operation  for  any  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  to  conclude  that  there  was  a 
cause for concern and prior to that time his links were such as not to raise concern 
either.  

 

140.	  Mr  Muirhead  was  undoubtedly  well  regarded,  hence  his  appointment,  but  there  is 
 
nothing to suggest that he was more or less regarded than any other Commissioner. 
There was certainly nothing to suggest that his role was effectively at officer level, as 
was  the  case  with  Professor  Moizer,  or  anything  like  that  or  that  he  had 
disproportionate influence or that he was a person that his fellow Commissioners gave 
undue  deference  to.  There  is  nothing  here  to  suggest  that  the  informed  and  fair 
minded  observer  would  regard  Mr  Muirhead’s  mere  presence  at  the  Commission 
 
meetings when discussions about the sift criteria were ongoing as giving rise to any 
real possibility of bias.

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 

141.	  That  remained  the  case  after,  firstly,  the  announcement  of  and,  secondly,  the 
 
completion  of  the  acquisition  of  Stansted.  By  the  time  the  second  of  those  events 
occurred Mr Muirhead, as set out, had no link with MAG in any capacity. The fact of 
the  acquisition  of  Stansted,  therefore,  did  not,  in  itself,  mean  to  a  fair  minded  and 
informed observer that Mr Muirhead’s role with the Commission was compromised.  

 

142.	  When the expressions of intent were submitted Mr Muirhead had no knowledge of 
them until informed at the Commissioners’ meeting on the 13th March. At that time he 
 
became aware that MAG were going to be making a final submission in July and that 
 
it might include increased utilisation of the existing runway at Stansted as well as or 
 
instead of the provision of new runways there or elsewhere in the MAG business. His 
knowledge as to the content of that submission was, therefore, at a basic level.  

 

143.	  Because  of  the  recent  completion  of  the  purchase  and  the  necessity  to  look  at  all 
expansion  options  across  the  MAG  business  a  fair  minded  and  informed  observer 
could not conclude that Mr Muirhead knew that there was a real possibility of MAG 
submitting a final proposal in July which included new runways at Stansted. MAG 
might do, but it might not, and might instead include proposals for increased capacity 
at  one  of  its  regional  airports  or  be  content  with  maximising  the  existing  unused 
capacity at Stansted without going so far as to promote a new runway at that airport. 
All options were open. A fair minded and informed observer in those circumstances 
 
would conclude that Mr Muirhead’s knowledge was such that whilst he was aware of 
a  likely  further  submission  by  MAG  he  did  not  know  of  any  likely  content  of  the 
submission  and  was  not  privy  or  able  to  be  privy  to  any  information  that  made 
enhanced knowledge likely about any submission to be made. Absent that knowledge 
a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was no real possibility 
of an appearance of bias. That is not to say that a fair minded and informed observer 
would think that Mr Muirhead needed to know the detail of any submission which 
was to be made by MAG before his position needed to be re-examined. Far from it, 
but his knowledge had to be at a higher level than it was; it had to be elevated from an 
awareness of a possibility that the subsequent submission could contain a new runway 
or new runways at Stansted to a knowledge of a real possibility that it would do so. 
That was not the position in March 2013. 

 

 

144.	  Other expressions of intent which affected Stansted were made by private individuals, 
MAKE, a firm of architects and TFL. However, in relation to those Mr Muirhead had 
no links at all, whether former or present. A fair minded and informed observer could 
 
not  conclude,  therefore,  that  there  was  a  real  possibility  of  bias  in  that  regard.  Mr 
Muirhead was simply too remote from those parties. 

April to July 2013 
 

 

145.	  On the 17th April 2013 Sir Howard Davies and Phil Graham, from the Commission, 
met with Charlie Cornish, Chief Executive of MAG. The notes of the meeting record 
as  part  of  the  key  areas  of  discussion,  “ambitions  for  MAG  Airports  and  potential 
 
submissions to Airports Commission:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 
	  MAG still reviewing its position; 
 

 
	  Expects to provide input on traffic growth, role of regional airports, views on both 

second runway and hub options at Stansted, options for funding; 

 
  MAG explained that they were not intending to align themselves with the work of 
 

 
Mayor of London on SE airport options. 

At the next Commission meeting on the 30th April, although not minuted, Mr Graham 
says  that  it  was  highly  likely  that  the  meeting  with  MAG  was  reported  to 
Commissioners and Mr Muirhead, in his witness statement, recollects that the meeting 
was briefly mentioned. 

 

146.	  A fair minded and informed observer would not attach any greater significance to the 
report of the meeting other than to realise the situation was still under review so far as 
MAG was concerned. Although the meeting notes record that input could be expected 
from  MAG  with  views  on  both  second  runway  and  hub  options  at  Stansted  it  was 
 
entirely  open  as  to  the  likely  nature  of  those  views.  It  is  unclear  how  much  of  the 
meeting on the 17th April was reported to Commissioners at their meeting on the 30th 
 
April. Taking the notes at their highest against Mr Muirhead the opening point was 
that MAG was still reviewing its position. In those circumstances, a fair minded and 
informed  observer  would  take  the  view  that  Mr  Muirhead’s  knowledge  was  little 
changed in that the matter was still under review and he/she would be unlikely, in the 
absence of any other evidence, to conclude that there had been any material change 
from the position in March 2013. The MAG business is sizeable and a decision on one 
 
airport  could  impact  on  the  business  of  another  within  MAG.  It  was  reasonable, 
therefore,  that  strategic  business  decisions  on  the  part  of  MAG  would  be  properly 
researched and thought through before reaching a conclusion: that process would take 
 
some time.  As Mr Muirhead has distanced himself from the core business of MAG 
for over two and a half years a fair minded and informed observer would not feel able 
to  conclude  that,  as  at  the  end  of  April  2013,  Mr  Muirhead  had  the  requisite 
 
knowledge, namely, that there was a real possibility of a submission by MAG with a 
second runway and/or hub option at Stansted.  

 

147.	  At  the  same  Commission  meeting  various  items,  including  the  responses  to  the 
consultation  on  the  demand  forecasting  paper,  were  discussed.  A  sift  criteria 
document had been circulated to the Commissioners before the meeting but there was 
 
insufficient  time  to  discuss  it.  That  document  incorporated  a  revised  list  of  sift 
questions and had been updated in light of the points made at previous meetings and 
from the public comment. Commissioners were asked, therefore, to submit comments 
by  email  if  they  had  any.  Email  comments  were  received  from  Professor  Ricky 
Burdett  and  Professor  Dame  Julia  King.  The  sift  document  was  cleared  for 
publication by Sir Howard Davies on the 1st May 2013 and was published on the 3rd 
 
May  2013.  Under  the  environment  section  there  is  a  heading  “other”  under  the 
question  “what  other  significant  local  environmental  impacts  should  be  taken  into 
account?” The text beneath that reads,

“Where  proposals  may  have  other  significant  environmental

potential 

impacts, 

 

148.	  The claimants are concerned that the sift criteria set the direction of travel. Further, on 
the same day as the publication of the sift criteria membership of the expert panel to 
 
assist the Commission in its work was published. The claimants point to the absence 
 
of  any  member  on  that  panel  with  environmental  expertise  as  supportive  of  its 
submission that environmental factors are downplayed within the sift criteria.  

 
149.	 

In his letter, dated the 29th May 2013, in reply to the claimants raising concerns about 
Mr Muirhead’s continued membership of the Commission Sir Howard Davies assured 
the  claimants  that,  as  for  all  criteria  in  the  decision  making  process,  local 
 
environmental  impacts  will  be  given  full  consideration  in  the  course  of  the 
Commission’s  work. 

 

150.	  With the absence of any comment from Mr Muirhead on the sift criteria after the 30th 
 
 
of April meeting a fair minded and informed observer would draw the inference that 
he  was  content  with  their  content.  However,  that  is  far  from  saying  that  he  had 
influenced the criteria so that they were biased in favour of  development at Stansted. 
 
On proper scrutiny a fair minded and informed observer would not conclude that the 
sift criteria were slanted or engineered so that environmental impacts were regarded 
 
as  material  considerations  to  which  less  weight  should  be  attached  in  the  complete 
decision making process. The sift criteria were published in a high level document. 
The fair minded and informed observer would regard them as generic criteria that had 
been developed through an iterative process, including public consultation.  

 

151.	  On  the  contemporaneous  appointment  of  the  expert  panel  on  the  3rd  May  as  the 
Commission had retained Jacobs and Company for their environmental expertise there 
was  no  need  to  appoint  any  further  expert  as  part  of  the  expert  panel  membership. 
That  panel  was  to  supplement  the  existing  expertise  which  the  Commission  had 
retained.  A  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  would  not,  as  a  consequence,  look 
askance at the composition of the panel or draw any adverse conclusion from the date 
of its announcement  

 

152.	  Meanwhile the Government had published its Aviation Policy Framework in March 
2013.  That  states  that  air  quality  and  other  local  environmental  impacts  remain  of 
importance  to  the  Government  when  appraising  individual  proposals.  Within  the 
 
White  Paper  the  Government  makes  it  clear  that  it  will  want  to  have  a  thorough 
understanding  of  the  local  environmental  impacts  of  any  airport  development 
 
proposal.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 

153.	  The Paper refers (in paragraph 3.54) to the Airports Commission interim report and 
“that it will be informed by an initial high level assessment of the credible long term 
 
options which merit further detailed development. That will take into account local 
environmental factors which are one of the broad categories which the Commission 
has  identified  in  its  recently  published  guidance  document  that  scheme  promoters 
should  consider.  The  Commission’s  final  report  will  include  an  environmental 
assessment for each option as well as consideration of their operational, commercial 
and technical viability.” 

 
154.	 

The White Paper goes on to make it clear that any proposals for nationally significant 
 
 
infrastructure  would  likely  be  taken  forward  through  an  Airports  National  Policy 
Statement  (NPS).  Development  involving  the  loss  of  protected  landscape  and 
affecting built heritage would only be advocated if there were no feasible alternatives 
 
and the benefits of the proposal clearly outweighed those impacts. The policy is to 
ensure  that  there  is  full  consideration  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  most 
credible options for maintaining the international connectivity of the UK.  

 

155.	  The Foreword to the Aviation Policy Framework makes it clear that the document sets 
out  the  principles  which  the  Commission  will  take  into  account  when  working 
towards the  recommendations it makes when it reports later in 2013 and in 2015. It 
continues that while the Government “believes that aviation needs to grow delivering 
the benefits essential for our economical wellbeing it has to respect the environment 
and protect the quality of life.” 

 

156.	  Any fair minded and informed observer reading the Aviation Policy Framework and 
sift  criteria  would  appreciate  that  there  was  an  interrelationship  between  the  two. 
 
When  read  together  or,  in  the  latter  case  separately,  a  fair  minded  and  informed 
 
observer would not regard the sift criteria as slanted. He/she  would bear in mind that 
they were both high level documents, it is true setting the direction of travel, but each 
setting  out  a  general  framework  of  balancing  the  various  competing  factors  to  be 
considered in any prospective development.  

 

157.	  On the 17th May 2013 the claimants wrote to the Commission and the Secretary of 
 
State  reserving  their  position  on  Mr  Muirhead  in  case  it  was  shown  that  his 
 
membership of the Commission had operative effect. 

 

158.	  On the 5th June 2013 members of the secretariat met with MAG officials. The meeting 
notes record that the MAG official was content to talk in more detail about any aspect 
of their possible proposals but reiterated that the new owners were still deciding on 
their options. The purchase plan for Stansted did not rely on additional capacity but 
the  airport  was  keen  to  play  an  active  role  in  the  future  work  of  the  Commission. 
Many  options  were  possible  at  Stansted;  increased  use  of  the  existing  runway  and 
both two and four runways were possible. A final decision would depend somewhat 
 
on the decisions taken by the Commission with regards to whether or not the future 
 
relied on a hub or a dispersal model.

159.	  A further meeting took place between officials of the secretariat and MAG on the 19th 
 
June  2013  on  matters  arising  from  MAG’s  submission  on  short  and  medium  term 
 
options. Nothing further was mentioned with regard to the approach to proposals for 
the long term at Stansted. 

 

160.	  On  July  2nd  the  Commission  published  a  discussion  paper  on  aviation  noise.  The 
claimants  contend  that  is  illustrative  of  how  the  approach  of  the  Commission  is 
 
stacked  towards  development  at  Stansted,  particularly  as  there  is  no  comparable 
document published about environmental issues, and there is a possible new category 
for assessing noise on the basis of the size of population affected by aircraft noise at 
the  UK’s  largest  airports.  Stansted  tops  the  list  as  the  airport  affecting  the  least 
number of people by that criterion.   

161.	  On the 19th of July 2013 MAG submitted their document entitled Capacity for Growth 
 

 

to the Commission contemplating two broad propositions. They were 

 
 

 
	 

 
to support the growth of Manchester to the capacity of its two existing runways and a 
throughput of 55 mppa.  

that Stansted’s long term options provide flexible, affordable and deliverable capacity and 
merit inclusion on the Commission’s short list for further study. Additional capacity there 
can be delivered in a number of different ways, ranging from maximum use of the single 
 
runway  through  to  the  development  of  an  effective  hub  to  replace  Heathrow.    The 
document continued that MAG  “ does not have a preferred view. Much more needs to be 
done before that point is reached.” 
 

 

162.	  On  the  26th  July  2013  the  claimants  wrote  to  Miss  Snashall,  at  the  Department  for 
 
Transport, saying that they considered it unacceptable for Mr Muirhead to continue to 
serve on the Airports Commission and the longer he continued to serve the more the 
process risked being tainted. The letter explained that the delay had been to allow it to 
become  clear  whether  or  not  any  apparent  bias  could  have  an  operative  effect  i.e. 
dependant  or  not  on  whether  MAG  submitted  proposals  to  the  Commission  for  a 
major long term expansion at Stansted Airport. They sought a response within 14 days 
failing  which  they  were  to  take  legal  advice  with  a  view  to  initiating  legal 
  
proceedings. 

 

163.	  With the submission of the proposal on the 19th of July MAG crystallised its position. 
What  had  been  a  possibility  previously  had  become  a  reality.  Whilst  Mr  Muirhead 
 
was  aware  that  MAG  may  provide  input  on  a  second  runway  and  hub  options  at 
Stansted,  because  it  was  reviewing  its  position,  it  was  uncertain  as  to  whether  that 
would be promoting its own proposals, the nature of those proposals, if there were to 
be any, or whether that was to be comment on other suggestions for development at 
Stansted which had been made at the expressions of interest stage. A fair minded and 
informed observer would conclude that as Mr Muirhead had no contact and had had 
no contact with core business at MAG for two and three quarter years he would have 
had no advance knowledge of any such proposals.

164.	  Once the submissions were received, however, Mr Muirhead was then placed in the 
position of carrying out a quasi judicial function in terms of assessing the proposals 
against the sift criteria. One of those proposals was now from his longstanding former 
employer.  The  appearance  of  Mr  Muirhead  adjudicating  upon  that  was  a  material 
change in circumstance from that which existed previously. In those circumstances a 
fair minded and informed observer would have expected Mr Muirhead to act out of an 
abundance of caution and step down from the Commission. That is not to cast any 
aspersions upon the conduct of Mr Muirhead but rather to reflect the fact that there 
 
had  been  a  change  of  circumstances  along  the  temporal  way  when  MAG  had 
crystallised their position. To avoid any allegation of apparent bias in the forthcoming 
process of assessing and judging the proposals a fair minded and informed observer 
would think it prudent for Mr Muirhead to take that defensive step.  

 
165.	 

In  the  circumstances  it  would  have  been  reasonable  for  Mr  Muirhead  to  have 
questioned his own position and taken advice upon it. That is what a fair minded and 
informed observer would have expected him to have done. Having allowed time for 
that  a  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  who  was  neither  unduly  suspicious  nor 
sensitive  but  mindful  of  appearances  would  have  expected  Mr  Muirhead  to  have 
 
stepped down from the Commission. 

August to October 2013 
 

 

166.	  On the 4th of September the Commission met again. It was then aware of the threat of 
 
judicial review proceedings and they were reported to the Commission meeting.  Mr 
Muirhead  stood  down  from  those  sections  of  the  meeting  which  dealt  with  surface 
access  investments  and  fiscal  incentives  to  redistribute  services  between  airports 
because if implemented there could be specific benefits for airports owned by MAG. 
He was present when the meeting discussed long term options for new runways and 
airports  as  the  agenda  focussed  on  removing  the  least  credible  options  from 
consideration. 
those  proposals  which  were 
fundamentally  flawed,  duplicated  other  proposals  or  were  not  consistent  with  the 
Commission’s remit. The meeting reached a provisional view only as the proposals 
received in July were still out for public consultation which continued until the 27th 
 
September. 

The  purpose  was 

to 

identify 

 

167.	  The second meeting on the received proposals took place on the 10th of October. That 
 
was after Mr Muirhead had departed the Commission. It was that meeting which had 
the  more  detailed  input  from  the  Commission’s  consultants  but  even  so  the  sifting 
decisions taken remained provisional and were to be revisited following completion 
of  the  analysis  of  responses  from  third  parties.  The  decision  making  process  has, 
therefore, not been affected by the position of Mr Muirhead. 

 

168.	  A  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  would  not  have  regarded  the  actions  of  Mr 
Muirhead in remaining as a Commissioner until the 20th of September or those of the 
Commission  in  retaining  him  until  then  as  the  most  wise.  However,  a  defensive 
strategy was adopted so that, although the conduct of both parties was less than ideal,
--------

Sanders v SST 
 

 

a fair minded and informed observer, considering all of the circumstances, including 
the fact of Mr Muirhead’s absence from part of the meeting of September 4th and the 
fact that such decisions as were made then were provisional only would not have been 
satisfied that there was a real possibility of apparent bias.   

 

169.	  Sir  Howard  Davies’  speech  on  the  7th  October  2013  outlined  the  Commission’s 
 
emerging thinking on the need for additional aviation capacity but made it clear that 
 
the Commission had not yet reached a view on the best means of providing that. He 
invited interested parties to submit evidence in relation to the topics covered in his 
speech by 31 October. His answer in response to a question from a member of his 
audience that the Commission would not be replacing Mr Muirhead as a member of 
the Commission because thinking of the Commission was advanced has, therefore, to 
be seen in that light, namely, that although the thinking is advanced, it is not fixed and 
is  open  for  amendment  after  further  public  responses.  A  fair  minded  and  informed 
observer  would  not  draw  an  adverse  inference  from  the  comment  made  by  Sir 
Howard Davies when seen in its full context. 

Other matters 
 

Retrospective operative effect 
 

It is apparent from what is set out above that a fair minded and informed observer 
would  find  that  there  was  no  real  possibility  of  apparent  bias  on  the  part  of  Mr 
Muirhead until receipt of the submission on the 19th July from MAG. That is not to 
 
say that I accept the Commission’s argument that to be satisfied of a real possibility 
something  tangible,  such  as  the  submission  of  MAG  in  this  case,  needs  to  exist. 
 
Rather, applying the indicia in BAA along the temporal line the situation developed so 
that although Mr Muirhead was on notice after the submission of intent by MAG, at 
the end of February 2013, he had insufficient knowledge, namely, his understanding 
was that there was a possibility as opposed to a real possibility or likelihood that a 
proposal of the sort that was eventually received from MAG involving the prospect of 
additional  runways  at  Stansted  would  be  submitted.  To  attribute  any  other 
understanding  to  Mr  Muirhead  would,  as  the  first  defendant  submitted,  for  a 
significant  part  of  the  time,  be  to  place  him  in  a  position  ahead  of  the  MAG 
 
management. His position changed upon receipt of the submission from MAG. The 
fair minded and informed observer would conclude that, despite the two month period 
 
or so, between the submission by MAG and Mr Muirhead’s stepping down there was 
no apparent bias during that latter period. The prospect of it arising was due to the 
appearance of Mr Muirhead participating in the determination through the autumn and 
 
winter  of  which  submitted  options  should  proceed  to  the  short  list.  No  absolute 
 
determination was made during the final months of Mr Muirhead remaining with the 
Commission.  The  fair  minded  and  informed  observer  reviewing  the  events  and 
chronology set out above would not conclude that there was a prospect of apparent 
bias having a role before that time.

Sanders v SST 
 

 

 

171.	  By the 4th September the sift criteria had been adopted for four months. The iterative 
process that they had been through, their high level general nature, together with the 
fact  that  the  consultation  exercise  that  was  carried  out  and  in  response  to  which 
changes were made was completed by May 3rd  meaning that they were not affected 
by the position that Mr Muirhead found himself in some months later. The declaration 
and orders sought by the claimants are not justified.  

 

 

172.	  That is not to say that in an appropriate case retrospective operative effect may not 
have a role to play but, in the circumstances of this case, for the reasons set out above 
that is not the position. 

 

173.	  That means that strictly I do not have to consider the issue of delay. If I had to do so 
 
the  claimants  knew  that  the  Commission  was  involved  in  a  time  critical  process. 
 
Having said that the minutes and notes of the meetings of the Commission were not 
publically available. The claimants may have been able to deduce that Mr Muirhead 
was part of the decision making process but they did not know what that process was; 
 
they  did  not  know  about  the  iterative  approach  to  the  sift  criteria,  how  they  were 
developed over time and in response to public consultation including a response from 
 
themselves.  They  only  became  aware  of  the  background  with  the  disclosure  of  the 
documents through the prospect of these proceedings.

175.	 

In the circumstances, if necessary, I would have extended time within which to bring 
this claim. As it is I grant permission to bring the claim for judicial review but dismiss 
the substantive action for the reasons I have set out above. 

I  express  my  gratitude  to  Counsel  for  their  extremely  efficient  and  expeditious 
submissions all made within the agreed timetable and to the parties generally for the 
 
preparation of the case within an expedited timetable.
