This was an appeal against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner Mr Amarjeet Singh convicting the appellant on a charge of trafficking in not less than 24.97g of diamorphine under s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
On the morning of 19 June 1991, a team of narcotics officers mounted a surveillance operation in the vicinity of a bus-stop along Woodlands Road. The officers took up their respective positions around the area at about 8.45am. Narcotics Officer Juahir bin Ismail (`NO Juahir`) was stationed at the second storey of a deserted shophouse about 20m behind the bus-stop and had a clear view of the bus-stop. Woodlands Road was divided by a fenced barrier with two lanes on either side. Diagonally across from the bus-stop, on the other side of Woodlands Road in the direction of the city, was a community centre. Corporal Wong Chong Yeo (`Cpl Wong`) and two other officers were stationed at different points in the community centre. Cpl Wong had a clear view of the bus-stop some 30-40m away across Woodlands Road. Narcotics Officer Ho Thiam Huat (`NO Ho`) was cruising in his car along this two-way stretch of road. Traffic was light; there were few pedestrians on the road.
At about 10.30am, NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho all saw the appellant walking along the pavement towards the bus-stop in the same direction as the traffic, carrying a white plastic carrier bag which had some sort of markings by its cut-out handles. NO Ho was at the time driving along the extreme left bus lane at about 50kph, and was some 50m away from the bus-stop; he spotted the appellant when the latter was some 5m away from the bus-stop. NO Juahir and Cpl Wong saw the appellant when he was some 10-15m away from the bus-stop. All three of them saw him putting the plastic bag on a seat of the bus-stop, and then going to sit on the railings at the rear of the bus-stop.
When the three officers spotted the appellant at the bus-stop, they alerted their leader, Inspector P Senthilnathan, who then ordered the team to move in to effect arrest. The officers arrested and handcuffed the appellant. From that moment onwards, the appellant did not touch the white plastic bag. When questioned, the appellant denied that the bag was his and any knowledge of its contents. The appellant was brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) at around mid-day. Inspector Alan Moh (`Insp Moh`) took charge of the case as the investigating officer.
The white plastic bag seized from the bus-stop was found to contain a bundle wrapped in a page of the `
 China Press 
` newspaper (dated 18 June 1991). Inside the wrapping was a translucent packet containing some 452g of a granular substance. This was analyzed and found to contain not less than 24.97g of diamorphine. The white plastic bag was dusted for fingerprints. Three latent prints were lifted. The expert evidence showed that one of these prints had been made by the impression of the appellant`s left thumb.
On the afternoon of 19 June 1991, a statement was taken from the appellant under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 122(6) statement`). The appellant was subjected to medical examinations before and after the taking of the statement; the reports of the examinations were negative. The s 122(6) statement was not sought to be admitted in evidence at trial. Instead, the prosecution sought to admit a long statement under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 121 statement`), which, on the face of it, was taken from the appellant by Insp Moh two days later, on 21 June 1991, between 12.15pm and 3.40pm. The appellant was not medically examined before and after he had made this statement.
The appellant disputed the admissibility of the s 121 statement and a voir dire was held. It is necessary to deal with the voir dire in some detail as the main arguments before us were centred essentially on the admission of this statement in evidence by the trial judge at the conclusion of the voir dire.
Insp Moh gave evidence that on 21 June 1991, at 11.50am, he took the appellant from the lock-up to his office and began the recording of the s 121 statement. This was done by him alone without the service of an interpreter. Insp Moh stated that he had offered an interpreter to the appellant, but the appellant refused, and that as both of them were conversant in Cantonese, the recording of the statement proceeded in that dialect, with Insp Moh translating it into English for the purposes of the recording. After five pages of the statement had been recorded and read back to the appellant in Cantonese, the appellant signed on every page, and both of them had lunch. Afterwards, the appellant asked to make a further statement extending over three pages, and, after this second recording the appellant was returned to the lock-up at 3.40pm.
Insp Krishnan, NO Porter and NO Lim admitted to having taken the appellant from the lock-up in the evening of 19 June 1991 for an interrogation session. They said, however, that the purpose of interrogating the appellant was to gather intelligence about other drug traffickers which the appellant might have knowledge of, and not to extract a confession from the appellant. They denied that they had assaulted the appellant to make him confess and had fabricated the s 121 statement.
The evidence of the appellant at the voir dire was this. On 19 June 1991, NO Porter had taken him from the lock-up at about 6.35pm before he could have dinner. He had not eaten since breakfast on the morning he was arrested. He was taken to an office with his hands handcuffed behind his back, and interrogated by the three officers in Hokkien and was urged to confess. When he denied that the drugs were his, NO Porter and NO Lim assaulted him continuously for 15-25 minutes, punching him in the stomach and kicking his legs. He was severely assaulted and the pain was unbearable. He was very hungry and asked for food, saying that if they gave him food he would do whatever they wanted. One of them went to fetch food and it was given to him an hour later.
NO Porter then typed the statement in the appellant`s presence, making reference to a small piece of paper, 8.5"" by 5"". Although NO Porter kept asking him questions while typing the statement, he merely replied that he would sign whatever NO Porter typed. NO Porter then read the statement out to him in Hokkien, and he signed on every page. In cross-examination, he stated that the s 121 statement before the court was the same document as the statement he had signed, except that, when he signed it, some space on the first page of the statement had been left blank.
The appellant further testified that, as a result of the assault on him, he sustained a huge bruise of some 10-12cm in diameter on the right side of his rib cage. He said that it caused him intense pain that came and went. He did not report this to the officers-in-charge on his return to the lock-up because he was in pain. He reported it to an officer the next day but nothing was done. He informed a cell-mate, Ong Kee Kwok (`Ong`), of the assault and showed him his bruise. The appellant also said that on his remand at Queenstown Remand Prison two weeks later, he still felt the pain, and asked to see a doctor there, but, again, nothing was done.
The appellant explained that at 11.50am on 21 June 1991, Insp Moh took him out from the lock-up to his office not to take the statement as alleged by the prosecution, but to have the statement, which had already been typed by NO Porter, read over to him. There was no interpreter present, and both of them spoke in Cantonese, which Insp Moh had elected to use. He told Insp Moh that there was no need to read the statement to him as he knew what it said. Thereafter, Insp Moh gave him tea and cakes and they chatted about inconsequential matters until he was returned to the lock-up at 3.40pm.
Ong was called as a defence witness and gave supportive testimony for the appellant. He said that, at the material time, he shared a cell with the appellant in the lock-up at the Central Police Station. The appellant told him that he had been assaulted by the CNB officers and showed him the redness and bruise in his stomach. He called the police and, thereafter, he retreated to leave the appellant to talk to the police. He did not hear the conversation. The police did nothing.
At the end of the voir dire, the trial judge reviewed the evidence of the prosecution and defence in great detail and evaluated it thus. First, on the alleged deprivation of food and assault by NO Porter and NO Lim, he found inconsistencies in the appellant`s evidence. He held that if it were true that the appellant was assaulted continuously for 15-25 minutes, a reasonable reaction from the appellant would have been that he would sign anything if they stopped assaulting him. That was not what the appellant said; the appellant said that if they gave him food he would sign whatever they wanted from him. The trial judge accepted NO Porter`s evidence that he recorded in his diary that food was provided to the appellant at 7.00pm and this was not challenged. The only meal the appellant missed was lunch and that, the trial judge held, in the rush of an on-going investigation was of no significant consequence.
Secondly, on the question of assault, the trial judge held that the appellant had failed to complain to PC Abdul Nazir and W/CP Ong Peck Geok, the officers-in-charge at the Central Police Station`s lock-up, on his return to the lock-up although he claimed he was in great pain; one would reasonably expect him to complain and seek medical attention if the assault and pain had been as severe as he had made it out to be. The trial judge also found his other evidence relating to the assault incongruous and that he was not telling the truth. As for the evidence of Ong, the trial judge found that, save for supporting `the main strands` of the appellant`s allegations, Ong`s evidence was very thin on details and differed from the appellant`s on several material points and in one material point there was a sharp contradiction between the two. The trial judge was of the view that there was little doubt that the medical staff of the prison would have allowed the appellant to see a doctor if he had alleged assault at the police station and was in pain. The trial judge said: 
 
I was of the opinion, in the circumstances, that the accused was untruthful 
 in alleging the assaults
 at the eleventh hour and the contradictions in his evidence and his conduct and behaviour after the alleged assault and the evidence of his witness totally lacked credibility and his allegations did not raise any reasonable doubt in my mind of their truthfulness in respect of the said assault.
 
 
 
On the alleged fabrication of the s 121 statement, the trial judge stated that he was thoroughly unimpressed with the appellant`s allegations. The most damning piece of evidence against the appellant, the trial judge held, was the appellant`s own allegation that the statement had been completely fabricated by NO Porter, as he had told NO Porter to type what he wanted and that he would sign it. It was a fact that the statement contained detailed information about the appellant`s personal background which he later admitted to be true, and which were thus incapable of fabrication by NO Porter. The trial judge was of the view that the appellant had realized this in cross-examination and had come up with the story that NO Porter, when typing the statement, referred to the `piece of paper, 8.5"" by 5""`, which must have contained details of his personal particulars that he had revealed to Insp Moh when giving his s 122(6) statement earlier that afternoon, and with which Insp Moh must have provided NO Porter. The trial judge accepted the evidence of NO Porter, Inspector Krishnan and NO Lim as being frank and truthful and disbelieved the appellant`s version of the events.
The trial judge rejected the appellant`s allegation that the document typed by NO Porter which he had signed had blanks in the spaces for date, time and name of recording officer, which had since been filled in falsely, since the appellant had admitted he could not read English, and when he was shown the statement at the trial, he said that all he could recognize on the document was his name, `Lim`.
The trial judge further rejected the appellant`s allegation that Insp Moh had taken him out from the lock-up merely to read the statement over to him; if the statement had been made earlier and had already been signed by the appellant as alleged, then obviously there was no need for further co-operation from the appellant. Equally unlikely was the appellant`s account of his spending the length of time between 11.50am until 3.40pm merely chatting with Insp Moh, and eating cakes and drinking tea.
The trial judge accordingly held that the s 121 statement was made voluntarily and admitted it in evidence. The content of the statement, so far as material, was as follows. The appellant admitted to agreeing with one Seow Kia to smuggle drugs into Singapore from Johor Bahru for $4,500 per pound. Seow Kia had contacted him through a pager which his friend Ah Seong (a Singaporean drug purchaser) had given him. The appellant met Seow Kia at Beauty World in Upper Bukit Timah at 8pm on 18 June 1991, and agreed to meet him with the drugs at the bus-stop in Woodlands at 10.30am the next day. The appellant then returned to Johor Bahru to look for a heroin supplier he knew by the name Seow Chern. He found Seow Chern at the Cathay Cinema shortly after 9 pm; Seow Chern had heroin wrapped in newspaper stored behind the driver`s seat of his car, and was able to meet the appellant`s request for heroin. The appellant left with the drugs for Singapore the next morning at 9am. He took a lift down to the Woodlands checkpoint from a fellow lorry driver, and then took a taxi from there to the bus-stop where he had arranged to meet Seow Kia. He put the bag containing the drugs on the bus-stop seat `as a precautionary measure` and sat on the railings at the rear of the bus-stop. Ten minutes later, he was arrested by the CNB officers.
In his defence, the appellant maintained that he had nothing to do with the drugs found at the bus-stop and that he merely happened to have come upon them there. He testified that, on the morning of 19 June 1991, he left his home in Kulai for the Nam Hong Plywood Factory (`the factory`) in Jurong, Singapore, to make enquiries as to whether the factory needed sawdust. His employer had been supplying the factory with sawdust for seven years, but had since stopped; the appellant claimed that he had in view the setting up of his own business and supplying the factory himself. He said he drove from Kulai but parked his car in Johor Bahru and hitched a ride from across the Causeway to the factory from a fellow lorry driver known as `Ah Pui`.
When the appellant reached the factory, he spoke to an employee known as `Ismail`, although he did not go to see the factory manager, `Gan`. He first said that it was too early; then he said that it was pointless to see Gan as he had not bought his lorry yet. He stated he left the factory at 9.30am and had a cup of tea at a canteen next door. There, he met a pick-up driver who gave him a lift to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road so that he could take the Service 170 bus back to Johor Bahru.
As the appellant approached the bus-stop, seven or eight passengers were boarding a bus. When he reached the bus-stop, the appellant noticed a white plastic bag had been left on the middle seat. He thought that it had been left behind by one of the passengers who had got onto the bus, which had since moved off, leaving him alone at the stop. Out of curiosity he touched and then opened the bag, thinking it contained a ladies` wallet; inside, he saw a newspaper wrapped bundle which he also opened and saw something like salt. He said that he had replaced the bag on the seat and was sitting on the bus-stop railings when he was arrested by CNB officers. He maintained that, instead of immediately handcuffing him, the officers first insisted that he pick up the plastic bag and take a look inside; they told him it was drugs.
The appellant denied having had at any time possession of the bag; he asserted that the inculpatory parts of the s 121 statement were fabricated and untrue. He denied knowing the persons Seow Kia, Seow Chern and Ah Seong.
The defence called one Sheo Poh Hong who had given the appellant a lift from the factory to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road. This witness testified that the appellant did not carry a white plastic bag when he met the appellant at the canteen. However, his account of the circumstances surrounding the meeting that morning was regarded by the trial judge as being `highly improbable`, differing from the appellant`s at material points. He also admitted to meeting the appellant next at Queenstown Remand Prison, and admitted that he recognized the appellant and remembered the incident when he was reminded by the appellant.
The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant`s possession of the white plastic bag containing the drugs had been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the following: the evidence of NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho, the fingerprint evidence, and the main inculpatory parts of the s 121 statement, in which the appellant admitted to possession of the drugs and to transporting them from Johor Bahru to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road to deliver them to Seow Kia. He said: 
 
Having thus reviewed and assessed the whole evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case in respect of the basic ingredient of possession by the accused of the plastic bag with the diamorphine in it beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the presumed facts under the Misuse of Drugs Act that the accused had knowledge of the diamorphine in the plastic bag and additionally, the presumed facts that the accused, having more than 2g of diamorphine, was presumed to be trafficking in it, in combination with the proved facts, amongst which was the offer of delivery by the accused as stated in the charge, had not been rebutted by the accused.
 
 
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant took issue with the admission of the s 121 statement and contended that the trial judge erred in finding that the s 121 statement had been made voluntarily. He advanced two main arguments against such finding. First, he submitted that that part of the judgment in which the trial judge held that the appellant had been `untruthful in alleging the assaults at the eleventh hour`, ie only at trial, was unfair to the appellant, since a copy of the s 121 statement was given to defence counsel only three days before the commencement of the trial, and the appellant could not have raised the allegations of assault earlier; the appellant did not know, and would not have known, whether the prosecution intended to rely on the s 121 statement until the trial itself.
We think that counsel had misunderstood that part of the judgment. The trial judge in holding that the appellant raised the allegation of assault at the `eleventh hour` was not referring to the fact that the allegations had not been made earlier in the proceedings, such as at the preliminary inquiry, but the fact that the allegations or complaints had not been made to the officers on duty at the lock-up at the Central Police Station immediately after the alleged assault or soon thereafter at any time as would have been reasonably expected of a person so assaulted in police custody. The trial judge was fully aware that a copy of the s 121 statement was given to the defence shortly before trial commenced. At the commencement of the trial, defence counsel asked for an adjournment on the ground, inter alia, that a copy of the s 121 statement was furnished to him shortly before the trial and he required time to take instructions from the appellant. This request received sympathetic consideration from the trial judge and an adjournment was granted to defence counsel to take instructions from the appellant. In our judgment, this argument had no merit, and we rejected it.
We now turn to the second main argument advanced on behalf of the appellant. It was contended that adverse inferences should have been drawn from the failure of Insp Moh (i) to ensure that an interpreter was present while he was taking the s 121 statement from the appellant, and (ii) to send the appellant for a medical examination both before and after the making of the statement. Counsel pointed out that both these safeguards had been taken by Insp Moh when the appellant made his s 122(6) statement. Under cross-examination, Insp Moh explained that medical examinations before and after the s 122(6) statement were `a procedural requirement ... but not [for] s 121`. Counsel submitted that this was an arbitrary distinction, as s 121 statement carried the same evidentiary weight as s 122(6) statement, and as, particularly, the purpose for having the requirement of pre- and post-statement medical examinations was to ensure that an accused had not been assaulted and compelled to give the statement. Counsel accordingly urged us to draw the inference, to the extent that a reasonable doubt would be raised, that Insp Moh, who was an experienced and prudent officer, failed to ensure the presence of an interpreter (who would have been an independent person) at the time the statement was recorded, because the statement had already been prepared, and that he failed to send the appellant for medical examinations before and after the taking of the statement, because the examinations would have revealed the assaults on the appellant. Counsel submitted that the explanations given by Insp Moh of his behaviour, taken with the corroborating evidence of Ong, were sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the trial judge`s mind as to the voluntariness of the statement.
Although we could see the force of counsel`s argument, we are not persuaded that the trial judge`s finding was in error. The evidence before him was not solely that of Insp Moh. There was also the evidence of NO Porter, Insp Krishnan and NO Lim. The trial judge had considered with great care the evidence of NO Porter, Inspector Krishnan and NO Lim, and found that their evidence was frank and truthful; he disbelieved the evidence of the appellant on the alleged assault and fabrication of the s 121 statement. The trial judge had also considered carefully the evidence of Insp Moh, who had been vigorously cross-examined as to why there were no pre- and post-statement medical examinations and why there was no interpreter around at the material time, and he had accepted Insp Moh`s evidence. The trial judge had seen and heard these witnesses and he had evaluated their evidence. In our judgment, the trial judge was well entitled on the evidence before him to reach the conclusion that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been made voluntarily.
We revert to the facts in the instant case. Although the trial judge considered that possession had been made out by the evidence taken as a whole, we were of the opinion that, even without the s 121 statement, the evidence of NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho, who had seen the appellant carrying the bag and placing it on the middle seat at the bus-stop, and the expert evidence of the appellant`s fingerprint on the paper bag - all this evidence was unassailable - would have constituted sufficient evidence to raise a strong inference that the appellant knew the contents of the paper bag and, therefore, had possession of the drugs found there, and he had not given any explanation as to the contents of the bag which was accepted by the trial judge. On this point, we would refer to the oft-quoted passage of the speech of Lord Pearce in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
1 at pp 305-306: 
 
... If a man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was mistaken as to its contents? ... Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.
 
 
 
More apposite to the facts in this case is the following passage of the judgment of this Court in 
 Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP 
, at p 52, where Wee Chong Jin CJ said: 
 
With regard to the question of possession of the contents of the plastic bag, it is submitted that the trial judges should have drawn the inference from her evidence that she did not in fact know what was contained inside the plastic bag. In our opinion there was no plausible evidence before the trial judges to require them to draw the inference that she was an innocent custodian of the contents of the plastic bag. Indeed, even if there were no statutory presumptions available to the prosecution, once the prosecution had proved the fact of physical control or possession of the plastic bag and the circumstances in which this was acquired by and remained with the second appellant, the trial judges would be justified in finding that she had possession of the contents of the plastic bag within the meaning of the Act unless she gave an explanation of the physical fact which the trial judges accepted or which raised a doubt in their minds that she had possession of the contents within the meaning of the Act.
 
 
 
That precisely was what had happened in this case. The appellant was in physical possession and control of the plastic bag; he was found carrying the plastic bag on the way to the bus-stop and then placing the bag on the middle seat at the bus-stop and his left thumb print was found on the plastic bag and drugs were found in the plastic bag. A strong inference irresistibly arose that he knew the contents of the bag, and he had not given `any explanation of the physical fact` which the trial judge accepted or which raised a doubt in his mind. His evidence that that was not his bag and that he had nothing to do with it was rejected, and the trial judge was justified in rejecting it. Once possession was proved, as, in our opinion, it had been proved in this case, the presumption of trafficking in the drugs under s 17 of the Act arose which the appellant had to rebut on a balance of probabilities, and he had failed to rebut it.
