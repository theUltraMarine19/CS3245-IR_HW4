4273468,Safe Work (NSW) v Activate Fire Pty Ltd; Safe Work (NSW) v Unity (NSW) Pty Ltd [2017] NSWDC 66,"Judgment


	
	Unity (NSW) Pty Ltd (Unity) and Activate Fire Australia Pty Ltd (Activate Fire) pleaded not guilty to an offence contrary to section 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act). It is alleged that the defendants breached a health and safety duty owed pursuant to section 19(1) or (2) of the Act and thereby exposed Dwayne Gumbleton, an employee of Hanna Plumbing Pty Limited (Hanna Plumbing), to a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	At about 11.30am on 14 March 2014 Mr Gumbleton suffered an electric shock while working in the roof space of the administration area (the roof space) of an aged care facility known as Kularoo Aged Care Facility at Forster (the facility) operated by Baptist Care Services Pty Limited (BCS). At the time of the incident Mr Gumbleton was with other employees of Hanna Plumbing installing a fire sprinkler system (the system).
	


The facts


	
	The facility provided residential accommodation for aged persons in a number of buildings. The buildings were interconnected by covered walkways. The facility had a kitchen to provide meals for the residents, an on-site registered nurse and a number of its residents required high dependency care. One of the buildings at the facility contained a number of offices where the administration staff of BCS had offices (the administration wing). Stage 2 of the facility that included the administration wing, had been completed in or about 2004. A change in legislation required BCS to install the system at the facility before a certain date. BCS invited tenders for the installation of the system.
	
	
	Unity had previously subcontracted the installation of a fire sprinkler system to Hanna Plumbing for an aged care facility in Grafton. Peter Gurtner, the director of Unity, approached Heinz Stalder, [1]  the director of Hanna Plumbing, to be involved in the tender process for the work. Mr Stalder brought in Glen Chapman the director of Activate Fire to assist because size of the project. Mr Stalder had previously worked on projects with Mr Chapman when Mr Chapman was employed by Wormald.
	
	
	During the course of the tender process, David Gurtner a foreman employed by Unity, Mr Chapman and Mr Stalder were given access to the roof spaces at the facility for the purpose of preparing a quote to be included in the tender.
	
	
	Following a successful tender, Unity entered into an agreement with BCS dated 27 September 2013 (the Agreement) to design and install the system at a cost of $520,744.
	
	
	Activate Fire entered into an agreement with Unity to design and install the system. Hanna Plumbing entered into an agreement with Activate Fire to supply the labour to fabricate and install the system. Activate Fire retained the responsibility for providing a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) for the work, certifying the system and for arranging materials to be ordered and delivered to site.
	
	
	BCS appointed EPM Projects Pty Ltd (EPM) to act on its behalf as a project manager and to liaise with Unity as to the progress of the work. [2]  EPM were the designated Superintendent in the Agreement.
	
	
	Peter Wells was the Property Asset Manager of BCS and its onsite representative for the work. Mr Wells was based at the facility and usually present for 2-3 days a week. He had responsibility for 9 aged care facilities operated by BCS between Forster and the Queensland border. David Watt, the Maintenance Supervisor of BCS and Nathan Don reported to Mr Wells. Deidre Moylan was the Manager of the facility and responsible for its overall operation.
	
	
	It was agreed at the commencement of the work that Mr Wells was to be notified if the work would affect the operation of the facility. Mr Wells would then consult the necessary BCS personnel and notify Unity if there were any conditions to be placed on when or how that work could take place. For example, on one occasion approval was given to perform work in the kitchen area after 6.30pm when the kitchen no longer required for the day.
	
	
	Activate Fire prepared a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) dated 9 September 2013 because some of the work to be performed in the installation of the system was high risk construction work as defined by clause 291 Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011 (the Regulations). The SWMS was forwarded to Unity and reviewed by David Gurtner on 30 October 2013.
	
	
	The SWMS identified the risk of electric shock when moving in or working in a roof space. The SWMS identified the relevant control measures to respond to the risk as:
	



	
	noting the location of services and avoiding them; and
	
	
	avoiding dropping tools or equipment.
	



	
	Before commencing work at the facility the employees of Hanna Plumbing were required to sign the SWMS prepared by Activate Fire to indicate that they had read and understood it. They were also required to undergo a site induction conducted by David Gurtner.
	
	
	The installation of the system began in about October 2013.
	
	
	From that time, David Gurtner, Mr Chapman and Mr Stalder had further access to the roof spaces of the facility for the purpose of measuring up to design and fabricate parts of the system.
	
	
	The administration wing was one of the last areas to have the system installed.
	
	
	The roof of the administration wing was constructed of metal trusses covered by metal roof sheeting. Steel furring channels were attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The furring channels were made of sheet metal, bent into a U-shape. The furring channels were affixed perpendicular to the roof trusses. The gyprock ceiling of the administration wing was fixed to the flat underside of the furring channels with self-tapping screws (the screws). The furring channels had sharp edges and there were a number of screws that protruded through the gyprock, the furring channels and in places pieces of timber that had been installed to support the inclusion of air-conditioning vents and other structures.
	
	
	The installation work in the roof space took place over 7 days. The first 2 days involved the installation of the sprinkler heads and then fitting them with a flexible hose connection that would be ultimately connected to the main. That work was completed a few weeks or months before the installation of the main. This work required one of the Hanna Plumbing employees to be present in the roof space to determine the correct positioning of the sprinkler heads in the ceiling.
	
	
	During this work, Mr Stalder gave evidence that he assessed the roof space for risks to safety. He determined that when the main was to be installed that he would he need an extra manhole installed in the ceiling of the administration wing to provide a safe means of accessing the roof space and that he would remove the metal roof sheets to provide natural light, ventilation and better access to an alternate method of access to the roof space at that time.
	
	
	Mr Stalder observed that the wiring in the roof space as “sloppy”. The wires were everywhere, not contained in conduit or cable trays, lying on top of one another and going in all different directions. Mr Stalder identified the risk of cutting the wires by standing on them and causing them to come in contact with the sharp edges of the furring channels. Mr Stalder did not notice the sharp points of the screws in the roof space.
	
	
	Mr Stalder discussed his assessment with Mr Chapman and David Gurtner.
	
	
	He told Mr Chapman that the installation of the main in the roof space was going to take more time because the workers would have to be extra careful because of the risk posed by the location of the wires on top of the steel furring channels. He told Mr Chapman that it was worse than the Triangle (another roof space) because of the presence of the furring channels. The Triangle roof space was constructed from timber and did not present as serious a risk of cutting the wires by treading on them. The roof space was the only area constructed using the furring channels and it presented a “definite” risk of the wires being cut.
	
	
	Mr Stalder told David Gurtner that the wiring was really sloppy and that the workers were going to have to be really careful and to take extra measures.
	
	
	On 20 January 2014 Mr Chapman rang Mr Stalder and asked for his input into an email to be sent to Peter Gurtner. Earlier that day, Mr Stalder and Mr Chapman had been in the Triangle roof space measuring up for the installation of the main in that area. Mr Stalder told Mr Chapman in that telephone conversation that it was going to be a difficult install because of the location of the cables in the roof space.
	
	
	The email [3]  was sent on 20 January 2014 at about 11.45pm by Mr Chapman to Peter Gurtner, David Gurtner and copied to Mr Stalder. The email relevantly read, after making reference to being in the Triangle roof space earlier in the day:
	


I have great concerns from an EH&S prospective (sic) due to the amount of electrical cable, mechanical duct work and just the extreme difficulty within this roof space and the heat conditions in which the subcontractors are working in.

Hanna and his team have done a fantastic job and have worked extremely hard, however, extreme caution needs to be seriously taken into consideration here as I’m very concern (sic) for their safety. I have reiterated the need to make sure tool box talks are held every day and review there (sic) JSA whilst working in both roof spaces going forward for the Triangle and the administration building which is even a higher risk.

Both of us do not want to see anyone get hurt “As safety comes first” but once you have an actual walk around in this roof space you would really get an appreciation on how difficult it is from both a design perspective to fabricate pipe & installation prospective (sic).

Peter, we are continuing to do the best possible job for you with the same interest in BCS but we cannot afford to question the safety aspects of these last 2 areas to be completed as one serious accident will undo all the good work which has been done to date… [4] 


	
	On 21 January 2014 Peter Gurtner replied, relevantly including the paragraph, “Lets ensure that we carry out those meetings as necessary and ensure the safety of the staff and workers at all times”.
	
	
	After at least the end of January 2014 a tool box talk was held each morning before work commenced at the site. Present were the Hanna Plumbing employees, Mr Stalder, Dylan Stalder, Tom Rayward and Mr Gumbleton and David Gurtner. At those meetings the scope of the work to be performed and how it was going to be done was discussed. Dylan Stalder gave evidence that the risk of an electric shock from damage caused to the wires by treading on them and severing them on the furring channels was a matter that was discussed in the daily tool box talks held with David Gurtner.
	
	
	The remaining 5 days of work in the roof space involved the fabrication of and the installation of the main. That work began on Monday 10 March 2014 and continued until about 11.30am on 14 March 2014 when Mr Gumbleton was injured.
	
	
	The system of work adopted in the roof space to install the main can be described as follows. The workers removed the metal roof sheets of the administration wing to provide for natural light, ventilation and access to the roof space for workers and to allow the steel pipe that was to be installed as the main to be carried in. Access for the workers to the roof space was also provided via the manhole that had been installed in the ceiling of the administration wing as part of the works. The workers placed pieces of timber on top of the furring channels and between them to stand and walk on. These pieces of timber were referred to as “walkboards”. The workers then moved any wiring out of the way with their hands and secured it with pieces of timber, referred to as “noggins”. Noggins were pieces of timber about 90mm by 35mm and about 1200mm long [5]  that were placed against the wires and secured in place by the weight of the noggin. The noggins were recycled by moving them to a different location when the workers had completed the installation of the main in a particular area.
	
	
	On the morning of the incident, Mr Gumbleton was assisting Dylan Stalder to install the main in the roof space. Dylan Stalder was a licensed plumber and Mr Gumbleton was employed as a labourer.
	
	
	About 1.5m away from the manhole in the ceiling to the roof space there was a screw protruding through a piece of timber installed to support an air-conditioning duct (the duct). At an earlier point in time, a double insulated electrical lighting cable (the cable) had become positioned on top of the sharp point of the screw and underneath the duct. When Mr Gumbleton leant on the duct, the cable was punctured by the screw and electrical current was conducted through the duct. Mr Gumbleton suffered an electric shock because at the time he was touching the steel pipe that he had been installing as part of the system. The steel pipe acted as an earth and allowed the electrical current to flow through Mr Gumbleton’s body.
	
	
	Dylan Stalder alerted Mr Stalder to the fact that Mr Gumbleton had collapsed in the roof space. Dylan Stalder left the roof space to turn off the power supply. He was shown where it was in the office and he turned off the main switch.
	
	
	CPR was commenced in the roof space and an ambulance was called. During the course of CPR, Mr Gumbleton fell through the gyprock ceiling and onto the floor of the administration wing.
	
	
	Mr Gumbleton suffered serious injury as a result of the electric shock that included hypoxic brain damage.
	
	
	At about 1.50pm on 14 March 2014, William Barlin, an electrical inspector employed by Essential Energy, attended the facility to make the site safe following a report that there had been an electrical accident. Mr Barlin was eminently qualified and had been employed by Essential Energy or its predecessors for 46 years. [6]  Mr Barlin checked that the 2 distribution boards that had been danger tagged were properly isolated to ensure that it was safe to go into the roof space. Mr Barlin conducted a visual inspection from on top of the roof, but could not identify any problem from that view. He then proceeded to use a step ladder to gain access into the roof space through where the gyprock ceiling had collapsed. From that perspective, Mr Barlin identified the cable that had been pierced by the screw underneath the duct. Mr Barlin observed that the wiring in the roof space was not protected from the sharp edges present. Mr Barlin prepared a report dated 18 March 2014 requiring that the wiring in the roof space be rectified on the basis that the cables were in a located in areas where they were likely to become damaged and that they were not protected from the sharp edges of the building materials used. Both of those matters were reported by Mr Barlin to be in breach of Australian Standard AS/NZS 3000:2007 (the Wiring Rules).
	
	
	After the incident, Unity engaged an electrician to tidy up the wiring in the roof space. The wires were bundled together and placed in conduit and hung up off the ceiling. The work was completed in an area of about 2m2. Unity did not seek payment for the completion of that work.
	
	
	Unity recommended to BCS that it install residual current devices (RCDs) on the lighting circuits throughout the facility. That work was completed for the lighting circuits to the administration wing by electricians retained by BCS. I infer that it was accepted by BCS that the installation of the RCDs was outside the scope of works provided for by the Agreement.
	
	
	Activate Fire directed Hanna Plumbing not to complete the work in the roof space until the RCDs were installed on the lighting circuits.
	
	
	Unity also made a request to BCS that the power to the administration wing be isolated prior to the resumption of the installation work in the roof space. That request was approved on condition that the work be completed after 12.30pm on 28 March 2014.
	
	
	The work in the roof space was completed 28 March 2014 within about 4 hours.
	


Issues


	
	The issues to be determined are;
	



	
	Did the defendants owe a health and safety duty?
	
	
	Did the defendants fail to comply with their health and safety duties by failing to take the steps particularised in the Summons?
	
	
	Did the defendants’ breach of duty expose Mr Gumbleton to a risk of death or serious injury?
	


The elements of the offence


	
	The prosecution bears the onus of proving the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Section 32 of the Act provides:
	


A person commits a Category 2 offence if:


	
	the person has a health and safety duty, and
	
	
	the person fails to comply with that duty, and
	
	
	the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness.
	



	
	The elements of the offence are:
	


Element 1   The defendant was conducting a business or undertaking;

Element 2   The defendant owed a health and safety duty to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, to ensure the health and safety of;


	
	workers engaged by it or caused to be engaged by it and workers whose activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed by it;
	
	
	while the workers were at work in the business or undertaking;
	


Element 3   The defendant failed to comply with its health and safety duty; and

Element 4   The failure exposed an individual to a risk of death or serious injury.


	
	The defendants conceded that Element 1 was established in respect of each of them.
	


The relevant law


	
	The offence is one of strict liability: section 12A of the Act.
	
	
	A person is a “worker” if the person carries out work in any capacity for a person conducting a business or undertaking, including work as an employee, a contractor or subcontractor or an employee of a contractor or subcontractor: section 7 of the Act.
	
	
	A health and safety duty is owed to “workers” as provided for by section 19(1) of the Act that provides:
	



	
	A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of:
	



	
	workers engaged, or caused to be engaged by the person, and
	
	
	workers whose activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed by the person,
	


while the workers are at work in the business or undertaking.


	
	A health and safety duty is owed to “other persons” as provided for by section 19(2) of the Act that provides:
	



	
	A person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of other persons is not put at risk from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking.
	



	
	The term “other persons” when used in section 19(2) is a reference to persons other than “workers” who are provided for by section 19(1): SafeWork New South Wales v Rawson Homes Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 237.
	
	
	The content of the duty is set out in section 19(3) of the Act that relevantly provides:
	


(3)   Without limiting subsections (1) and (2), a person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable:

(a)   the provision and maintenance of a work environment without risks to health and safety, and

(c)   the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work, and

(d)   the safe use, handling and storage of plant, structures and substances, and

(f)   the provision of any information, training, instruction or supervision that is necessary to protect all persons from risks to their health and safety arising from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking, and

(g)   that the health of workers and the conditions at the workplace are monitored for the purpose of preventing illness or injury of workers arising from the conduct of the business or undertaking.


	
	The inclusive list of specific obligations set out in section 19(3) of the Act has each been identified at common law.
	
	
	The prosecution bears the onus of proving as an element of the offence that at the time of the offence that it was reasonably practical to ensure the health and safety of the persons alleged to be at risk. The risk should be identified with sufficient precision to determine if it was reasonably practical to eliminate the risk, or if not, if it was reasonably practical to minimise it. In this way the application of reasonable practicability may arise more than once. [7] 
	
	
	“Reasonably practicable” is defined in section 18 of the Act. The Court must take into account and weigh up all relevant matters including;
	



	
	the likelihood of the risk concerned occurring, and
	
	
	the degree of harm that might result from the risk, and
	
	
	what the defendant knows or ought reasonably to know about;
	



	
	the risk, and
	
	
	(ii)   ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, and
	



	
	the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk, and
	
	
	after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with either of those options, including whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to the risk.
	



	
	The state of knowledge applied to the definition of practicable is objective. It is that possessed by persons generally who are engaged in the relevant field of activity and not by reference to the actual knowledge of a specific defendant in particular circumstances: Laing O’Rourke (BMC) Pty Ltd v Kirwin [2011] WASCA 117 at [33].
	
	
	The reasonably practicable requirement applies to matters which are within the power of the defendant to control, supervise and manage: Slivak v Lurgi (Aust) Pty Ltd (2001) 205 CLR 304 at [37] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ.
	
	
	The word “risk” is not defined in the Act. Risk should not be interpreted in a complicated fashion. Safety cannot be ensured if a risk is present. The presence of a risk to the health or safety of a worker constitutes a breach of section 19 of the Act. It is not necessary that there be a particular accident, or that a person is actually injured. What is required is the creation of the risk. The relevant risk for the commission of the section 32 offence is a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	An incident causing injury may be evidence of the presence of a risk and may be relevant to sentencing as a measure of the severity of the harm suffered as a result of the risk. But a distinction must be drawn between the specific risk that manifested in the incident and the general class of risk that the analysis must focus on. Paying too close attention to the specific risk resulting in an incident can lead to error: Tangerine Confectionery Ltd and Veolia ES (UK) Ltd v R [2011] EWCA Crim 2015.
	
	
	The phrase “exposed to risks” contained in section 8(2) Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 was interpreted to mean that a person was sufficiently proximate to the source of a risk for the risk to come home, irrespective of the mechanism by which that could happen: Thiess Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales (2010) 78 NSWLR 94.
	
	
	The section 19 duty requires knowledge of the risk emanating from the activities of the defendant: Slivak v Lurgi (Aust) Pty Ltd (2001) 205 CLR 304. Foreseeability of the risk to persons from the activity is an element of this question of knowledge. It would not generally be practicable to take measures to guard against a risk to safety that was not reasonably foreseeable: Genner Constructions Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2001] NSWIRComm 267 at [68].
	
	
	The statutory duty is not limited to simply preventing foreseeable risks of injury. The duty is to protect against all risks, if that is reasonably practicable. Reasonably practicable means something narrower than physically possible or feasible: Slivak at [53] per Gaudron J.
	
	
	The words reasonably practicable indicate that the duty does not require a defendant to take every possible step that could be taken. The steps to be taken in performance of the duty are those that are reasonably practicable for the employer to achieve the provision of and maintenance of a safe working environment. Bare demonstration that a step might have had some effect on the safety of a working environment, does not without more demonstrate a breach of the duty: Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v R (2012) 246 CLR 92 at [15] and [38] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ.
	
	
	An employer must have a proactive approach to safety issues. The question is not did the employer envisage a particular danger, but rather should it have: WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Kellogg (Aust) Pty Ltd [1999] NSWIRComm 453.
	
	
	A defendant must have regard not only for the ideal worker but for one who is careless, inattentive or inadvertent: Dunlop Rubber Australia Ltd v Buckley (1952) 87 CLR 313 at 320 per Dixon CJ. If there is a foreseeable risk of injury arising from the employee’s negligence in carrying out his or her duties then this is a factor which the employer must take into account: Smith v Broken Hill Pty Ltd (1957) 97 CLR 337 at 343. It may not always be possible to foresee various acts of inadvertence by workers but defendants must conduct operations on the basis that such acts will occur and they must be guarded against to the fullest extent practicable.
	
	
	The relevant question on causation is whether the act or omission of the defendant was a significant or substantial cause of the worker being exposed to the risk of injury: Bulga Underground Operations v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [127].
	
	
	The question is to be determined by the application of common sense to the facts, bearing in mind that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter: Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378.
	
	
	Regard must be had to the scope and objects of the Act: Simpson Design and Associates Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 316 at [79]-[102]. The relevant question is not whether the particularised failures of the defendant was the cause of the injury to the worker, but rather whether there was a causal relationship between the act or omission and the risk to which the worker was exposed: Bulga Underground at [130].
	


Did the defendants owe Mr Gumbleton a health and safety duty? (Element 2)


	
	The prosecution pleaded that the business or undertaking of each of the defendants included the design, supply and installation of the system at the facility: [2] of the Summons.
	
	
	It was common ground that Unity entered into the Agreement to design, supply and install the system at the facility. I am satisfied that the work conducted pursuant to the Agreement was part of Unity’s business or undertaking.
	
	
	It was common ground that Activate Fire entered into a contract with Unity to design, install and certify the system at the facility. I am satisfied that the work done by Activate Fire pursuant to that contract was part of Activate Fire’s business or undertaking.
	
	
	Mr Gumbleton was an employee of Hanna Plumbing. Hanna Plumbing was a contractor to Activate Fire and a sub-contractor to Unity. Accordingly, Mr Gumbleton was a “worker” within the definition provided for in section 7(1)(c) of the Act, being an employee of a contractor or subcontractor.
	
	
	Mr Gumbleton was owed the health and safety duty provided for by section 19(1) of the Act if he was engaged or caused to be engaged by the one or both of the defendants, or if his activities were influenced or directed by one or both of the defendants.
	
	
	The words “engaged” and “caused to be engaged by” are not defined in the Act. In R v ACR Roofing Pty Ltd (2004) 11 VR 187, the Victorian Court of Appeal decided that the term “engaged” has a number of meanings according to the context in which it is used. In the legislation, “engaged” was not used lightly and it was clearly intended to have a meaning different to the word “employ” that was also used in the legislation. The definition of “engage” includes “to secure or obtain the services of” whether or not there is some contractual arrangement between the provider of the services and the person who makes use of them: per Ormiston JA. Nettle JA (as his Honour then was) with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said at [54]:
	


I consider that it would make little sense to interpret ""engaged by"" so as to restrict the operation of the section to contractors with whom the employer is in contractual relations. It does, however, make evident sense, and in my view it was intended that the expression include the engagement of any contractor in relation to matters over which the employer has control, either (a) under a contract entered into between the contactor and the employer; or (b) under a contract entered into between the contractor and some other person. Thus in my opinion a contractor could just as well be regarded as engaged by the employer in relation to matters over which the employer has control if the contractor were engaged directly by the employer under a contract with the employer, or by another contractor under a sub-contract, or by a sub-contractor under a sub, sub-contract, or under a sub, sub, sub-contract or some remoter species of sub-contract; regardless of the layers of contractual relations that might separate the contractor from the employer.


	
	The evidence was that Unity approached Hanna Plumbing with a view to contracting with it to design and install the system, based on their previous dealings relating to the installation of a similar system in an aged care facility in Grafton. Activate Fire was involved in the project at the request of Mr Stalder because of Mr Chapman’s expertise in designing and certifying the system, the need to provide a SWMS and the size of the project. The parties accordingly entered into the following contractual relationships. Unity contracted with Activate Fire to design, install and certify the system. Activate Fire then contracted with Hanna Plumbing to provide the labour to install the system. Activate Fire retained the responsibility for the provision of and implementation of the SWMS, the design and certification of the system and the ordering of and the delivery of the necessary materials to the site. At all times Unity and Activate Fire were reliant on Hanna Plumbing to provide the labour of its employees to install the system, to satisfy their respective contractual obligations.
	
	
	Adopting the reasoning of the Victorian Court of Appeal, I am satisfied that Mr Gumbleton was a worker engaged by Activate Fire and Unity because each of them contemplated at the time of entering into contracts obliging them to install the system that they would be using the services of the Hanna Plumbing employees to undertake the necessary work to do so.
	
	
	The phrase “cause to be engaged by” is a wider concept by reference to the ordinary meaning of those words. In my view the concept would extend to the facts of this case.
	
	
	If I am wrong in relation to my finding that Mr Gumbleton was engaged by the defendants then I am satisfied that he was caused to be engaged by the defendants for the same reasons.
	
	
	In the alternative, I am also satisfied that the activities of Mr Gumbleton in carrying out work were influenced or directed by the defendants for the reasons that follow.
	
	
	Mr Gumbleton’s activities in installing the system were influenced or directed by Unity in the following ways.
	
	
	Unity’s Project/Site Safety Plan (the Safety Plan) [8]  provided that the Site Foreman, David Gurtner, was responsible for assessing the ability of sub-contractors to comply with occupational health and safety requirements and to ensure that safe working practices were implemented and adhered to. That included encouraging all contractors in achieving a safe and healthy workplace by arranging tool box talks and inviting input from people relating to work processes and health and safety. The Safety Plan required the employees of contractors to have completed a General Construction Induction and to have undertaken a site specific induction. The Safety Plan provided that all electrical work onsite must be carried out by a licensed electrician.
	
	
	David Gurtner of Unity provided the site specific induction to the Hanna Plumbing employees, including Mr Gumbleton.
	
	
	Unity required Mr Gumbleton to sign a document entitled “Site Employee Induction and Registration” on the day of his site specific induction. The form required Mr Gumbleton to acknowledge that he had undertaken the site specific induction and to indicate that he agreed to accept the direction of Unity’s officers regarding the provision of a “hazard free working environment”. [9] 
	
	
	David Gurtner of Unity arranged the daily tool box meetings with the Hanna Plumbing employees where safety matters were discussed, including the risk that was posed by the state of the wiring in the roof space and the materials used to construct it.
	
	
	Finally, David Gurtner was present onsite and monitored the progress of the work carried out by the Hanna Plumbing employees. He often directed them to undertake tasks such as cleaning up after finishing a task. He was also responsible for liaising with Mr Wells as to the timing of certain parts of the work or concerning under what conditions certain parts of the work could be done. For instance, if the Hanna Plumbing employees needed to go into resident’s rooms to fit the sprinkler heads, David Gurtner was responsible for obtaining BCS’s consent from Mr Wells to that course and communicating the results of those matters to the employees of Hanna Plumbing.
	
	
	Mr Gumbleton’s activities in installing the system were influenced or directed by Activate Fire in the following ways.
	
	
	Hanna Plumbing was contracted to Activate Fire to provide the labour necessary to install the system. It can be inferred from the conduct of the parties to the contract that the Hanna Plumbing employees installed the system in accordance with the design provided for by Activate Fire.
	
	
	Activate Fire produced the SWMS that governed the work of the Hanna Plumbing employees at the facility. A SWMS was required for the installation work because it was high risk construction work. The SWMS was required to describe the measures to be implemented to control any risks identified and how those measures would be implemented, monitored or reviewed. It had to be prepared taking into account the circumstances at the workplace that may affect the way the high risk construction work was carried out; clause 299 of the Regulations. The work was required to be carried out in accordance with the SWMS: clause 300 of the Regulations. This was the clearest indication that the activities of Mr Gumbleton involved with installing the system were influenced or directed by Activate Fire, because Hanna Plumbing was required by law to perform the work in accordance with the content of the SWMS that was prepared by Activate Fire. If it did not do so it exposed itself to criminal sanction, being a maximum fine of $30,000.
	
	
	Mr Chapman also attended the facility from time to time and was in regular telephone contact with Mr Stalder about how to undertake the work. This included consulting with Mr Stalder and devising the system of work referred to in the email to Peter Gurtner dated 20 January 2014 that required the daily tool box talks to review the safety requirements of the work in the Triangle and the roof space.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Chapman was responsible for ordering the materials required to fabricate the system and have them delivered to site.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gumbleton that each of the defendants owed Mr Gumbleton a health and safety duty pursuant to section 19(1) of the Act.
	
	
	Having determined that Mr Gumbleton was a “worker” of the kind provided for by section 19(1), I would apply the decision of Judge Kearns SC in Rawson Homes, to the effect that Mr Gumbleton could not be an “other person” provided for in section 19(2) of the Act.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has established Element 2.
	
	
	It follows that in determining the balance of the case that I have only had reference to the particulars pleaded in Annexure A to the Summons, that relate the health and safety duty provided for by section 19(1) of the Act.
	


The pleading relating to the issue of risk


	
	The prosecution particularised the risk in [6] of the Summons as:
	


The risk was the risk of persons being electrocuted by coming into contact with live electrical wiring whilst working in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	The prosecution went on to plead at [9] of the Summons that, “[T]he injuries sustained by Mr Gumbleton were a manifestation of the risk”.
	
	
	Activate Fire [10]  complained that the pleaded risk did not exist in the roof space because at no time did Mr Gumbleton come into direct contact with live electrical wiring. Rather, he came into contact with the duct that had been energised which was at best indirect contact with live electrical wiring.
	
	
	The defendants contended that it was clear from the pleading that the prosecution relied on the incident to prove the existence of the risk. It was submitted that the prosecution should not be permitted to depart from the particulars pleaded if to do so would result in an unfair trial: R v Saffron (No 1) (1988) 17 NSWLR 395 at 448.
	
	
	The unfairness relied on was an ambiguity in the pleaded risk, because it was said that the risk and measures to be taken are related in that one informs the other: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority (NSW) (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [14].
	
	
	The defendants urged the Court to restrict the case to one dealing with direct contact rather than indirect contact with live electrical wiring so as not to expand the particulars beyond the case that the defendants could meet.
	
	
	I response the prosecution made 2 submissions. First, it contended that it was a matter of common knowledge that a person was at risk of an electric shock by coming into indirect contact with live electrical wiring.
	
	
	Section 144 Evidence Act 1995 provides that proof is not required of a matter that is not reasonably open to question and is capable of verification by reference to a document of authority that cannot reasonably be questioned.
	
	
	The prosecution then referred me to paragraphs 1.5.3 and 1.4.35 of the Wiring Rules. The effect of those extracts is that the Wiring Rules identify that protection is required form both direct and indirect contact with conductive parts, including electrical wiring. Indirect contact is defined as coming into contact with a conductive part that is not normally live but has become live under fault conditions, including an insulation failure. Whereas direct contact is defined as contact with a conductor or conductive part that is live in normal service.
	
	
	The Wiring Rules were published by Standards Australia on 12 November 2007. Australian Standards are well recognised as a consensus of professional opinion and practical experience to sensible, safe precautions and a standard of reasonable conduct. An Australian Standard can assist a court in determining whether a danger exists that must be guarded against by the exercise of reasonable care: Onetech Pty Ltd v Shaw [1999] WASCA 289 at [17], Fitzpatrick v Job [2007] WASCA 63 at [94] and M R and R C Smith Pty Ltd trading as Ultra Tune (Osborne Park) v Wyatt (No 2) [2012] WASCA 110 at [70].
	
	
	Section 144 Evidence Act 1995 permits the Court to notice certain notorious facts of which ordinary persons are aware. It can do so after being reminded of those facts by reference to appropriate information or evidence. The Court may make reference to works of reference or authority to remind it of what it knows. “Knowledge” of which proof is not required under section 144 is not strictly evidence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [75]-[76] per Spigelman J with whom the other 4 members of the Court agreed.
	
	
	Second, the prosecution submitted that the evidence served in the prosecution brief could be relied on to inform the adequacy of the particulars in determining whether the particulars were sufficient to inform a defendant of the case it was required to meet: GPI (General) Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 157 at [39] per Hodgson JA, Allsop P reserving his position and Basten JA not deciding the point.
	
	
	The evidence demonstrated that the workers understood that they were at risk of electric shock by damaging the wiring as a result of the cables to coming into contact with the sharp edges of the furring channels. Objectively viewed, there was also a risk of damaging the cables as a result of them coming into contact with the sharp points of the screws. Notwithstanding that none of the witnesses who gave evidence noticed the screws in the roof space they presented an obvious risk of causing damage to the cables in the roof space. The photographs of the roof space depict that there were numerous screws that posed that hazard. The risk identified by the evidence was not one of electric shock caused by indirect contact.
	
	
	Mr Barlin’s evidence confirmed that the workers in the roof space were at risk of electric shock by coming into wiring that had its insulation damaged by any means, including being gnawed on by rodents.
	
	
	I would understand the pleading in [9] of the Summons to be an allegation that the injury to Mr Gumbleton was caused by the breach of duty alleged against each of the defendants. That is not an element of the offence and is not required to be pleaded or proven. It is irrelevant except as to penalty or to indicate that the prosecution intended to rely on the incident as evidence of the existence of the risk. Section 16(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that no objection can be taken or allowed the Summons [11]  on the grounds of any variance between it and the evidence adduced in the proceedings for the offence.
	
	
	In this case, the injury to Mr Gumbleton was not evidence of the existence of the pleaded risk, but it was evidence that the risk of electric shock was a real one. The evidence of the injury to Mr Gumbleton is available to reject the submission advanced by the defendants that Mr Gumbleton was “a bird on a wire” when working in the roof space and unlikely to suffer an electric shock, because he would not have been earthed. I will return to this point shortly.
	
	
	The evidence of the existence of the pleaded risk comes from the identification of the risk in the SWMS prepared by Activate Fire, the conditions of the roof space, the ensuing discussions and correspondence about those matters between Mr Stalder, Mr Chapman, Peter Gurtner and David Gurtner and the knowledge of the pleaded risk by the Hanna Plumbing employees.
	
	
	Whilst the first submission of the prosecution has considerable force and is capable of acceptance, it is only relevant to the causation of Mr Gumbleton’s injury and that is not a matter I have to decide in coming to a verdict. It may become relevant when determining the extent of the extent of the injury, loss or damage caused by the offence when and if I am required to sentence one or both of the defendants, if I find either or both of them guilty of the offence.
	
	
	The issue should be determined in favour of the defendants and I will decide the case on the basis that the risk pleaded was one of electric shock caused by direct contact with live electrical wires in the event that the wires were damaged in the course of the work.
	


Did the defendants fail to comply with their health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [7] of the Summons? (Element 3)


	
	The prosecutor is required to demonstrate the particular measures that should have been taken to prevent the risk identified: Kirk at [37].
	
	
	In order to find the defendant guilty of the offence I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it failed to comply with its health and safety duty in that it failed to take one of the reasonably practicable steps set out in the particulars of breach in [7](a)-(f) of the Summons.
	
	
	In order to understand the matters pleaded in [7] of the summons it is necessary to set out the following matters.
	
	
	The cable that was responsible for Mr Gumbleton’s electric shock was a lighting cable connected to distribution board 9. When Stage 2 was completed in 2004 the Wiring Rules did not require the installation of RCDs to be installed on lighting circuits. An RCD is designed to break the circuit it is attached to within 0.4 of a second of the device detecting a leakage of one 30,000th of an ampere.
	
	
	The likelihood of the pleaded risk occurring was moderate. It was more likely to occur in the roof space because of the presence of the furring channels and the screws. The potential consequences were grave in that an electric shock was likely to cause serious injury or even death to any worker in the roof space. I do not accept the submission that the workers in the roof space were “birds on a wire” meaning that they were unlikely to receive an electric shock because of they were unlikely to have been earthed. First, the evidence did not support the submission that in particular Activate Fire knew that to be true. The evidence does not establish what Mr Chapman knew about this issue. Second, it was the risk that the worker could receive an electric shock that needed to be eliminated or minimised and as was demonstrated by the incident that risk could come home.
	
	
	Activate Fire and Unity had actual knowledge of the risk involved with the work in the roof space by reason of the information provided to them by Mr Stalder that was discussed in person, in correspondence, on the telephone and in tool box talks. Mr Stalder also advised Activate Fire and Unity of the steps he was taking to minimise the risk by using walkboards and noggins and by directing the Hanna Plumbing employees to proceed with the work slowly and carefully (the behavioural controls).
	
	
	I will now turn to each of the particulars of breach.
	


7(a)      Ensuring a competent person (such as a licensed electrician or an experienced electrical engineer) was engaged to conduct an electrical safety assessment, which included an inspection of the wiring in the roof space of the administration wing and the lighting circuits on distribution board 9, before the installation work commenced in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	It is clear that if the electrical services in the roof space needed to be inspected then that had to be done by a qualified person such as a licensed electrician.
	
	
	The defendants contended that because the wiring in the roof space would have had to have been certified after the completion of Stage 2 that conducting an electrical safety assessment was not reasonably practical. I reject that submission. The ad hoc location of the wiring of the roof space, together with the presence of the sharp edges of the furring channels and the sharp points of the screws protruding through the ceiling in numerous places presented a specific danger to workers in the roof space against which precautions were required to be taken and the defendants could not merely rely on the fact that the electrical work had been certified.
	
	
	The problem with particular (a) is that the prosecution did not lead to evidence to define what was meant by an “electrical safety assessment”. The evidence was that there were a number of services present in the roof space that used electricity or otherwise were energised. There were powered components of the air-conditioning system, data and telecommunications cables, general power outlets (GPOs), lighting cables and other power cables. The circuitry diagrams for the roof space indicated that some of the power supplied to the administration wing for which the cabling ran through the roof space was connected to distribution board 1 as well as distribution board 9. The defendants successfully demonstrated in cross-examination that an electrical safety assessment if it was conducted with a view to ensuring safety may have been a lengthy, complex and expensive task. The prosecution did not lead evidence as to the cost involved with the electrical safety assessment.
	
	
	The particular does not demonstrate what effect conducting an electrical safety assessment would have had on the provision of a safe working environment. I am not satisfied that the carrying out of an electrical safety assessment would have detected the cable that was responsible for the electric shock suffered by Mr Gumbleton, although that was possible. The cable was located under the duct and in an area that was not visible from the manhole or from above. Mr Barlin gave evidence that it was not readily apparent to him on his inspection of the roof space after the incident, notwithstanding he knew that he was looking for a problem. Mr Barlin located the problem through the hole in the ceiling caused by Mr Gumbleton’s fall. I would infer that the cable was not in a position that could have been readily seen by a person working in the roof space. Merely conducting an electrical safety assessment, would not have affected the provision of a safe working environment unless the cable had been detected in the precarious position that it was.
	
	
	The particular did not require the defendants to implement any suggestion provided for by the licensed electrician after conducting the electrical safety assessment. There is no evidence as to what a licensed electrician may have suggested was required to be done after the completion of an electrical safety assessment or whether those matters were reasonably practical.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has established particular (a).
	


7(b)   Ensuring a competent person (such as a licensed electrician or an experienced electrical engineer) was engaged to install residual current device protection on the lighting circuits on distribution board 9 before the installation work commenced in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	This particular is of narrower compass to particular (a). It required the defendants to identify that the workers were at risk from the lighting cables in the roof space. There is no evidence that any of the relevant personnel from Unity, Activate Fire or Hanna Plumbing had the requisite specialised knowledge to identify that the risk identified was posed by the lighting cables from distribution board 9. The evidence was that there were also lighting cables running through the roof space that were connected to distribution board 1.
	
	
	The particular focusses on the precise risk rather than the pleaded risk. The pleaded risk was posed by all of the electrical cabling in the roof space, although I note that the power circuits relating to the GPOs in the administration wing were already fitted with RCDs. There is an identifiable element of hindsight involved with particular (b).
	
	
	The Wiring Rules did not require the installation of RCDs on the lighting circuits for the administration wing at the time of their installation or subsequently.
	
	
	The installation of RCDs would have cost about $200 per lighting circuit plus the cost of having a licensed electrician to install them. There were 5 lighting circuits connected to distribution board 9. There is no evidence of the quantum of the installation costs, but the evidence is that the work was completed shortly after the incident. The work was completed by an electrician retained by BCS and paid for by them because that work was not within the scope of works covered by the Agreement. The installation of the RCDs was required by the defendants, particularly Unity, before the installation work could recommence. I am satisfied that the cost incurred by the defendants to require BCS to install the RCDs was not grossly disproportionate to the risk.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that it was reasonably practical for the defendants to have identified the need for the installation of RCDs on the lighting circuits to distribution board 9 because none of the relevant personnel were qualified to identify that the risk was posed by those particular cables.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has established particular (b).
	


7(c)   Ensuring that the power to the administration wing of the premises was isolated and proven dead (de-energised) prior to the commencement of the installation work in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	The evidence was that Mr Wells and Mr Watt had been trained on how to isolate the distribution boards at the facility. Mr Wells gave evidence that he had been required to do that from time to time, which he estimated to be once or twice a year during his 14 years of service with BCS.
	
	
	The administration wing had its own electricity supply and it could be isolated at the distribution boards in the administration wing or at the main distribution board in the service quarters. Mr Wells gave evidence that he had isolated the power supply to the administration wing every 6 months since the completion of the building in 2004, to allow the RCDs to be tested by an electrician. The isolation of the power for the administration wing did not affect the other areas of the facility, including the residential buildings.
	
	
	Following the incident, David Gurtner on behalf of Unity made a request to Mr Wells to shut down the power to the administration wing during the completion of the installation work in the roof space. Mr Wells responded in an e-mail dated 24 March 2014 [12]  that the request was approved from 12.30pm on Friday 28 March 2014. Mr Wells asked David Gurtner to liaise with Mr Watt about the shut down and asked Unity to ensure that certain isolation procedures were followed. Mr Watt was copied in on the e-mail sent by Mr Wells.
	
	
	Mr Wells also verbally instructed Mr Watt to make sure that when the power was shut down that the distribution board was “tagged out” by Unity. Mr Watt had the keys to the distribution boards and the requisite knowledge as to how to isolate the power.
	
	
	On 28 March 2014 Mr Wells was not present at the facility. Mr Wells had a telephone conversation with Mr Watt on 28 March 2014 and Mr Wells had no reason to respond to what he had been told. I infer from that evidence that Mr Watt had complied with Mr Well’s instruction to participate in the isolation of the power to the administration wing on 28 March 2014 and to ensure that the relevant isolation procedures were followed.
	
	
	Mr Stalder gave evidence that he believed that the power to the administration wing was off when the work recommenced. Mr Chapman said in his record of interview that the power was not isolated for the remainder of the installation work after the incident. I would prefer the evidence of Mr Stalder on this issue because it was corroborated by the evidence of Mr Wells and Mr Chapman did not state the basis for his understanding, including whether or not he was present onsite on 28 March 2014.
	
	
	There were 4 or 5 administration staff that worked in the administration wing. The staff were either relocated to other offices throughout the facility or they worked in the administration wing, with no power, during the time that the power was isolated on 28 March 2014. There was no need to relocate any of the office equipment because there was other equipment available for them to use in the other offices.
	
	
	The installation work was completed in about half a day. The power shut down involved no cost to BCS. There was no impact to the power supply to other parts of the facility.
	
	
	The Hanna Plumbing workers removed the roof sheets to provide natural light and ventilation when the work was completed. Power was not required to operate the tools that the Hanna Plumbing workers were using in the roof space to carry out the work.
	
	
	Prior to the incident, there was no request made of BCS to isolate the power to the administration wing.
	
	
	The defendants contended that particular (c) was not reasonably practical for the following reasons:
	



	
	the Agreement required Unity to conduct the work with minimum nuisance to the residents and to ensure their safety;
	
	
	that there were a number of other services present in the roof space that used electricity or were energised, and that to eliminate the risk the power to all of those services needed to be shut down, which would in turn have affected the residents. This may have included the shut-down of essential medical equipment required by the residents of the facility; and
	
	
	to effect a complete isolation would have required the hire of a portable generator at a cost of approximately $180,000, together with the costs associated with connecting it and disconnecting it as required.
	



	
	I am not satisfied that the risk could have been eliminated by isolating the power to the administration wing by reason of the presence of the other powered services running through the roof space.
	
	
	However, the relevant enquiry does not stop there: section 17 of the Act.
	
	
	Particular (c) requires the isolation of the power to the administration wing. That would have resulted in the de-energising of the lighting cables in the roof space that serviced the administration wing. The GPO circuits in the administration wing were protected by RCDs and isolation of the power to those circuits would not have added much more protection, if the RCDs operated as they were designed to. The isolation of the power to the administration wing would have had the effect of removing the risk of an electric shock from some of the cabling running through the roof space and that was a step that in combination with the behavioural controls that would have minimised the risk.
	
	
	It was submitted by Activate Fire that the behavioural controls provided more protection than was usually provided by similar controls because they created distance between the worker and the cabling by elevating the worker above the wiring on the walkboards and by moving the wiring aside by using the noggins. I do not accept that submission. The workers were still exposed to the risk if they were careless or inadvertent in carrying out the work and that is the usual position with systems of work that involve only behavioural controls.
	
	
	The isolation of the power was an engineering control that removed the risk from inadvertent or careless departure from the behavioural controls by the workers. In the present case the workers were in a confined space and in close proximity to sharp edges and screws that could damage the wiring. If the power to a cable was isolated, the worker would have been protected if despite their best efforts to avoid it and/or handle it carefully it was severed by the worker accidentally treading on it, falling on it or by hitting it with a tool. That protection against inadvertent contact was not and could not be provided for by the behavioural controls.
	
	
	The installation work took place over 7 days. The isolation of the power to the administration building would have required the relocation of the staff for that period. I am satisfied the administration staff could have been relocated at no cost to BCS because there were other offices and other equipment available for them to use at the facility.
	
	
	Mr Wells and Mr Watt had the requisite knowledge to undertake the isolation of the relevant distribution boards. I am satisfied that Mr Watt undertook that task on 28 March 2014 when the installation work resumed.
	
	
	The isolation of the power to the administration wing did not affect any other parts of the facility. Accordingly there was no need for the hire of a generator. I would pause to note that I have not relied on the bulk of Peter Gurtner’s evidence. His evidence was exaggerated and unreliable. He gave evidence that was intended to advocate Unity’s cause, of which the evidence about the hire of the generator was a prime example. He failed in his response to the section 155 notice or in his evidence to differentiate what measures may have been reasonably practicable as opposed to what he believed to be practicable. Further, by reference to his demeanour in the witness box I was not satisfied that he gave reliable or truthful evidence.
	
	
	There was some evidence that the lighting in the car park and the emergency lighting in the administration area could have been affected. The work was being completed during the day with the use of natural light. There is no evidence to suggest why the power could not have been restored when the work was completed at the end of each day.
	
	
	The work could have been completed without the provision of power in the roof space, as it was after the incident.
	
	
	The defendants both relied on evidence to the effect that it was their collective experience that isolation of the power to services running through a roof space was not something that was done. Unity, for its part accepted that the risk had to be determined according to the conditions in a particular location [13]  and that the risk posed by the sharp edges could not be eliminated. [14]  The prevailing conditions in the roof space included the wiring not being bundled together and lying across the sharp-edged furring channels, passing through un-bushed holes in the furring channels together with the presence of numerous sharp-pointed screws protruding through the materials on the horizontal plane. The defendants were aware that the workers were required to move throughout the roof space in close proximity to the cables that were themselves in close proximity to the sharp items that could puncture or sever them and that the workers were required to move the cables to perform the work. The defendants both recognised the need for precautions to be taken to minimise the risk. The fact that the isolation of the power was not a precaution that the defendants had actually taken in the past does not determine if it was reasonably practicable. It was reasonably foreseeable that the risk of electric shock could be minimised, even if not eliminated, by the isolation of the power to the administration wing.
	
	
	The particular required the isolation of the power to the administration wing and to check that it was proven to be dead. I am satisfied that Mr Watt oversaw that process on 28 March 2014 by isolating the power and tagging out the distribution boards, which was a process to ensure that the cables had been de-energised. In other words, I am satisfied that the process required by the particular was possible and it required little effort.
	
	
	There was no cost to either of the defendants in asking BCS to isolate the power to the administration wing. Based on the evidence relating to BCS’s approval of other requests made by Unity to shut down parts of the facility to complete various aspects of the work and the evidence of the minimal disruption caused to BCS by closure of the administration wing, I would infer that BCS would have approved a request to isolate the power to the administration wing if such a request had been made prior to the incident.
	
	
	I am satisfied that having considered all of the relevant circumstances that the cost of implementing particular (c) was not grossly disproportionate to the risk.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the isolation of the power to the administration wing prior to the commencement of the installation of the system in the roof space was a reasonably practicable step to minimise the pleaded risk.
	


7(d)   In the alternative to (c), ensuring that the power to lighting circuit 13 on distribution board 9 was switched off and proven dead (de-energised) before the installation work was undertaken in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	Particular (d) is pleaded in the alternative to particular (c). It is only necessary to consider particular (d), If I am wrong in my conclusion on particular (c).
	
	
	This particular suffers from the same identifiable element of hindsight involved on particular (b). It required the identification of the particular circuit that was responsible for Mr Gumbleton’s injury by personnel who did not have the requisite specialised knowledge.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has established particular (d).
	


7(e)   Implementing a system of supervision, review and/or auditing of the installation work conducted by the sub-contractor Hanna Plumbing Pty Ltd to ensure adequate safety measures such as those identified in paragraphs (a)-(d) above were in place prior to the commencement of the work in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	I am satisfied on the evidence that both defendants were intimately familiar with the work and the safety concerns being raised in relation to the roof space. It was not through lack of supervision that the incident occurred, but the lack of a proactive approach to minimising the risk arising from conducting the work in a distinct area (the roof space) of the facility, where there was a specific risk.
	
	
	Both of the defendants and Hanna Plumbing acted on the basis of their experience, rather than determining if the isolation of the power to the administration wing was reasonably practicable.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the prosecution have proven beyond reasonable doubt that a system of supervision, review or auditing of the installation work would have had resulted in the pleaded measure being implemented. In any event I am satisfied that the defendants had a system of close supervision of the workers in place, through the daily tool box talks held between David Gurtner and the Hanna Plumbing employees and the regular contact between Mr Stalder and Mr Chapman when matters of safety were always discussed and in the circumstances where Mr Chapman assumed responsibility for the provision and implementation of the SWMS.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution have established particular (e).
	


7(f)   Checking that a safe work method statement included adequate safety measures such as those identified in paragraph (a)-(d) above was in place prior to the commencement of the installation work by Hanna Plumbing Pty Ltd in the roof space of the administration wing at the premises.


	
	A SWMS was required for the installation work because it was high risk construction work.
	
	
	The SWMS was required to be reviewed and revised in accordance with clause 38 of the Regulations; clause 302 of the Regulations.
	
	
	The SWMS was prepared by Mr Chapman on behalf of Activate Fire and provided to Unity as the principal contractor. Hanna Plumbing relied on Activate Fire to prepare the SWMS and I am satisfied that it was subject to the ongoing obligations provided for by the Regulations in relation to the SWMS.
	
	
	It is common ground that the SWMS was not reviewed before the incident, notwithstanding that the defendants decided it was wise to take extra precautions in the roof space, being control measures that were not identified in the SWMS.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that had Activate Fire undertaken the formal process of revising the SWMS after it became aware of the conditions in the roof space, as it was required to by the Regulations, that it would necessarily have included the control measure that the power to the administration wing should be isolated.
	
	
	Similarly, I am not satisfied that if Unity had reviewed the SWMS after it became aware of the conditions in the roof space, as it was required to by the Regulations, that it would include the control measure that the power to the administration wing should be isolated.
	
	
	Without that link, I am not satisfied that the pleaded measure would have had any effect on the provision or maintenance of a safe working environment.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution have established particular (f).
	


Conclusion on Element 3


	
	Based on my findings relating to particular (c) I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants breached their health and safety duty.
	


Did the defendants breach expose Mr Gumbleton to a risk of death or serious injury? (Element 4)


	
	Mr Gumbleton was exposed to the risk because he was required to work in the confines of the roof space in close proximity to the energised cables, in the presence of the sharp edges of the furring channels and the sharp points of the screws.
	
	
	That risk could have been minimised if the power to the administration wing of the facility was isolated because there would have been less cables that posed the pleaded risk by reason of the movement of the workers and/or the work being conducted in the roof space.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a causal relationship between the defendants’ failures to isolate the power to the administration wing and the exposure of Mr Gumbleton to the pleaded risk.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecutor has proved Element 4.
	


Conclusion


	
	The elements of the offence have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against each defendant.
	
	
	I find Activate Fire Pty Ltd guilty of the offence.
	
	
	I find Unity (NSW) Pty Ltd guilty of the offence.
	
	
	I will list the matters for mention on 3 April 2017 together with the matter of Hanna Plumbing with a view to listing the matters for sentence on a day convenient to the parties. It appears to me that the defendants and Hanna Plumbing may wish to take issue with the causation of the injury to Mr Gumbleton and if that was the case, it would be convenient to hear all of the parties as to penalty at the same time.

4273484,Johnston v R [2017] NSWCCA 53,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was employed by a mining company as a senior accountant. Over a period of 3 years, the applicant prepared 156 false invoices which were paid by the company into accounts controlled by the applicant. The total amount defrauded was $1,257,847.25. It was dissipated in gambling.

The applicant was charged with and pleaded guilty to a single count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.

Prior to sentencing, the applicant reached a settlement with his former employer which involved him paying the company $250, 000 in consideration of a release from further liability. The applicant had a gambling addiction and had begun therapy to address this problem, completing an eight week residential rehabilitation program prior to sentencing.

The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 6 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years. This was arrived at after allowing a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of his early guilty plea. In the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge described the offence as involving a substantial breach of trust and expressed the view that there were differences between a gambling and drug addiction for the purposes of sentencing. He stated that gambling does not physically alter a person’s mind or body and that a gambler knows what he or she is doing.

The issues on appeal were:

1. Whether the sentencing judge erred with respect to the weight he placed upon the gambling addiction and its relevance in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending;

2. Whether the sentencing judge erroneously applied a hierarchy to addiction placing the gambling addiction below that of drug addiction;

3. Whether the sentencing judge erred in his consideration of the offender’s rehabilitation by distinguishing between those who seek help at an early stage and those who seek help after being charged;

4. Whether the sentencing judge erred in placing insufficient weight upon the cumulative effect of factors in mitigation including restitution, good character and the applicant’s first-time offender status; and

5. Whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Johnson and Fagan JJ agreeing), dismissing the appeal:

The gambling addiction 

(i)    The fact that offences were committed to feed a gambling addiction will not generally be a mitigating factor at sentence, even where it is pathological. This is particularly so in cases where general deterrence is an important factor and the offences are planned and perpetrated over an extended period: [36]-[38] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

R v Molesworth [1999] NSWCCA 43; R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49; R v Huang, R v Siu (2007) 174 A Crim R 370; [2007] NSWCCA 259; Marks v R [2009] NSWCCA 24; Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136; Assi v R [2006] NSWCCA 257; Ourdi v The Queen (2009) 193 A Crim R 381; [2009] NSWCCA 46 applied.

(ii)    A gambling addiction will not generally reduce moral culpability where the offence is committed over an extended period as the offender has a degree of choice as to how they finance their addiction. The disorder will not often be connected to the crime but merely provide a motive or explanation for its commission, and is therefore only indirectly responsible for the offending conduct: [38] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

R v Grossi (2008) 183 A Crim R 15; [2008] VSCA 51 applied.

(iii)   The sentencing judge did not postulate a hierarchy of addiction placing gambling below drugs, but was simply stating that unlike some cases of drug addiction the applicant did not lack the capacity to exercise judgment nor was the crime something other than a willed act. The fact that gambling addiction is listed in DSM-V does not indicate to the contrary: [42]-[45] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111 applied.

Rehabilitation 

(iv)    There was no error in the sentencing judge’s consideration of rehabilitation. The remarks made distinguishing the applicant’s case from one where early intervention is sought go no further than saying that the circumstances of his rehabilitation meant that no sentencing option other than a custodial sentence was appropriate: [50] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

Mitigating factors and manifest excess

(v)    The failure of a sentencing judge to attribute sufficient weight to a particular matter will not generally be a material error and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention are narrowly confined. There is no discernible error in the sentencing judge’s approach: [64]-[65] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

Bland v The Queen (2014) 241 A Crim R 51; [2014] NSWCCA 82; Hanna v R [2015] NSWCCA 326 applied.

(vi)    An appellate court is not entitled to interfere with the exercise of the sentencing discretion merely because it would have arrived at a different result. For a sentence to be set aside as manifestly excessive it must be unreasonable or plainly unjust after taking all relevant matters into account: [66] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665; [1999] HCA 29; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321; [2000] HCA 54; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 applied.

(vii)    In considering the question of manifest excess it is relevant that the plea was to a “rolled up count” involving 156 fraudulent transactions, which meant the criminality involved was greater than a charge involving only one episode of criminal conduct: [68]-[70] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

R v Richard [2011] NSWSC 866; R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183; R v Glynatsis (2013) 230 A Crim R 99; [2013] NSWCCA 131; R v Donald [2013] NSWCCA 238 applied.

(viii)    The offences involved systematic defrauding in circumstances where the applicant was in a position of trust. General deterrence is of considerable importance. The offender’s prior good character is not a matter of great significance as generally only persons of good character are placed in a position of trust so as to enable the commission of these offences. The sentence is not manifestly excessive: [70]-[74] (Bathurst CJ); [76] (Johnson J); [77] (Fagan J).

R v Hawker [2001] NSWCCA 148; R v Woodman [2001] NSWCCA 310 applied.

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The applicant, Bruce Alan Johnston, (the applicant) pleaded guilty to a single count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	A sentencing hearing took place on 27 March 2015, but sentencing was deferred under s 11(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Procedure Act) for the purpose of assessing the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation by allowing him to complete an eight week rehabilitation programme in respect of his gambling addiction.
	
	
	On 5 June 2015 the applicant was sentenced to a total term of 6 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4 years. The sentence was arrived at after allowing a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of his early plea.
	
	
	The applicant has sought leave to appeal out of time against the sentence. In an affidavit filed in support of the application, the solicitor for the applicant sought to explain the reasons for the delay. It is not necessary to set out these reasons in detail as the Crown accepted in argument that “the result of the appeal … will dictate whether leave is granted or not”.   
	
	
	In Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37, the plurality stated that an application to extend time will be determined by what is required in the interests of justice, a concept which the plurality recognised could pull in different directions: Kentwell at [32]. The plurality also stated that the prospects of success, should the extension be granted, is relevant to the determination: Kentwell at [33].
	
	
	Although I do not regard Kentwell supra as stating that the prospects of success will always be the determinative factor, having regard to the Crown’s position, it is not necessary to go beyond that factor in the present case.
	


The facts


	
	The facts are straightforward. The applicant was employed by Newcrest Mining Limited (Newcrest) as a senior accountant involved in the development of the Cadia East Mine. Between 1 July 2010 and 27 August 2013, the applicant prepared a total of 156 invoices in the name of “Bramph Consulting Services”, a false entity set up by him. The invoices, which purported to be for consultancy services in respect of the Cadia Mine project, were paid by Newcrest and transferred into accounts controlled by the applicant. The total amount paid was $1,257,847.25. It was dissipated in gambling.
	
	
	The fraud was uncovered when it was revealed no GST was paid on the invoices. On 21 November 2013 the applicant was spoken to by Newcrest management and admitted his deception. He was arrested and charged on 25 July 2014.
	
	
	Other factors relevant to the sentence are contained in the sentencing judgment which I have summarised below.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had no criminal record and that at the time of sentence he was 40 years of age, married, with two children aged 7 and 6.
	
	
	The primary judge noted that since his graduation from a Bachelor of Business, majoring in Accounting and Finance, he worked in North Sydney until his relocation to Orange. He noted that the applicant was employed by “Cadia Newcrest” as a senior accountant. He noted that following his dismissal the applicant was employed as a labourer, although from 14 September 2014 to 15 February 2015 he was employed as chief financial officer with a large cherry orchard enterprise. The sentencing judge stated that the employer confirmed that the applicant was forthright regarding his offences and that he had had no qualms in offering him employment to manage the company’s finances and administration throughout the harvesting season.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was currently midway in post-graduate studies for a Master of Business Administration at Deakin University. He noted that the applicant was not suffering from any mental health issues, although he had been receiving regular psychological counselling.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had reached a confidential settlement with Newcrest. The evidence established that this involved him paying the company $250,000 in consideration of a release from further liability. The evidence also established that this effectively enabled him to preserve the family home.
	
	
	The primary judge referred to the applicant’s evidence concerning his gambling activities. He noted the applicant stated that he had a problem with gambling since he was a teenager but had not admitted to it. His Honour noted the applicant described the offences, the subject of the charge, as opportunistic.
	
	
	The sentencing judge stated that the applicant fully accepted responsibility for his offences and had made efforts to deal with his addiction by completing the St John of God residential rehabilitation program.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the applicant’s psychiatrist, Dr Krishnaswamy, had advised Community Corrections that the applicant had only just begun his therapy for an addictive disorder which required long term professional intervention to address it. The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was assessed as being at a low risk of reoffending.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that Dr Krishnaswamy expressed the view that once the applicant completed the rehabilitation at St John of God, he should continue his appointments with the gambling counsellor at Lifeline and attend Gambling Anonymous meetings. She stated that “[i]f able to participate in the above programs and with continued support from his family and social networks”, she expected that the prognosis was good. The sentencing judge noted that for the 15 months during which he had stopped gambling, he had been gainfully employed.
	
	
	The sentencing judge set out in detail a series of references attesting to the applicant’s good character.
	
	
	His Honour also set out the following 11 factors which he said would affect the appropriate sentence:
	


“1.   The offending seems to have commenced fairly shortly after he started his employment with Newcrest.

2.   The offending behaviour occurred regularly over a period of just over three years.

3.   The offender was in a position of trust.

4.   The amount defrauded was substantial.

5.   The offender appears to be an intelligent, well-educated man.

6.   There appears to have been no attempt to deal with any gambling problem at any stage prior to him being found out years after he started offending.

7.   Having regard to what Latham J said in Li v VR [sic] [2006] NSWCCA 136, a gambling addiction generally does not warrant the extension of leniency.

8.   The plea of guilty was immediate and deserving of the maximum discount, 25%.

9.   Mr Johnston is aged 40 and was of prior good character before he started this offending.

10.   A person is usually in a position of trust because of their prior good character, which in turn of course is the enabling factor in being able to offend in such a way that good character may not have a substantial effect on the sentencing process for such matter [sic].

11.   Having regard to the case of Scanlon [2006] NSWCCA 238, the JIRS statistics and case comparisons have little relevance in the sentencing process, although a recent case of Chen v R [2015] NSWCCA 122 has provided some comfort as to an appropriate sentence.”


	
	The sentencing judge described the offence as involving a substantial breach of trust. He expressed the view that there were differences between a gambling addiction and a drug addiction. He stated gambling does not physically alter a person’s mind or body. He stated a gambler knows what he is doing. He said that the concern in the present case was that, despite knowing his gambling was causing him to steal, he did not do anything until he was confronted by his employer.
	
	
	In that context the sentencing judge stated that his addiction did not explain why it had taken over 3 years and the theft of one and a quarter million dollars before the applicant sought professional help. He described the applicant’s evidence, “I knew it was a problem but I just couldn’t help myself”, as not sufficient.
	
	
	The sentencing judge stated that he realised imprisonment would be devastating on the applicant’s wife and family, as the applicant’s wife would be the sole breadwinner and suffered a recurring chronic back condition.
	
	
	His Honour noted that fraud matters, such as those in question, were relatively easy to commit by a person in a position of trust and quite often very large sums of unrecoverable money were lost. He stated that such cases needed to be publicly denounced to deter others from offending and that the offender needed to be adequately punished.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the sentencing judge imposed the sentence to which I have referred above.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant relied on the following grounds of appeal:
	


“1.   His Honour erred with respect to the weight he placed upon the causative gambling addiction and its relevance in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending.

2.   His Honour erred in applying a hierarchy to addiction placing the applicant’s gambling addiction below that of the drug addiction.

3.   His Honour erred in his application of the principle of demonstrated rehabilitation.

4.   His Honour erred in placing insufficient weight upon the cumulative effect of factors in mitigation, including restitution, good character and a first custodial sentence.”


	
	During the course of argument on Ground 4, the applicant sought and was granted leave to rely on an additional ground of appeal, namely, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It was common ground that the argument on Ground 4 raised similar issues as the ground of manifest excess. In these circumstances it is convenient to deal with these grounds together. It is also convenient to deal with Grounds 1 and 2 together.
	


Grounds 1 and 2

The submissions


	
	The applicant submitted there was clear evidence he had a gambling addiction which he submitted propelled the offending. He pointed to the fact that expert evidence was led to the effect that at the relevant time, he suffered from a gambling disorder as defined under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). He pointed to the evidence of rehabilitative steps he had taken including the rehabilitation programme which led to the prolonging of the sentencing proceedings, with the intimation by the sentencing judge that this would result in an adjustment of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was no evidential basis for the finding made by the sentencing judge that, “[g]ambling does not physically alter a person’s mind”, submitting the fact that it is included in DSM-V evidences that it does. He submitted that it was required to be taken into account in the finding of objective seriousness. In that context he referred to what was said by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [273], to the effect that the fact that an offence is motivated by a need to support a drug habit may be taken into account, inter alia, so far as it throws light on the state of mind or the capacity of the offender to exercise judgment.
	
	
	The applicant recognised that in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39, the plurality stated (at [27]) that the objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender. However, he submitted, referring to McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29], that this did not derogate from the requirement of a sentencing judge to form an assessment as to the moral culpability of the offending, in respect of which the offender’s mental state may be taken into account. The applicant submitted the judge erred in failing to take the gambling addiction into account in that fashion.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted, referring to the evidence of Dr Krishnaswamy, that there was a difference between a problem gambler and someone who has a clinical condition. She submitted that the evidence ruled out that it was a crime committed for greed or to support a lavish lifestyle. She submitted that the applicant’s inability to stop gambling, whilst not disabling him from making a determination between right and wrong, impaired his judgment. She also submitted that the inability to stop gambling was inextricably linked to the commission of the offences.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 2 the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge incorrectly applied a hierarchy of addiction placing gambling below drugs. He submitted that in doing so the sentencing judge distracted himself from the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence, of remorse and of the prospects of rehabilitation. He submitted that each of Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry supra, rejected a hierarchy of motivations to obtain money. He repeated that the approach of the sentencing judge resulted in him failing to turn his mind to the evidence of rehabilitation and his low risk of reoffending.
	
	
	The Crown pointing to Muldrock supra (at [27]), submitted that the sentencing judge would have been in error had he taken the applicant’s gambling addiction into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, submitting that moral culpability and objective seriousness were not the same.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in drawing the distinction between drug addiction and gambling addiction, the sentencing judge was specifically concerned with the physical effects of each addiction. The Crown submitted that in stating, “the gambler knows what he or she is doing”, the sentencing judge was comparing the gambler with someone acting or offending under the chemical influence of a drug. The Crown submitted that there was no evidence that the applicant did not know what he was doing and that when he committed the frauds he was neither under the influence of any substance nor suffering from its withdrawal. It was submitted the applicant not only knew what he was doing but knew that it was a problem yet did not stop until he was caught.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that it was not put below that the applicant’s gambling addiction impacted the objective seriousness of the offence or the applicant’s moral culpability. It pointed to the fact that at the sentencing hearing, senior counsel for the applicant described the gambling addiction as properly going to “context”. In those circumstances it was submitted there was no error in failing to consider the matters the subject of this ground.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 2 the Crown submitted there was nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that the sentencing judge placed the applicant in any special category for sentencing purposes. To the extent the ground sought to criticise the weight put by the sentencing judge on the respondent’s gambling addiction as a mitigating factor, it was submitted referring to Hanna v R [2015] NSWCCA 326 at [76], that the question of whether adequate weight was placed on a particular factor does not readily demonstrate House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40 error.
	


Consideration


	
	This Court has consistently held that the fact that offences were committed to feed a gambling addiction will not generally be a mitigating factor at sentence: R v Molesworth [1999] NSWCCA 43 at [24], [30]; R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [62]; R v Huang, R v Siu (2007) 174 A Crim R 370; [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [42]; Marks v R [2009] NSWCCA 24 at [29]; Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136 at [32]; Assi v R [2006] NSWCCA 257. In the latter case Howie J, with whom Tobias JA and Rothman J agreed, stated at [27] that although the gambling habit may explain the fall into serious criminal conduct, it is a rare case where the offender can seek mitigation of penalty based on an addiction to gambling even when it is pathological.
	
	
	In Ourdi v The Queen (2009) 193 A Crim R 381; [2009] NSWCCA 46, the applicant sought to rely on his gambling habit in mitigation of offences of breaking and entering dwelling houses with intent to steal. In rejecting that submission Kirby J, with whom Grove and Blanch JJ agreed, noted (at [45]) that the crimes were not impulsive but on the contrary involved careful observation and planning. The same may be said of the applicant’s offence in the present case.
	
	
	Similarly in R v Grossi (2008) 183 A Crim R 15; [2008] VSCA 51, the Victorian Court of Appeal stated that a gambling addiction will generally not reduce moral culpability where the offence is committed over an extended period, as the offender had a degree of choice as to how they would finance their addiction. The Court also explained that the disorder will not often be connected to the commission of the crime but merely provide a motive or explanation for its commission and so is therefore only indirectly responsible for the offending conduct. Redlich JA, with whom Neave and Vincent JJA agreed, stated (at [56]-[57]):
	


“[56]   Evidence may establish that an offender suffers from an impulse control disorder in the form of pathological gambling listed in DSM-IV-TR, the essential feature of which is ‘persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behaviour that disrupts personal family or vocational pursuits’. The relevance of the disorder to the sentence to be imposed, is then to be assessed in accordance with the principles restated in Verdins. That assessment will generally lead to the conclusion that the presence of a gambling addiction should not, on that ground alone, result in any appreciable moderation of the sentence. There are a number of reasons why that will be so. Firstly in most cases, the nature and severity of the symptoms of the disorder, considered in conjunction with the type and circumstances of the offending, will not warrant a reduction in moral culpability or any moderation of general deterrence. Secondly, it will frequently be the case that crimes associated with gambling addiction will have been repeated and extended over a protracted period. The long term chase to recoup losses is characteristic of those with such a disorder. Thirdly, in cases involving dishonesty, the crimes will commonly be sophisticated, devious, and the result of careful planning. Fourthly, the gravity of such offences, if there is a breach of trust or confidence, will commonly attract an increased penalty making such offences more appropriate vehicles for general deterrence. Fifthly, when offences of this nature are committed over extended periods, the prominent hypothesis will be that the offender has had a degree of choice which they have continued to exercise as to how they finance their addiction. This has often provided a reason for a general reluctance to temper the weight given to general deterrence or to reduce moral culpability because an offender has found it difficult to control their gambling obsession. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the nexus of the addiction to the crime will often be unsubstantiated. The disorder will not generally be directly connected to the commission of the crime, the addiction providing only a motive and explanation for its commission. Hence, by contrast to a mental condition that impairs an offender’s judgment at the time of the offence, such addiction will generally be viewed as only indirectly responsible for the offending conduct.

[57]   The appellant’s conduct was premeditated, calculated, and systematic. Counsel for the appellant properly acknowledged that, to satisfy her addiction, the appellant had repeatedly exercised the choice to re-offend over a lengthy period and that this bore upon the weight to be given to her addiction. In my view the learned sentencing judge made no error in not mitigating the sentence to any significant extent because of the appellant’s gambling addiction. The existence of the disorder did not, on that ground alone, necessitate any reduction in moral culpability or amelioration of general deterrence” [Footnotes omitted].

I agree. Although the majority’s approach in Grossi supra in relation to the interpretation of ss 6H and 6I of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) was not followed in a subsequent decision, the passage cited above was not criticised: see R v Roussety (2008) 24 VR 253; [2008] VSCA 259. I would add that in cases of this nature where general deterrence is an important factor, it would be inappropriate to treat an underlying explanation that the motive was gambling as a mitigating circumstance or reducing moral culpability particularly in cases such as the present, where the frauds were perpetrated and skilfully executed over an extended period.


	
	Further it should be noted that the remarks in Grossi supra were made in circumstances where there was psychological evidence that at the time of the offending the applicant would have been diagnosed as having an impulse control disorder in the form of pathological gambling listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: [2008] VSCA 51 at [47].
	
	
	The applicant in support of his submission relied on what was said by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry supra. Each of Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL stated that addiction including an addiction to drugs or gambling is not of itself a mitigating circumstance: (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [178]-[203], [273]. Wood CJ at CL in the passage cited in part by the applicant in his submissions, set out the relevant principles in the following terms:
	


“[273]   In my view the relevant principles are as follows:

(a)   the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit, even a severe habit, is not an excuse to commit an armed robbery or any similar offence, and of itself is not a matter of mitigation;

(b)   however the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence in so far as it may throw light on matters such as:

(i)   the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it; cf R v Bouchard (1996) 84 A Crim R 499 at 501-2 and R v Nolan (Victorian Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, 2 December 1998, unreported);

(ii)   the existence or non-existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence, for example, that it was motivated to fund some other serious criminal venture or to support a campaign of terrorism;

(iii)   the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment, for example, if he or she was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that may have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a willed act;

(c)   It may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance, in so far as the origin or extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it, might:

(i)   impact upon the prospects of recidivism/rehabilitation, in which respect it may on occasions prove to be a two-edged sword: eg, R v Lewis (Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 July 1992, unreported);

(ii)   suggest that the addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, for example where it arose as the result of the medical prescription of potentially addictive drugs following injury, illness, or surgery (cf R v Hodge (Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 November 1993, unreported) and R v Talbot ); or where it occurred at a very young age, or in a person whose mental or intellectual capacity was impaired, so that their ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete;

(iii)   justify special consideration in the case of offenders judged to be at the ‘cross roads’: R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212; 5 A Crim R 394.

[274]   To go further, and to accept the fact of drug addiction as a mitigating factor generally, would not be justified in principle. Moreover, it would involve an exercise in irresponsibility on the part of the Court, if it were understood as a message that committing the crime of armed robbery to feed a drug habit is less deserving of censure than would otherwise be the case.

[275]   The legislature has, by the heavy maximum penalty prescribed for armed robbery, spoken clearly in relation to this offence. Drug dependent persons should not be encouraged, as a class, to think that they are free to engage in serious criminal conduct of whatever kind with impunity, or with any hope of favourable treatment because they are able to show that they needed money through their addiction.”


	
	These comments apply equally to cases of fraud to feed a gambling addiction.
	
	
	The applicant placed particular reliance on par 273(b)(iii) of the passage from the judgment of Wood CJ at CL cited above. However there was nothing to suggest that over the period in which the frauds were committed the applicant lacked the capacity to exercise judgment, or that the crime was anything other than a willed act. The fact the addiction is included in DSM-V does not indicate to the contrary.
	
	
	In these circumstances Ground 1 has not been made out.
	
	
	So far as Ground 2 is concerned it does not seem to me that the sentencing judge postulated a hierarchy of addiction placing gambling below drugs. The remarks complained of (see [20] above) were directed to the proceedings before him. The sentencing judge was simply stating that unlike some cases of drug addiction, the offender did not lack the capacity to exercise judgment, nor was the crime something other than a willed act.
	
	
	In my opinion this ground has not been made out.
	


Ground 3


	
	The applicant referred to the following remarks by the sentencing judge:
	


“Courts will exercise the full gamut of sentencing options to someone who offends but tries to do something about their offending behaviour and seeks help and intervention at an early stage. Mr Johnston’s gambling addiction does not explain why it took over three years and the theft of one and a quarter million dollars before he sought professional help.”


	
	The applicant submitted that those remarks show that the sentencing judge took the view that only rehabilitative actions occurring early in the addiction were to be taken into account. He submitted that this approach did not accord with authority. He submitted that the absence of an early response to his gambling addiction should be assessed against the background that the gambling difficulties commenced at a young age (17 years) and the fact that gambling, “lawfully infects our daily lives and saturates all sporting mediums” and so, “provides fertile ground for unchecked and unnoticed addiction”. Counsel for the applicant further submitted that it was not appropriate to take the applicant’s rehabilitation into account only by adjusting the non-parole period.
	
	
	The Crown submitted the applicant misinterpreted the criticised passage. It was submitted the applicant could not complain about being at a disadvantage because the nature of his offending meant he had to be charged by police as a prompt to commence treatment. The Crown submitted the applicant was sentenced in an appropriate fashion, with the serious extent of the fraud and the need for general deterrence properly being given determinative significance.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the applicant’s demonstrated need for continued rehabilitation resulted in a finding of special circumstances and reduction in the non-parole period. The Crown submitted that the applicant’s rehabilitation was acknowledged by the sentencing judge deferring sentence to enable the applicant to complete a rehabilitation programme and in the variation of the statutory non-parole period ratio.
	


Consideration


	
	The remarks made by the sentencing judge complained of do not seem to me to go further than to say that having regard to the fact that the offender did nothing about his addiction until he was apprehended meant sentencing options other than a custodial sentence were not appropriate. That is relatively clear from his remarks immediately following the passage of which complaint is made, to the effect that the applicant and his counsel recognised that a custodial sentence must follow and that although imprisonment will be devastating there were no exceptional circumstances justifying the non-imposition of a custodial sentence.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


Ground 4 and manifest excess


	
	The applicant submitted that he had made significant restitution and it could be inferred that Newcrest, a commercial enterprise, was satisfied no more could be reasonably obtained from him. He submitted that showed significant remorse and warranted significant mitigation, or at least should have had an impact on the appropriate sentence. He submitted the fact of restitution was a statutory mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. He submitted that it was not clear that the sentencing judge had taken this matter into account.
	
	
	The applicant also submitted that the “impressive testimonials” tendered by him were not taken into account by the sentencing judge, apparently because he took the view that good character is generally a necessary prerequisite to being in a position of trust to enable fraud to be engaged in. He submitted that this fact should not have stood in the way of some credit being given for good character.
	
	
	The applicant also submitted that whilst the judge acknowledged the hardship of incarceration on a man without antecedent criminal history, it did not result in any mitigation of penalty.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that a sentence of 8 years and 8 months pre-discount for an early plea gave little or no weight to the fact the applicant suffered from an addiction and the other relevant factors in his favour. Counsel for the applicant submitted that had they been taken into account, a sentence of 8 years and 8 months could not have been imposed.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that when Parliament laid down a maximum penalty of 10 years it was done in circumstances where Parliament knew that the offences could take place over a number of years and involve separate transactions. However, she accepted that there may be significant differences between the seriousness of one incident and engaging in conduct over 3 years which involved individual and not necessarily connected acts. However, she submitted the present case did not fall within the worst class of case.
	
	
	In that context, counsel for the applicant referred to two cases. The first, Power v R [2002] NSWCCA 244, was a decision of a two judge bench of this Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to 39 offences of making a false instrument whilst a bank employee. The instruments in question were fictitious loans to fictitious customers. The amount involved was $5.81 million spent on luxury items. The offences occurred over a period of 4 years. A total sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years was imposed. The Court held that the failure to impose a non-parole period in respect of a number of the offences and the non-parole period imposed on others led to the imposition of a sentence which was manifestly excessive. The Court did not vary the head sentences but substituted an effective non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	The other decision, R v McDonald (1994) 71 A Crim R 370, was a decision of the Federal Court on appeal from the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. The applicant pleaded guilty to eight counts of fraud, the amount involved being some $632,000. Prior to being sentenced for these offences, he was convicted in the NSW District Court of various offences of fraud involving an amount totalling $951,000. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for these offences of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	The applicant was then sentenced for the Australian Capital Territory offences. The effect of the sentence was to increase the total term of imprisonment for all the offences to 8 years and 9 months and the non-parole period from 2 years to 4 years. The Federal Court held that the sentencing judge did not pay proper regard to the principle of totality and varied the sentence to impose a sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 3½ years.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant did not suggest that these cases indicated a range but pointed out that in neither of the two cases were the offences described as falling within the worst category.
	
	
	The Crown noted the sentencing judge referred to the applicant’s restitution, remorse and to his good character. It was submitted that the authorities established that good character will be given less weight when general deterrence is important and the offence is one frequently committed by persons of good character.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the reference by the sentencing judge to R v Chen [2015] NSWCCA 122, a Commonwealth prosecution involving the submission of 27 fraudulent business activity statements for the purpose of claiming false refunds of Goods and Services Tax. The total amount fraudulently obtained was $1,396,285.76. The applicant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. Leave to appeal against sentence was refused. R A Hulme J (with whom Bellew and Davies JJ agreed) described the offence as involving repeated fraudulent claims as a part of a scheme to manipulate the self-reporting GST/BAS scheme solely for the applicant’s enrichment.
	


Consideration


	
	To the extent that this ground asserts error in placing insufficient weight on the cumulative effect of the applicant’s restitution, good character and the fact that this was the applicant’s first custodial sentence in mitigation, the ground implicitly acknowledges that the judge did take these factors into account. That implicit acknowledgement is correct. The sentencing judge referred to the fact that the applicant had reached a confidential settlement with Newcrest, although presumably because of the claimed confidentiality, he did not refer to the precise amount paid. In relation to good character the sentencing judge referred to the testimonial from the manager of his employer immediately prior to sentence and set out in some detail the character references tendered on his behalf (see [11] and [18] above). He expressly noted the devastating effect that imprisonment would have on his wife and family.
	
	
	As was pointed out in Bland v The Queen (2014) 241 A Crim R 51; [2014] NSWCCA 82 at [112]-[113] the failure of a sentencing judge to attribute sufficient weight to a particular matter will generally not be a material error and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention are narrowly confined: see also Hanna v R supra at [76].
	
	
	In the present case it does not seem to me that the manner in which the matters referred to were taken into account of itself constituted error. The sentencing judge referred to these matters and clearly considered them as part of the process of determining the appropriate sentence. There is no discernible error in his approach. Those factors however are of course relevant factors to be taken into account in determining whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The principles on which an appellate court will determine that a sentence is manifestly excessive (or inadequate) are well established. An appellate court is not entitled to interfere with the exercise of the sentencing discretion merely because it would have arrived at a different result: Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665; [1999] HCA 29 at [15]. For a sentence to be set aside as manifestly excessive it must be unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321; [2000] HCA 54 at [6], [22], after taking all relevant matters into account: see also Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [58]-[60].
	
	
	In considering this issue I do not consider the two cases referred to by the applicant, Power v R supra and R v Macdonald supra, to be of particular assistance. The applicant correctly conceded that they did not constitute a range. I have set out the detail of these cases at [57]-[59] above. In Power, adjustment was made to take account of an effective non-parole period said to be manifestly excessive, whilst the adjustment in R v Macdonald was made having regard to the principle of totality. They provide no assistance in demonstrating a range of sentences for matters of this nature. As has been pointed out on a number of occasions, reference to statistics is of limited value in cases of fraud having regard to the variety of objective and subjective circumstances involved: R v Woodman [2001] NSWCCA 310 at [22]-[24]; R v Hawker [2001] NSWCCA 148 at [17]-[18]; R v Martin [2005] NSWCCA 190 at [56]. In each of these cases it was emphasised that greater assistance is derived from general sentencing principles with respect to white collar crime.
	
	
	In considering the question of manifest excess it is necessary to pay regard to the fact that the plea was to a “rolled up count” involving 156 fictitious transactions. The question of sentencing on such a rolled up count was considered by Garling J in R v Richard [2011] NSWSC 866. The offender pleaded guilty to two offences contrary to s 1041G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The offences involved diverting $26.6 million of superannuation funds into tax havens over a period of 4 years. Garling J (at [65]) observed that rolled up charges include more than one episode of criminal conduct such that the criminality involved is greater than a charge involving only one episode of such conduct. Garling J (at [105]-[108]) identified two advantages to the offender in the use of rolled up charges. First, restriction of the maximum sentence available and, second, the fact that the sentence imposed represents a complete concurrence of separate sentences which might otherwise have been imposed.
	
	
	The observations of Garling J were approved by this Court in R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183. That case involved three counts of using a carriage service to access child pornography (a Federal offence) and one count of possessing child abuse material (a State offence) involving a multiplicity of pornographic images. Two further offences were also taken into account on a Form 1. Johnson J made the following remarks (at [116]):
	


“[116]   The use of ‘rolled up’ charges is very common with offences of this type. The sheer number of items, often seen in cases such as this, renders it both practical and sensible to proceed in this way. The sentence or sentences to be imposed for particular offences will reflect the number of images caught by the charge or the length of the period over which accessing has occurred. The larger the number of images, the more serious the offence will be. This is especially so where the number of images is to be measured (as in this case) in the tens-of-thousands. In this way, the charges include more than one episode of criminal conduct which will magnify the objective gravity of the offence: R v Richard at [65](f). Depending upon the circumstances of the case, this may have a bearing, as well, on the issues of accumulation and concurrency.

See also R v Glynatsis (2013) 230 A Crim R 99; [2013] NSWCCA 131 at [66]; R v Donald [2013] NSWCCA 238 at [85].


	
	The applicant’s submissions principally focused on the head sentence (pre-discount for the guilty plea) of 8 years and 8 months compared with the maximum sentence of 10 years for the offence, submitting that a sentence of that nature was reserved for the worst class of cases. However that does not take into account the fact that this was a “rolled up count” involving a considerable number of transactions over a period of some years. The offences involved the systematic defrauding of the applicant’s employer in circumstances where he was in a position of trust. It has been repeatedly emphasised that in these circumstances general deterrence is of considerable importance: See R v Hawker supra at [23]-[24]; R v Woodman supra at [24]-[28] and the cases therein cited. It is of course necessary to consider the subjective circumstances of the offender. As I indicated I do not consider the fact that the theft took place to feed a gambling addiction to be a mitigating circumstance. Further I do not consider that the prior good character of the applicant in this case is a matter of great significance. It is generally only persons of good character who are placed in positions of trust so as to enable offences such as the present to be committed.
	
	
	So far as restitution and remorse are concerned, they are plainly matters which need to be taken into account. However when dealing with restitution it must be remembered that of the total amount defrauded, only some $250,000 was repaid in return for a release from further liability. However, it is correct that the offender was remorseful for his conduct.
	
	
	As the sentencing judge found, the applicant since his arrest has actively pursued courses towards rehabilitation and is well down that path. As the sentencing judge found, there was a low risk of reoffending. It is also correct that imprisonment will undoubtedly cause considerable hardship both to the applicant and to his family.
	
	
	In considering the question of manifest excess it is also relevant in my opinion that the sentencing judge found special circumstances and adjusted the non-parole period to approximately 61% of the head sentence.
	
	
	Taking all these factors into account, it seems to me the sentence which on its face appears severe when compared with the maximum penalty, was not in the particular circumstances of the present case unreasonable or plainly unjust. This ground has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having regard to the way the case was argued it seems to me that the appropriate course is to grant the applicant an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. Accordingly, I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him.
	
	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the Chief Justice.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

	WALTON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Xiao Feng Wang (""the appellant"") was sentenced by Sweeney DCJ in the District Court on 3 November 2006 in respect of the following:

	The appellant successfully appealed against the severity of the sentence in respect of Count 1: Xiao Feng Wang v R [2009] NSWCCA 223. Two issues were raised in the appeal: that the primary judge had erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period and that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Hidden J, with the concurrence of Giles JA and McCallum J, found it unnecessary to decide the former but held that the judge had erred in her finding that the offence was in the mid-range of objective seriousness and that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The appellant was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. As with the original assessment of sentence, the new term entirely subsumed the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	Following the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 the appellant applied under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for the case to be referred to this Court pursuant to s 79(1)(b) to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Hoeben CJ at CL refused the application: Application by Xiao Feng Wang pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 825.
	
	
	After the Court of Appeal delivered judgment on 31 July 2015 in a case involving similar issues, Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 221, the appellant's present lawyers made a further application for referral to this Court which was granted by Bellew J: Application by Xiao Feng Wang pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2016] NSWSC 1670.
	
	
	Although the decision of Bellew J was made on 25 November 2016, it was not until 23 February 2017 that a Notice of Appeal was filed. The Registrar was, however, on notice of the decision and previously secured the earliest possible hearing date for the matter given the appellant's non-parole period is due to expire on 11 July 2017.
	


Ground of appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal is:
	


The appellant's sentence on count 1 was imposed contrary to the principles set out in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.

Submissions for the parties


	
	It is common ground and uncontroversial that this Court must deal with the matter as if it was an appeal against the sentence imposed by it in 2009 rather than the sentence imposed in the District Court in 2006: Louizos v R [2014] NSWCCA 242 at [6] (Leeming JA) and [109] (R A Hulme J).
	
	
	The appellant was sentenced, and re-sentenced, in the period in which R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 was understood to set out the principles for sentencing in respect of offences for which a standard non-parole period applied. The High Court in Muldrock v The Queen held R v Way to have been wrongly decided in a manner that has been stated so often in judgments of this Court that it does not bear repeating.
	
	
	The appellant contends that ""Muldrock error"" is evident in the approach of this Court to resentencing in three respects:
	


1   Hidden J expressly applied R v Way in considering whether there should be a ""departure"" from the standard non-parole period whereas it was held in Muldrock v The Queen that the standard non-parole period is not a starting point in the assessment of sentence. (AWS [38])

2   The ""neatness"" of the arithmetic is indicative of error in that the Court assessed the objective seriousness of the offence as ""somewhat below the mid-range"", found certain mitigating subjective features, and imposed a non-parole period of 12 years as compared to the standard non-parole period of 15 years. (AWS [39]-[41])

3   In assessing the new sentence to be imposed, Hidden J drew comparisons with other cases which had been determined (explicitly or by inference) in accordance with R v Way. (AWS [43]-[47])


	
	The Crown does not accept that the first and third of these contentions are made good. However, it accepts that it would be open to the Court to find that the sentence imposed by this Court was contrary to the principles in Muldrock v The Queen for three reasons:
	


1   It should be presumed, unless the contrary appears, that a sentence that was imposed following R v Way and before Muldrock v The Queen was assessed by application of the principles in R v Way: Davis v R [2015] NSWCCA 90 at [33] (Simpson J). (CWS [34]-[35])

2   The language of Hidden J's judgment (particularly at [19]) does not suggest he was, in any way, departing from the approach stipulated in R v Way. (CWS [36])

3   ""The 'neatness' of the arithmetic as to the appellant's sentence may, in the present case, be indicative of Muldrock error."" (CWS [37])

Determination


	
	I am satisfied that error has been established on the basis that the sentence was impermissibly affected by application of the principles in R v Way and contrary to Muldrock v The Queen for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, although Hidden J found it unnecessary to decide whether the primary judge erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period, immediately before stating that he said:
	


""[19] With respect to her Honour, there is some force in Mr Boulten’s argument. In particular, her observation that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and low to moderate prospects of recidivism were not “striking”, so as to warrant a departure from the standard non-parole period, concerns me. Whether there should be such a departure depends upon an assessment of the objective and subjective factors peculiar to each case, and there is no requirement that an offender’s subjective case, or any part of it, should rise above some notional threshold before the standard non-parole period can be ameliorated. …"" (Emphasis added)


	
	The emphasised sentence clearly indicates that, in accordance with R v Way, his Honour regarded the approach to sentence as involving the standard non-parole period having determinative significance and being a two-staged one, looking for reasons to depart from it: to the contrary, see Muldrock v The Queen at 131-132; [26], [28].
	
	
	Secondly, Hidden J referred to sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in respect of the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and to a number of previous decisions of this Court in respect of sentencing for such an offence. Both the statistics and the cases derived from the post-R v Way and pre-Muldrock v The Queen era. As Simpson J (as she then was) observed in R v Davis, it may be presumed that most, if not all of them, were influenced by the erroneous R v Way principles.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	Error having been established, in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen (at [42]-[43]), it is necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in order to determine if a lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	In accordance with Muldrock v The Queen (at [26]-[27]) it is necessary to have regard to all factors relevant to sentence and in doing so to bear in mind the legislative guideposts of the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and the standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	


Facts


	
	The appellant was found guilty after trial in respect of the drug offences but had earlier pleaded guilty to assaulting the police officer. The facts of the offences were set out in the judgment of Hidden J (at [5]) as follows:
	


""The evidence which the jury must have accepted in order to find Mr Wang guilty of the two offences on the indictment at the trial was that on 12 July 2005 at around 7pm, at Strathfield Park, Mr Wang was observed to be standing near a telephone box with some other men. A car pulled up to that telephone box. Mr Wang got into the car. The car drove about 100 metres up the road, and stopped at a bus stop. Mr Wang got out of the car holding a bag which was later found to contain almost 5000 Ecstasy pills. They were later analysed and found to be such. A police officer, the police officer in relation to the assault charge, Detective Tse, was across the road from the bus stop. She announced her office and went towards Mr Wang. There was a struggle over the bag which he held. Eventually Mr Wang was able to extricate himself from the bag. He pushed the bag into the chest of Detective Tse which caused her to fall backwards and land on the ground. He then ran away. The assault on Constable Tse, which I take to be the pushing her in the chest with the bag, while it caused her to fall to the ground, is in my view, at the lower end of assaults. …

As to the second offence on the indictment, Mr Wang, having left the scene of Strathfield Park, was later detected by police to be at a unit at Belfield where he said he was living, although surveillance suggested that he may also have been spending part of his time at other premises. He left those Belfield premises with a bag. He got into a car and was driven a short distance whereupon he was arrested after the vehicle was stopped. In the bag there were some personal belongings including some clothing and a further approximately 80 Ecstasy tablets which had the same appearance and the same Mitsubishi logo and were analysed later to have about the same level of purity as the 5000 or so tablets which were contained in the bag at Strathfield Park. The quantity of those pills were weighed at 50.93 grams and the trafficable quantity is .75 of a gram. In terms of the first charge on the indictment, the large commercial quantity charge, the large commercial quantity specified for the drug [MDMA] is 0.5 of a kilogram and those drugs were weighed at 1464.46 grams.""

The appellant's personal circumstances


	
	The written submissions for the appellant accepted that the following matters derived from the remarks on sentence of the primary judgment and the judgment of Hidden J may be relied upon in re-sentencing.
	
	
	The appellant was born in China and was aged 37 at the time of the offences and is now aged 49. His childhood was disrupted by the death of his mother when he was aged 14. In his early twenties he was briefly married but a psychological report recorded that there was a degree of instability in his life in this period. He migrated to Australia in his late twenties.
	
	
	The appellant attained a tertiary qualification in physical education and worked consistently as a policeman and fitness trainer in China and later as a physical education instructor in Australia.
	
	
	He was addicted to alcohol by the time he migrated to Australia, drinking to excess daily. A psychologist diagnosed a substance abuse disorder. This was accepted to have affected his decision making but not to have mitigated his offending because, according to the primary judge, he ""chose to let the problem overtake him"". At the time of his first appeal he had sought to address his addiction in custody and had undertaken a course in English in which he was making progress.
	
	
	The appellant had a criminal record comprising driving offences as well as offences of dishonesty and concerning firearms. He served terms of imprisonment for some of these matters after he was taken into custody in respect of the index offences.
	
	
	An affidavit by the appellant's solicitor read at the first appeal hearing annexed copies of a number of certificates attesting to the appellant's continued efforts to further his education whilst in custody. They included completion of an Alcohol and Other Drug Relapse Prevention course and numerous literacy and computer courses.
	
	
	A number of affidavits were read at the hearing today. The appellant's affidavit included that he understood he would be deported upon his release on parole and that he was eager to return to his family in China. He provided an account of his progression through classification down to minimum security, ultimately with a transfer to a remote country gaol where he has permission to work outside of the gaol, in the community. He used to receive visits from a friend up until 2012 but has had no visitors since then. He maintains telephone contact with his family.
	
	
	The material indicates that the appellant has been of good behaviour during his long period of incarceration; he has played a role as a peer support inmate; he has given effort to improving his English and has enrolled in a variety of self-improvement and vocational courses. Further, he has accepted employment when available and he has family support to assist him after his release.
	
	
	An affidavit by the appellant's current solicitor sets out in detail the process since Muldrock v The Queen was decided of seeking a review of the appellant's sentence and those of many other inmates who were sentenced under the R v Way-regime. I interpolate the personal comment that although the task has been difficult and lengthy, the dedicated efforts of Mr Eccleshall and those of his colleagues at Legal Aid NSW doing similar work should be commended.
	
	
	Documentary material annexed to Mr Eccleshall's affidavit confirms what the appellant said in his affidavit. It appears that his efforts in undertaking work, courses and programs throughout the period of his imprisonment have been exemplary and he is a well-regarded inmate.
	
	
	Albeit that there is no evidence of remorse, the appellant has established on the balance of probabilities that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	The appellant relied upon delay as a further mitigating factor. The principles in relation to delay were recently summarised by Price J (Button and Fagan JJ agreeing) in Elchiekh v R [2016] NSWCCA 225 at [56]. I infer that the appellant has been left in a state of some uncertainty about the outcome of his various applications and appeals but there is nothing tangible in the evidence about him experiencing any adverse consequences as a result. The only real way in which delay is relevant in a significant sense is that the appellant has demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation during the lengthy period since he was first sentenced. However, that is a factor that must be taken into account in his favour in any event.
	


Assessment of seriousness of offence


	
	The assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence is a contentious issue. The primary judge found that it was in the mid-range whilst in this Court in 2009 it was assessed at ""somewhat below"" that level.
	
	
	For the appellant it was submitted that ""if this Court considered it appropriate to make a finding … it would find that it falls towards the lower end [of the range] for offences of this kind"". (AWS [51]) The Crown contested that submission, arguing that a fresh assessment would result in the same conclusion drawn by Hidden J.
	
	
	This task is rendered difficult by the paucity of evidence as to the appellant's role and intentions in relation to the large quantity of drugs he acquired on the night in question. However, it can be said at least that he was in possession for the purpose of supply of almost three times the large commercial quantity threshold for the drug and that he was in that position as a result of some degree of planning and premeditation. Clearly, it is not an offence that is at the lower end of the range but I am not satisfied that it is in the mid-range either.
	


Statistics and other cases


	
	Accompanying the appellant's submissions were various printouts of sentencing statistics and an extensive table of other cases.
	
	
	The statistics are of little use because of the 62 cases in the Judicial Commission's database for this particular offence where it concerns the drug known as ecstasy, only 4 involved a plea of not guilty. Although the Judicial Commission has recently commenced to provide increasingly informative information as to the cases that comprise the database, the appellant provided no information as to the extent to which the sentences passed in respect of the vast majority of offenders were presumably reduced on account of pleas of guilty and, in some cases perhaps, assistance to authorities.
	
	
	The table provided by the appellant lists cases which are recent (2011-2017) and involve an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of any type of prohibited drug. I have found it to be of some, albeit very broad, assistance in reminding myself of the range of penalties imposed for this kind of offending.
	


Totality


	
	The Crown noted that the sentence for the primary offence entirely subsumed those imposed for the offences in Counts 2 and 3, notwithstanding Sweeney DCJ finding that they involved additional criminality. It submitted that as a matter of principle there should be some accumulation of the sentence for the primary offence upon them, as well as upon the sentences imposed for various earlier offences that were dealt with summarily following the appellant's arrest (""the prior offences"").
	
	
	The prior offences were:
	


Goods in custody (6 months imprisonment)

Possess unauthorised firearm (200 days)

Possess ammunition (200 days)

Possess unregistered firearm (200 days)

Not keep firearm safely – pistol (200 days)

Use copy of false instrument with intent (6 months)

Have false instrument with intent to use (x 2) (6 months)


	
	Each of these sentences was specified to commence on either 13 July 2005 or 13 September 2005.
	
	
	Having regard to the principle of totality (see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]) it would be appropriate to partially accumulate the sentence for the primary offence by 6 months, thereby ordering its commencement on 12 January 2006.
	


Special circumstances


	
	The appellant submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances. However, for the reasons given recently in Potts v R [2017] NSWCCA 10, there is no utility in making such a finding.
	


Conclusion


	
	After assimilating all of the foregoing and bearing in mind the statutory guideposts, I have concluded that a lesser sentence is warranted. There should be a sentence of imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months accumulated by 6 months upon the various other sentences that had been imposed upon the appellant.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1   Allow the appeal against sentence.

2   Quash the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 10 September 2009 and in lieu, sentence the appellant for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug in not less than the large commercial quantity to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years 6 months.

The sentence will date from 12 January 2006. The non-parole period expired on 11 July 2016 and the total term will expire on 11 January 2020. The appellant is now eligible for release on parole.


	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with R A Hulme J and the orders his Honour proposes.

		29 March 2017",2017-03-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
4273527,R v Brooks (No 4) [2017] NSWSC 315,"ex tempore Judgment (revised)


	
	One of the witnesses, who is on the Crown's witness list, is a witness called Sarah Baird. She made a statement on 17 April 2015 and a highlighted copy of that statement has been provided as Exhibit VD7. Her statement covers in essence three things, two of them closely related. There is a controversy over the admissibility of parts of her evidence and whether there is any obligation on the Crown to call her in its case.
	
	
	The first matter covered in her statement is that she worked with or employed the accused, Bradley Brooks, since he commenced work in her restaurant as an apprentice chef. In paragraphs 10-13 Ms Baird provides an opinion of his character which is generally positive. The Crown does not object to the evidence of character and some agreement – the details of which I am not aware of – has been reached between the parties as to the extent of the character evidence that can be led before the Crown would seek to raise a case in reply. Whilst the Crown accepts the admissibility of those parts of Ms Baird's statement he indicates that he would not call her as a witness in the Prosecution case in order to provide the accused with a vehicle, as it were, through which to adduce evidence of good character.
	
	
	Ms Baird goes on to provide some evidence of what she was told about an incident which the parties agree took place on 27 February 2015. She was told things by one of the other people who worked in the kitchen (the head chef) and she was also told things by Bradley Brooks himself. What she was told, and I am speaking generally, was that the accused was involved in an incident in which he had been ""knocked out or something"". Bradley Brooks told her that he had lost consciousness and that his windpipe had partially collapsed. That was information he was told by doctors. She described his appearance in paragraph 26 in which she said, ""Bradley didn't look well, he looked pale and he just wasn't himself. He was quieter than usual…"" and he told her he had been having headaches. That is the second part of her evidence.   
	
	
	The third part of her evidence is related to that second part but involved a conversation that occurred around Easter and then on the afternoon of 5 April 2015, which is to say just a few hours before the events with which this trial is concerned.
	
	
	The Crown has indicated that if I rule the evidence of those recent conversations – that is to say the conversations shortly before the incident giving rise to the charges against the accused – is relevant evidence that he would call Ms Baird in his case, thus allowing the accused the tactical advantage of being able to cross-examine Ms Baird. He would also elicit, or at least allow the accused to elicit, the conversations that occurred closer to the events of 27 February 2015.
	
	
	There were some arguments initially about whether or not the conversations were admissible under the hearsay provisions in sections 65 and 66 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) but I do not need to go into those arguments because, as the argument has developed, Mr Boe has submitted that the evidence would at least be admissible to put into context the conversations that happened shortly before 5 April 2015 or on 5 April 2015. So the question as to whether the Crown will call Ms Baird really turns on a decision that I need to make as to the relevance of what is said in paragraphs 27 and 29 of the statement of Ms Baird.
	
	
	It is common ground, as I understand it, that the incident on 27 February 2015 is relevant. In that incident, the accused was himself assaulted at the Beachcomber Hotel. This is the same venue where the accused and the two victims had been immediately before the tragic events that give rise to the present proceedings. There is evidence, to be admitted without objection, that the accused suffered some injury as a result of that. [1]  It is common ground that that is relevant evidence. Mr Boe opened the case by indicating that self-defence (and defence of another) would be an issue in the trial. In the course of the argument he has articulated the evidence which gives rise to the defence of self-defence. That includes the fact that there is at least some evidence that Joel Brooks, the brother of the accused, was pushed and possibly pushed to the ground and that that event happened immediately before Bradley Brooks became involved.
	
	
	He provided other details but it is unnecessary to go into the matter other than to say that the evidence of events of 27 February are relevant to the issue of whether the accused genuinely believed that it was necessary for him to take some action. They are also relevant to the question of whether his response was a reasonable one in the circumstances “as he [perceived] them”. [2]  The events that occurred on 27 February 2015 are relevant to those issues and the Crown has never, as I understand it, suggested that they are not.
	
	
	It follows from that that the conversation that the accused had with Sarah Baird that afternoon and on or before the Easter weekend is also relevant. It served as a reminder to him, that is the accused, of what happened the last time he attended the Beachcomber Hotel. Accordingly, my ruling is that the evidence in paragraphs 27 and 29 is relevant evidence.
	
	
	The question of the basis upon which any earlier conversation is admitted will turn to a degree on which witnesses are ultimately called in the case. It may be that that evidence is ultimately admitted to prove some of the events on 27 February 2015. Alternatively, it may be it is simply led to indicate that the conversations occurred, thus putting the conversation in the week leading up to Easter and on 5 April 2015 into perspective but that is a ruling that can be made after the evidence closes.
	
	
	I should repeat something that I said in argument. This issue commenced as a debate about the extent of the Prosecutor's duty to call relevant witnesses. It might be thought that the evidence of Ms Baird, whilst relevant as an aspect of the defence being raised by the accused, is borderline in that regard having regard to cases such as Whitehorn v The Queen [3]  and The Queen v Apostolides. [4]  As I said in argument the Crown has taken an admirably fair approach in indicating that he would call Mrs Baird if I ruled her evidence to be relevant. Whether her evidence “is necessary to unfold the narrative” [5]  is perhaps debatable one way or the other but I do congratulate the Crown Prosecutor in taking the approach that he has.

		17 November 2017",2017-03-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4273534,NSW Police v Snow [2017] NSWLC 2,"Judgment

Reasons for Decision


	
	The defendant has been apprehended for the offence of driving with an illicit drug present in his blood (s 111, Road Transport Act 2013) on two relevant occasions – 22 October 2015 and 30 October 2015. He pleads not guilty to both offences on the basis of an honest and reasonable mistake of fact.
	
	
	The legislative provision is simple:
	


111   Presence of certain drugs (other than alcohol) in oral fluid, blood or urine

(1) Presence of prescribed illicit drug in person’s oral fluid, blood or urine

A person must not, while there is present in the person’s oral fluid, blood or urine any prescribed illicit drug:

(a) drive a motor vehicle…..


	
	The elements of the offence are not in issue – the defendant was driving a motor vehicle on a public street whilst there was present a detectable level of THC in his oral fluid. There is no controversy with these elements in relation to both the charges.
	
	
	It is common ground that the detection level is 5 ng/ml, the cut-off for prosecution is 10, the defendant was tested at 233 ng/ml on the first occasion, and 26 on the second occasion. A nanogram is one thousand-millionth of a gram.
	
	
	It is important to note that there need not be any affect proven – the mere presence of a minute or residual presence of THC is sufficient. There is a separate offence of driving under the influence of a drug for which affect must be proven.
	


Does the defence apply to s 111 of the Road Transport Act?


	
	I have previously found that the defence of honest and reasonable fact applies to s 111 of the Road Transport Act: NSW v Carrall [2016] NSWLC 4. I note that decision has not been appealed, and I adopt the same reasoning here. So much was accepted by the prosecution in this case.
	


Burden and onus of proof


	
	There is an evidential burden to raise the defence. This has been achieved by the defendant’s evidence detailed below. The prosecution then bear the burden of disproving 'honest and reasonable mistake of fact'. The test is stated clearly in the concluding remarks of Goldring J in Appeal of Francesco Mendilicchiu [2008] NSWDC 182 at [20]:
	


I find that, once the appellant raised the defence of an honest and reasonable belief by asserting facts that, if true, would have exonerated him from guilt of the offence, the evidentiary burden of disproving that defence shifted to the prosecution.

Prosecution Case


	
	The apprehending officer for the first allegation was Senior Constable Benjamin Tuckett, and his evidence was by way of statement and he was not cross examined. The defendant stated to the police officer (at paragraph seven) that:
	


I have not had a smoke for about nine days mate.


	
	He also described his medical conditions as including lung cancer and emphysema.
	
	
	The apprehending officer for the second allegation was Senior Constable Mathew Linton and his evidence was also by way of statement and he was not cross-examined. The defendant stated to the police officer (at paragraph four)
	


I haven’t had a smoke now for over five weeks right and it’s still in your system.


	
	When the first roadside test was administered, and the defendant was informed that it came back positive he stated:
	


Yep cause it’s in your system mate. It takes ninety four or fifty four days to get out of your system. So you can test me now and test me tomorrow and you’re gonna get the same reading and your gunna test me the next day for seventy four days mate. If I took that to court and I’d beat it mate. Right. Drive under the influence of marijuana mate.


	
	When asked if he understood that this was not a DUI charge, he stated:
	


It’s not mate I haven’t had anything that’s the thing. I had not had any. So why do youse keep. Youse know all the police you all know it stays in your body.

The Evidence of Dr Perl


	
	Dr Perl gave evidence for the prosecution. Contained within her statement are details of her experience and her qualifications which are extensive. She was asked to assume consumption of cannabis had last occurred nine days prior.
	
	
	In her statement she states at page two that:
	


Where the drug is present, usage has been fairly recent.


	
	This statement is then qualified on page three by stressing that the length of time drugs can be detected varies due to many factors, and that usage and detection times are not certain. She also states that the prosecution limit used at the laboratory is 10 ng/ml.
	
	
	Dr Perl in her statement then reviews the available literature on saliva testing and concludes that
	


… a person using cannabis 9 days prior to the test would definitely NOT have a positive oral fluid result. However the Accused did have a positive result and the scientific studies demonstrate that this is not possible unless cannabis had been used within 12 hours of the oral fluid sampling.


	
	Under cross-examination Dr Perl was asked to define “fairly recent”. She answered:
	


In most users within 24 hours. With chronic heavy users no more than 48 hours.


	
	At first this seemed contradictory to her written report with respect to 12 hours. However she explained this with reference to a subsequent paper by O’Dell where very heavy users (two of them) had detectable levels up to 48 hours. However, she reiterated her view at 9.35 as follows:
	


Q. Sorry, perhaps I can put it this way. Your evidence is it would be impossible to be either five or 10 after nine days?

A. Absolutely impossible. According to all the scientific literature, yes.


	
	This certainty was reiterated at 13.30 to 13.45.
	
	
	At 13.1, Dr Perl conceded that the studies of THC in saliva are
	


Very few and far between. I mean they’re certainly not a widely studied area. Very few study it.


	
	Dr Perl was not aware of any study that found THC in oral fluid after eight days (at 13).
	
	
	On the issue of passive exposure, Dr Perl was asked to opine assuming a passive smoking episode in a hotel room an hour before the testing. She stated at 14.20:
	


… from the studies that have been done on passive exposure, you would not be a positive after that sort of exposure. The studies that were done were actually in extreme conditions where you’ve got very small closed environment with several smokers and only a couple of subjects who did not use any cannabis and they were not positive once they left that environment. So it would – it would be in a real situation impossible.


	
	This certainty was somewhat contradicted when Dr Perl was referred to the Dutch coffee shop study, where she conceded that the subjects in that study had tested positive once leaving the premises after exposure to cannabis smoke. However, she commented that the study was poorly designed and unverifiable.
	
	
	Despite that study, and some others, she reiterated her view at 16.15 that after an hour of passive exposure it was impossible to have a positive reading.
	


The Defendant’s evidence


	
	Mr Snow gave evidence that his last use before the first test was at least nine or ten days prior. He describes an incident where he was exposed to cannabis smoke in a closed room in the minutes prior to his apprehension for the first allegation. He was asked if he thought he would test positive and he said at 21.30:
	


No, no, I didn’t think I’d test positive at all.

Q. Why did you think that?

A. Because I hadn’t had any and the police said it was closed out of your system in 12 hours, 24 hours. That’s what they keep telling us, but people been pulled up 36 hours and it comes up in their system. So I don’t really know.

Q. When you say people keep telling us that…what do you mean by that?

A. …Well the police said once you – you can drive after 24 hours. If it shows up positive at the police station you’re not allowed to drive for 24 hours. So I assumed after 24 hours I was allowed to drive, because the police virtually told me. You can – after 24 hours you can drive. So I don’t know whether they’re misleading me or what the law is on it. No one seems to know.


	
	At 22.45 the defendant was asked why he thought he’d come up negative if tested by police. He stated:
	


Because I hadn’t had any for that long and I – I’m trying – no I gave it up because of my emphysema and because I cough up a lot of blood is always right in my system all the time. Even now I can taste it right in my lungs, you know. And because I’m so skinny there’s no fat for it to hold, to hold the – the THC. Where it is for me is just – is there. Where I get to the stage I don’t even have any but people say they can smell it because it’s coming out of the pores of my skin.


	
	The defendant was cross-examined by the prosecutor focusing firstly on the discrepancy between saying nine days on the date of the first allegation, and five weeks on the second, which was only eight days later. The defendant did not remember saying five weeks, and then denied it flatly describing it as follows (at 25.50):
	


… to me that’s just police verbal again.


	
	I note that the evidence of the police officer was recorded at the time, was reproduced in his statement, and was not the subject of cross-examination of the officer.
	
	
	The defendant flatly denied stating that it takes 94 or 54 days to get out of your system at 28.35.
	
	
	At 30.25 I asked the defendant whether, at the time of the first test, he believed there was still some cannabis in his system. He responded:
	


I couldn’t really say because I wasn’t affected in any way. I wasn’t under the influence. I wasn’t – there’s no euphoria, there’s no – you know.

The evidence of Professor Weatherby


	
	Professor Weatherby gave evidence for the defence, and during the course of his evidence gave details of his experience and qualifications which are extensive. He was head of drug testing for the Sydney Olympics, and has decades of experience in pharmacology.
	
	
	Professor Weatherby was taken to the current research on saliva testing, and pointed out several limitations to the studies in terms of the numbers tested, the dosage administered and the limited profile of the subjects. He pointed out at 35.40 that the research relied upon by Dr Perl included studies with six subjects, ten subjects and under 14 subjects, making
	


… a total of 24 people in the world that’s been looked at under controlled laboratory conditions with probably a very low dose.


	
	He criticises any attempt at certainty by extrapolating these results at 36.40:
	


… here where we’ve got some data in a very little controlled area, well controlled, a small – not even a hundred subjects, not even fifty, that we’re now applying to the world in terms of looking at ‘oh this is a particular oral fluid THC concentration so therefor it must mean something’. Well in relation to those particular very, reasonably healthy subjects there it might mean something but for the rest of the community you might have all sorts of other complications.


	
	Professor Weatherby detailed the O’Dell study describing that after 30 hours the subjects ranged from one to 327 ng/ml. After 61 hours the highest was 37 nanograms per ml. This, he said, exemplified the extremes that occur in this type of testing because not everyone responds to a drug in the same way (at 38.5).
	
	
	Professor Weatherby’s conclusion was that this was an area of very little study, that the extremely small numbers do not give rise to extrapolation and that there are simply too many unknowns to make conclusions as made by Dr Perl:
	


I’m very critical of Dr Perl’s comments that these sort of things are a blanket ‘no that won’t happen’. She cannot say that. There is no way she is able to say that. Because there is no scientific evidence to do so and that is the big issue.


	
	At 46.5, Professor Weatherby discusses the kind of wide ranging research with thousands of subjects that would be necessary to form confident conclusions regarding saliva testing and times of use including different ethnic groups, allowances for clean mouth conditions without residue, bleeding from ulcers or other disease.
	
	
	In terms of passive smoking, Professor Weatherby detailed the Dutch study and other studies and concluded that the passive exposure detailed by the defendant could have led to a positive result - it is “a very plausible possibility that that occurred” (at 42.35). He also concluded that passive smoking could get a subject to the 10 nanogram limit after “maybe” an hour and a half.
	
	
	There is a very important passage in the evidence of Dr Weatherby relating to the differential between the reading of the test on the first occasion (233 ng/ml) and the second (26 ng/ml). Dr Weatherby concluded at 47.25:
	


Yeah. I mean in terms of the – the two reading about eight days apart, we’re looking at that terminal phase which goes for days, it’s dropped and we’re looking at potentially – you know we’re talking about half-lives here of it could be 10 to 40 days, that’s consistent with 233 – he said he’d done nine days, and then another eight days its dropped to 26. It’s consistent.


	
	As I understand this evidence, it is that a reading in the saliva of 233 ng/ml on day one, without any fresh consumption, could lead to a reading of 26 ng/ml eight days later.
	
	
	Under cross examination Professor Weatherby detailed the Dutch study, and on the half-life issue and passive smoking stated at 9.35 (on the second day of the hearing) that those persons in a room with others would have tested positive in New South Wales with readings of 12 to 17 ng/ml. On the half-life issue, he stated that one of those would have tested positive in New South Wales for another three to four days (at 10.10). And later at 11.5:
	


But the thing is that two of the people in the same room would have, if they then walked out and got in a car and driven off and it was in New South Wales, would have tested positive, and likely one of them for a couple of days.


	
	Under cross-examination Professor Weatherby concluded in relation to the defendant’s evidence at 12.40 relating to cannabis use and smelling of cannabis:
	


I think because there was nowhere else for it to go it’s still floating around and probably clogging up blood vessels somewhere and – and as – thinning out. So I suspect – and what you’ve got to think is that this body compartments, because of his actual physical nature, is probably making what’s in the blood somewhat higher than a lot of other people.


	
	It was put in cross-examination to Professor Weatherby at 13.4 that the reading of 233 ng/ml and nine days was totally inconsistent with the literature to date. Professor Weatherby disputed that:
	


… because the evidence we’re getting is - is pushing that out and we really have not got any evidence about reality - that we know of that’s got a group of really really heavy users, of big doses....

Resolution of Expert Evidence Issues


	
	This is a case where the experts have given utterly contradictory evidence. Dr Perl states that it is impossible to test positive above 10ng/ml after nine days. Professor Weatherby categorically states that this conclusion is unsustainable. These differing views rest largely on agreed material – the limited published studies on the issue. These radically different positions require resolution by this court.
	
	
	The leading case on this issue is Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4 where the issue was substantially determined. In that case three children and their mother died from knife wounds. The father of the children was charged with all four murders. The defence case was that the prosecution had not excluded the hypothesis that the mother had killed the children and then herself. Accordingly, the focus was on the expert evidence relating to the wound on the mother and whether it was self-inflicted. Two of the experts gave evidence that it was probable that the mother had died at her own hand. Four of the experts were of the contrary view.
	
	
	The court found that this direction by the trial judge was not in error (at [36]):
	


The trial judge told the jury that, in assessing the expert evidence, it was proper for them to bear in mind that they lacked the scientific knowledge and experience of the experts and that insofar as their opinion depended on scientific medical or psychological knowledge (as opposed to common experience or common sense) ""it would not be proper to find an issue against the accused by accepting one body of expert evidence and rejecting another unless there was good reason for doing so""… [emphasis in original]


	
	At [85] Gaudron J (dissenting), quoting in part from Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] [1984] HCA 7, found:
	


If the conflicting evidence of experts is not based on matters or assumptions with respect to matters upon which the jury can reach its own conclusions but, instead, is evidence of ""opinion on matters of science within disciplines of which each [is] a master, and at a level of difficulty and sophistication above that at which a juror ... might by reasoning from general scientific knowledge subject the opinions to wholly effective critical evaluation"", a jury cannot, by reference solely to that evidence, resolve that conflict in a manner ""which would eliminate reasonable doubt"".


	
	Gummow and Callinan JJ at [178]–[]182] appear to have taken a different view where they found that:
	


180. … the position… that juries are entitled to prefer one group of experts over another is, as a matter of general principle, clearly established. …

181. The correct position is, in our opinion, that conflicting expert evidence will always call for careful evaluation. …

182. Juries are frequently called upon to resolve conflicts between experts. They have done so from the inception of jury trials. … Nor is it the law, that simply because there is a conflict in respect of difficult and sophisticated expert evidence, even with respect to an important, indeed critical matter, its resolution should for that reason alone be regarded by an appellate court as having been beyond the capacity of the jury to resolve.


	
	The task of the fact-finder in cases where there is such a dispute is succinctly characterised by the Criminal Trials Bench Book produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, under the heading “Where there is a conflict between the experts…” (at [2-1110]):
	


In the present case, there is a conflict between the expert evidence of [AB] called on behalf of the Crown and that of [CD] called on behalf of [the accused]. It goes to the issue of … [specify the issue(s)]. It is not a case of simply choosing between their evidence as a matter of simple preference. How you approach the resolution of that conflict will depend largely upon which party has the onus of proof in relation to the issue upon which the expert evidence relates. …

It is for you to decide whose evidence and whose opinion you accept in whole or in part, or whose evidence you reject altogether. …


	
	In this case the defence have handed up the research reports for the court to read. It is not my function to read those reports and come to some lay independent expert view on the veracity or potential for extrapolation of the findings. My task is to evaluate the evidence and, keeping in mind the onus and burden of proof, assess the acceptability of the evidence.
	
	
	In applying the above direction from the bench book to myself I have carefully considered the evidence given by each of the experts. In my view Dr Perl was clear and straightforward in her evidence, and was prepared to make concessions as appropriate when new evidence (further research) was apparent. She also conceded that the research was limited, but opined that it was nonetheless sufficient to draw finite conclusions. In my view her opinion as to time delay softened appropriately in the light of the fresh evidence and she brings years of experience to her conclusions. In my view Professor Weatherby was also clear and straightforward in his evidence. He had read and analysed each of the studies in question in detail, and brought to bear vast experience in the field, particularly in the area of testing drugs. This was not evidence tailored to muddy the waters and strive for reasonable doubt. It was given in a manner and content in an effort to assist the court. Certainly, if there is strength in his firm and unequivocal evidence as to potential half-life, then THC can be detected for far longer periods than the assumptions and conclusions of Dr Perl would allow. If there is strength to his evidence as to the potential for detection following passive smoking, then this has serious and significant implications for those exposed to THC indirectly.
	
	
	This is indeed an unusual case which has caused me great pause for thought. How can two rational and reasonable, highly qualified experts with decades of experience come to such completely different opinions based largely on the same few academic articles?
	
	
	In the end this is a criminal case, and whilst I would be comfortable, should the evidence allow, in discounting one expert or the other, this is not such a case. To succeed in this case, the prosecution would have to have seriously dented the evidence of Professor Weatherby, and they have not done so. Alternately, they would have needed to provide grounds for accepting the evidence of Dr Perl over that of Professor Weatherby. They have not done so. They bear the burden. The doubt is reasonable, and must favour the defendant.
	
	
	I find as a question of fact that had the defendant consumed cannabis nine or ten days prior, and been exposed to a passive smoking situation as described, he may well have tested positive with the levels described in the analyst certificates on each occasion. The prosecution have not excluded this as a reasonable hypothesis.
	


Resolution of the factual matters


	
	It is important to note that the time at which the defendant’s state of mind (as to honest and reasonable mistake) is crucial is at the time of committing the offence. I have carefully analysed his evidence and listened to portions of it again in reviewing the transcript and submissions made.
	
	
	I do not accept that the defendant, at the time of committing the offences, had an honest and reasonable mistake as to whether he had cannabis in his system at detectable limits. In Carrall I made the following comments at [44]:
	


Of course it can never be the law that a person can rely on mistake where they made a miscalculation as to their driving ability based upon a misconceived analysis of their own level of intoxication. Every day in every court in the land defendants say: “I thought I was sober enough to drive”. And that is because alcohol and other drugs intoxicate and dull the judgement. The defence of honest and reasonable mistake is not a drunk (or drug) driver’s charter.


	
	The comments of Adams J in DPP v Bone [2005] NSWSC 1239 reinforce this at [36]:
	


One of the important purposes of the legislation is to warn drivers that, whatever their subjective judgment might be as to their fitness to drive, they are objectively a danger to themselves and to other members of the public if they drive with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in their blood. Accordingly, persons who drink drive at their peril as well as the peril of other road users.


	
	In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25, it was said at [8]:
	


Where it is a ground of exculpation, the law in Australia requires that the honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief be in a state of affairs such that, if the belief were correct, the conduct of the accused would be innocent. In that context, the word ""innocent"" means not guilty of a criminal offence. In the case of an offence, or a series of offences, defined by statute, it means that, if the belief were true, the conduct of the accused would be ""outside the operation of the enactment"". [footnote omitted]


	
	In my opinion, the defendant’s view at the time of the offence was that he still had cannabis in his system. He had been told others could smell it on his skin. He told the police on the second arrest that he knew that after five weeks it could still be in your system. His state of mind at that time was clear:
	


Yep cause it’s in your system mate. It takes ninety four or fifty four days to get out of your system. So you can test me now and test me tomorrow and you’re gonna get the same reading and you’re gunna test me the next day for seventy four days mate. If I took that to court and I’d beat it mate. Right. Drive under the influence of marijuana mate.


	
	In my view this state of mind is not consistent with an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. In my view the evidence establishes that the defendant well knew that the cannabis may still be in his system, and chose to drive and run that gauntlet based upon some misapprehension as to a need to show affectation.
	
	
	He told the police that it was nine days, then five weeks, a crucial inconsistency that belies the later held belief stated in oral evidence that he thought he would not test positive. When asked why he thought that, he answered with a confusing reference to 24 hours, then 36 hours, then quoting the police suspension time on a positive test.
	
	
	Despite the evidence being uncontested (and/or recorded) he denied making crucial statements blaming it on memory or police verbal or other such unconvincing excuse.
	
	
	The defendant was a most unimpressive witness, not just cantankerous and unwell, but clearly tailoring his oral evidence to a later-formed position of ignorance, despite his statements to the police. In my view the prosecution have disproved an honest and reasonable mistake of fact because I have formed the opinion that he knew full well that he may have been positive and still chose to drive. A person cannot rely on an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the detectability of cannabis in the system where there is accepted evidence that they knew they could still be detectable.
	
	
	In my view, if a driver knows they may be detected after nine days, or 17 days, and chooses to drive, the defence is disproven. That is the evidence here by virtue of the statements made to the police and the ambiguity of the oral testimony of the defendant.
	
	
	In Carrall, by comparison, I accepted that the defendant genuinely and reasonably formed the opinion that he would have no cannabis in his system based on the advice of the police officer to him directly. Mr Snow, on the other hand, clearly believes that he has cannabis in his system after 17 days (or five weeks) because that is precisely what he told the police.
	


Conclusion


	
	Accordingly, the prosecution having disproved the defence beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is convicted of each offence, and the court will now move to the sentencing phase.

		06 April 2017",2017-02-08 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
4273539,NSW Police v Klein [2016] NSWLC 26,"Judgment


	
	The defendant is charged with a single count of “consorting” contrary to s 93X of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The particulars of the charge state that the accused did, between 2145 hrs and 2200 hrs on 27 August 2015, “habitually consort with convicted offenders, to wit Timothy MARTIN, Luke RAZZA and Benjamin GITTANY after having been given an official warning in relation to each of those convicted offenders.”
	
	
	The case proceeded almost entirely on agreed documentary evidence, with only one prosecution witness being briefly questioned by the prosecutor. After the closure of the prosecution case, the defence called no evidence. None of the prosecution evidence was disputed.
	
	
	Mr Lang for the defendant made a number of submissions on the case’s legal aspects, with particular reference to the decision of High Court of Australia (HCA) in Tajjour v New South Wales; Hawthorne v New South Wales; Forster v New South Wales [1]  (Tajjour). In order to properly address those submissions it is necessary to analyse the language of Part 3A, Division 7 of the Crimes Act 1900, comprising ss 93W, 93X and 93Y, with some precision as, despite its brevity, the language of the Division is decidedly obscure.
	
	
	These sections provide:
	


93W   Definitions

In this Division:

consort means consort in person or by any other means, including by electronic or other form of communication.

convicted offender means a person who has been convicted of an indictable offence (disregarding any offence under section 93X).

93X   Consorting

(1)  A person who:

(a)  habitually consorts with convicted offenders, and

(b)  consorts with those convicted offenders after having been given an official warning in relation to each of those convicted offenders,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 3 years, or a fine of 150 penalty units, or both.

(2)  A person does not habitually consort with convicted offenders unless:

(a)  the person consorts with at least 2 convicted offenders (whether on the same or separate occasions), and

(b)  the person consorts with each convicted offender on at least 2 occasions.

(3)  An official warning is a warning given by a police officer (orally or in writing) that:

(a)  a convicted offender is a convicted offender, and

(b)  consorting with a convicted offender is an offence.

93Y   Defence

The following forms of consorting are to be disregarded for the purposes of section 93X if the defendant satisfies the court that the consorting was reasonable in the circumstances:

(a)  consorting with family members,

(b)  consorting that occurs in the course of lawful employment or the lawful operation of a business,

(c)  consorting that occurs in the course of training or education,

(d)  consorting that occurs in the course of the provision of a health service,

(e)  consorting that occurs in the course of the provision of legal advice,

(f)  consorting that occurs in lawful custody or in the course of complying with a court order.


	
	There is no reason to revisit the history of “consorting” legislation in NSW or elsewhere, as the HCA in Tajjour examined this topic quite closely.
	


Consort


	
	Section 93W begins with one of those tautologies beloved of NSW parliamentary draftspersons, viz, “‘consort’ means consort”: perhaps a statement of the obvious. The next two words, however, provide some greater meaning, so the initial clause becomes “‘consort’ means consort in person”, assuming a received meaning for the verb ""consort"", which may be taken to have been based upon the pre-existing judicial interpretation [2] . This formulation is then further expanded with the words, “or by any other means, including by electronic or other form of communication”.
	
	
	Earlier authority did not focus on “communication” expressly. In Johanson v Dixon, [3]  in a judgment expressly approved by French CJ [4]  and Keane J [5]  in Tajjour, Mason J states:
	


ln its context ‘consorts‘ means 'associates' or ‘keeps company’ and it denotes some seeking or acceptance of the association on the part of the defendant."" [6] 


	
	According to Hayne J in Tajjour:
	


First, there is an element of associating or keeping company. Second, there must be “some seeking or acceptance of the association on the part of the defendant”. [7] 


	
	In Johanson v Dixon, Aickin J, with whom Stephen J also agreed, said: [8] 
	


The ordinary meaning of the words ‘to consort’ is to ‘accompany; to escort or attend, to be a consort to (someone) or to associate oneself with (someone)', and thus to associate with or to keep company with a particular person is to ‘consort’ with such person. In this respect I agree with the views expressed in Brown v Bryan that it denotes some seeking or acceptance of the association with other specified persons on the part of a defendant.


	
	These older authorities describe the nature of “consorting” at common law as requiring physical presence (or “keeping company”) of consorters together. While this may still satisfy the definition of “consort” as meaning “consort in person”, it is clearly Parliament’s intention that the requirement of such presence be removed in the expanded version of consorting. However, given the final word of the s 93W definition of “consort”, it seems inherent in the new structure that some form of communication between persons, whether in each other’s presence or not, is fundamental to consorting. Whilst the concept is not stated expressly this way in the varied judgments in Tajjour, it would seem to be supported by the HCA’s opinions. Most clearly, Gaegler J stated:
	


Section 93W serves to ensure that consorting is not limited to personal interactions involving physical presence; but ss 93X and 93W do not operate to proscribe all forms of communication between an individual and a person convicted of an indictable offence. While consorting will usually, if not always, involve some communication between the putative consorts, not every communication between individuals can sensibly be described as consorting.” [9] 


	
	While his Honour was perhaps over-cautious in suggesting that there could be “consorting” between people without communication, the examples chosen by him further in his judgment do not disclose any example of consorting absent communication:
	


“Not every conceivable social interaction between individuals, one or more of whom happens to have been convicted of an indictable offence, amounts to consorting with convicted offenders. Quite apart from s 93Y, no one would sensibly suggest that the sending of a letter of demand by a creditor to a debtor could, of itself, amount to consorting. Equally, an individual who regularly catches the same bus to work as a group of persons previously convicted of indictable offences could not sensibly be said to consort with persons convicted of an indictable offence. Similarly, a pollster who canvasses the political opinions of persons convicted of indictable offences on a regular basis cannot be said to be habitually consorting with those convicted offenders. A member of a political party would not contravene s 93X merely by attending a branch meeting of the party which is also attended by fellow party members who happen to be persons who have been convicted of an indictable offence. Similarly, a political blogger could not be said to consort with convicted offenders by reason of the fact that they are on his or her mailing list. Nor could it be suggested that persons chatting while waiting to vote at a polling booth are consorting with each other.” [10] 

In particular, his Honour’s “blogger” example envisages a situation where communication is one-way only.

Habitually consort


	
	However, it is not any consorting that is criminalised, but only “habitual” consorting. Section 93X(2) seems to be designed to place some limitation on the common law concept of “habitual consorting” by providing that:
	


A person does not habitually consort with convicted offenders unless:

(a)  the person consorts with at least 2 convicted offenders (whether on the same or separate occasions), and

(b)  the person consorts with each convicted offender on at least 2 occasions.


	
	On the common law consideration of this topic, French CJ observed in Tajjour: [11] 
	


The term ""habitually consorts"", in the offence provisions of the various States, required, in practical terms, proof of more than one occasion of association between a defendant and reputed thieves or criminals. Consorting was construed as ""frequent companionship"". The adverb ""habitually"" required that it be more than occasional, ""so constant as to have created a habit."" It was not necessary that the consorting be with the same person or persons.

and that:


	
	It was a ""question of degree”, involving consideration by the court of the number of times a person had been in company with reputed criminals and all the circumstances”;
	
	
	The requirement that consorting be habitual involved ""a continuance and permanence of some tendency, something that has developed into a propensity, that is present from day to day."" [12] 
	



	
	Section 93X(2) prescribes two concurrent necessary conditions for consorting to be classified as “habitual” consorting. A person may consort with the same convicted offender 100 times, but will not thereby be habitually consorting with that offender. It is only when the person has previously (or simultaneously) consorted with a second convicted offender that an offence is committed. Similarly, a person may consort with 100 different convicted offenders but will only habitually consort when he or she consorts with two of them a second time.
	
	
	The formulation of s 93X(2) carries the logical implication that, even if paragraphs (a) and (b) are satisfied with respect to a person, the person is not necessarily consorting: they are necessary but not sufficient conditions. [13]  It appears there is still room in this formulation for the common law concept of “frequent companionship”, [14]  even if companionship is now via Skype rather than by physical closeness.
	
	
	In common law parlance, the adverb ""habitually"" required that it be more than occasional, ""so constant as to have created a habit"". [15]  But the s 93X definitions seems to have entirely done away with that concept.
	


Occasions


	
	Mr Lang argued that there must be some temporal separation in events before they can be described as “occasions”. So much may be conceded, but the extent of that separation is unclear. For example, on the prosecution evidence, the accused was seen by police twice on the same day travelling in a particular car with one or more convicted offenders. Mr Lang‘s argument was that the apparent continuity of these two events, in terms of location, participants and time, meant they together constituted only a single “occasion” of consorting. ln one sense this might merely be a matter of evidence. Consorting, as an offence, does not occur only when police or other persons observe it: it is a continuing behaviour. Evidence of all sorts, such as listening or video recording devices, could be used to establish that consorting took place between particular individuals, regardless of whether the consorting conduct was observed at the time by police or anyone else.
	
	
	Whilst, as noted above, the common law saw physical proximity as a necessary element of consorting (because, prior to the development of the telephone, real-time oral communication could not occur except in the presence of the parties), the statutory expansion of that concept by s 93X removes such spatial proximity from the realm of “necessary” conditions. The spatial dimensions being unnecessary, the only remaining dimension is the temporal, so that an “occasion” must logically be sufficiently constituted by a period of time during which consorting is occurring.
	
	
	lt follows from the above that two ”occasions” exist only when there are two distinct periods of time that are separated by another period of time: two periods of time that are consecutive or overlapping can only constitute a single “occasion”. The legislation provides no direction as to how long the individual occasions, or the period of separation, must be. But to constitute an “occasion”, the requisite period of time must at least be long enough for communication to occur between the parties, since if there is no communication there is no consorting.
	
	
	It does not seem that there must be some direct communication link between consorter (CO) and consortee (CE), as envisaged by s 93W. If CO talks to X (who is not a convicted offender), and X communicates that conversation to CE1 and CE2 (who are both convicted offenders) on the same occasion, is CO “habitually” consorting with either CE1 or CE2? Section 93W’s use of the words “by any other means” suggest an affirmative answer to this question.
	


The present scenario


	
	Mr Lang's initial argument was that when, on 7 August 2015, D entered a building shortly after a convicted offender, about whom D had been officially warned, entered the same building, consorting had not been established. [16]  That argument is, on the above principles, clearly correct. The prosecution must prove that some actual “consorting” took place: that is, they must show that there was some communication between D and the convicted offender(s). Were the building to be a single room rather than a house, the inference of communication would be quite strong. But in this instance there is no evidence that the police knew when D left the building, so that the prosecution would be unable inferentially to prove consorting, either because there was insufﬁcient time for it to occur, or there was, time aside, insufficient evidence that D and CE had any communication at all. The second argument centred on the abovementioned observations of D in a motor vehicle on the offence date of 27 August 2015. The position suggested by the prosecution was that each period of time during which police observed D in the vehicle was a separate occasion for the purposes of s 93X, as the two periods of observation were themselves separated by an intervening period.
	
	
	However, it would be necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the two observations were not of the one consorting event, viewed twice, but rather were observations of two distinct consorting events, necessarily separated by a period constituting a non-consorting event, viewed (at least) once each. If either argument is correct, the prosecution’s case must fail. If D is not proven beyond reasonable doubt to have consorted with a convicted offender on 7 August 2015, or on 27 August 2015, there is evidence of only a single prior relevant consorting event involving D, and s 93X(2) is not satisfied. In my view the evidence falls short of establishing that critical fact. l find the defendant not guilty. The charge is dismissed.

4275997,R v Glen [1994] NSWCCA 1,"Judgment


	
	GROVE J: Peter James Glen appeared before his Honour Judge Saunders QC in the Penrith District Court on 22 September 1993 where he pleaded guilty to a count of sexual intercourse without consent which was accepted by the Crown in discharge of an indictment which also contained a more serious charge. It was noted that the opportunity to plead guilty to the lesser charge had first been made available on that day. The appellant was aged twenty seven years and had been employed as a linesman by Telecom. He claimed that he had been dismissed as a result of being charged with the present matter and although - as the sentencing judge commented - it would appear surprising that dismissal would follow what amounted to mere allegation, the appellant's assertion was not challenged. Thereafter he remained unemployed. His prior convictions were - in relative terms - minor. In 1991 he had been fined for cultivating a prohibited plant and further fined for driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle whilst he was unlicensed. In 1992 he was fined for receiving. Saunders DCJ sentenced the appellant to two years penal servitude to date from 22 September 1993 with an additional term of a further two years.
	
	
	The victim was one JV. A perspective of the offence requires some examination of the relationship between her and the appellant. They had known each other since they went to school together in the suburb of Shalvey. Their parents - or at least their mothers so far as the information before the court reveals - lived around the corner from each other. JV was the mother of a child AV of whom one Alan Loosenore was said to be the father. She had, however, for a span of about two and a half years prior to the offence been living in a relationship with the appellant. A daughter EV had been born. The relationship between the appellant and the victim was somewhat strained and he was expressing considerable upset about possible denial of access to his daughter and his exclusion from participating in her upbringing.
	
	
	JV was called to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings by the appellant’s representatives. He also testified. JV fixed the previous April as a time of cessation of her relationship with the appellant but her description of the severance merits examination. It was extremely laconic and although interrupted by counsel it can be gleaned that when she was moving to an address on the Central Coast she asked the appellant whether he was going to come with her. He responded in the negative although they continued to see each other on an “off/on period, sort of- more really, really close friends than anything.” It is hardly surprising that the learned sentencing judge understood this in accordance with the finding which he made in these terms:
	


“…since that time she had been seeing him they were close friends and nothing more.”


	
	The addendum “nothing more” was incorrect. The offence occurred on 12 October 1991 so that it was nearly two years before the appellant appeared for sentence. In the interim, JV had given birth to another son RV. That a sexual relationship had resumed between the parties is clear from the appellant’s testimony that he was seeking then to find out whether he was the father of RV. His candidacy was not contradicted by JV and it might be observed that in written submissions and in testimony in this Court he has now positively asserted his paternity. In passing I add that the approach of the appellant to JV was in breach of bail conditions then pertaining and it is clear JV was aware of this although obviously she reported nothing about it.
	
	
	I can begin a description of events leading up to the offence a few days beforehand. JV had arranged with a girlfriend of hers to take that girlfriend’s three children from their home on the Central Coast to her mother’s place in an outer Sydney suburb where she was spending some school holidays so that the children could visit Australia’s Wonderland Amusement Park. The appellant assisted in this excursion. Owing to some delays however the children did not visit the park. They were returned to the Central Coast. However on 12 October the appellant turned up with these children again. It is unnecessary to trace everybody's movements on that day. According to the appellant he consumed a considerable quantity of liquor in the course of the day including a bottle of bourbon and a large amount of beer. He had also acquired some marijuana.
	
	
	The appellant was later in the night still accompanied by the three children from the Central Coast. He was by then at the home - nearby to both his and JV’s mother’s dwellings - of a man named Gibbonson. JV had retired for the evening when the appellant by means of persistent telephone calls persuaded her to come to the Gibbonson house. They walked together from there to the residence of some people called Mayer but they were out and they returned to the Gibbonson’s residence. In the front yard of this residence the offence occurred. The appellant’s version that intercourse took place within the house should be rejected. It is plain that the appellant was behaving hysterically as well as sexually aggressively and insofar as the victim succumbed it was no indication of consent. The absence of consent was a factor conceded by the appellant in his plea of guilty.
	
	
	It is a somewhat bizarre aspect to the whole affair that the offence occurred virtually in public in a yard. The appellant’s mother passed by whilst it was occurring. JV asked Mrs Glen for assistance and it is perhaps some indication of existing undercurrents that Mrs Glen gave voice to feelings of utter exasperation and indicated that she was going to - for the first time in her life - ring the police. As events turned out, after the victim returned home she spoke to her mother and it was her mother who telephoned the police. JV did not return home however until after she had shared some marijuana with the appellant. It appears that when she returned she had a bruised lip which had previously been bleeding and this attracted attention. The causing of harm is not an ingredient in the offence for which the appellant stood for sentence.
	
	
	The appellant was originally unrepresented in this appeal but he has since retained Mr Hidden QC. Mr Hidden did not appear below but the appellant was then represented by counsel.
	
	
	The appeal, despite the plea of guilty, is against both conviction and sentence. Evidence was taken in relation to the first of these issues. In substance the assertion of the appellant was that he did not appreciate when he pleaded guilty that he was acknowledging the absence of consent of JV to sexual intercourse. His explanation for offering the plea was that he had understood a communication from his counsel to mean that unless he pleaded guilty he was likely to be deprived of access to his daughter. So motivated, but without really understanding the extent of his acknowledgment, he offered the plea. In cross examination he repeated that he never denied having intercourse and added ''I am just saying it was never forced upon her, it was always consented."" He reasserted that by pleading guilty he did not realize that he was actually admitting the absence of consent. The insincerity of the appellant's evidence was revealed shortly after that and no elaboration is required upon this extract from the transcript:
	


""Q. What did you think the plea of guilty meant?

A. Just thought that was a lesser plea. Mr Barnett stated to me, you know, 'Best of my knowledge you wasn't going to gaol, worse that will happen to you you will get weekend detention.' If I thought pleading guilty to get my daughter, I will plead it.

LOVED AY AJ: Q. Pleading guilty to what?

A. Lesser charge.

Q. Charge of what?

A. Sex without consent.

Q. Charge of what?

A. Sex.

GROVE J: You did say sex without consent?

A. Yes.

HOWIE: Q. You knew when pleading guilty you were admitting to sex without consent?

A. Yes.""


	
	The solicitor acting for the appellant at trial was called. I found his evidence acceptable and I would be prepared to depend upon it. Significantly he obtained written instructions from the appellant prior to the arraignment. The terms of the instructions were:
	


“I hereby authorize and direct you that I wish to accept the prosecution’s offer of accepting a plea of non consensual intercourse and leaving the aggravated sexual assault charge out.

I understand that [JV] has indicated that she does not wish to see me go to gaol, and is willing to give evidence that she thinks I have been a good person most of the time and that I have been a fairly good father to [EV] and that she wants me to get help.

I understand that there is no guarantee that on my plea of guilty to non consensual intercourse that I won’t be given a gaol sentence.

I understand and my solicitors and counsel have explained to me that if I were to plead not guilty and have the trial run and I were to be found guilty by the court that there is a much greater chance of me being sentenced to a gaol term and that it might be a very significant term.

I understand that there is a possibility of winning my case, however there were a number of difficulties including the record of interview and the evidence of injury and complaint.”


	
	Other matters were canvassed in support of setting aside the plea of guilty. In essence they all focussed upon a proposition that the admission of guilt involved in the plea should be regarded as tainted as not being a free and voluntary confession: cf Reg v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218. The terms of the written instructions, the evidence of the solicitor Mr Magee and the lack of credibility attaching to the appellant’s assertion combine to make his position on this issue quite untenable. The references to the appellant’s fears concerning access to his daughter show a contribution to the motives which the appellant may have had in offering his plea of guilty but they do not erode the necessary qualities which his confession has, nor do they provide a ground for permitting him not to adhere to it.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant has submitted that the sentencing judge fell into error in failing to give adequate weight to the lack of any relevant prior record, the emotional background to the incident - including his fears concerning future contact with his daughter which I have earlier mentioned, - the remorse expressed in his evidence and the attitude of the complainant.
	
	
	None of these matters was overlooked by the sentencing judge. In particular, he made express reference to the attitude of the complainant. It cannot be that the attitude of complainants can govern the duty of a court when proceeding to sentence. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the adoption of such a practice or philosophy would involve taking into account the desires of unforgiving complainants for vengeance or salutary penalty.
	
	
	There is in my opinion no error of consequence disclosed in the remarks made by the sentencing judge. It was an ingredient of the offence to which the appellant pleaded guilty that there was no consent. The existence of a relationship between the parties does not diminish the entitlement of a woman to engage in sexual intercourse only if and when she consents to it.
	
	
	It was a serious offence and committed in a place that was open to the public view of passers by.
	
	
	I do not regard the total term assessed by his Honour as outside appropriate range and it has been divided to the advantage of the appellant into minimum and additional term.
	
	
	I have referred to the absence of error of consequence in the remarks of the sentencing judge. The evidence was presented in a confused fashion but his conclusion that the resumption of relations between the victim and the appellant did not involve sexual congress was wrong. That error of fact does not seem to me to vitiate the sentence and I do not consider that a less severe sentence was warranted nor that in terms of the Criminal Appeal Act such a sentence should be substituted. The appellant’s own evidence showed that he was well aware that intercourse should only take place by consent and that forcing his attentions upon his partner was punishable. The circumstances of their relationship before and afterwards do not in my opinion detract from the proportionality of the sentence.
	
	
	I propose that the appeal be dismissed and the conviction confirmed. Leave to appeal against sentence granted but the appeal dismissed. Time to count.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Grove J, and I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons therefor. I wish to add only a few words on the relevance of the attitude of the victim of the offence to the sentence which should be imposed. I do not suggest that forgiveness by a victim can never be a relevant factor in the sentencing decision. It has been so regarded in the past, particularly in relation to offences such as culpable driving causing grievous bodily harm or death. The forgiveness of the family of a victim killed by reckless or drunken driving is a matter that courts from time to time take into account in the sentencing process. It is appropriate that they do so. One might speculate that the community would consider it appropriate. The converse, of course, cannot so readily be accepted. A victim or family of a victim calling for vengeance could create special difficulties for courts, and it is, in my view, generally undesirable that the sentencing process be subjected to distraction from a consideration of what is, in an overall sense, a proper result.
	
	
	An imbalance or one sidedness is thereby immediately created; a merciful attitude by a victim, or victim's family may be material, a vengeful attitude cannot or should not be. This imbalance is common to all offences in which there is an identifiable victim, and is only one of number of reasons why caution should be exercised in the consideration of such evidence.
	
	
	In my opinion, exceptional caution should be exercised in the receipt, and the use, of evidence of that kind in cases that fall within the general description of domestic violence offences, of which this case is one. It is a fact known to the courts and to the community that victims of domestic violence frequently, and clearly contrary to their own interests and welfare, forgive their attackers. It is said, and has been said so often and for so long as to be almost notorious, that it was this pattern of post offence forgiveness, accompanied by apparent remorse or contrition on the part of the offender, that prevented the prosecution of such offenders. In turn, it appeared that the victim of domestic violence was in a class different to the rest of the community insofar as the protection of the law was concerned. Domestic violence was not seen as a crime which attracted the sanction of the law in the same way or to the same extent as other crimes, whether or not of violence. The perpetrator of domestic violence was relatively safe to commit crimes with impunity, at least provided he or she (and, in the cases that have to date come before the courts, it has almost invariably been he) could attain the victim's forgiveness.
	
	
	There are two main arguments of principle against the proposition that this Court should give any weight to the expressed wish of the victim in this case that the applicant not be incarcerated. The first concerns the importance, especially great in cases of domestic violence, given the history that I have alluded to, of general deterrence. This Court must send a signal to domestic violence offenders that, regardless of self interest denying forgiveness on the part of victims, those victims will nevertheless receive the full protection of the law, insofar as the courts are able to afford it to them. It must not be forgotten, that, if it is to be accorded weight by the courts, forgiveness by the victim also operates contrary to the interests of other victims. Until it is recognised that domestic violence will be treated with severe penalties regardless of a later softening of attitude by the victim, no progress is likely to be made in its abolition or reduction. Put simply, the importance of general deterrence in such cases overrides any minor relevance that evidence of forgiveness might have.
	
	
	For too long the community in general and the agencies of law enforcement in particular, have turned their backs upon the helpless victims of domestic violence. Acceptance of the victim's word that he/she forgives the offender, casts too great a burden of responsibility upon one individual already in a vulnerable position. Neither the community, the law enforcement agencies, nor the courts can be permitted to abdicate their responsibility in this fashion. Protection of the particular victim in the particular case is a step towards protection of other victims in other cases.
	
	
	The second reason of principle for treating with extreme caution the evidence of the forgiveness of the victim in the circumstances of this case is that the legislature has, since 1982, made clear its intention that special considerations apply to offences of domestic violence. Not only is the present offence one which, in ordinary parlance, would be categorised as a domestic violence offence; it is so within the meaning of that term in the Crimes Act 1900. And it is in respect of such offences that special measures were taken, including the introduction of s 407AA to the Crimes Act 1900, inter alia, removing the long established non compellability of one spouse to give evidence against another. The second reading speeches in both houses of the NSW Parliament when these provisions were introduced make it perfectly clear that the intention of the legislature that domestic violence offences should be treated with equal seriousness to other offences of violence. The then Vice President of the Executive Council, the Honourable D P Landa, said in the Legislative Council:
	


""These provisions are an integral part of the Government's plan to eliminate domestic violence. It is the intention of the Government to ensure that police play an effective role in investigating domestic violence, and where necessary, in prosecuting offenders. Domestic assaults are criminal offences, but because of the circumstances in which they occur, the evidence of the victim is usually essential if prosecutions are to be successful. The existing law as to the compellability of spouses recognises the special relationship between partners in a domestic relationship. However, where the object of the court proceedings is to protect one spouse from the other, it is entirely inappropriate that the court should be deprived of the most important evidence. It is an unfortunate fact that wives are frequently pressured by their husbands not to give evidence in proceedings for assault which the wife may have herself commenced. This is a loophole which must be closed ...

The spouse is placed in a position similar to that of a Crown witness. This provision has great social force because in many of the cases on record of spouses finally withdrawing their wish to testify it has been proved subsequently that that was done under duress and threat of a further incident occurring, either before or after giving evidence. Often times that withdrawal has caused people to think that a reconciliation had occurred."" (Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 24 November 1982 at 2893,2905)


	
	Earlier, the then Premier, Mr Wran, in the second reading speech in the Legislative Assembly had said:
	


""The rule about spouses not being compellable against other spouses in criminal cases relates to the intimacy of the marriage relationship. However, it is now recognised that where women are themselves the victims of assault by their husbands, it is harsh and unfair to put upon them the burden of making the decision about whether or not the case should proceed. Moreover, up until now a great discouragement to the police against ensuing cases of domestic violence has been the repeated situation of victims who are key witnesses withdrawing from giving evidence. Victims are often subjected to a great amount of undue pressure and threats to not give evidence."" (Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 9 November 1982 at 2367)


	
	These remarks, directed to the compellability of a victim of domestic violence to give evidence, are equally apposite to the receiving of evidence of the post offence attitude of the victim. It is, or can be, in my view, harsh and unfair to put upon a victim the burden of participating in the sentencing decision. There is absolutely no evidence in the present case which would suggest that the victim's forgiveness had been brought about by the threats or pressure referred to. But if a practice were to be adopted of taking that factor into account in sentencing, it is obvious that such a temptation will present itself to the perpetrators of domestic violence.
	
	
	Accordingly, I consider that the victim's attitude to sentencing in this case was not a matter which should have influenced the sentencing decision.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J.
	
	
	LOVEDAY AJ: I agree with the judgment of Grove J and have nothing to add.

The Court: 
 

R v Blackman (Media) 

 
1.	 

This judgment sets out our reasons for refusing the application by the media parties, 
the BBC, ITN, Times Newspapers Limited, British Sky Broadcasting, and Guardian 
News and Media, that the court make available to the media six video clips taken by 
Marine  B  before  and  during  the  killing  of  the  insurgent.  The  background  to  the 
application is fully set out in the judgment the court gave on 15 March 2017 allowing 
the appeal: [2107] EWCA Crim 190. 

The applications during the course of the court martial 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

During the course of the court martial the media parties made various applications to 
the  Judge  Advocate  General  for  the  release  of  transcripts  of  the  soundtrack  of  the 
videos  and  various  still  photographs.  On  28  October  2013  the  Judge  Advocate 
General,  in  a  series  of  rulings,  declined  to  order  the  release  of  the  video  clips  but 
allowed  the  release  of  a  transcript  of  the  soundtrack.    In  a  subsequent  ruling  on  7 
November 2013 he ruled that certain stills taken from the video should be released. 

Those rulings are referred to in the judgment of this court in R v Marines A, B, C, D 
and E and Guardian News and Media and Other Media [2014] 1 WLR 3326, [2013] 
EWCA Crim 2367 at paragraphs 68 to 73 on an appeal against them. The court set out 
 
at paragraphs 49 to 67 and 78 to 80 its reasons for upholding the rulings of the judge 
 
in relation to the six video clips but allowed certain further images to be made public. 

The publicity surrounding the reference by the CCRC 

The decision by the Criminal Cases Review Commission to make a reference to this 
court  in  respect  of  the  conviction  of  the  appellant  was  attended  by  a  considerable 
amount of publicity, as had been a campaign on behalf of the appellant to secure the 
 
reference.  In the directions hearings for the appeal on 16 and 21 December 2016 it 
was intimated by the media parties that they would apply for release of the video.  A 
hearing  took  place  for  that  purposes  on  31  January  2017  at  which  the  Ministry  of 
Defence opposed the application in respect of three of the six clips; they agreed to 
release three of the clips. The three have been released. The three clips showed the 
landscape  and  some  of  the  marines  shortly  before  the  killing  of  the  insurgent  took 
place. 

In addition to hearing counsel for the media parties who sought release of the video 
clips (save for Associated Newspapers Ltd which expressed itself neutral), we heard 
from  counsel  for  the  Crown,  The  Ministry  for  Defence  and  the  appellant.  At  the 
conclusion  of  the  hearing  we  stated  that  we  would  refuse  the  application  for  the 
 
release to the media parties of the three video clips for reasons to be given later. These 
are our reasons. 

We also made an order imposing reporting restrictions in relation to the hearings for 
directions and for the application by the media parties. We lifted these restrictions at 
the outset of the hearing of the appeal.

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down 
 
(subject to editorial corrections) 
 
 
The evidence before the court 

R v Blackman (Media) 

When the matter was considered by the Judge Advocate General and by this court in 
2013 there was evidence from the Ministry of Defence before the court, as is apparent 
from paragraph 17 of the judgment.   

On this occasion the evidence filed by the Ministry of Defence comprised a statement 
 
by Peter Wilson, the Head of the Research Information and Communications Unit in 
the  Office  of  Security  and  Counter-Terrorism  at  the  Home  Office.  His  initial 
statement  was  dated  18  January  2017,  supplemented  by  a  short  statement  of  25 
January 2017. 

It is unnecessary for us to set out the statement in detail. The essence of the statement 
was that if the three video clips were made available to the media parties for public 
broadcast,  any  broadcast  would  be  recorded  by  the  terrorist  organisations  and  then 
used  as  propaganda  in  order  to  radicalise  others.  It  would  provide  terrorists  with 
material  they  could  use  to  underpin  their  ‘justification’  for  undertaking  terrorist 
attacks  against  the  Western  powers  and  to  underpin  their  extremist  narrative  at  a 
tactical  and  strategic  level.  They  would  use  it  to  argue  that  Western  powers  are 
corrupt, do not adhere to their own rules, such as the military rules of engagement and 
the  Geneva  Convention  and  claim  that  this  was  the  way  the  armed  forces  of  the 
 
Western powers treat insurgents on the battlefield.   

It was said that in the three years since the video emerged, nothing had been seen that 
surpassed it in terms of radicalisation potential.  Releasing it would therefore present a 
real threat to life, the members of the Armed Forces and the wider British public and 
to British interests overseas. 

The  statement  pointed  to  the  increase  since  2013  in  the  ambitions,  capabilities  and 
scale of terrorist communications, the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013 and the attacks 
that had taken place.  The statement set out illustrations of particular individuals who 
had  been  radicalised  by  material  that  did  not  have  the  potential  of  this  video.    Mr 
Wilson concluded in his supplementary statement: 

“The  presentation  of  any  of  this  footage  will  be  used  as 
compelling evidence for supporters [of violent Jihad] to act and 
respond immediately, specifically and violently.  They will use 
 
it to evidence and justify the claim that the West is at war with 
Islam and that it operates outside its own legal restraints; it will 
trigger  a  tipping  point  for  many  sympathisers  who  may  have 
been  on  the  verge  of  active  response  into  immediate  violent 
 
action.  It will in short create a real and immediate risk to life.” 

The media parties were shown the video clips prior to the hearing on 31 January 2107 
and offered an opportunity to cross-examine Mr Wilson but they decided not to do so.   

In  addition,  there  was  a  statement  from  the  appellant’s  wife  setting  out  advice 
received from the police and her fears for her own safety.  Again, no application was 
 
made to cross-examine her.

The video clips were played at the hearing of the appeal; the court made clear that no 
attempt was to be made to film or otherwise record the video when played.  

R v Blackman (Media) 

 
15.	 

The content of two of the three clips is set out at paragraphs 20 to 22 of our judgment 
 
of 17 March 2017 allowing the appeal of the appellant. 

The material in the public domain 

 
16.	 

There is in the public domain: 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

The transcript and audio of all six clips of the video. 

Some stills taken from the video. 

The  appellant  and  two  of  the  marines  on  the  patrol  have  been  publicly 
identified; the photograph of the appellant has been very prominent in the 
media reports of what has happened. 

 
17.	 

In  addition  to  that  material  the  Ministry  of  Defence  decided  at  the  hearing  of  31 
January 2017 that they would consent to the release of video clips 1 to 3 as we have 
 
set out above. 

The legal principles 

The  basic  approach  is  set  out  in  R  (Guardian  News  and  Media  Limited)  v  City  of 
Westminster  Magistrates’  Court  [2013]  QB  618,  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  420  and  the 
judgment of this court in Marine A to which we have referred. 

If there is a threat to life within the meaning of Article 2 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights, the court does not have to balance the principle of open justice and 
the rights of the media under Article 10, as the State through its judicial branch cannot 
 
release material into the public domain which would threaten the life of a citizen.  On 
the other hand, if there was no obligation under Article 2, then it is accepted the court 
must balance the principles of open justice and the right of the media under Article 10 
against the other circumstances militating against disclosure. 

It was submitted on behalf of the Ministry of Defence that the evidence advanced by 
 
them showed that there was a real and immediate threat to life through the release of 
the video and therefore the court should simply not order its release.  In submissions 
 
made on behalf of the media parties (save Associated Newspapers Ltd) by Mr Jesse 
Nicholls  it  was  contended  that  there  was  no  immediate  threat  to  life  within  the 
meaning of Article 2, as Article 2 required the identification of the perpetrator of the 
threat  and  the  victim  of  the  threat  in  all  circumstances.    Reliance  was  in  particular 
 
placed on the decision of In re Officer L [2007] 1 WLR 2135 and decisions of the 
 
Strasbourg Court to that effect.  
It was said to make no difference whether the case 
 
concerns  the  failure  of  a  State  to  take  action  to  protect  a  named  individual  from  a 
threat as distinct from a case like the present where the State is being requested to act 
in a way that would not endanger the lives of citizens in general. 

  

It was, in our view, not necessary for us to determine the issue under Article 2.  It 
seemed to us clear on the evidence before us that the balance under Article 10 was 
 
clear  beyond  any  doubt.  Sufficient  has  been  put  into  the  public  domain  to  make  it

possible fairly to report the appeal without creating the real and immediate danger to 
life  that  would  result  from  making  available  the  three  clips  so  far  withheld.    The 
 
evidence before us from Mr Wilson was clear and compelling as to the threat. 

 

22.	  We accepted, of course, that the media applicants to this court would show the three 
video clips in issue responsibly in a way that might have assisted in the fair reporting 
of  the  appeal.  We  also  accepted,  for  the  reasons  summarised  in  the  judgment  in 
Marine A at paragraphs 55 to 58, that the position of the media parties as a public 
watchdog is different from that of the general public.  We also accepted that the media 
parties have obligations under the relevant Codes of Conduct with which they would 
be expected to comply.  However, it is self-evident in respect of three video clips that 
such clips could be misused by others.  The evidence in this case was overwhelming 
that these clips would be so misused. 

 
23.	 

Balancing, therefore, the principles of open justice and the rights of the media parties 
under Article 10 there was no doubt in our minds that the release of the three clips 
 
would  significantly  endanger  a  large  number  of  people,  not  only  in  the  United 
 
Kingdom  but  elsewhere.  We  therefore  considered  that  the  balance  lay  against  their 
disclosure and refused the application.",2017-03-28 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

In the Crown Court at Leicester 

 
 

21st March 2017 

 
 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Haddon-Cave 

 

 
 
 
1.  Katie  Leong  (52),  you  have  been  found  guilty  by  the  Jury  on  overwhelming 
evidence of the Attempted Murder of Daniel Rotariu (31).  This intelligent and 
hard-working  Jury  have  seen  through  your  elaborate  web  of  lies.    I  will  now 
sentence you for this most serious offence. 

 
The Facts 
 
2. 

Just after 2 am on 27th July 2016, you entered your boyfriend Daniel Rotariu’s 
bedroom  at  11  Turner  Road  in  Leicester  whilst  he  was  fast  asleep,  pulled  his 
duvet  away and  poured  the  entire  contents of  a  500ml  bottle  of  sulphuric  acid 
96%  purity  over  him,  intending  to  cover  as  much  of  his  face,  torso,  arms  and 
legs  as  possible,  but  particularly  targeting  his  face  and  head.    He  was  naked 
apart from boxer shorts.  He woke feeling as if boiling water was being poured 
on him, and issued an ear-splitting scream as excruciating pain began to set in.  
He felt attempts to move his arms away from his head in order to target his face.  
It was dark and he could not tell who was in the room doing this to him but saw 
a shadow leaving.  He staggered next door into the living room and found, you, 
Katie Leong, sitting in a chair and simultaneously heard the back door shutting 
as  Mark  Cummings  left  the  house.    Daniel  Rotariu  managed  to  get  to  the 
bathroom, his eyes already going cloudy and the sulphuric acid burning into his 
face and body, and started trying to wash it off himself with the shower head.   

The  police  were  quickly  on  the  scene.    PC  Woods  and  PC  Boyall-Love  from 
Euston Street Police Station, Leicestershire  Constabulary, arrived  first.  Officer 
Woods  described  the  scene  that  greeted  her  as “the  most  horrific  thing  I  have 

 
3.
--------
ever seen in my life and the chemical smell hit me like a swimming pool”.  She 
calmed Daniel Rotariu and spent the next 25 minutes bravely trying to shower 
the acid off him and, in the course thereof, was herself splashed with acid.  T/PS 
Davies  and  DS  Walker  and  then  DC  Palfreyman  and  PC  Chabuz  arrived, 
followed by the Leicestershire ambulance service and paramedics. 

 
4.  Daniel Rotariu was rushed to Leicester Royal Infirmary and then to a specialist 
Burns  Unit.    He  was  put  into  an  induced  coma  and  underwent  a  number  of 
emergency operations.  He had 32% surface area burns estimated at 35-40% full 
thickness to his face, lips, tongue, ears, both arms, chest and other parts of his 
body.  He remained in hospital for months.  He suffered irreversible blindness 
and the most terrible life-threatening and life-changing injuries.  It is a miracle 
that  he  survived.    It  was  only  because  of  the  first  class  medical  treatment  he 
received from the doctors and nurses of the NHS that he pulled through. 

 
5.  Unfortunately  for  you,  the  attack  did  not  quite  go  according  to  plan.    Daniel 
Rotariu was sleeping on his stomach and pouring acid over his face and mouth, 
which might  have  silenced  him was not  as  straightforward  as you  thought  and 
he immediately screamed and woke the rest of the house up. 

 
6. 

 
7. 

The police chest-cameras show you, Katie Leong, then performing an elaborate 
charade of pretending that it was nothing to do with you and it was all the doing 
of Mark Cummings, whom you had enticed over to the house that night.  Your 
protestations of how much you loved Daniel Rotariu were entirely hollow.  You 
were, however, not as clever as you thought and started giving differing versions 
of events to the police and medical staff, one of which was that you were actually 
in bed  with Daniel  Rotariu  when Mark  Cummings threw  the  acid  and  you  saw 
him  ‘smiling’  as  he  did  it.    It  was  telling,  as  the  jury  no  doubt  found,  that  not 
once did you deign to go and try to help Daniel Rotariu in the shower or comfort 
him. 

I  have  no  doubt,  that  it  was  your  plan  to  fulfil  a  long-held  fantasy  to  pour 
sulphuric  acid  over  your  boyfriend  Daniel  Rotariu’s body  and  kill  him, and  set 
up Mark  Cummings to  take  the  blame.    In  this way,  you  would  get  rid  of  both 
men for whom you had no further use.  

 
Victim impact  
 
8.  The  injuries  that  you  have  inflicted  on  Daniel  Rotariu  have  been  beyond 
imagination.    He  is  completely  blind.    He  has  suffered  the  most  terrible  facial 
and body disfigurement.  He is in constant pain.  He will require at least another 
20 operations. 

 
9.  Remarkably,  and  bravely,  Daniel  Rotariu  was  able  to  come  to  give  evidence  in 
this  court  and  the  jury  heard  him  recall  what  he  saw  and  felt  as  he  woke  that 
terrible  night.    Nobody  who  witnessed  his  evidence  could  not  have  been 
profoundly moved.  As Mr Rutherford QC eloquently put it in his final speech: 

“Mr  Rotariu  was  a  highly  dignified  and  impressive  man  who  delivered 
his  evidence  without  a  whisper  of  self-pity;  it  was  hard  not  to  be 
overwhelmed by the privilege of hearing him give evidence.”
--------
10.  Daniel  Rotariu’s victim impact  statement,  taken by the  officer-in-charge of  the 
case, DC Welford, speaks powerfully and poignantly as to the living catastrophe 
that you wrought upon another human being, a kind and decent man who was 
liked and admired by his colleagues at work: 

 

“…It’s  changed  my  life  totally.    It’s  a  nightmare  for  me…  I  can’t  see 
nothing anymore…  I’m  afraid  I’m  not  gonna  have  a  relationship  ever… 
I’m never gonna see my baby… I don’t know what to do, I have to make 
some  plans  to  survive  you  know  because  I  can’t  stay  all  of  my  life  on 
benefits… I worked all my life, I used to like working.  Even after work, I 
used  to  walk  home  and  I used  to  do  things, I  liked  to  do  a  lot  of  things.  
Now I can do nothing that I used to do… After I wake up in the hospital 
and I found out what it was a shock for me finding out that my girlfriend, 
Katie did this… I wish that I should have known the lies… The person you 
trusted  the  most  did  this  to  you.  I  have  nightmares  that  I  see  that  day, 
that  happened,  I  see  it  every  day,  every  hour,  like  it  was  yesterday…  I 
can feel the acid like it’s going to your skin, you know it’s like all this pain, 
it’s going into your skin… It’s hard because you don’t know when it’s day 
and you don’t know when it’s night, you don’t see the daylight anymore… 
I was looking to the sun when it was sun a couple of days, I couldn’t see 
nothing, and I was feeling the heat from the sun on my face but I couldn’t 
see it, it was dark… Going outside people are just making space, just hear 
them whispering and  things… I’m gonna have to live all my, the rest of 
my life, more than half of my life I’m gonna have to live it like this… I’m 
gonna  need  another  twenty  operations  at  least.  I  had,  idea  now,  over 
five thousand tablets I counted them… It’s hard.  It’s hard.  Sometimes I 
wish I was dead and I didn’t survive.” 

 
Attempted Murder – the Guidelines 
 
11. 

I  direct  myself  in  accordance  with  the  Sentencing  Counsel’s  Guidelines  on 
Attempted  Murder.    I  also  have  regard  to  the  factors  set  out  in  Schedule  21  to 
the Criminal Justice Act 2003 relating to the most serious offences.  Attempted 
murder can often more serious than murder itself, given the necessary intention 
which must be shown of actual intent to kill (R v Powell [1998] 1 Cr App R (S) 
84). 

In  my  judgment,  this  case  falls  under  paragraph  5(1)  of  Schedule  21  to  the 
Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  as  one  where  the  seriousness  is  “particularly  high” 
for the following reasons: 

(1)  First,  the  use  of  acid  as  a  weapon  of  death  and  destruction  on  another 
human being, in this case the most powerful of acids, 96% purity sulphuric 
acid 

 
(2)  Second,  it  involves  sadistic  conduct,  namely  the  pouring  of  an  entire 
500ml bottle of this acid over the face and body of the victim whilst he was 
asleep  in  bed  with  the  intention  of  causing  the  most  horrific  and  painful 
disfigurement and death 

 

 
12.
--------
(3)  Third, detailed research carried out by you prior to committing the attack; 
you researched the effect of acid on the web, and tested one of the bottles 
of  acid  on  sausage  meat  to  satisfy  yourself  it  would  have  the  right 
destructive effect on human tissue 

 
(4)  Fourth,  you  harboured  a  long-standing,  macabre  fascination  and  fantasy 
about  attacking  someone  with  acid  and  kept  a  copy  of  Katie  Piper’s  book 
“Beautiful” beside your bed (see further below) 

 
(5)  Fifth, the life-long physical and psychological damage caused to Mr Daniel 

Rotariu in this case cannot be understated 

 
(6)  Sixth, the preparation and planning you engaged in was long-running and 
meticulous.  You had two aims: to kill your boyfriend, Daniel Rotariu, with 
acid and ensure Mark Cummings took all the blame.  You persuaded Mark 
Cummings in January 2016 to buy the first bottle of acid by pretending it 
was  for  a  jewellery  business,  and  insisted  that  Mark  Cummings  bought 
both bottles on the web using his own PayPal account.  You persuaded him 
to  buy  a  second  bottle  in  June  2016.    You  exploited  the  fact  that  Mark 
Cummings  was  obsessed  with  you  and  would  do  anything  to  please  you. 
Your plan or fantasy to conduct an attack may have been inchoate in early 
2016  without  a  particular  victim  in  mind.    However,  at  some  stage  you 
decided  to  do  away  with  your  boyfriend,  Daniel  Rotariu,  who  was  not  as 
compliant as some of the other men whom had had the misfortune to have 
relationships  with  you.    You  therefore  conceived  of  the  idea  of  inveigling 
Mark  Cummings  over  to  11  Turner  Road  on  the  promise  of  re-kindling 
your relationship and a trip to Blackpool to celebrate your inheritance and 
setting him up. 

 

Level of determinative sentence under paragraph 5(1) and SG 
 
13.  Paragraph  5(1)  of  Schedule  21  of  the  2003  Act  provides  for  a  case  where  the 
seriousness is “particularly high” a starting point of a determinative sentence of 
30  years’  imprisonment.    The  present  case  also  falls  within  Level  1  of  the 
Sentencing  Guidelines,  because  of  the  long  term  physical  and  psychological 
damage  caused  to  Daniel  Rotariu,  which  provides  a  starting  point  of  30  years’ 
imprisonment and a range of 27 – 35 years’ imprisonment. 

 
Further aggravating factors 
 
14.  There are a number of further aggravating factors in this case: 
 

(1)  First,  the  fact  that  you  have  a  conviction  in  1988  for  wounding  your 
estranged husband when you assaulted him with a bread knife severing an 
artery 

 
(2)  Second,  this  case  also  involves  a  breach  of  trust  and  deceit  by  you  as  Mr 
Rotariu’s  girlfriend.    You  grossly  abused  and  exploited  that  trust.    You 
made sure he was asleep that night and did not lock his bedroom door and 
then attacked him in the most cowardly of circumstances, as he slept in his 
own bed, a bed which you used to share.
--------
15.  For these reasons, in my view, this case falls into the highest categories of both 

culpability and harm.  

 
Mitigating factors 
 
16. 

I have listened carefully to everything that has been ably said on your behalf by 
Ms  Khan  QC  by  way  of  mitigation.    But  as  she  realistically  acknowledges, 
personal mitigation has minimal weight in a case of this gravity.  Nevertheless, I 
have  carefully  read  the  Psychiatric  Report  prepared  on  you  by  Dr  Mendelson 
which refers to difficulties you are said to have experienced in childhood.  I also 
bear in mind that you have a daughter. 

 
Discretionary life sentence 
 
17.  Section  225  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  permits  the  court  to  pass  a 

discretionary life sentence in appropriate cases.  It provides: 

 

“225.—Life sentence for serious offences 
 
(1)  This section applies where— 
 

(a)  a  person  aged  18  or  over  is  convicted  of  a  serious  offence 

 

 
(2) 
 

 

committed after the commencement of this section, and 

(b)  the  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  a  significant  risk  to 
members  of  the  public  of  serious  harm  occasioned  by  the 
commission by him of further specified offences. 

If— 
(a)  the offence is one in respect of which the offender would apart 

from this section be liable to imprisonment for life, and 

(b)  the court considers that the seriousness of the offence, or of the 
offence and one or more offences associated with it, is such as 
to justify the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life, 
the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment for life. 

 
(5)  An offence, the sentence for which is imposed under this section, is 
not to be regarded as an offence, the sentence for which is fixed by 
law.” 

 
18.  The  court  must,  therefore,  be  satisfied  of  four  matters  before  passing  a 

discretionary life sentence: 

 

(1)  The defendant is over 18 years old; 
(2)  The defendant is convicted of a “serious offence”, 
(3)  The defendant is “dangerous”; 
(4)  Imprisonment for life is justified. 

 
Analysis  
 
19. 

I am satisfied as to each of these factors.  First, you are now aged 52.   Second, 
Attempted Murder is a “serious offence” within the meaning of the Act.
--------
20.  Third,  I  am  satisfied  that  you  are  “dangerous”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act.  
“Dangerous”  means  “a  significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of  serious 
harm” occasioned by the commission of further specified offences.  Significant 
means noteworthy, or of considerable amount or importance (R v Lang [2005] 
EWCA  Crim  2864;  Pedley,  Martin  and  Hamadi  [2009]  1  WLR  2517).    The 
indicia  of  dangerousness  are  plain  on  the  facts  of  this  case  as  revealed  during 
the trial and in my judgment it is not necessary to obtain reports in this case (c.f. 
s.156(3)  and  (4)  of  the  2003 Act).    I  am satisfied  that  you  are  “dangerous”  for 
the following reasons: 

(1)  First,  the  fact  that  you  were  prepared  to  carry out  the  attack  of  this most 
heinous nature suggests a capacity to commit physical harm with no moral 
boundaries.  You sought to torture and kill a man, your boyfriend, for over 
6 months by pouring acid over his face and body whilst he lay asleep in bed, 
having previously experimented to satisfy yourself as to the harm the acid 
would cause to human flesh 

 
(2)  Second,  this  was  no  spur  of  the  moment  action,  but  a  carefully  planned 

attack (see above) 

 
(3)  Third,  the  fact  that  it  is clear  that  you  are  a  highly  obsessive,  jealous and 
  You  harboured  a  well-documented  obsession  with 
selfish  person. 
sulphuric  acid  and  fantasised  about  committing  an  attack  on  someone 
using acid.  As I have highlighted, the police found the biography by Katie 
Piper  “Beautiful”  beside  your  bed.    I  am  satisfied  that  you  derived  a 
macabre  pleasure  from  carrying  out  the  attack  on  your  boyfriend,  Daniel 
Rotariu, in some sort of mirror image to the book.  You had an obsession 
with  crime  and  committing  ‘the  perfect  crime’,  and  apparently  fancied 
yourself as a ‘crime writer’.  I also regard it as noteworthy and disturbing 
that there was evidence that you made Mark Cummings watch a DVD with 
you about Ruth Ellis, “Dancing with Strangers”, dozens of times 

 
(4)  Fourth, the fact that you have a conviction for violence with a knife against 

a previous ex-partner albeit a long time ago (see above) 

 
(5)  Fifth,  it  is  clear  that  you  are  a  highly  manipulative,  controlling  and 
scheming  person  who  seeks  to  exploit  the  weaknesses  of  men  who  are 
drawn into your web and to punish those who do not do your bidding, in 
particular  those  who,  like  Daniel  Rotariu,  refused  to  have  your  name 
tattooed  on  them.    You  deceived  Daniel  Rotariu  about  many  things 
including  your  age.    I  have  no  doubt  that  the  reason  why  you  chose  that 
particular evening to put into effect your plan to attack Daniel Rotariu with 
the  acid  is  because  he  had  annoyed  you  during  a  minor  argument  that 
afternoon and went to bed at 8 pm ignoring you; and that is why you called 
Mark  Cummings  at  9  pm  and  enticed  him  over  with  the  promise  of  re-
kindling  your  relationship  and  a  supposed  trip  to  Blackpool.    You  then 
tricked him into opening the bottle of acid in your room and wore his coat 
downstairs  when  you  carried  out  the  attack.    You  exploited  Mark 
Cummings’  weakness  for  you  and  deliberately  sought  to  implicate  him.  
You nearly succeeded.
--------
Life sentence   
 
21.  When  passing  a  life  sentence,  pursuant  to  Section  269  of  the  Criminal  Justice 
Act 2003, the Court must decide the minimum term to be served before you can 
be  considered  for  release  on  licence.  In  deciding  what  minimum  term  is 
appropriate, the court must take into account the overall gravity of the offending. 

 
22.  It  is  important  that  you  and  the  general  public  should  understand  what  a 
“minimum term” means in practice.  Where the court specifies a minimum term, 
you cannot be released until that minimum term has expired.  But even then you 
will not automatically be released.  You will not be released unless and until the 
Parole Board are satisfied that it is safe to release you into the community.  That 
time may never come.  Even if you are released on licence, that is not the end of 
your sentence.  You will remain subject to the conditions of your licence for the 
rest of your life.  If you reoffend, the Secretary of State has the power to order 
that you be returned to prison to continue to serve your life sentence until it is 
thought safe to release you again.  

 
Minimum term 
 
23.  In  my  judgment,  taking  all  the  above  considerations  into  account,  the 
appropriate  determinate  term  of  imprisonment  would  have  been  at  the  higher 
end of the range of the Sentencing Guidelines bracket to which I have referred, 
namely 34 years. 

 
24.  Accordingly,  in  accordance  with  normal  sentencing  practice,  when  setting  the 
minimum  term  for  an  indeterminate  life  sentence,  the  minimum  term  will  be 
half of the equivalent determinate sentence, namely 17 years. 

 
25.  Time already spent in custody will be deducted to arrive at the minimum term. 
You  have  been  in  custody  since  29th  July  2016  and,  accordingly,  235  days 
should,  by  the  Prison  Authorities  calculation,  be  deducted  from  the  minimum 
term set.  Any adjustment to that figure to be made administratively.  

 
Sentence 
 
26.  Katie  Leong,  stand  up  please.    For  the  Attempted  Murder  of  Daniel  Rotariu,  I 
sentence you to Life Imprisonment with a minimum term of 17 years.  Please go 
with the officers. 

 
Compensation  
 
27. 

[To  counsel:]  I  will  hear  submissions  on  compensation  in  the  light  of  the 
evidence that Katie Leong received an inheritance of £30,000.

Judgment Approved by the court for handing down 
 
(subject to editorial corrections) 
 
 
The Court: 
 

Introduction 
 

R v Blackman (Sentence) 

On 15 March 2017, we quashed the appellant’s conviction for murder. It is not 
necessary for us to set out the history or the background or the findings we 
made on the hearing of the appeal against conviction.  They are all fully set 
out in our judgment: [2017] EWCA Crim 190.   

As  the  original  conviction  has  been  quashed,  all  the  sentences  have  fallen 
away.  It is therefore necessary for us to sentence the appellant on the basis of 
the powers available to a Court Martial.  On that basis there are two principal 
issues for us to consider: 

 

 
i)	 

The length of the determinate sentence of imprisonment to be served 
 
for the offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. 

 
ii)	  Whether the court should sentence him to be dismissed and, if so, the 
 

 

 
1.	 

 
 
2.	 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of that sentence. 

 
The determinate sentence to be served 
 
 
3.	 

As to the length of sentence, there is no Sentencing Council guideline for the 
offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, although the 
Sentencing  Council  is  in  the  course  of  preparing  such  a  guideline.    The 
principles,  however,  are  well  established,  particularly  in  the  decision  of  this 
court in R v Wood [2009] EWCA Crim 651, [2010] 1 Cr App R(S) 2.  On the

R v Blackman (Sentence) 

(1) The relationship to the sentence for murder 

 

Although  there  is  no  express  statutory  link  between  the  guidance  given  by 
Parliament to the courts in Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 on 
 
the appropriate minimum term to be served when a life sentence is passed for 
 
murder,  it  is  clear  from  the  decision  in  Wood  that  there  is  a  link  to  that 
Schedule in determining the appropriate sentence for manslaughter. We have 
to  have  regard  to  the  level  of  sentences  specified  for  murder  and  to  the 
 
mitigating and aggravating factors to be taken into account. It is important to 
  
note that the starting point for the minimum term for murder is 15 years. 

However there is an important difference between a minimum term specified 
in Schedule 21 and a determinate sentence.  A minimum term is the time that 
will be served in prison counted in actual years; in contrast, the time served in 
 
prison  on  a  determinate  sentence  is  generally  half  the  number  of  years 
specified by the court. Thus, for example, the starting point for the minimum 
term of 15 years for murder is the equivalent of a determinate sentence of 30 
years.  A  minimum  term  of  30  years  is  equivalent  to  a  60  year  determinate 
 
sentence.  Thus,  in  the  present  case  when  considering  the  minimum  term 
 
originally imposed by the Court Martial for the offence of murder, namely 10 
years, and the reduced minimum term imposed by this court, namely 8 years, 
these are the equivalent respectively of a 20 and 16 year determinate sentence.   

Thus, as this is plainly a case for a determinate sentence, the comparison that 
we make for the purposes of Schedule 21 is with the original sentence which is 
 
the equivalent of a determinate sentence of 20 years and the term substituted 
by this court of 16 years.  It would be highly misleading, therefore, to contrast 
 
the term that we impose with the minimum term specified as part of the life 
sentence. 

(2) The reduction made in the decision on the appeal in 2014 

 

There are two factors set out in the judgment of this court on the earlier appeal 
given on 22 May 2014, [2014] EWCA Crim 1029, [2015] 1 WLR 1900 which 
are  material  because  we  took  these  factors  into  account  in  reducing  the 
sentence by an equivalent of 4 years: 

 
i)	 

 

First we took into account the fact that when the appellant killed the 
insurgent  he  acted  entirely  out  of  character  and  was  suffering  from 
combat  stress  disorder.    As  we  said  at  paragraph  75  of  the  2014 
judgment: 

“In  assessing  the  evidence  of  stress  and  its  affect  on  [the 
appellant] we attach particular importance to the evidence in 
 
relation to the remoteness of the command post at which [the 
 
appellant] had been stationed for 5½ months and the limited 
contact  with  those  commanding  him.    His  mental  welfare 
had not been assessed in the way which it would ordinarily 
be assessed by a commanding officer and there is evidence 
that he was becoming somewhat paranoiac about the Taliban

gunning  for  him.
  Taking  into  account  the  whole  of  the 
evidence  we  conclude  the  combat  stress  arising  from  the 
nature  of  the  insurgency  in  Afghanistan  and  the  particular 
matters  we  have  identified  as  affecting  him  ought  to  have 
been accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor.” 

Second an additional term by way of deterrence was not required, as 
 
we said at paragraph 76 of the 2014 judgment. 

 
ii)	 

 

 

(3) The harm caused by the commission of the offence 
 

A  court  is  required  by  Parliament  to  consider  the  harm  caused  by  the 
 
commission  of  the  offence  and  the  culpability  of  the  offender.  In  a  case  of 
manslaughter the harm caused by the offence is at the highest level, as death 
has  followed  from  the  actions  of  the  appellant.  For  these  purposes  death 
cannot  be  measured  in  terms  of  a  short  time  of  likely  survival;  this  was  a 
 
deliberate killing of a wounded man. 

 

(4) The culpability of the appellant in committing the offence 
 
 

In our judgment of 15 March 2017 we concluded that the adjustment disorder 
from  which  the  appellant  suffered  at  the  time  of  the  killing  had  led  to  an 
abnormality of mental functioning which had substantially impaired: 

 
i)	 

 
 
ii)	 

His  ability  to  form  a  rational  judgment  about  the  need  to  adhere  to 
standards and the moral compass set by HM Armed Forces and putting 
together  the  consequences  to  himself  and  others  of  the  individual 
actions he was about to take. 

His ability to exercise self-control as he had acted impulsively and not 
in the way in which he had previously acted to control his emotions. 

Although the appellant’s responsibility is diminished for these reasons, as is 
 
evident from the matters we set out in the judgment of 15 March 2017, he still 
retained a substantial responsibility for the deliberate killing. We consider that 
the  responsibility  he  retained  for  the  deliberate  killing  after  taking  these 
 
factors into account was at a medium as opposed to a high level.

(5) Aggravating and mitigating factors 
 
 
11.	 
 

The aggravating factors that were clearly present were: 

 
i)	 

The effect of the appellant’s actions on the reputation and safety of HM 
Armed  Forces.    There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  way  in  which  the 
appellant  acted,  knowingly 
the  Geneva 
 
Conventions, in deliberately killing by shooting an injured insurgent in 
 
the  circumstances  recorded  on  the  video  clips  as  described  at 
paragraphs 17-22 of the judgment of 15 March 2017 has had a material 
adverse  effect  on  the  views  many  hold  about  the  conduct  of  HM 
Armed Forces. The appellant’s actions can be used by the insurgency 

in  contravention  of

R v Blackman (Sentence) 

  
 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

 
and others as evidence that the killing of the insurgent was in breach of 
the values proclaimed for which the International Security Force and 
HM Armed forces had been sent to Afghanistan.  

The  vulnerability  of  the  insurgent as  he  had  been  seriously  wounded 
and could not defend himself. It matters not that he probably had little 
time to live. His life was deliberately ended by the appellant. 

The decision made to ensure that the killing was not witnessed by the 
overhead helicopter and thereafter to cover up the evidence of what had 
happened. 

The  fact  that  the  appellant  used  a  weapon  with  which  he  had  been 
provided may not, in the unusual circumstances of this case, constitute 
an aggravating factor, but his intention to kill and, even more so, the 
collusive  involvement  of  other  members  of  the  team  that  he  led  and 
 
who felt intense loyalty towards him, did. 

The mitigating factors were: 

 
i)	 

 
 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

The  appellant’s  outstanding  service  record,  together  with  the  very 
impressive statements that have been placed before us attesting to acts 
of conspicuous bravery. 

The effect on him of the conflict in Afghanistan and the 16 factors we 
set out in our judgment of 15 March 2017 at paragraph 99.  Each of 
those factors is significant. 

His  perception  of  the  perceived  lack  of  leadership  by  Colonel 
Murchison  and  Major  Fisher,  the  relevance  of  which  we  set  out  at 
paragraphs 100-103 of our judgment of 15 March. 

The nature of the anticipated further attack on CP Talaanda and the fact 
that  the  insurgent  had  a  high  explosive  grenade  which  we  set  out  in 
 
paragraph 104 of our judgment of 15 March. 

 

 

 
 
12.

(6) The submission on reduction for a possible guilty plea 
 
 
13.	 

Although  the  appellant  never  indicated  a  willingness  to  plead  guilty  to 
manslaughter during the proceedings at the court martial, and his defence at 
trial  involved  a  denial  of  any  intention  to  kill,  it  was  submitted  that  the 
 
appellant should nevertheless be sentenced as if he was entitled to receive the 
full one third discount for an early guilty plea.   

Against the background of the appellant’s decision, during these proceedings, 
to  accept  substitution  of  a  verdict  of  manslaughter  by  reason  of  diminished 
 
responsibility (which decision, he reminded us, was described in our judgment 
of  15  March  2017  as  having  been  “entirely  realistic  and  sensible”)  it  was 
submitted that:

R v Blackman (Sentence) 

 
i)	 

 
 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

 
v)	 

 
vi)	 

 
If matters had proceeded as they should have done, particularly given 
the view of the appellant’s then lawyers that the case against him for 
 
murder  was  “overwhelming”,  one  or  more  psychiatric  reports  would 
have been obtained before trial. 

It was inevitable that any such report(s) would have concluded that the 
appellant  had  been  suffering  from  an  adjustment  disorder  at  the 
material time which substantially impaired his responsibility. 

In  that  event  the  appellant  would  have  been  given  robust  advice  to 
plead  guilty  to  manslaughter  by  reason  of  diminished  responsibility, 
and would have done so (or indicated an intention to do so). 

It was almost inevitable that such a plea would have been accepted. 

Even if it was not, it was highly likely that the outcome would have 
been an acquittal on the charge of murder and conviction (by plea or 
verdict) of manslaughter. 

 
Hence, by whichever route, the appellant would have been entitled to 
full  discount  when  being  sentenced  for  manslaughter  by  reason  of 
diminished  responsibility  –  given  that  the  plea  would  have  been 
tendered  or  indicated  at  the  first  available  opportunity  after  the 
 
discovery of the adjustment disorder (the existence of which, both at 
the time of the killing and during the proceedings below, the appellant 
was unaware of). 

In our view these submissions are misconceived.  Quite apart from the absence 
of  any  plea  or  any  indication  of  a  willingness  to  plead,  we  are  wholly 
unpersuaded  that  matters  would  have  taken  the  course  advocated  by  Mr 
 
Goldberg.  As touched on in paragraphs 10, 23, 35, 66 and 67 of our judgment 
of 15 March 2017: 

 
i)	 

The appellant’s defence pursued throughout the trial was that when he 
 
shot  the  insurgent  he  had  believed  that  the  insurgent  was  dead  –  i.e. 
that he had no intention to kill the insurgent or to cause him any serious 
(or any) bodily harm. 

 

 

 
ii)	  Whilst  unbeknown  to  the  appellant  he  was  suffering  from  the 
adjustment disorder at the time of the court martial, and lacked insight 
into  his  condition,  it  is  very  clear  that  he  would  not  have  wanted  to 
advance a psychiatric defence not only because he only knew of PTSD 
 
and  was  not  suffering  from  that,  but  also  because  of  the  stigma  and 
perception  of  weakness  resulting  from  the  running  of  a  psychiatric 
defence, and (very significantly) the likely end of his career consequent 
upon any conviction for homicide. 

 
iii)	 

The  express  confirmation  given  by  the  appellant  at  the  outset  of  the 
appeal hearing on 7 February 2017 that, if satisfied that that the partial 
defence  of  diminished  responsibility  was  established,  the  court  could 

 

 

 

 

 
 
15.

and should proceed to substitute a verdict to that effect, upon the basis 
that the appellant had intended to kill the insurgent, was the first time 
 
throughout  his  prosecution  and  appeals  (despite  the  strength  of  the 
evidence and having long recovered from the adjustment disorder) that 
the appellant had formally admitted having had that intention. 
 

That was “an entirely realistic and sensible course to adopt” because, 
 
finally, it accepted that the appellant knew that the insurgent was alive 
when  he  shot  him,  and  had  intended  to  kill  him  -  which  further 
undermines,  rather  than  supports,  the  contention  that  it  would 
otherwise have been accepted before trial. 

 

 
iv)	 

 
An order for dismissal 
 
 
16.	 

A Court Martial, when it comes to sentence, is in an unusual position as it is 
empowered as part of the sentence under s.265 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 
to dismiss a convicted person or to dismiss the convicted person with disgrace. 

It was common ground that the court is fully entitled to leave the question of 
 
continuation  in  service  for  the  military  authorities.  We  have  very  carefully 
considered whether we should exercise the powers as part of the sentence or 
leave  to  the  administration  of  HM  Armed  Forces  the  decision  whether  to 
discharge  the  appellant  or  to  allow  him  to  continue  to  serve.  We  have 
 
considered whether if we order the dismissal of the appellant, that dismissal 
should be with disgrace. 

 
18.	  We  were  told  by  the  appellant’s  wife  that  the  cruellest  punishment  that  the 
appellant had considered he had suffered was the dismissal with disgrace. That 
punishment has fallen away. In the light of the appellant’s outstanding service 
 
prior  to  the  killing  of  the  insurgent  and  the  finding  we  have  made  of 
diminished  responsibility,  we  accept  the  submission  that  there  should  be  no 
question of dismissal with disgrace. 

 
19.	  We have carefully considered the guidance on sentencing in the court martial 
and  the  relevant  guidance  for  the  administration  in  respect  of  persons 
 
convicted. 

Although  it  was  submitted  that  the  decision  should  be  left  to  the  military 
authorities, we are unable to accept that submission.  

 
i)	 

 
 
ii)	 

The conviction for the offence of manslaughter remains a very serious 
matter.  As  we  have  set  out  in  paragraph  10  above,  the  appellant’s 
responsibility  is  not  negated  by  the  acceptance  of  the  psychiatric 
evidence, but remains substantial.   

It is inevitable that his continuation in service is out of the question not 
only because of the length of the inevitable custodial sentence but also 
 
because of the severe damage to the reputation of HM Armed Forces 
which we have described. This must be so, whatever view is taken of 
the  dispute  between  Lt  Col  Lee  and  Lt  Col  Murchison  (to  which  we

Conclusion 
 
 
21.	 

As  we  have  explained,  we  had  concluded  in  2014,  taking  into  account  the 
 
matters we have set out in paragraph 7 above, that the appropriate sentence in 
the case of murder was one that would have been the equivalent of a 16 year 
determinate sentence.  Taking into account all the considerations we have set 
 
out above, we have concluded that the sentence should be and is: 

 
i)	 
 
 
ii)	 

He be dismissed from the service. 

He  serve  a  determinate  sentence  of  7  years,  with  a  direction  under 
s.246 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 that the time on remand in service 
 
custody be counted towards sentence. 

As with any person sentenced to a determinate term, his release will ordinarily 
 
 
be at the half way point of the sentence.

LANE 


STATEMENT: IPCC INVESTIGATION 


 

 

Having listened with great care to the evidence in the course of this trial there is one 
matter that I wish to make some observations about. 

Shana Grice was murdered by Michael Lane in August 2016.  Between February and 
July 2016 Shana or persons on her behalf made five complaints to the Police about the 
 
behaviour of Michael Lane. On the second occasion in March a complaint was made 
about  an  alleged  assault  by  Lane  upon  Shana.  When  questioned  by  Police  Michael 
Lane showed them text messages passing between himself and Shana which indicated 
that he and she were in a sexual relationship.  The Police then treated the complaint as 
 
being based upon the deliberate supply of false information.  Shana was issued with a 
fixed penalty notice and a fine for wasting police time; in other words she was treated 
 
as the wrongdoer and having committed a criminal offence, and Michael Lane was 
treated as the victim.   

There was seemingly no appreciation on the part of those investigating that a young 
woman  in  a  sexual  relationship  with  a  man  could  at  one  and  the  same  time  be 
 
vulnerable and at risk of serious harm. The Police jumped to conclusions and Shana 
was stereotyped. 

The position adopted by the Police had three potentially serious consequences. 

First, following this incident the Police treated all further complaints by Shana with 
scepticism.  In particular three further complaints were made over the course of the 
short period between 9th and 12th July 2016.  The first related to theft of a door key by

Lane which he then used to enter Shana’s bedroom to peer at her in her bed at 6.00am 
in the morning.  The second concerned the sending of silent, heavy breathing, calls to 
Shana, believed to have been from Lane.  The third concerned an incident when Lane 
 
was seen following Shana.  In relation to the use of the stolen key to enter Shana’s 
 
bedroom  Lane  received  a  caution  for  theft  and  a  low  level  warning  to  terminate 
In  relation  to  the  subsequent  complaints  Shana  was  told,  in 
contact  with  Shana. 
effect, that no further action would be taken.  The incidents were classified as low 
risk. Shana was murdered six weeks later. 

 
The second consequence was that when further incidents of stalking occurred Shana 
 
did not complain to the Police because she felt that her complaints would not be taken 
seriously. Evidence was given to this effect during this trial by those close to Shana. 

The  third  consequence  was  that  Michael  Lane  felt  that  if  he  continued  with  his 
obsessive stalking behaviour it was most unlikely that the Police would do anything to 
stop him. And he did continue even though he had been warned by Police to keep 
away from Shana.  

I would emphasise that my concern lies with the way in which the complaints were 
handled.  Following the murder the investigation and prosecution of this case has, in 
my view, been conducted by the Police professionally and efficiently.   

I  am  aware  that  the  Independent  Police  Complaints  Commission  (the  IPCC)  is 
investigating and indeed officials from the IPCC have been observing this trial.  I am 
therefore directing that my concerns be brought to the attention of the IPCC so that 
they can be taken into consideration in the course of that investigation.

Michael Lane 

Lewes Crown Court 

23rd March 2017 

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Green 

 

Michael Lane, the Jury has found you guilty of the murder of Shana Grice. You 
killed Shana by slitting her throat. You set fire to her room intending her body 
and  the  scene  of  the  crime  to  be  burnt  beyond  recognition.  You  stole  her 
 
money. Shana was 19 years old when she died, still a teenager. 
 
Everyone  in  this  Court  heard  Shana  speak  when  the  recording  of  her 
conversation  with  you  about  the  theft  of  the  key  was  played.  We  heard  the 
clear tones of a confident and vibrant young woman. You robbed Shana of her 
life  and  you  have  caused  grief  untold  to  her  family  and  friends.  They  have 
attended this trial together to provide support to each other and they have had 
to sit though harrowing and demeaning evidence about Shana’s love life and 
 
her death. 
 
The  Court  has  heard  from  Sharon  Grice,  Shana’s  mother.  She  spoke  of  the 
enormous  gulf  that  Shana’s  death  has  left  in  the  lives  of  family  and  friends. 
 
She described her only daughter in these terms: 

 

“Shana was a beautiful, bright and bubbly, kind natured 19 year old 
who  brought  joy  to  all  those  who  knew  and  loved  her.  She  was 
popular throughout childhood; she made friends easily and was never 
grumpy.  She  loved  life  and  was  always  enthusiastic.  She  particular 
enjoyed  spending  time  with  her  grandparents  with  whom  she  had  a 
very strong relationship.” 
 

 
She also said: 

“We  have  lost  our  beautiful,  kind  and  thoughtful  daughter;  we  miss 
her giggles and laughter, the jokes we shared and having her to hold 
and share our future lives together as a family.” 
 

No sentence that I impose can ever begin to compensate them for their loss.   

I  am  quite  sure  also  that  you  have  caused  despair  to  your  own  family  and 
 
friends who will be bewildered and at a loss to understand your actions.

Conclusions on the facts 
It is now my duty to sentence you. I do this only upon the basis of facts that I 
 
am sure of. The evidence against you was overwhelming. 

In  the  months  before  the  murder  you  had  a  relationship  with  Shana. 
Throughout that period you exhibited obsessive behaviour which can only be 
 
described as that of a stalker. You were jealous of the fact that she was at the 
time  in  a  long  term  relationship  with  another  man.  You  would  hang  about 
were Shana lived. You sent messages to her boyfriend telling him that Shana 
would always cheat on him. You were jealous of any relationship she had with 
other men. On one occasion this led to you to follow Shana down the road and 
then  you  grabbed  her  phone  from  her  hand  hitting  her  in  the  process.  You 
secretly  placed  a  tracker  on  her  car  so  that  you  could  follow  her  movements 
and you would follow her car in yours. Every few days you would sneak back 
 
to  her  home  and  covertly  recharge  the  battery  in  the  tracker  without  her 
 
knowing.  You  stored  embarrassing  text  messages  between  you  and  her  and 
you  were  prepared  to  use  them  as  pressure  against  her,  as  a  form  of  moral 
blackmail. You also used such messages to persuade the Police that when she 
complained  to  them  about  you,  it  was  she  that  was  the  wrongdoer  and  not 
 
you. You deflated and slashed her car tyres so that you could then help repair 
 
them and appear in a good light to her. You stole her rear door key and used it 
to  enter  her  bedroom  at  6.00  in  the  morning  so  that  you  could  peer  at  her 
whilst she slept. You engaged in silent, heavy breathing, telephone calls to her. 
You even sent her threatening legal letters about a debt you believed that she 
 
owed you. 

It  is  undoubtedly  the  case  that  this  was  a  complex  relationship.  On  the  one 
hand Shana was sufficiently concerned about your conduct to make repeated 
complaints  to  the  Police  about  you.  But  on  the  other  hand  she  was  also 
 
attracted  to  you.  Because  of  her  age  and  inexperience  of  life  Shana  did  not 
know  how  to  deal  with  you.  And  tragically  when  she  sought  help  from  the 
 
Police she received none. 

 

 
10.	  On 23rd August 2016 Shana decided that her relationship with you was at an 
 
end. This split occurred at a hotel in Hove that same evening. You then plotted 
 
revenge. 

I am sure that your revenge was premeditated. This is clear from the evidence 
 
given during the trial. You told a young woman in the pub that when you had 
split from Shana on an earlier occasion you were upset and depressed and you 
told  her  that  Shana  would  “pay  for  what  she  had  done”.  That  was  an 
indication of your general state of mind. On 24th August, the day after the final 
split,  you  purchased  petrol  in  a  can.   You  told  the  Court  that  you  were 
intending to commit suicide by setting fire to yourself. That was untrue. You 
purchased the petrol because you intended imminently to cause terrible and 
 
fatal harm to Shana and then to destroy the evidence with a raging fire.  You 
also set out on the morning of 25th August with your disguise in your hands. 
  
This was the high visibility jacket and a peaked cap to pull over your face.  All 
of this shows a high degree of calculated planning and premeditation. I am in 
no doubt therefore that when you set out from your home in your car at just 
before 7.25am on 25th August 2016 you had already formed an intent to kill.

At  shortly  after  7.30am  you  went  into  Shana’s  bedroom  knowing  that  her 
 
house  mates  had  left  for  work.  We  will  never  know  for  certain  what  then 
 
passed between you and Shana. At about that time a neighbour heard a raised 
female  voice  coming  from  Shana’s  house.  But  there  was  no  screaming  or 
shouting. Shana knew her assailant, and it was you. You took a knife, almost 
certainly from the kitchen which has not been found, and you slit her throat. 
In all likelihood you did this from behind her. She would have been conscious 
for some time before she died slumped by the side of the bed.  

You killed Shana in the few minutes either side of 7.40 am. Having killed her 
 
you searched for her bank cards. Then in your disguise you walked out on to 
 
the street. You were at this stage wearing a hoodie, which you had obtained I 
suspect from Shana’s house, and the high visibility jacket and the blue cap on 
your head. The hood of the hoodie was pulled up over the cap and you were 
 
looking downwards to avoid being recognised. 

And then to add insult to injury you headed for the nearest ATM which was 
close by on Graham Avenue. You can be seen on the CCTV within 20 metres of 
the cash machine at 8.06 am.  This was the time when Shana’s bank card was 
 
used to steal her money. You knew the pin. You accepted in evidence that you 
had  used  that  pin  in  conjunction  with  her  card  some  months  earlier.  You  
 
clearly  stored  the  pin  number  and  now  you  used  it  again.  You  attempted  to 
 
steal a sum from her account which was roughly the same as that you believed 
she owed you as a debt. But Shana did not have that amount of money in her 
 
account. So instead you checked her balance and you then took out £60 which 
 
was  just  below  the  balance.  There  was  a  small  service  charge  to  pay  but  the 
machine  only  issued  the  amount  you  keyed  in,  namely  £60.  It  is  no 
coincidence  that  two  20  and  two  10  pound  notes,  totalling  £60,  were  later 
 
found by the police in your car. 

 

 
15.	  Having stolen Shana’s money you went to your car and having driven around 
and purchased some water you returned to Shana’s house because you needed 
 
to  destroy  the  evidence  of  the  murder.  It  is  probable  that  at  some  point  you 
transferred  petrol  into  that  water  bottle.  You  can  be  seen  on  the  CCTV  at 
about  8.22am  going  back  into  Chrisdory  Road  to  Shana’s  house  carrying  a 
bag.  And  even  though  you  denied  that  this  was  in  fact  a  picture  of  you, 
nonetheless you also accepted in evidence that you were indeed at the house at 
that  very  time.  You  re-entered  her  house  with  the  petrol  and  you  moved 
Shana’s body onto the bed. You doused the floor and the bed with petrol and 
you ignited the fire. You left closing the door behind you. The fire quickly took 
 
hold and because it was in a confined space the heat built up rapidly to a high 
temperature.  Shana’s  body  was  burned  but  the  oxygen  in  the  room  soon 
became  depleted  and  the  fire  extinguished  before  the  body  and  the  room 
 
burned down and all of the evidence was destroyed. 

 

 
16.	  Having  left  Shana’s  house  you  went  home  and  showered  to  remove 
 
incriminating  blood  stains  and  you  set  about  hiding  all  of  the  clothes  and 
shoes  that  might  be  contaminated  with  Shana’s  blood.  You  disposed  of  the 
 
murder weapon. 

This was a cold hearted murder. I have not detected in you any appreciation of 
the  devastation  you  have  caused  to  Shana’s  family  and  friends.  Nor  have  I 
 
detected  remorse.  In  so  far  as  I  have  detected  emotion  in  you  it  has  been  a 
 

 
 
17.
--------
determination to do all you can to protect yourself and you have been the one 
person you have felt sorry for.  
 

Sentence of life imprisonment 
 

There is only sentence that in law I am allowed to impose upon you and that is 
 
imprisonment for life. 

Minimum term 
 

I  am  also  required  to  set  the  minimum  term  which  is  the  number  of  actual 
years that you must serve before you are able to apply to the Parole Board to 
be released on licence. Lest there be any misunderstanding the minimum term 
is not the point in time when you will be released. Whether you are released 
 
then, or indeed ever, is a matter for the Parole Board, not for me. 

The starting point for determining the minimum term is the guidance set out 
in  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003.  Under  that  Act  I  must  determine  the 
seriousness  of  the  offence  and  any  related  offences.  The  facts  of  the  present 
case  do  not  fit  exactly  or  neatly  into  any  of  the  categories  in  the  Act,  as  is 
accepted by the Prosecution and by your own counsel.     

In my judgment this was a murder following significant premeditation. When 
you set out on 25th August you intended to kill Shana in her own home. You 
 
knew where you would find an appropriate killing weapon, in Shana’s kitchen 
 
and  it  was  a  part  of  your  plan  to  use  this  knife.  This  was  a  long  way  from  a  
spur of the moment killing. 

You also combined murder with arson. If you had not closed the door behind 
you  when  you  left  Shana’s  bedroom  then  the  fire  would  have  been  fed  by 
 
oxygen  from  outside  the  room  and  there  is  a  real  likelihood  that  the  house 
would  have  burned  down  and  Shana  would  have  been  incinerated.  There  is 
 
also  a  risk  that  the  fire  could  have  spread  to  neighbouring  homes  causing  a 
danger to the lives of others. 

 
I  also  cannot  ignore  the  theft.  This  was  a  cold  hearted  and  callous  action.  It 
reveals  a  lack  of  remorse  on  your  part  that  having,  just  minutes  before, 
 
murdered the young woman you professed to adore you set about stealing her 
savings. I do not believe however that theft was the main motivation for the 
murder. That was a combination of anger at Shana for having split with you 
and  jealousy  of  any  other  man,  such  as  her  long  standing  boyfriend  Ashley, 
that she might replace you with.  

I must also take into account the efforts you made to conceal your own clothes 
from being found with incriminating evidence upon them.  

I  do  take  account  of  your  age.  You  do  not  have  previous  convictions.  I  take 
account of the grief and pain that you will have imposed upon your own family 
and  friends.  This  was  in  my  view  a  crime  committed  from  profoundly 
misguided  and  irrational  emotion.  You  have  suffered  from  depression  and 
suicidal  tendencies  in  the  past  which  may  well  be  connected in some way to 
these events.

I do not apply a mechanistic approach to sentence. I have taken full account of 
the  guidance  and  starting  points  set  out  in  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003. 
 
Ultimately I have to stand back and look at all of the evidence in the round to 
 
assess the overall seriousness of the crime and to consider what is just in all 
 
the circumstances.

The sentence of this Court is one of life imprisonment. 

You  will  spend  a  minimum  of  25  years  in  custody  before  you  can  apply  for 
parole. Whether or not you are then released is for the Parole Board. You have 
 
been on remand since 3rd September 2016. The time you have spent in custody 
on remand will count towards this minimum term.

4276039,R v Rowe [1996] NSWCCA 1,"HEADNOTE

Section 90A of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that anyone who takes away or detains a person for his own advantage shall be liable to penal servitude for twenty years or, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the judge that the person so taken away or detained was thereafter liberated without having sustained any substantial injury, to penal servitude for fourteen years.

Held   

1.   The onus lies on the accused to satisfy the judge that the victim was liberated without having sustained substantial injury. It is a matter in mitigation, not aggravation. Accordingly, the Crown does not have to charge substantial injury in the indictment where it intends to rely upon the higher maximum sentence.

The Queen v Meaton [1986] HCA 27; (1986) 160 CLR 359; Regina v Lee (1994) 76 A Crim R 271 distinguished

2.   ""Substantial injury"" means one which is more than minor or slight, but it need not be of the serious kind which would constitute it being grievous bodily harm.

Regina v Hudson [1985] FCA 442; (1985) 63 ALR 257 followed. Regina v Lloyd [1967] 1 QB 175; Regina v Albert Steven Ryan (CCA, 30 October 1995, unreported) referred to

3.   An injury of a minor physical nature caused to a woman by violence inflicted during or associated with sexual intercourse without consent, and particularly when the woman is being detained against her will, is capable of being regarded as substantial because the circumstances in which it was inflicted greatly affect its seriousness.

Discussion as to relevance to sentencing of the wishes of the victim in domestic violence type offence.

Judgment


	
	HUNT CJ at CL: The applicant (Shane Michael Rowe) pleaded guilty to charges that he had kidnapped and then had sexual intercourse without consent with the complainant (KT). Judge Nield in the District Court imposed a total term of penal servitude for seven years, consisting of an effective minimum term of four years and an additional term of three years. Those figures include a period of one month and five days of discrete pre-sentence custody. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.
	
	
	The applicant and the complainant lived in a de facto relationship over a period of more than five years. That relationship has been described variously as ""off and on"" and as ""unsteady and disruptive"". It is unnecessary to give any particular details of it. It is sufficient to say that, although reference has been made to the applicant's temper, there had been no violence exhibited by the applicant towards the complainant prior to the events which led to these two charges.
	
	
	There were two children born of that relationship. Immediately prior to the events in question, the relationship had broken up again. The applicant nevertheless harboured strong feelings of jealousy when he was informed that the applicant had become involved (as he believed) with another man. At some time after midnight, he called at a nightclub where the complainant was in a group of people, and asked her to speak to him. The two of them spoke briefly in the carpark and an argument developed. She declined to enter his car, and he took her by the arm, physically pushing her into it, and he prevented her from leaving it when she attempted to do so. He drove her to the premises where he was then residing, asking her to have sexual intercourse with him. When she declined, he informed her that he intended to rape her.
	
	
	When they arrived at the applicant's premises, the complainant declined to enter, but she was pushed inside by the applicant, who made various threats to kill her family and the man with whom he believed that she had become involved. He forced her by the hair on to the bed, and he roughly undressed her, tearing her underpants from her in the process. He forced her legs apart, and sexual intercourse without consent followed. He then pushed her to the floor, threatening to kick her.
	
	
	The complainant suffered grazes to her leg, stomach and wrist, and soreness to her head, groin and vagina. She had been upset, scared and crying throughout the ordeal. At the time of her abduction, she had been crying hysterically. The applicant drove her to her mother's house where the children were being minded, and obtained her agreement that she would not tell her mother or the police what had happened. He told her that he was sorry for what he had done.
	
	
	When interviewed by the police shortly afterwards, the applicant made full admissions in relation to the offences, and he accepted the truth of most (but not all) of the complainant's version. He told the police that he had just freaked out when he had found out that she was with someone else. When she admitted to him that she had been with a man, he said that he had just flipped out. He said that he could not handle the fact that other people were going to be around his children. He said that he just did not know what he was doing at the time, but that he felt he had to do what he did. He said that he had had two schooners of beer earlier in the evening after work, but no more because he had had to drive a considerable distance home. He conceded that there was no excuse whatsoever for committing the offences.
	
	
	The applicant appeared in the Local Court a month after he had obtained bail and consented to a ""paper"" committal. In the District Court, he initially appeared unrepresented and sought a sentence indication hearing. When legal aid was granted, he accepted advice to plead guilty. In the meantime, he had access to his children and slept with the complainant on those occasions. This was in breach of the bail conditions, but both parties appear to have ignored them. The judge did not take those breaches into account.
	
	
	The complainant wrote a letter to the judge, and gave evidence, that she had resumed a relationship with the applicant and that she did not want him to receive a custodial sentence - particularly because of the trauma which the older child would suffer if he did. She said that she had forgiven the applicant for what he had done. She confirmed the truth of what she had told Dr Strum, a psychiatrist, whose report was tendered. According to that report, she had told Dr Strum that, as a result of these two offences, she no longer had faith in relationships and did not trust men. She had been terrified by the applicant and had not thought that she would escape alive. She had developed depression, with anorexia, insomnia, sleep disturbances, nightmares about what had occurred, and flashbacks. She had suicidal thoughts, an altered libido, and felt very angry and bitter towards the applicant. Dr Strum had diagnosed a post traumatic stress disorder with symptoms of major depression, but he hoped that, in time, things would settle down.
	
	
	At the commencement of the hearing in this Court, Mr Segal on behalf of the applicant stated that he wished to amend the Notice of Appeal in order to challenge the conviction - in other words, to include an application to withdraw the pleas of guilty which had been entered. He indicated that the basis for such an application was twofold. The first was that the indictment charged the kidnapping as taking away, rather than as detention, and that (so it was said) there was no evidence of intention to obtain an advantage at the time of taking away. The second was that the admissions made to the police may have been excluded by the judge in the exercise of his discretion, based upon the report of a psychologist that the applicant's intellectual functioning is within the bottom twelve per cent of the population.
	
	
	The complainant's statement asserts that the applicant kept asking her to have sexual intercourse with her during the course of the car journey from the club. It is an easy inference to draw that that was the intention with which he took her away. An intention to have sexual intercourse, even with consent, would amount to an advantage within the meaning of the section. Moreover, the applicant admitted that the original kidnapping was in order to make the complainant talk to him. That, too, would amount to an advantage within the meaning of the section (as Mr Segal conceded), as it would have given the applicant a psychological satisfaction if she did so. [1] 
	
	
	Of course, if the applicant were to have been successful in withdrawing his plea to the kidnapping charge, it is inevitable that the indictment would have been amended to add a count based on detention to that based on taking away. The intention to obtain an advantage needs to be shown to exist only at some time during that period of detention. [2]  Yet, on sentencing, all of the circumstances of the detention would be relevant. I do not see that the applicant would have been likely to obtain any benefit from going to trial upon the issue of intention.
	
	
	As to the admissibility of the confession, there is no suggestion that the police acted illegally. There is nothing on the face of the interview itself to suggest that it was in any way unfair to the applicant, or that he did not understand the fact that he was admitting his guilt of very serious offences and that he was willing to do so or that it would be unfair to use those admissions against him. He had earlier, when unrepresented, sought a sentence indication. He appears from the transcript to have handled that matter without difficulty. Psychologists, by referring to the low percentile rating of a person's intellectual functioning, do not usually intend to suggest that it would be unfair to that person to ask him to answer some questions of the nature asked here.
	
	
	Mr Segal was granted an adjournment in order to confer with his client as to the wisdom of pursuing an application to withdraw his pleas, with the consequence that, if ultimately convicted, he would lose the benefits which he presently has of his early confession and pleas of guilty. The Crown fairly enough said that it was not in a position to meet such an application today, having had no notice that it would be made. There would therefore have had to be an adjournment. When the hearing resumed, Mr Segal stated that his client had decided not to proceed with that application.
	
	
	This Court has received written submissions from the applicant himself and from Mr Segal in relation to the application for leave to appeal against the sentence which was imposed. An application was made for ""fresh"" evidence to be led from the complainant that she and the applicant had married since the sentencing, that her complaints to Dr Strum had been deliberately exaggerated because she had been angry with the applicant at the time, and that she had originally attempted to have the charges dropped, and repeating the plea which she had made to the judge. This evidence was not objected to, but the submission was made that it did not amount to ""fresh evidence"" in that it did not materially add to the evidence before the judge.
	
	
	The complainant added further oral evidence to her affidavit. She said that she had not read Dr Strum's report at the time when she gave evidence in the District Court that what she had said to the doctor was correct. Having now read it, she denied having told the doctor that the applicant had been abusive towards her - verbally or physically - or that she had been anorexic. She said that her depression and insomnia were unrelated to the commission of these offences. I do not see that those make any real difference to the picture before the judge, who made no reference to any physical abuse of the complainant by the applicant. There is, as the Crown submitted, nothing new in the remainder of the evidence now tendered.
	
	
	The submissions made by counsel for the applicant subsume those received in writing from the applicant himself, and I shall deal only with the former.
	
	
	The first submission is that the judge misstated the applicant's prior criminal history. The judge referred to his record as including ""three offences of assault recorded in June 1988"". The amended particulars supplied to this Court confirm that that is true. The fact that the applicant did have prior convictions for assault was relevant. It was relevant to show that the applicant did not have a clear record in relation to violence. I see no error here. A point is taken that the judge should have accepted the evidence given by the applicant that he had been adversely affected by alcohol at the time of these offences. He did not in his evidence before the judge deny the truth of what he had told the police, that he had only consumed two schooners much earlier in the evening. No error has been shown in the judge's finding that he was not intoxicated at the time.
	
	
	The second submission relates to the kidnapping charge. Section 90A of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that anyone who takes away or detains a person for his own advantage shall be liable to penal servitude for twenty years or, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the judge that the person so taken away or detained was thereafter liberated without having sustained any substantial injury, to penal servitude for fourteen years. The applicant has argued that, if the Crown wished to rely upon the higher maximum sentence, the indictment should have charged the circumstance of aggravation which gave rise to that higher maximum. Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Regina v Lee, [3]  which followed the decision of High Court in The Queen v Meaton. [4]  I reject that submission.
	
	
	The intention of s 90A is clear. It is to offer an inducement to the kidnapper to refrain from killing the victim in order to destroy the evidence, or from inflicting substantial injury upon the victim, by offering a lower maximum sentence where no such injury has occurred. The form in which the section is expressed clearly places the onus upon the accused to satisfy the judge that the victim was liberated without having sustained such injury; it does not require the Crown to eliminate any reasonable possibility that such injury was sustained. It is not a matter of aggravation but of mitigation. [5] 
	
	
	The applicant has then argued that the judge erred in treating the maximum as twenty years in this case. Quite apart from the onus of proof, which the applicant made no attempt to discharge, it was in my view open to the judge to conclude positively (as he did) that the complainant had suffered substantial injury. In Regina v Hudson, [6]  the Full Court of the Federal Court, hearing an appeal from the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, interpreted the phrase ""substantial injury"" in s 90A in these terms:
	


"" ... for an injury to be substantial it must be more than minor or slight, but that it need not be of the serious kind which would constitute it being grievous bodily harm.""


	
	That interpretation was based in large part upon the NSW Parliamentary discussion of the clause of the Bill which became s 90A. I agree with that interpretation. It is similar to the meaning given to the word ""substantially"" in the phrase ""substantially impaired"" in s 23A, being of less than total but more than trivial or minimal. [7]  The physical injuries which the complainant suffered were minor, but an injury caused to a woman by violence inflicted during or associated with sexual intercourse without consent, and particularly when the woman is being detained against her will, is capable of amounting to serious injury within the meaning of s 90A. It was submitted that ""injury"", in the context of the Crimes Act, must be a physical injury. Be that as it may, an assault which produces minor physical consequences may well become substantial where the circumstances in which it was inflicted (as here) greatly affect its seriousness.
	
	
	The applicant's third submission is that the judge gave insufficient weight to his subjective features. Complaint is made of the judge's statement that the applicant's age, background, upbringing, education and employment had no relationship to the commission of these offences. The argument is that those matters ""served to create the milieu"" for the commission of the offences. According to the Pre-Sentence Report, the applicant had been brought up in a disruptive and unhappy family, as violence and abuses were frequent in his early years due to the alcohol abuse, first by his father and then by his mother's de facto husband. I do not see any error made by the judge in rejecting the claimed relationship in the circumstances of this case. There had been no previous violence towards the complainant, despite many breakups in the relationship and despite what is described by the complainant as frequent arguments. The report of the psychologist suggests that the applicant is vulnerable to accumulated stress and that he has only a minimal competency to manage and resolve stress. I do not see that the judge was obliged to find that this was a mitigating factor in relation to these offences. We do not rehear these matters, and it was open to the judge to make that finding. The judge said that he was allowing a substantial (in the sense of large) discount for the pleas of guilty, and that he was taking into account his contrition and his immediate and frank confession to the police. I do not accept that the judge has erred by giving too little weight to that contrition.
	
	
	The applicant's fourth submission is that the judge erred by having regard to the sexual assault when sentencing him on the kidnapping charge because he was thereby being punished twice for that offence. It was suggested that the scuffle in the car park was domestic violence unassociated with the sexual assault which later took place. I regard this as a somewhat unreal approach in the circumstances of this case. I am satisfied that the judge was fully alive to the problem relating to this issue. He said that, as the offences were related (as they necessarily were in this case), the principle of totality had to be applied. The total sentence imposed does not suggest to me that there was any double counting. A very substantial sentence could have been imposed in relation to each of the offences taken alone. No error has been established here.
	
	
	The applicant's fifth submission is that the judge gave insufficient weight to the wishes of the complainant. This Court has said more than once that the attitude of complainants cannot govern the approach to be taken in sentencing. In Regina v Peter James Glen, [8]  Simpson J pointed out that, whilst forgiveness by the victim may be relevant in some cases, exceptional caution is required in allowing such evidence to be given in relation to domestic violence type offences. The present offences fell within the same category, where the nature of the relationship between the offender and the victim is such that the victim will frequently, and clearly contrary to their own interests and welfare, forgive their attacker. The importance of general deterrence in such cases overrides any minor relevance that evidence of forgiveness might have. I accept her Honour's reasoning as to why that should be so. It is unnecessary to repeat what she said here.
	
	
	This Court has also said more than once that the hardship upon the family of an offender will not be relevant in mitigation unless it goes beyond that which inevitably results in any case of incarceration and unless it is sufficiently extreme as to demand that the judge draw back. [9]  That has not been established in this case. It may be ironic, as has been suggested, that the victim and her children are also going to suffer the punishment imposed upon the offender, but the fact remains that the law requires such a punishment to be imposed. All that the applicant says here is that it would not have offended sentencing principles to give greater weight to the complainant's wishes. That is not an argument which can be put to this Court, which (as I have already pointed out) does not rehear these matters until error has been established. It has not been established here.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that the subsequent marriage of the couple and the application shows that the future relationship between them is assured. I do not see any particular weight in this submission. It is obvious from the psychologist's report that, should the applicant again suspect that the complainant has been unfaithful, the same thing is likely to happen again.
	
	
	I propose that leave to appeal be refused.
	
	
	SMART J: I agree.
	
	
	IRELAND J: I also agree.
	
	
	HUNT CJ at CL: The order of the Court is that the application for leave to appeal is refused.

	JAMES J: Bill Kotevski has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court by Judge Cooper, following a plea of guilty to a charge of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. In sentencing the applicant Judge Cooper took into account a further offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of penal servitude for three years, consisting of a minimum term of two years three months commencing 10 September 1996 and an additional term of nine months. The applicant had been continuously in custody since 10 September 1996, which was the date on which the offences were committed and the applicant was arrested. Under section 33 of the Crimes Act the offence of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty-five years.
	
	
	The application for leave to appeal originally came on for hearing on 30 March 1998 before a Bench consisting of two judges of this Court, Hulme and Simpson JJ, pursuant to a direction given by the Chief Justice under section 6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act. However, as on 30 March those two judges were divided in opinion, the proceedings fell to be re-heard and determined by a Bench constituted by three judges (see section 6AA(5)). Both Hulme and Simpson JJ are on the present Bench and I am the third member.
	
	
	The sentencing judge's statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence was largely derived from a facts sheet which had been admitted into evidence without objection in the proceedings on sentence. The victim of the principal offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act was the applicant's wife. The applicant and his wife were estranged and living apart and proceedings between them had been commenced in the Family Court. His Honour found that there was bitterness on both sides. Notwithstanding that they were estranged and living apart and court proceedings had been commenced between them, the applicant and his wife continued to work together in a takeaway food business conducted by the applicant's wife in premises at Lidcombe.
	
	
	On 10 September 1996 the applicant and his wife were in the food preparation area in the premises at Lidcombe. On that day there was a dispute between them about whether one of their children should be given permission to build a carport at a property at Auburn where the applicant's wife was living. The sentencing judge found that the applicant ""snapped"", that is lost his self-control, and, on the spur of the moment, attacked his wife. In this attack the applicant successively used three kitchen implements which happened to be nearby. At first he picked up a scraper, held his wife down and repeatedly stabbed her with the scraper on the back of her head and her neck. A number of persons heard the wife's screams and came to her assistance. The applicant was forced to let go of the scraper, by one of these persons jabbing at him with a shovel and by his wife grabbing his arm.
	
	
	The applicant then grabbed an implement similar to a trowel and with this implement began stabbing his wife to the back of her head and her neck. The applicant's wife grabbed the applicant's arm and he let go of the implement. The applicant then picked up a long bladed knife, went over to his wife, grabbed her, rolled her over and lunged at her with the knife. Another person managed to take the knife away from the applicant but in the course of struggling with the applicant this person suffered a number of scratches and lacerations to his hand. The inflicting by the applicant of these injuries constituted the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The applicant was arrested by police who had been called to the scene. The applicant's wife was taken to hospital, where she was found to have lacerations and bruising to her head. The lacerations were treated by suturing.
	
	
	After the applicant was arrested he was interviewed by police in an electronically recorded interview. An attempted transcript of the questions and answers in this interview was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence. In the transcript there are many rows of dots in the applicant's answers and I infer that many parts of the applicant's answers could not be transcribed. In the interview the applicant admitted that he had stabbed his wife with a scraper but said that he had no recollection of using any other weapon. In the interview the applicant said that he had been married to his wife for many years. In the interview he made a number of complaints about his wife, asserting inter alia that she had ""kicked him out"" of the take-away food business, which the two of them had jointly owned for many years; that she had claimed that she was the sole owner, to the exclusion of the applicant, of the property at Auburn; that she had taken the keys of the property at Lidcombe and the property at Auburn; that she had claimed that a unit in Greece which belonged to the applicant was owned by her and her brother; that she had in effect adopted a course of seeking to benefit her relatives to the detriment of the applicant and her and the applicant's children; and that after saying that she would not oppose proceedings in the Family Court by the applicant, she had not co-operated in the proceedings which the applicant had brought.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge, said that ""this was a vicious heated attack on a woman with a number of weapons"". His Honour said that the existence of matrimonial disputes between the applicant and his wife and a feeling on the applicant's part that his wife was being unreasonable in those disputes was no excuse for such an attack on her. His Honour accepted that the attack was not premeditated and that the weapons used had been used ""opportunistically"", that is because they happened to be nearby when the applicant lost his self-control and not because the applicant had formed a plan to use them.
	
	
	The applicant was born in Macedonia in 1927 and was, accordingly, about seventy years old at the time he was sentenced. He had migrated to Australia in 1960. The victim was his second wife, to whom he had been married for many years. He had a history of working hard and he had no previous criminal convictions at all. He had made early admissions and had pleaded guilty. He was contrite. Because of his age and his limited command of English, he was likely to find imprisonment more than usually onerous.
	
	
	There was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence a report by Dr Jonathon Carne, a psychiatrist, who had seen the applicant on 21 May 1997. In his report Dr Carne recorded inter alia that the applicant had told him that his wife's family had refused to allow him to stay in his unit in Greece, that ownership of the interest he had had in the unit in Greece had been transferred from him to his wife's relatives, that his wife had failed to co-operate in the divorce proceedings, that the title deeds to the Auburn property were missing and that his wife had made a false accusation that the applicant had assaulted her. Dr Carne stated that he found that the applicant displayed a number of symptoms of depression and he diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, that is a depressive illness. Dr Carne recommended that the applicant have regular counselling with a Greek speaking psychiatrist or psychologist. Under the heading ""mitigating factors"" in his report, Dr Carne said inter alia of the offence:-
	


""It was an impetuous act and not, in my view, premeditated. The stressors were:

1. Long drawn out divorce proceedings and continuing conflict with his wife.

2. His feeling that his wife had defrauded him of properties, some of which he had planned to be gifts to his children"".


	
	Dr Carne also referred to some of the applicant's subjective circumstances as amounting to ""stressors"".
	
	
	An earlier report in 1996 from Dr Corcos, a forensic psychiatrist associated with the Corrections Health Service, which was also admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence, was in a number of respects in marked contrast to Dr Carne's report. Dr Corcos concluded that he found no evidence that the applicant was suffering from any mental illness, although he thought it possible that the applicant had paranoid personality traits, ""which would tend to colour his judgment of events"". In his report Dr Corcos referred to the history of matrimonial disputes between the applicant and his wife, saying:-
	


""Over the past five years since the separation there have been ongoing conflicts within the marriage based - as Mr Kotevski reports them - on his desire for a divorce and her refusal to grant one, a sense of both wanting ownership of the loyalty of their three sons and major conflict about their jointly owned properties"".


	
	Also admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence was a statement by the applicant's wife. This statement dealt mainly with the attack by the applicant on his wife which was the subject of the charge and contained only a little information about the matrimonial disputes between the applicant and his wife. However, the statement did contain assertions by the applicant's wife that the property at Lidcombe was owned, not by either the applicant or his wife, but by one of their adult sons and, that the property at Auburn was jointly owned by the applicant and his wife and that on 10 September 1996 there had been an argument, between the applicant on the one side and the applicant's wife and one of their sons on the other side, about whether a garage should be built at the Auburn property so that the sons could park their cars at the property.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge expressly declined to enter into a determination of the merits of the matrimonial disputes between the applicant and his wife. The sentencing judge said:-
	


""I do not propose to go into the rights and wrongs of the conduct of the prisoner and his wife in relation to those matrimonial proceedings. Suffice it to say that there is some bitterness between both of them and by that I mean bitterness on both sides"".


	
	When the application for leave to appeal against sentence came on for hearing on 30 March, the only submission originally made by counsel for the applicant was that the sentencing judge had erred in not finding that there were special circumstances within s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge had stated that, having given consideration to whether there were special circumstances, he had concluded that there were not. On 30 March counsel for the applicant expressly stated that he did not challenge the total sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, conceding that the total sentence was ""within range"". However, in exchanges between counsel and the bench on 30 March, it was suggested to counsel that the sentencing judge might have erred in not taking into account in sentencing the applicant the applicant's belief that he had been unfairly treated by his wife and the applicant's consequential feelings of anger and frustration and in not taking into account the extent to which, on the evidence in the proceedings on sentence, there seemed to be justification for the applicant having a belief that he had been unfairly treated by his wife. It was shortly after these suggestions had been made that the proceedings were adjourned. On the adjourned date submissions were made which were based on the suggestions which had been made on 30 March.
	
	
	In my opinion, there are three questions to be determined in relation to the total sentence imposed:-
	


1. Whether the sentencing judge erred in not taking into account, or in not sufficiently taking into account, the belief by the applicant that he had been unfairly treated by his wife and the applicant's consequential feelings of anger and frustration.

2. Whether the sentencing judge erred in declining to enter into a determination of the merits of the matrimonial disputes between the applicant and his wife.

3. Whether in any event a less severe sentence was warranted and should have been passed.


	
	I will deal with each of these questions in turn.
	


1. As to the first question:-


	
	The Court was referred to passages in the remarks on sentence, including a passage where the sentencing judge stated that the existence of the matrimonial disputes and the feeling on the applicant's part that he had been given ""a raw deal"" by his wife provided ""no excuse"" for the attack by the applicant. It was, of course, accepted by counsel for the applicant that the applicant's belief that he had been unfairly treated by his wife and his consequential emotional state did not provide any legal defence to the charge which had been brought against him. However, it was contended that the belief by the applicant that he had been unfairly treated and his consequential emotional state were relevant to assessing the degree of seriousness of his criminality and were consequently relevant to the sentencing of the applicant. It was contended that the passage in the remarks on sentence to which I have referred showed that the sentencing judge had, erroneously, proceeded on the basis that the applicant's belief and emotional state were irrelevant to the sentencing task.
	
	
	I do not consider that the sentencing judge proceeded on the basis that the applicant's belief and feelings about his wife were irrelevant in the sentencing of the applicant. On the contrary, I consider that his Honour took into account the applicant's belief and feelings about his wife, in reaching the findings his Honour clearly made that the attack by the applicant on his wife was not pre-meditated and that the applicant while subject to stress had ""snapped"" and had ""on the spur of the moment' engaged in a ""heated"" attack. I consider that the sentencing judge should be regarded as having adopted the same process of reasoning as that used by Dr Carne in his report, namely that it should be concluded that the applicant's attack was not pre-meditated but was an impetuous act, which occurred as a result of stresses, including the long drawn out divorce proceedings, the continuing conflict with his wife and the feeling that his wife had defrauded him of properties. I do not consider that his Honour was required to take the applicant's belief and feelings about his wife any further into account, unless the second question is resolved favourably to the applicant.
	


2. As to the second question:-


	
	I have already referred to the passage in the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence where his Honour said that he would not enter into a determination of the merits of the matrimonial disputes between the applicant and his wife.
	
	
	The question of whether the sentencing judge should enter into a determination of the rights and wrongs of the matrimonial disputes had arisen in the proceedings on sentence, in an exchange between the sentencing judge and the applicant's legal representative in those proceedings, Mr Craigie. The transcript of this part of the proceedings on sentence reads as follows:-
	


""CRAIGIE: Well at that stage in their relationship things had become so impossible, so intractable and the relationship so poisonous that for the two of them to be working together in the one place really did tempt human restraint and whilst what Mr Kotevski did is totally inexcusable, one can see, in the background, how the pressures were building for there to be some sort of potential outburst.

Now your Honour as to who was in the right or wrong is largely irrelevant---

HIS HONOUR: Well I certainly don't propose to sit in judgment on the matrimonial dispute.

CRAIGIE: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It's quite clear that there was a dispute which caused a lot of ill feeling between them. Who was right and who was wrong is irrelevant.

CRAIGIE: Indeed...""


	
	It can be seen that in the proceedings on sentence the applicant's legal representative conceded that the question of who was in the right and who was in the wrong in the matrimonial disputes was irrelevant, or at least ""largely irrelevant"".
	
	
	In my opinion, the concession made by the applicant's representative in the proceedings on sentence was properly made and the sentencing judge was justified in adopting the position that he would not enter into a determination of the merits of the matrimonial disputes.
	
	
	In the first place, it would have been quite impracticable for the sentencing judge to have attempted to make findings on the merits of the disputes, on the limited material available to him and within the confines of a sentence hearing. The matrimonial disputes ranged over many matters, including the take-away food business, the property at Lidcombe, the property at Auburn, the unit in Greece and the proceedings in the Family Court and extended to include the parties' children and the wife's relatives. The material relevant to the disputes, which was available to the sentencing judge, was quite limited. The applicant did not give any oral evidence in the proceedings on sentence. It is true that the sentencing judge had the transcript of the interview of the applicant by the police but this transcript was incomplete and in places incoherent and it is quite apparent from a reading of the transcript that at the time of the interview the applicant was highly emotional and incensed against his wife. The sentencing judge had the history contained in Dr Carne's report but he also had the rather different history recorded in Dr Corcos' report. It is a matter of notoriety that in bitter matrimonial disputes a version of events given by either spouse is likely to be lacking in objectivity and balance, but the sentencing judge had no evidence from the applicant's wife with which to test the applicant's version, apart from what was contained in her statement given to the police, which was mainly concerned with the facts of the offence. Even in that statement there are indications that the applicant's version of the history of the marriage might not be the whole truth, for example in her assertions that the property at Lidcombe was owned, not by either the applicant or the applicant's wife, but by one of their children and her assertion that in the dispute which had occurred on the day the offence was committed one of the parties' children had sided with her and not the applicant. It would have been quite impracticable for the proceedings on sentence to have been enlarged, so that a sufficient body of evidence could be received to enable the sentencing judge to make findings, with any degree of confidence, about the merits of the matrimonial disputes.
	
	
	In the second place, and more fundamentally, even if it had been practicable to determine the rights and wrongs of the matrimonial disputes and even if the sentencing judge had concluded that there was justification for the applicant believing that his wife had treated him unfairly, nevertheless, in my opinion, such a conclusion would have provided little if any mitigation of the applicant's criminality in attacking his wife as he did, over and above the mitigation flowing from the findings his Honour did make, that the applicant's offence was unpremeditated and committed on the spur of the moment as a result of the applicant losing self control while under serious stress.
	
	
	I have accordingly concluded that both of the first two questions I have posed should be answered adversely to the applicant.
	


3. As to the third question:-


	
	In my opinion, the objective circumstances of the principal offence, even after taking into account the applicant's beliefs and feelings about his wife and the applicant's favourable subjective circumstances, were such as to call for the imposition of a total sentence of the order of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In my opinion, the challenges made to the total sentence imposed have been unsuccessful.
	
	
	On the adjourned hearing counsel for the applicant continued to press the submission that the sentencing judge erred in not finding that there were special circumstances and that his Honour should have found that a number of subjective circumstances of the applicant, either singly or in combination, amounted to special circumstances. The circumstances relied on included the early admissions and the plea of guilty, the contrition manifested by the applicant, his age, the absence of any previous convictions, his good character, the diagnosis by Dr Carne that the applicant had an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and Dr Carne's recommendation that he should have regular counselling with a Greek-speaking psychologist or psychiatrist.
	
	
	As regards the diagnosis and recommendation by Dr Carne, I have already indicated that another psychiatrist, Dr Corcos, who examined the applicant, had found that the applicant did not have any psychiatric disorder. The applicant did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. Neither psychiatrist was cross-examined. In those circumstances the sentencing judge would have been entitled to discount Dr Carne's evidence.
	
	
	There have undoubtedly been judgments in this Court in which it has been said that some favourable subjective circumstance or some combination of favourable subjective circumstances warranted or required the finding of special circumstances within section 5(2). However, a stricter attitude towards the interpretation and application of section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act has subsequently emerged in cases such as R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 and R v Farroukh (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 29 March 1996, unrep) and has continued to the present.
	
	
	Applying the principles stated in those cases, I do not consider that it could be held that the sentencing judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in not finding there were special circumstances.
	
	
	I propose that leave to appeal against the sentence be granted, but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed.
	
	
	I will call on Hulme J to give the next judgment.
	
	
	HULME J: On 17 July 1997 this applicant for leave to appeal pleaded guilty to a charge that he on 10 September 1996 did maliciously wound Antonia Kotevski with intent to do grievous bodily harm. He asked that there be also taken into account an offence that on the same date he assaulted a further person thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm. The sentence imposed was one of three years penal servitude consisting of a minimum term of two years, three months and an additional term of nine months. The commencement date for the first term was 10 September 1996, when the applicant went into custody. The sentencing judge, Cooper DCJ, concluded that there were no special circumstances.
	
	
	The applicant is aged seventy-one. He has no prior criminal convictions. There had been some Apprehended Violence Orders against him in the past, which the judge did not hold against the applicant, saying that there was none current at the time of his offence.
	
	
	The applicant arrived in Australia from Macedonia in 1960. After he could afford to do so, he brought his first wife and children to Australia in 1969. He met his second wife, the victim of the offence, in 1970; and they have three children, now adults. The applicant has worked hard all his life to support himself and his families.
	
	
	During the course of a number of years prior to the subject offence, there had been matrimonial disputes, proceedings in the Family Court and bitterness on both sides between the applicant and his wife.
	
	
	On the occasion in question they were in the food preparation area of a takeaway food business run by the victim, discussing a proposal for their son to build a car-port in a jointly owned premises. During the course of the discussion the applicant snapped. He attacked his wife by stabbing her with what may be most readily described as a paint scraper, used to scrape fat or items off the grilling plate. When persons nearby intervened and took this, he grabbed an article like a pointed trowel and repeated these actions. When in turn he lost this, he grabbed a knife and did the same. Finally he was restrained by persons who had intervened. It was relatively minor injuries to one of them which formed the foundation for the offence also taken into account.
	
	
	Apart from bruising and abrasions, the applicant's wife suffered four wounds to the face and head, which required in all twenty-two sutures. She lost an estimated five hundred millilitres of blood. She and the applicant were very fortunate that the wounds were not more serious.
	
	
	It is clear that the applicant's offences were not premeditated, although the transcript of the applicant's ERISP is very incomplete and, to some extent, incomprehensible; due, I suspect, to the applicant's pronunciation and other problems with the English language. When one has regard to statements in it and others made to a psychiatrist who furnished a report on his behalf, it is completely clear that the applicant had intense feelings of frustration or anger arising out of a property dispute with his wife and apparent inability to achieve resolution of this, in proceedings which he had instituted in the Family Court and which had stalled, as he saw it, at least in part by conduct of his wife.
	
	
	However, as Cooper DCJ said at the time of imposing sentence, ""the fact that there have been matrimonial disputes over prior years, the fact that the applicant felt that he had been given a raw deal by his wife, and that is wife was being unreasonable, is no excuse for an attack on her of this nature"" and ""Unfortunately, attacks by frustrated husbands, estranged from their wives, are becoming all too common in this community and citizens do look to Courts to impose sentences which will be a deterrent..."".
	
	
	Initially the only ground of appeal advanced in this Court was that his Honour erred in finding that there were no special circumstances and in not holding that a greater proportion of the total sentence imposed should have been by way of an additional term. Reliance was placed on the applicant's age, his past record, his co-operation with the police, his guilty plea, the marital dispute and the opinion of a psychiatrist, whose report was tendered before the sentencing judge, that the applicant was suffering from a depressive illness which should be treated by regular counselling with a psychiatrist or psychologist who spoke the applicant's native language.
	
	
	A difficulty with this last matter is that the conclusion that the applicant was suffering from a depressive illness was directly contrary to the opinion of another psychiatrist, neither of whom was cross-examined, and the applicant himself gave no evidence. I do not see that in these circumstances this Court could never reach a conclusion on such an issue, but in the instant case neither the material in the reports nor other evidence enables me to do so; and when regard is had to the purpose behind the concept of special circumstances in section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act and the other matters referred to, do not, in the circumstances of this case, constitute or contribute to constituting special circumstances.
	
	
	In significant measure the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant ignored the principles for which R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 and R v Farroukh (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW) 29 March 1996, unrep) are authority, that generally what constitutes a matter of special circumstances within the meaning of section 5(2) is its provision of the need or desirability of an offender being subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole; and that factors which do no more than argue for a shorter minimum or total term do not constitute special circumstances for the purposes of the sub-section.
	
	
	Although Wood J in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 would seem to have adopted a less restricted view of what might constitute special circumstances, the later cases constrain this Court.
	
	
	In further supplementary submissions counsel for the applicant widened his attack upon the sentence imposed to contend it was, in totality, excessive and that the sentencing judge had failed to give proper weight to a number of the matters to which reference has already been made, and to the applicant's background. There was, in my view, more substance in this ground.
	
	
	His Honour was, as I indicated, correct in his remarks to the effect that the applicant's matrimonial disputes and any feeling that he had been given a raw deal by his wife was no excuse for an attack on her. However, in his desire to stress both passages which I have quoted and others that, ""The message has to be sent out to those who are estranged from their spouses that the Courts will not tolerate the resort to violence, particularly violence where weapons are used"", his Honour in my view overlooked the fact that matters which do not excuse the commission of an offence may be very relevant to the magnitude of an offender's criminality and the appropriate sentence to be imposed. It could, for example, hardly be suggested that a woman who attacked her husband in response to, or in retaliation for, his treatment towards her could not pray, in aid of a plea for a reduced sentence, the nature and history of the relationship and disputes between them. The fact that the offender is a man and the victim is his wife does not make irrelevant factors which would be taken into account if the roles were reversed or in other relationships.
	
	
	His Honour's concern with matters other than those before him is apparent also in another passage in his reasons, where he said:
	


""There is no doubt that women generally, and estranged wives in particular, are concerned that the Courts impose a sentence which sends out a message to the community that they are not to be assaulted merely because they do not comply with their estranged husband's wishes.""


	
	There was nothing before his Honour to suggest that the applicant's attack on his wife was merely because she would not comply with her estranged husband's wishes.
	
	
	Although his Honour said at one time that the applicant had become frustrated, he said he did not propose to go into the rights and wrongs of the conduct of the applicant and his wife in relation to the matrimonial proceedings and nowhere in his reasons is there any recognition that the stresses or strains on the applicant, whether due to his wife or not, may have been such as to reduce the applicant's criminality. Yet, the evidence suggested that the applicant had been subjected to considerable stresses and strains by the victim of his attack. It is true that the evidence came almost exclusively, directly or indirectly, from the applicant. It was contained in his ERISP, and in the history which he had given to the psychiatrist, Dr Carne. The first of these documents was tendered by the Crown. The Crown did not call any evidence to suggest that those matters were in dispute.
	
	
	Nor was there any order made by his Honour under the Evidence Act to limit the weight or operation to be given to the history recounted to Dr Carne. Although, of course technically, his Honour may not have been required to accept what the applicant has said, in circumstances where much of which was tendered by the Crown, where there was no suggestion by the Crown that it was in dispute, it was wrong in my view for his Honour not to accept it and certainly wrong to take the stance he did that he would not go into the rights and wrongs of the matters in dispute in matrimonial proceedings.
	
	
	His Honour recorded that over his lifetime the applicant had worked hard. In his ERISP he stated that he had and, one may infer with the help of his wife, acquired or acquired an interest in three assets. One was a unit in Greece, for which the applicant said he had paid $44,000; a second was a house property in Auburn in the joint names of the applicant and his wife; and the third was some interest in the property at which the assault occurred. This property consisted of a shop, a residence above and a two roomed residence at the back. Although there was evidence from Mrs Kotevski that this was owned by a son, the applicant said that he and his wife had owned the business for twenty-one years and had lived there, upstairs. Among his answers in the ERISP were the statements,
	


""I no have key for nothing property, take me key from the property at Lidcombe, take me key from the property in Auburn.""

and that his wife ""kick me out from everything"" and, ""You can't get nothing property, you losing everything"". He said also that his wife had told him that the property in Greece was not his, but that it belonged to her and her brother.


	
	The applicant commenced proceedings in the Family Court for divorce and property settlement. As I read what he said, this was with the agreement of his wife. The Court apparently requested more evidence, the applicant looked to his wife to co-operate in attending, but she failed to do so on more than one occasion. The proceedings languished.
	
	
	As I have said, there was nothing before his Honour to suggest this evidence was not, in substance, correct. If it was, the applicant, after a lifetime of work, had its product substantially taken away from him by the victim. He did what he could by legal means to redress what he saw was the wrong done and was again frustrated. While this does not excuse the applicant's conduct, I find it impossible not to regard it as relevant to his criminality on two counts: the first is the applicant's perception of events; the second is the history of the events themselves.
	
	
	With respect to those who may take a contrary view, I regard the frustration apparent in the ERISP and the events there detailed as very relevant to any judgment of the applicant's criminality and, as I have said, it is I think clear that his Honour refused to consider probably at all, but certainly to any significant degree, this issue. It is, I think, appropriate to record that he was encouraged and certainly not dissuaded from this approach by counsel who appeared for the applicant in the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	Both the sentencing judge and counsel expressed themselves as saying who was right and who was wrong was irrelevant; his Honour also said that the background of a longstanding dispute did not help the applicant. It follows that, in my view, the sentencing of the applicant miscarried and unless the view is taken the sentence was in any event correct, this Court should re-sentence the applicant. There can be no doubt that a custodial sentence was called for but, on the evidence before the sentencing judge and that which is before us, the appropriate terms are less than what was imposed.
	
	
	Three factors in particular lead me to that conclusion: the first is that during a lifetime of seventy years, and with the possible exception of the Apprehended Violence Orders which his Honour regarded as irrelevant to his task, the applicant had not come into adverse contact with the law. The second is the extent of the stresses imposed upon him. I would apprehend that at his age to see what may have seemed the product of a lifetime taken, would be very, very stressful to most people. The third factor is that the applicant would seem to have done what he could to sort out, by legal means, his difficulties.
	
	
	I am of the view that a total sentence of two years, consisting of a minimum term of eighteen months and an additional term of six months would have been apposite. Having regard to the fact that the applicant has already served more than eighteen months, it might be necessary to hear the parties on matters of detail attendant on those terms; but that topic may be left for the moment.
	
	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge for the reasons he has given.
	
	
	JAMES J: The orders of the Court are the orders proposed by me. Those orders are that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed.

He had migrated to Australia from Zimbabwe.  In 2003, he bought and then operated, until early 2013, the only pharmacy in Kellerberrin, Western Australia.  Mr Nyoni brought proceedings against the Shire of Kellerberrin (the first respondent), two of its successive chief executive officers, Frank Peczka and Darren Friend (the fourth and second respondents), its President, Stan McDonnell (the third respondent) and an electrical contractor, Peter Mitchell (the fifth respondent).2    The primary judge, in a careful and thorough judgment, dealt with the five substantive causes of action on which Mr Nyoni relied.  Those were claims that:(a)    Mr Peczka and the Shire acted in concert with Robert Bateman, a senior investigating officer of the Health Department, in trespassing upon Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy property in October 2007 (the 2007 trespass claim);(b)    the Shire, by one or more of its agents or officers, had made disparaging statements about Mr Nyoni’s business and, thereby, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and/or malicious falsehood (the false statements claim);(c)    the Shire, Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell were liable as joint tortfeasors with Mr Mitchell in trespassing upon Mr Nyoni’s property in the course of disconnecting the electricity supply to Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy in March 2010 and in October 2010 (the 2010 trespass claim);(d)    the conduct of Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell in relation to the disconnection of the electricity supply to Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy on 14 October 2010, amounted to misfeasance in public office (the misfeasance claim);  and(e)    the Shire engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by publishing the minutes of a Shire Council meeting which disparaged Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy business (the minutes claim).3    The primary judge found in Mr Nyoni’s favour on one aspect of the 2010 trespass claim.  He held that Mr Mitchell had committed a trespass at the pharmacy on 14 October 2010 when he intentionally entered and remained on the premises without consent of owner or lawful authority and, in the course of which, he disconnected the electricity without any lawful basis to do so.  His Honour awarded Mr Nyoni $12,000 in damages against Mr Mitchell, that included $4,000 in aggravated damages, and ordered Mr Mitchell to pay Mr Nyoni’s costs in relation to the issues between them.4    However, his Honour dismissed with costs all of Mr Nyoni’s claims against the Shire and Messrs Peczka, Friend and McDonnell, including the balance of the 2010 trespass claim.  The appeal – introduction5    Mr Nyoni, who represented himself both below and in the appeal, argued that his Honour erred in dismissing those claims.  His written submissions closely followed his grounds of appeal.  At the beginning of the hearing of the appeal, the Full Court suggested that Mr Nyoni might begin by developing his argument on why the primary judge erred when deciding the 2010 trespass claim by failing to find that the Shire, Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell were liable, as Mr Nyoni claimed, as joint tortfeasors with Mr Mitchell.6    After he addressed us on that aspect of the appeal and how it also bore on the misfeasance claim, the Full Court informed him that we had read his written submissions and that we would take them into account so that he need not repeat them.  Mr Nyoni said that he would elaborate on two aspects of his written submissions, which he did, before concluding his argument.7    In essence, Mr Nyoni’s grounds of appeal challenge his Honour’s factual findings.  It will be convenient for us to describe sequentially each set of circumstances found by his Honour for the five claims, the basis of Mr Nyoni’s challenge to the particular ground and our consideration of it.8    An appellant who brings an appeal that challenges a judge’s findings of fact, arrived at after seeing and hearing witnesses and making findings based on the judge’s assessment of the witnesses’ credibility, must demonstrate an error in the judge’s fact-finding within the principles specified in Robinson Helicopter Company Inc v McDermott (2016) 331 ALR 550 at 558-559 [43], where French CJ, Bell, Keane, Nettle and Gordon JJ said:If the court of appeal concludes that the judge has erred in fact, it is required to make its own findings of fact and to formulate its own reasoning based on those findings. [Devries v Australian National Railways Commission (1993) 177 CLR 472 at 479-81 per Deane and Dawson JJ; Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ; Miller & Associates Insurance Broking Pty Ltd  v BMW Australia Finance Ltd (2010) 241 CLR 357 at [76] (Miller & Associates) per Heydon, Crennan and Bell JJ.].  But a court of appeal should not interfere with a judge’s findings of fact unless they are demonstrated to be wrong by “incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony”, [Fox 214 CLR at 128 [28] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ] or they are “glaringly improbable” or “contrary to compelling inferences” [Fox 214 CLR at 128 [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ. See also Miller & Associates 241 CLR at 380-381 [76]].9    The primary judge heard the evidence and final submissions over 12 days in July 2014.  He made individual assessments of the 17 witnesses that demonstrated both the care with which he considered all of the evidence and the difficulty that an appellate court necessarily has in reviewing, on a rehearing, his Honour’s factual findings.  In particular, his Honour said that he had approached the evidence of Mr and Mrs Nyoni, Mr Friend and Mr Mitchell with caution, accepting some and rejecting other parts of their evidence.Regulatory Background10    His Honour found that the regulation of pharmacists in Western Australia occurred, relevantly, under:    the Poisons Act 1964 (WA):  That Act provided that a pharmacist had to be licensed to sell any “poison” at any particular premises.  A licence required the holder to satisfy the State’s chief executive officer (CEO) responsible for administering the Poisons Act that he or she was a fit and proper person to hold a licence and that their premises were properly and hygienically equipped for sale of the poisons.  The CEO had power to suspend or revoke a licence at any time and s 54(1) of the Poisons Act provided that an authorised officer, such as Mr Bateman claimed to be, could, “for the purpose of ascertaining whether this Act is being complied with, at any reasonable time”, enter any premises occupied by a licensee or from which poisons were sold, and inspect or examine any room or part of the premises and any goods and records located there.    the Pharmacy Act 1964 (WA):  That Act regulated the registration of pharmacists and their professional practice standards.  A pharmacist had to be licensed under the Act in order to carry on business and the premises from which such a business operated had to be registered under that Act.Disciplinary proceedings could be taken against a pharmacist if he or she were guilty of “carelessness, incompetence, impropriety, misconduct or infamous conduct in a professional respect” (s 32(1)(c)).  The Pharmaceutical Council could bring proceedings before the State Administrative Tribunal alleging that there was “proper cause for disciplinary” action against a pharmacist (s 32(2)).  The Tribunal could deregister, suspend, fine or censure a pharmacist in respect of whom it found that such proper cause existed (s 32(3)).  The Act provided that the Council could appoint a person to investigate and report to it on a matter relevant to the performance of its functions (s 31A).If the Council determined that in a particular case an investigator had reasonable grounds for believing that entry to premises was necessary for the purposes of an investigation, the investigator could apply to a magistrate to issue a warrant under s 31E.  A warrant under s 31E(1) authorised the investigator to enter and inspect the premises named in the warrant, to require persons on those premises to answer questions, produce documents or things in his or her possession concerning the investigation and to inspect and copy documents so produced (s 31E(2)).  The Council’s registrar was Robert Brennan, and Timothy van Bronswijk was one of its pharmacist field officers.    The National Health Act 1953 (Cth):  That Act regulated premises from which pharmacists could dispense prescriptions that could be supplied at discounted prices under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).The 2007 trespass claim – background 11    Mr Nyoni began operating his pharmacy from 92 Massingham Street, Kellerberrin in 2003.  On 16 January 2007, Mr Peczka, whose evidence the primary judge accepted, wrote, as the then chief executive officer of the Shire, to Mr Nyoni.  The letter noted that an inspection of the pharmacy by a Shire environmental health officer had revealed cobwebs in the display and water fridge areas and an accumulation of empty boxes at the rear service entrance.  Next, Mr Peczka wrote to Mr Nyoni on 22 January 2007 that a follow-up inspection had determined that the premises were “reasonably clean”.12    During the period to early 2007, three local institutions, Kellerberrin Hospital, a frail aged care home and a care facility for persons with disabilities, claimed to have experienced difficulties with the performance of the pharmacy in its supplying “Webster packs” to them.  Those packs contained medication dosages prepared by the pharmacy in separate compartments for patients based on what each patient had to take at four different times each day for a week.  The care facility terminated its contract with the pharmacy in early 2007 on the basis of its dissatisfaction with Mr Nyoni’s services and in March 2007 the hospital ceased using the pharmacy’s Webster pack services for its nursing home residents, although the hospital continued using those services for other patients.13    His Honour found that from time to time between 2007 and 2010, members of the public had complained to the Shire, the State Department of Health and the Pharmaceutical Council that, among other matters, the pharmacy was dirty, did not have sufficient stock and had irregular operating hours.  There were also complaints that Mrs Nyoni had dispensed medicine in her husband’s absence.14    In September 2007, officers of the Department discussed the investigation of one complaint.  Ultimately, the Department decided to send Mr Bateman to Kellerberrin to investigate the pharmacy in early October 2007 and it informed some of the complainants at the hospital of this.15    Mr Nyoni claimed that when Mr Bateman visited Kellerberrin on 2 and 3 October 2007, he had trespassed on the pharmacy premises and, when doing so, Mr Bateman acted in concert with Mr Peczka so as to make Mr Peczka and the Shire liable as joint tortfeasors in Mr Bateman’s trespass.  Mr Nyoni contended that Mr Bateman had entered the pharmacy on these occasions for a purpose that went beyond his authority to do so under s 54 of the Poisons Act, namely for the purpose of investigating Mr Nyoni’s professional conduct generally, including his alleged dispensing errors.  Mr Nyoni argued that because Mr Bateman entered the pharmacy on these occasions for a wider purpose than the discharge of his limited powers under s 54 of the Poisons Act, he became a trespasser.  Mr Nyoni also alleged that Mr Bateman was acting in concert with Mr Peczka and the Shire in pursuing the investigation on 2 and 3 October 2007 in excess of his statutory powers.  Alternatively, Mr Nyoni claimed that Mr Bateman became a trespasser ab initio by abusing his authority under s 54 when he began investigating other matters while in the pharmacy.  This is the 2007 trespass claim.16    The primary judge weighed the conflicting evidence.  Mrs Nyoni had said that while Mr Bateman was in the pharmacy on 2 October 2007, Mr Peczka had come in two or three times at intervals of about 1½ to 2 hours apart.  She said that on one occasion when Mr Bateman had left on a break, he had attended at the Shire offices and met with Mr Peczka there.17    His Honour accepted the evidence of Mr Bateman and Mr Peczka that Mr Peczka never came to the pharmacy and spoke to Mr Bateman on 2 October 2007.  He found that the evidence of both Mr and Mrs Nyoni was unsatisfactory in relation to both Mr Peczka’s presence at the pharmacy and his acting in concert with Mr Bateman.  The primary judge found that Mrs Nyoni was unable to give evidence of the content of any conversation between Mr Bateman and Mr Peczka, and his Honour set out instances from the transcript of why he found Mr Nyoni’s evidence on this claim inconsistent and unconvincing.18    The primary judge found that the 2007 trespass claim was the product of Mr Nyoni reconstructing events, based on his own evidence, after he had read minutes of a Shire Council meeting of 16 February 2010.  His Honour found that Mr Peczka did not enter the pharmacy or speak to Mr Bateman while the latter was there.  And, he found that Mr Peczka (as well as any other Shire employee) had not acted in concert with Mr Bateman or had a common design under which Mr Bateman did anything in the pharmacy that Mr Nyoni alleged amounted to a trespass.  Accordingly, his Honour dismissed the October 2007 trespass claim against Mr Peczka and the Shire.19    However, his Honour declined to make a “definitive finding” about whether Mr Bateman himself had committed trespass on 2 and or 3 October 2007.  That was because Mr Nyoni had brought separate proceedings raising the same claim against Mr Bateman in the Supreme Court of Western Australia (the Supreme Court proceedings).  The primary judge did say that “the evidence which emerged shows that Mr Bateman has a serious case to answer in relation to Mr Nyoni’s claim of trespass”.The 2007 trespass claim – Mr Nyoni’s submissions20    Mr Nyoni challenged the findings of fact that the primary judge made that, first, Mr Peczka and the Shire had not acted in concert with Mr Bateman in relation to his conduct in the pharmacy on 2 and 3 October 2007 and, secondly, Mr Peczka was a satisfactory witness.21    Mr Nyoni’s written submissions contended that his Honour should have found that Mr Peczka did enter the pharmacy on two or three occasions on 2 October 2007 and, while there, had discussions with Mr Bateman.  Mr Nyoni contended that the primary judge should not have found Mr Peczka to be a satisfactory witness.22    Mr Nyoni relied on the primary judge’s finding that on 2 October 2007 at the Shire offices Mr Bateman had asked Mr Peczka about certain addresses. Mr Nyoni argued that this finding supported his submission that Mr Bateman “procured confidential information about names and addresses of individuals in the Shire including a former locum pharmacist for” Mr Nyoni.  However, in our opinion, it is clear that his Honour’s finding gave no support to that submission.The 2007 trespass claim – consideration23    Mr Nyoni’s oral and written argument in relation to the 2007 trespass claim, in substance, was no more than a disagreement with findings of fact that the primary judge made on the contested evidence of witnesses.  Mr Nyoni was unable to identify any error in the factual findings that his Honour made that would enliven the power of the Full Court to interfere with those findings:  Robinson Helicopter 331 ALR at 558-559 [43].24    The primary judge made the challenged findings in relation to the October 2007 trespass claim having seen and heard the witnesses.  In the circumstances of this appeal, Mr Nyoni did not establish any basis that could justify any interference with the primary judge’s findings about the October 2007 trespass claim.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.The false statements claim – background25    Mr Nyoni alleged that Mr Peczka, the Shire and seven individuals, whom he alleged acted on behalf of the Shire, had published malicious falsehoods and or engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive by making statements to customers of the pharmacy that disparaged, first, Mr Nyoni in his profession as a pharmacist and, secondly, his business.  He alleged that those publications caused him loss and damage.  The seven individuals were Mr Bateman, Theresa Beech, Noreen Bonser, Bernice Del Borrello, Mr van Bronswijk, Raymond Griffiths (the deputy chief executive officer of the Shire) and Heather Sharman.26    His Honour set out the five classes of disparaging statements in his reasons.  These included statements that Mr Nyoni was dispensing “wrong and foul medicines” and therefore was going to lose his licence, that he had a terminal illness and that he was not fit to dispense medicines.27    His Honour found that Mr Nyoni did not lead any evidence that established that any of the persons whom he alleged had published the false statements, had actually done so.  The primary judge noted that Mr Nyoni had not even called as a witness any person to whom he alleged any statement complained of was made.  In addition his Honour found Mr Nyoni had not proved that any of the seven individuals (leaving Mr Peczka and Mr Griffiths aside) had any relationship to the Shire attracting its potential vicarious or accessorial liability for the making of any statement complained of.  Accordingly, given this evidentiary vacuum, his Honour dismissed the false statements claim and said that it “is apparent that this claim should never have been made”.The false statements claim – Mr Nyoni’s submissions28    Mr Nyoni’s notice of appeal and written submissions contended that his Honour erred in those findings in relation to each of the seven individuals as follows:    as to Mr Bateman:  Mr Nyoni relied on the primary judge’s finding that Mr Bateman had a serious case to answer in relation to the 2007 trespass claim.  Mr Nyoni claimed that Mr Bateman created some false records himself and also had acted with Ms Beech in some way to falsify records concerning Mr Nyoni.  Mr Nyoni also claimed that Mr Bateman connived with Mr van Bronswijk to conduct “secret trips to Kellerberrin on many occasions to catch [Mr Nyoni] and much more”;    as to Ms Beech and Ms Del Borrello:  Mr Nyoni alleged that they, and other staff, ran Kellerberrin Hospital and looked after an average of two to four elderly permanent residents who needed Webster packs.  He asserted that Ms Beech and Ms Del Borrello sent a false complaint to the Pharmaceutical Council concerning one or two Webster packs.  He asserted that Ms Beech sent Ms Del Borrello “to answer her questions” at the trial and that Ms Del Borrello “simply ma[d]e up stories that were simply uncorroborated” and created false documents.  He asserted that his Honour found the numerous documented false allegations by Ms Beech and Ms Del Borrello to be false. We note that, in fact, the passage (at [86]-[87]) in his Honour’s reasons, to which Mr Nyoni’s notice of appeal and written submissions referred, related to correspondence between Dr Geoff Masters, the acting director of the Department of Health and the solicitors for the Pharmaceutical Council in early 2009 concerning the lack of evidence available to the Council to pursue complaints against Mr Nyoni in the Tribunal.  The Council’s solicitors had noted there that Mr van Bronswijk, who was a field officer for the Council, had taken photographs of the pharmacy, first, in June 2008 that showed its state of cleanliness and repair to be unsatisfactory and, subsequently, in July and October 2008 that showed that Mr Nyoni had made a significant improvement to the state of the premises, which was then acceptable.  The letter concluded by noting that there was a “continued failure of most complainants to support the allegations that they make against Mr Nyoni” and there was no compelling evidence that the pharmacy was operated when he was not present;    as to Ms Bonser and Ms Sharman:  Mr Nyoni made no specific submission about Ms Bonser or Ms Sharman;    as to Mr van Bronswijk:  Mr Nyoni argued that his Honour erred in admitting photographs that Mr Nyoni had not seen before the trial;  and    as to Mr Griffiths:  Mr Nyoni contended that his Honour erred in finding Mr Griffiths to be a satisfactory witness.  Mr Nyoni submitted that Mr Griffiths was the deputy to both Messrs Peczka and Friend, before himself becoming chief executive officer of the Shire in about 2010.  Mr Nyoni asserted that Mr Griffiths tried to dissociate himself from his colleagues “for the purpose of evading responsibility for his impugned actions”.29    Mr Nyoni alleged that all the actions of the Shire and Mr Pezcka (together with the other seven individuals he named) occurred in trade or commerce.  He said that “it is common knowledge that [the seven] persons alleged to have made the disparaging remarks did so at the Shire offices, with the support and supervision of the Shire” and did so behind his back.The false statements claim – consideration30    It is difficult to relate how Mr Nyoni’s notice of appeal contended that there was any error in, beyond Mr Nyoni’s disagreement with, his Honour’s dismissal of the false statements claim.  But, in his written submissions, Mr Nyoni appeared to relate his Honour’s dismissal of that claim to a reason why his Honour should have awarded him damages under ground 11 of the notice of appeal.31    In our opinion, Mr Nyoni failed to demonstrate that his Honour erred in finding that Mr Nyoni had not called any witness who corroborated his claim or led other evidence that any particular one of the seven persons or Mr Peczka had made any of the statements complained of or that any of those seven had any relationship to the Shire that could make it liable for any such statement, had its making been proved in evidence at the trial.  Mr Nyoni’s case on his false statements claim failed before the primary judge because there was no evidence to support it.  Mr Nyoni did not identify any such evidence in his submissions on appeal.  We see no basis on which it could be said that the primary judge erred in dismissing this claim, let alone that his Honour erred in a way that would warrant interference with his findings to which we have referred above.32    Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.The 2010 trespass claim – background33    On 6 January 2010, Mr Friend wrote, on behalf of the Shire, to the State Minister for Health, making a formal complaint about the operations of the pharmacy and asking that it be investigated.  At same time, the Shire, at the instance of Mr McDonnell and Mr Friend, purchased a property at 96 Massingham Street, Kellerberrin, very close to the pharmacy.  The purpose for the purchase of this property, that appeared in the minutes of the Shire Council’s meeting of 16 February 2010, the subject of the minutes claim, was to provide rental accommodation to a pharmacist, Ms Lesley Ashburn, were she to succeed in her application under the National Health Act for a PBS licence that had become available in Kellerberrin after Mr Nyoni had sold his previous licence in late 2009.  The Council knew that both Mr Nyoni and Ms Ashburn had applied for the PBS licence.  The minutes recorded several adverse reflections on Mr Nyoni and his operation of the pharmacy, and went on to state:Whilst Council can not be seen to favour one business over another, it is Council’s responsibility to ensure that its community receives access to essential services as part of its “good governance” requirements.  (emphasis added)34    The primary judge found that as at 15 March 2010 Mr Nyoni was in arrears in paying his electricity account to Synergy in respect of the pharmacy.  He found that on 15 March 2010 Mr Mitchell disconnected the electricity supply to the pharmacy from outside, and without trespassing on, the pharmacy premises.  His Honour dismissed Mr Nyoni’s claim that alleged that Mr Mitchell had trespassed on that occasion as well as his claim that Mr Mitchell, Mr Friend, Mr McDonnell and the Shire were joint tortfeasors in the alleged trespass by Mr Mitchell.35    However, on 15 March 2010, after the disconnection of the electricity, the Shire’s environmental health officer, Garry Tucker, telephoned Joy Knight of the Department of Health and Mr van Bronswijk to inform them that the pharmacy had been without power from  8:00am that day.  Ms Knight then contacted Mr Nyoni and he confirmed that the power was disconnected.  She told him that he should not dispense medicine because he could not access customers’ records maintained on his computer.  Mr Nyoni told Ms Knight that he had put the pharmacy’s refrigerated items into his home refrigerator which was fully operational.36    Around 17 March 2010, Mr Friend learned that Ms Ashburn’s PBS licence application had been unsuccessful and Mr Nyoni learned that he had received a new PBS approval.37    On 17 March 2010, the power supply to the pharmacy was restored.  On that day Mr Tucker entered the pharmacy, on Mr Friend’s instructions, and undertook an extensive inspection of the pharmacy and its premises.  Mr Tucker took a number of photographs of the premises without the permission of Mrs Nyoni who was present at the time.  Later on 17 March 2010, Mr Friend hand-delivered to Mr Nyoni at the pharmacy a letter signed by Mr McDonnell, that stated:I write on behalf of the Council and the Kellerberrin community concerning the operations of the Kellerberrin Pharmacy and its effect on the general business community in town.I request that you make yourself available to meet with a delegation from Council as soon as possible to discuss this most important matter.Please contact the Chief Executive Officer Darren Friend on … to arrange a suitable time for the meeting.I ask that you give this matter your most urgent attention.38    Thereafter, as explained by the primary judge in some detail, Mr Friend, Mr McDonnell and the Shire made concerted efforts to pursue complaints against Mr Nyoni with a view to having the licences and authorities necessary for Mr Nyoni to conduct the pharmacy revoked.39    The second trespass in respect of which Mr Nyoni claimed relief occurred on 14 October 2010.  Importantly, Mr Nyoni was not in default of his payment obligations to Synergy in respect of the pharmacy on 14 October 2010, and Synergy had not authorised any disconnection of the power supply to the pharmacy on that day.40    Nonetheless, on the morning of 14 October 2010, Kerry Varney, who operated as a subcontractor of Synergy with responsibility for disconnecting the electricity supply of its customers who were in default of their payment obligations, instructed Mr Mitchell to disconnect the electricity “at the Nyoni properties”.  Mr Mitchell understood that to mean both Mr Nyoni’s house and pharmacy.  Mr Varney, contrary to his usual practice, did not send Mr Mitchell a facsimile of a written authorisation from Synergy for that work.41    After he received those instructions, Mr Mitchell told Mr Friend that, subsequently, he would be cutting off the electricity to both Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy and home.  However, Mr Mitchell did not normally inform the Shire of his intention to act on Synergy’s instructions to cut off supply to any Kellerberrin residents before he did so.42    Mr Mitchell attended at Mr Nyoni’s residence and disconnected the supply at 3:01pm.  He then went to the pharmacy and entered the premises.  His Honour, having heard conflicting evidence from Mrs Nyoni and Mr Mitchell of what then occurred, found as follows.  Mr Mitchell told Mrs Nyoni that he was there with Synergy’s authority to disconnect the electricity to the pharmacy because the account had not been paid.  Mrs Nyoni protested that he was not entitled to do so.  She asked him to produce written evidence to justify his claim that Synergy had authorised him to disconnect the electricity supply to the pharmacy, but he did not produce any such evidence.  Nor did he telephone Mr Varney or take any other step to satisfy himself that Synergy actually had issued a disconnection notice for the pharmacy.  Mr Mitchell said that he was in a hurry and was dismissive of Mrs Nyoni’s protest against his claim of entitlement to effect the disconnection.  He did so at 3:32pm and Mrs Nyoni then closed the pharmacy.43    In the meantime, at 3:31pm on 14 October 2010, Mr Friend sent an email to Messrs Bateman and van Bronswijk, and copied it to each of the elected members of the Shire Council, including Mr McDonnell, and three Council officers, that stated:Subject:  PHARMACY POWERTim/Robert I have been advised by Peter Mitchell, the local electrician, that he is cutting the power at both the pharmacy and Nyoni residence on Bedford Street this afternoon.I assume I will see you both tomorrow?Darren  (emphasis added)44    Mr van Bronswijk replied at 4:04pm as follows:Please arrange to have the electrician confirm to me in writing on his letterhead (electronically or by facsimile) that he has carried out disconnection of the power supply to both premises once he has done so.45    His Honour found that Mr van Bronswijk wanted that confirmation for the purposes of pursuing disciplinary action against Mr Nyoni.46    After effecting the disconnections, Mr Mitchell attended the Shire offices later on 14 October 2010 and co-operated with Mr Friend in composing a letter that was then produced and printed in the Shire offices, signed there by Mr Mitchell and sent, by or under the direction of Mr Friend, from the Shire offices to Mr van Bronswijk, later on the same day.  Mr Mitchell’s letter dated 14 October 2010 had his trading name in bespoke letterhead and appeared to be professionally formatted and presented.  It read:To Whom It May ConcernRe disconnection of power to both sites owned by Chemist one being house and other being owner’s business.Meter number for house is … disconnected at 3.01 pm on 14 OctoberMeter number for chemist shop is … disconnected at 3.32 pm on 14 OctoberPlease note this is not the first time this has occurred on the same premises.  (emphasis added)47    At about 9:45am on 15 October 2010, Mr Mitchell reconnected the electricity supply to the pharmacy.  Mr Friend advised Mr van Bronswijk of this bland fact by email at 10:58am.  His Honour found, however, that no one, including Mr Friend, advised Mr van Bronswijk or the Department of Health that Mr Nyoni was not at fault for the electricity supply to the pharmacy being disconnected.  The primary judge found that Mr van Bronswijk was left with the false impression that Mr Nyoni had been at fault.48    Thus, the registrar of the Pharmaceutical Council, immediately, before its statutory dissolution later on 15 October 2010, wrote to Mr Nyoni informing him that the Council considered that the continuous supply of electricity to registered pharmacy premises was essential to the provision of a professional pharmacy service.  Dr Robertson of the Department of Health wrote to Mr Nyoni on 19 October 2010 informing him that, in light of the 14 October 2010 disconnection of electricity and the earlier one between 15 and 17 March 2010, any future disconnection would give rise to consideration of whether his pharmaceutical chemist licence for the pharmacy should be suspended.49    His Honour found that Mr Mitchell’s purpose in advising the Shire in advance, on 14 October 2010, of the impending disconnection was to assist the Shire in demonstrating to regulatory authorities that, contrary to Mr Nyoni’s assertions, the latter did not run a “perfect pharmacy”.  The primary judge found:Mr Friend’s evidence that the first time he had seen the letter was when it was shown to him in the witness box, is highly implausible, and I reject that evidence.  It is inconceivable that Mr Friend who had since January 2010, been engaged in a continuing campaign to cause the regulatory authorities to take disciplinary action against Mr Nyoni would not have examined the letter before it was dispatched from the Shire offices so as to ensure that Mr van Bronswijk’s request for confirmation of the disconnection of the pharmacy’s electricity, had been complied with.  (emphasis added)50    His Honour also found:I find that Mr Friend’s intention in sending the email to Mr Bateman and Mr van Bronswijk advising of the impending disconnection of the electricity to the pharmacy, and in procuring the production and dispatch to Mr van Bronswijk of the letter of confirmation signed by Mr Mitchell, was to persuade the Pharmaceutical Council to consider taking disciplinary action against Mr Nyoni.  The same is true in relation to the dispatch of the letter of confirmation to the Health Department.  This action was part of a continuing campaign by Mr Friend and the Shire to persuade the various bodies which regulated the practice of a pharmacist, either to withhold benefits from, or impose sanctions against, Mr Nyoni so that Mr Nyoni would cease operating the Kellerberrin pharmacy and would be replaced by another pharmacist.  That this was Mr Friend’s and the Shire Council’s objective from, at the latest, early January 2010, is obvious from the activities engaged in by Mr Friend and the Shire which are described in [90] to [137] above.  The closing submissions of the second, third and fourth respondents, correctly acknowledge this to be the case.  (emphasis added)51    The primary judge found that on 14 October 2010, Mr Mitchell trespassed on the pharmacy premises and was liable in damages because he had no lawful authority to enter them.  As noted earlier, his Honour assessed that Mr Mitchell should pay $12,000 in damages, which included $4,000 in aggravated damages to compensate for the affront to Mrs Nyoni, and thereby to her husband’s right to enjoy exclusive possession, in the way that Mr Mitchell carried out that trespass.  He found that Mr Mitchell acted in a manner that was high-handed and disrespectful.52    However, his Honour found that Mr Mitchell’s trespass had not involved, or been authorised or directed by, Mr Friend, even though Mr Mitchell had informed Mr Friend beforehand of what he proposed to do.  He also found that Mr McDonnell had nothing to do with the disconnection of power to the pharmacy on 14 October 2010.  Accordingly, the primary judge dismissed Mr Nyoni’s claims that Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell were joint tortfeasors on that occasion.The 2010 trespass claim – Mr Nyoni’s submissions53    Mr Nyoni’s amended notice of appeal did not challenge the primary judge’s findings in relation to the March 2010 disconnection of the electricity supply.  Mr Nyoni argued in relation to the 14 October 2010 disconnection that the primary judge failed “to see the obvious link between Peter Mitchell and the Shire.  Nowhere in the decision is it ever suggested that Peter Mitchell disconnected power without Shire involvement”.  Mr Nyoni submitted that his Honour erred in failing to find that Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell had authorised, procured or acted in concert with Mr Mitchell in his trespass on 14 October 2010 and that all three of them had contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in doing so.54    Mr Nyoni argued that the primary judge had erred when he found that “Mr Friend’s conduct amounted to no more than advising third parties of Mr Mitchell’s intent to engage in a certain course of conduct”.  He contended that his Honour misapplied Fish & Fish Ltd v Sea Shepherd UK [2015] AC 1229 in characterising Mr Friend’s conduct of sending the 14 October 2010 email as having no causative or contributory effect on Mr Mitchell’s conduct in entering the pharmacy for the purpose of disconnecting the electricity.  Mr Nyoni argued that Mr Friend, Mr McDonnell and Mr Mitchell had a common design because they were all complicit in wanting Mr Mitchell to do the acts that constituted the tort of trespass.  Mr Nyoni submitted that this inference, of common design, should be drawn because Mr Mitchell did not go to other businesses or premises in Kellerberrin, other than the Shire offices, to seek assistance in relation to the disconnection of power to the pharmacy.The 2010 trespass – consideration55    The primary judge found that Mr Varney, whose evidence his Honour accepted generally as satisfactory, had induced the mistaken belief in Mr Mitchell’s mind that he was authorised to enter the pharmacy on 14 October 2010 to disconnect the electricity.  His Honour also, correctly, found that it was no defence to the claim in trespass that Mr Mitchell acted as he did under that mistaken belief.56    His Honour found that by the time Mr Mitchell informed Mr Friend of the instructions he had received from Mr Varney, Mr Mitchell was already intent on carrying out the disconnection of power to the pharmacy on the basis of Mr Varney’s instructions.   Accordingly, we can see no error in his Honour’s conclusion that Mr Friend’s conduct in passing on to others the information that Mr Mitchell was going to disconnect the electricity supply to the pharmacy was not sufficient to establish that Mr Friend authorised or directed Mr Mitchell to commit his act of trespass.57    No doubt Mr Friend was pleased to receive what he regarded as an important and useful piece of news from Mr Mitchell about his proposed course of action.  That course of action, if carried out, would further Mr Friend’s and the Shire’s admitted objective that, from at latest early January 2010, they could use the disconnection to persuade one or more regulators to act so that Mr Nyoni would cease operating the pharmacy.  But the mere fact that Mr Mitchell had been instructed by Mr Varney to disconnect the pharmacy and was proceeding to carry out his instructions, however much it suited Mr Friend and the Shire, could not make the latter joint actors in what Mr Mitchell did at the pharmacy.  Mr Friend and the Shire, while approving of what Mr Mitchell was going to do and then did, did not themselves play any causative role in the giving of the incorrect instructions to Mr Mitchell or in his acts of entry onto the pharmacy premises and disconnection of electricity on 14 October 2010.  There was no evidence before his Honour that, prior to the disconnection, Mr Friend or the Shire had done anything to assist Mr Mitchell in his act of trespass on 14 October 2010, let alone anything that made either of Mr Friend or the Shire a joint tortfeasor in that act.58    The 14 October 2010 email that Mr Friend sent, showed that he was hoping that Mr Mitchell would act as he said he had been instructed.  And Mr Friend’s conduct in procuring and despatching Mr Mitchell’s letter of 14 October 2010 showed that he, and the Shire, wanted to use the disconnection of power to the pharmacy to bring about a swift regulatory response that Mr Friend hoped would harm Mr Nyoni.  But the mere fact that Mr Mitchell’s communication of his proposed conduct of disconnecting the power coincided with an objective, that Mr Mitchell shared, of causing adverse regulatory action to be taken against Mr Nyoni, is insufficient to establish that Mr Friend or the Shire had any causative role in Mr Mitchell entering the pharmacy and carrying out the instructions that Mr Varney had given him.59    Nor was the conduct of Mr Friend in sending his 14 October 2010 email engaging in trade or commerce within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act.  As Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 604:the section was not intended to impose, by a side-wind, an overlay of Commonwealth law upon every field of legislative control into which a corporation might stray for the purposes of, or in connection with, carrying on its trading or commercial activities. What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it (or those whose interests it represents or is seeking to promote) has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.  (emphasis added)60    Mr Friend’s conduct in communicating with the two regulators was not an activity or transaction that of its nature bore a trading or commercial character.  His communications on 14 and 15 October 2010 with the two regulators were in the nature of a complaint or the provision of information by him and the Shire in furtherance of the campaign that his Honour found (see [50]) to persuade them to take regulatory action against Mr Nyoni.61    It follows that the grounds of appeal on the 2010 trespass claim fail.  But that is not the only cause of action on which Mr Nyoni relied arising out of the 2010 trespass.The misfeasance claim – background62    Mr Nyoni claimed also that the Shire, Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell engaged in the tort of misfeasance in public office in relation to Mr Mitchell’s disconnection of the electricity supply to the pharmacy on 14 October 2010.  Mr Nyoni contended that:    each of Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell, as a public officer:(1)    authorised or procured, or acted in concert with, Mr Mitchell to engage in the acts constituting his trespass at the pharmacy premises on 14 October 2010;(2)    directly or indirectly, by assisting Mr Mitchell to produce and despatch his letter of 14 October 2010, communicated misleading information to each of the Department and the Pharmaceutical Council, namely that the electricity supply would be, or had been, disconnected without informing the recipients that the disconnection was not attributable to any default by Mr Nyoni;(3)    engaged in the conduct in (1) and (2) with the intention of harming Mr Nyoni;    conduct of each of Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell caused the Department and Pharmaceutical Council to be misled into believing that the disconnection had occurred by reason of the fault of Mr Nyoni;    Mr Nyoni’s reputation had been harmed by reason of that conduct of Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell.63    The primary judge rejected Mr Nyoni’s claim that each of Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell authorised, procured or acted in concert with Mr Mitchell in the October 2010 trespass.  Because we have upheld his Honour’s rejection of that allegation, it is not necessary to consider this aspect further on the misfeasance claim.64    The primary judge rejected Mr Nyoni’s case that Mr McDonnell had any involvement in Mr Friend’s acts and conduct on 14 October 2010 in producing and despatching the email advising Mr Bateman (of the Department) and Mr van Bronswijk (of the Pharmaceutical Council) of the disconnection of the electrical supply.  Accordingly, his Honour dismissed the misfeasance claim against Mr McDonnell.65    His Honour referred to his earlier findings that, on 14 October 2010, Mr Friend had:    procured the production and despatch of Mr Mitchell’s letter;    sent the email to Mr Bateman and Mr van Bronswijk;    intended, when participating in those communications, to harm Mr Nyoni by causing the two regulatory authorities to take action against him as a consequence of the disconnection of the electricity supply.66    However, the primary judge reasoned that Mr Friend had not acted, when he engaged in that conduct, in exercise of his powers attaching to a public office.  His Honour followed what Lord Bridge of Harwich had held in Calveley v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police [1989] AC 1228 at 1240-1241 and Wilcox, Miles and RD Nicholson JJ had held in Emanuele v Hedley (1998) 179 FCR 290 at 300 [34] to conclude that it was an essential element of Mr Nyoni’s cause of action that, in acting as he did, Mr Friend exercised a power attaching to his public office.  Therefore, the primary judge dismissed the misfeasance claim.The misfeasance claim –the parties’ submissions67    Mr Nyoni argued that Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell had, and knew that they had, acted illegally and with the intention of harming him in sending the 14 October 2010 email and participating in the preparation and despatch of Mr Mitchell’s letter of 14 October 2010.  He argued that all of the respondents (including the Shire) “colluded and knew that Mr Nyoni would be reprimanded by the Pharmaceutical Council … and the Health Department”.  However, Mr Nyoni did not identify any evidence to show that the primary judge had erred in concluding that there was no basis to make a finding against Mr McDonnell and we need not consider this claim further.  Mr Nyoni also argued that Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell had contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act in the same way.68    Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell argued that his Honour was correct in dismissing the misfeasance claim against Mr Friend because Mr Nyoni had not identified a relevant power in Mr Friend’s public office that Mr Friend had or had not exercised on which the claim depended.  The Shire expressly adopted the submissions of Mr Friend and Mr McDonnell on this ground of appeal.  In doing so, it recognised that Mr Nyoni was, as he had at the trial, claiming that the Shire had acted to harm him.The misfeasance claim – consideration69    The Local Government Act 1995 (WA) provided that a local government, such as the Shire, had to administer its local laws and “may do all other things that are necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, performing its functions under this Act” (s 3.18(1)), and “In performing its executive functions, a local government may provide services and facilities” (s 3.18(2)).  Part 5 of the Act dealt with administration, including the publication of the minutes of a meeting of a local government council, such as the Shire Council, to which issue we will refer later in these reasons in relation to the minutes claim.  Importantly, s 5.36(1)(a) required a local government to employ a chief executive officer, defined as CEO in s 1.4, and the CEO had to be employed on a contract (s 5.36(2)).  The CEO’s functions, set out in s 5.41, included ensuring that advice and information is available to the council so that informed decisions can be made, causing council decisions to be implemented and managing the day to day operations of the local government (here the Shire) (s 5.41(b), (c) and (d)).70    We have summarised at [43]-[52] above the findings of the primary judge about Mr Friend’s email that he sent at 3:31pm on 14 October 2010 to Messrs Bateman and van Bronswijk, and copied to Mr McDonnell, six councillors and three other individuals including Mr Griffiths.71    Relevantly, Mr Friend sent that email using the Shire’s email account and it bore his name, official position and details as chief executive officer of the Shire under the subject heading “Pharmacy Power”.  Mr Friend said that he included all the councillors of the Shire Council in his email because:I quite often do that in relation to matters of operation, particular matters that the community will then badger them on.  So my council has never liked being blind-sided by – hot issues …  So it was important that they get copied in, same with my senior officers.  (emphasis added)72    Shortly afterwards, Mr Friend assisted Mr Mitchell in preparing and sending his letter of 14 October 2010 (set out at [46] above) in which he recorded that power had been disconnected to the residence of Mr and Mrs Nyoni at 3:01pm and to the pharmacy at 3:32pm.73    Mr Friend said in his witness statement, that he verified at the trial, that since becoming chief executive officer in late April 2009, he had received regular complaints in relation to how the pharmacy had been, and was being, run.  He said that as “the Shire’s CEO I was concerned that the pharmacy wasn’t providing a good service to the community.  I viewed the pharmacy as an essential service to the people of Kellerberrin”.  In cross-examination, he said that “from … a local government perspective, we deal with … a great number of complaints, some of which can be dealt with at a local government level and some of which … we need to refer to authorities” that had some form of control over the issue the subject of the relevant complaint.74    It is necessary to decide whether the primary judge was correct to hold that Mr Friend did not exercise the powers attaching to his public office of the Shire’s chief executive officer when he sent his email of 14 October 2010 and assisted Mr Mitchell to send his letter of that date.75    Mr Friend acted maliciously, on the primary judge’s findings, in sending his 14 October 2010 email and causing Mr Mitchell’s letter to be produced and sent to the two regulators.  The harm that Mr Friend sought to bring about, using his position as chief executive officer of the Shire in an official email from him in that office, was to give the Department and the Pharmaceutical Council a basis to act against Mr Nyoni to undermine his ability to act as a professional, licensed and qualified pharmacist at the pharmacy.76    Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307 at 345, in a passage applied by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Sanders v Snell (1998) 196 CLR 329 at 346-347 [42], held that misfeasance in public office:is a deliberate tort in the sense that there is no liability unless either there is an intention to cause harm or the officer concerned knowingly acts in excess of his or her power.  (emphasis added)77    In Mengel 185 CLR at 335-336 Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, explained that the officers concerned had acted outside the scope of their authority when they informed the Mengels that their cattle were subject to movement restrictions.  However, the officers did not have actual knowledge that they lacked authority and the Mengels contended in the High Court that constructive knowledge sufficed to impose liability on the officers for misfeasance in public office.  Thus, the High Court had to determine the requisite state of mind for that intentional tort.78    The joint judgment held that the tort was not simply constituted by an act of a public officer which, first, he, she or it knows is beyond power and, secondly, results in damage.  Rather, their Honours held that the tort should be confined in the same way as those torts that imposed liability on private individuals for the intentional infliction of harm, including acts that, in the ordinary course, are calculated to cause harm (Mengel 185 CLR at 347).  They instanced what Wright J had held in Wilkinson v Downton [1897] 2 QB 57 where the defendant falsely told the plaintiff that her husband had been seriously injured in an accident, intending that she believe that his statement was true.  The plaintiff suffered serious and permanent physical consequences and mental upset for which the jury awarded her £100 damages.  Wright J identified the principle that, if the defendant wilfully did an act that was not justifiable and was calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff and that in fact caused such harm, the law would impute that the defendant intended to cause harm of the kind suffered (Wilkinson [1897] 2 QB at 58-59).79    As Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ recognised, Wright J’s imputed intention was different from a finding that the defendant recklessly did the act that brought about the harm suffered.  Their Honours did not consider it necessary to decide whether a defendant’s recklessness could suffice to constitute the tort (Mengel 185 CLR at 347), but they held that an officer could not be liable for misfeasance in public office on the basis that the officer only had constructive knowledge of his or her lack of authority (at 348).80    As Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ noted in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Ltd (2008) 237 CLR 146 at 153-154 [11], 164 [55], after the High Court had accepted in Sanders 196 CLR at 346-347 [42] that the tort of misfeasance in public office included where the public officer acted knowingly in excess of his or her power, the House of Lords indicated in Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 at 192F-G per Lord Steyn (Lords Hope of Craighead and Hobhouse of Woodborough agreeing at 197C-D and at 231F-H), and at 228A-D per Lord Hutton (Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough agreeing at 231F-H), that recklessness may also be a sufficient state of mind to found the tort.  Their Honours then referred to “[t]he affinity between tort law and public law” that “reflects the precept that in a legal system such as that maintained by the Constitution executive or administrative power is not to be exercised for ulterior or improper purposes [cf  Three Rivers [2003] 2 AC at 190H-191A]” (Futuris 237 CLR at 153-154 [11]). 81    It is of the essence of misfeasance in public office that the officer either maliciously (with the intention of injuring the plaintiff) uses his, her or its power or, alternatively, knowingly acts in excess of that power.  That can occur because the officer either had no actual power to exercise or acted on the basis of an existing power but beyond its scope.  One way of acting beyond the scope of a public power is for the official to use the power maliciously because he or she intends to cause harm:  Mengel 185 CLR at 345 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ;  see too at 356-357 per Brennan J.  As the joint judgment explained in Mengel 185 CLR at 335, the officials in that case had no power at all to do the acts complained of but, because they lacked any knowledge of that want of power, and had no malicious intention, they did not commit the tort (see too Farrington v Thomson and Bridgland [1959] VR 286 at 293-294 per Smith J).82    Thus, in Mengel 185 CLR at 357 (and see too at 370-371 per Deane J), Brennan J explained that malice and actual knowledge (including, in his view, also reckless indifference) were alternative states of mind.  He said that either state of mind established “the absence of an honest attempt to perform the functions of the office that constitutes the abuse of the office”.83    In Sanders 196 CLR at 344 [37] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Kirby and Hayne JJ said that misfeasance in public office “is concerned with misuse of public power”.  The circumstances in which public officers can misuse their powers cannot be confined to closed categories.  That is because experience of human affairs suggests that it is unwise to attempt to categorise possible abuses.  Rather, the principle identified by their Honours encapsulates the ambit of operation of the tort.  The concern of the law in this area is to ensure that a person injured by an intentional or knowing misuse of public power will have an effective means of redress.84    In Dunlop v Woollahra Municipal Council [1982] AC 158 at 172E-G Lord Diplock, giving the advice of the Privy Council, described the tort as “the well-established tort of misfeasance by a public officer in the discharge of his public duties” (see too Mengel 185 CLR at 345 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, at 356-357 per Brennan J and at 370 per Deane J;  Watkins v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] 2 AC 395 at 404 [11] per Lord Bingham of Cornhill).  He said that Yeldham J, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, had “rightly accepted that the council as a statutory corporation exercising local government functions was a public officer for the purposes of this tort”.85    For the purposes of these proceedings, Mr Friend’s malicious intention, as found by his Honour, should be imputed to his employer, the Shire.  That is because, first, Mr Friend was acting consistently with the Shire’s campaign to harm Mr Nyoni and, secondly, in pursuing a complaint against Mr Nyoni he was acting as the Shire, not merely as its representative.  His was the mind of the Shire for that purpose, so that he was personally liable and, because he was “the hands and brains” of the Shire, the Shire became directly (and not vicariously) liable for any misfeasance in public office by reason of the same acts of Mr Friend on 14 October 2010:  Hamilton v Whitehead (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 127-129 per Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ.86    The observations of Wilcox, Miles and RD Nicholson JJ in Emanuele 179 FCR at 300 [34] concerned a senior public official who allegedly falsely reported to his superiors the substance of a conversation that suggested the commission of a crime.  Their Honours observed that whether the official’s report were true or false, his compilation and delivery of it “were not actions done in the exercise of powers attaching to a public office.  They were simply the actions of an employee reporting an alleged event to superior officers”.  In other words, their Honours found that the act complained of was not the exercise or purported exercise by the official of a power or authority of his public office.  The mere making of a report to a superior involved no exercise of power or authority.  Likewise, in Calveley [1989] AC at 1240C-F, Lord Bridge reasoned that a subordinate making an allegedly inaccurate report to the deputy chief constable, that resulted in the latter suspending the plaintiff police officer from duty, was not an exercise or purported exercise of a power or authority by the subordinate capable of constituting the tort of misfeasance in public office.  In contrast, his Lordship said that, had the deputy chief constable acted maliciously when he suspended the plaintiff, that “would certainly be capable of constituting the tort of misfeasance in public office”.87    In his article, Misfeasance in Public Office:  Some Unfinished Business (2016) 132 LQR 427, Emeritus Professor Mark Aronson helpfully discussed aspects of the tort.  He contended that spite or an intention to harm are not sufficient if the officer’s action complained of is in fact lawful, relying on the following statement by Harper J in Grimwade v Victoria (1997) 90 A Crim R 526 at 566 (see 132 LQR at 441):Malice of itself is insufficient unless the exercise of the power is only valid if done without malice: a parking officer may be as malicious as he likes in giving a parking ticket to his worst enemy whose vehicle is illegally parked. And the fact that the officer intends to cause harm (by fixing the enemy with an obligation to pay the fine) is wholly beside the point.  (emphasis added)88    However, his Honour’s example was, with respect, flawed.  That is because it overlooked that the causative role of the officer’s intention, in his act of giving the parking ticket, would be to injure the “enemy” as opposed to carrying out his lawful duties, were the officer not acting maliciously.89    Six years after Harper J’s decision, Iacobucci J, giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada (McLachlin CJ, Gonthier, Major, Bastarache, Binnie, Arbour, LeBel and Deschamps JJ) in Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse [2003] 3 SCR 263 at 280-282 [21]-[23], explained that if the public officer acts maliciously, he, she or it does not exercise the power for the purpose for which it exists.90    Iacobucci J said that the authorities in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (relevantly Mengel 185 CLR 307, Garrett v Attorney-General [1997] 2 NZLR 332 and Three Rivers [2003] 2 AC 1) had not limited the tort of misfeasance in public office to the unlawful exercise of a statutory or prerogative power actually held ([2003] 3 SCR at 279-281 [19]-[22]).  He identified the essential ingredients of the tort, based on Three Rivers [2003] 2 AC 1, as falling into two categories.  His Category A involved a public officer whose conduct was specifically intended to injure a person or class of persons, while his Category B involved a public officer who acted with knowledge both that he, she or it had no power to do the act complained of and that act was likely to injure the plaintiff ([2003] 3 SCR at 281 [21]-[22]).  Iacobucci J said that the two categories represented two different ways in which the officer could commit the tort, the common elements of which were ([2003] 3 SCR at 281-282 [23]):First, the public officer must have engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct in his or her capacity as a public officer.  Second, the public officer must have been aware both that his or her conduct was unlawful and that it was likely to harm the plaintiff.  What distinguishes one form of misfeasance in a public office from the other is the manner in which the plaintiff proves each ingredient of the tort.  In Category B, the plaintiff must prove the two ingredients of the tort independently of one another.  In Category A, the fact that the public officer has acted for the express purpose of harming the plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy each ingredient of the tort, owing to the fact that a public officer does not have the authority to exercise his or her powers for an improper purpose, such as deliberately harming a member of the public.  In each instance, the tort involves deliberate disregard of official duty coupled with knowledge that the misconduct is likely to injure the plaintiff.  (emphasis added)  91    Thus, in most cases, Harper J’s parking officer’s personal animus against his “enemy” will be merely coincidental to his everyday function of giving parking tickets.  However, if the officer used his power for the dominant purpose of injuring the “enemy”, then that would be an improper use of the power. 92    Iacobucci J’s reasoning is consistent with the alternative characterisations of the mental element in Mengel 185 CLR at 345, with the statement of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Sanders 196 CLR at 344 [37] that misfeasance in public office “is concerned with misuse of public power”, and with Lord Steyn’s identification of the rationale for the tort as “that in a legal system based on the rule of law executive or administrative power ‘may be exercised only for the public good’ and not for ulterior or improper purposes” (Three Rivers [2003] 2 AC at 190H (approving what Nourse LJ had held in Jones v Swansea City Council [1990] 1 WLR 54 at 85F)).  Lord Steyn’s view reflects what Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ had held in Futuris 237 CLR at 153-154 [11].93    Lord Steyn recognised that there are two distinct ways in which the tort of misfeasance in public office may be committed.  First, targeted malice, namely where the public officer engages in conduct that is specifically intended to injure a person or persons.  In a case of targeted malice there is bad faith in the sense that the exercise of public power is done for an improper or ulterior motive.  Secondly, the public officer acts knowing that there is no power to do the act complained of and that that act will probably injure the plaintiff (or applicant).  In such a case, the public officer acts in bad faith because the officer does not have an honest belief that the act complained of is lawful:  Three Rivers [2003] 2 AC at 191E-F.94    Iacobucci J’s Category A is what Lord Steyn called “targeted malice”:  see too Commonwealth v Fernando (2012) 200 FCR 1 at 23-24 [109]-[111] per Gray, Rares and Tracey JJ;  Sanders v Snell (No 2) (2003) 130 FCR 149 at 175-176 [98]-[100], 177 [106], 178 [108] per Black CJ, French and von Doussa JJ.  In Sanders (No 2) 130 FCR at 178 [108], the Full Court said that:The “targeted malice” that is central to the first form of the tort requires in the present case a finding of an intention to terminate the plaintiff’s employment as a means of inflicting harm upon him.  The intention to inflict harm must be “the actuating motive”.  (emphasis in original)95    They explained that, since the essence of the tort is the “dishonest abuse of power”, the mere intention to harm will not be sufficient if harm of that nature would necessarily result from the proper exercise of that power.96    Public power exists to be exercised for public, not private, purposes:  Futuris 237 CLR at 153-154 [11].  A public officer can use, with a proper or improper purpose, a power to make a grant to persons of public money, a licence or authority.  The improper purpose, such as to do a favour for a friend, to give a benefit to a relative or to give the quid pro quo for a bribe, is an abuse of the power even though that or any other officer could have decided to do the same act for lawful and proper purposes.  Clearly enough, it will be a very rare case in which an officer, such as Harper J’s parking officer, will be proven to have acted for an improper purpose in giving a ticket to a person who both illegally parked a vehicle and coincidentally is the officer’s enemy.  But, the difficulty of imagining a particular case should not obscure the commonplace experience that persons entrusted with powers can and do misuse them.97    The elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office have been crafted carefully to ensure that they do not encompass the negligent or unintentional acts or omissions of a public official.  The tort requires, first, a misuse of an office or power, secondly, the intentional element that the officer did so either with the intention of harming a person or class of persons or knowing that he, she or it was acting in excess of his, her or its power, and, thirdly, that the plaintiff (or applicant) suffered special damage or, to use Lord Bingham’s more modern characterisation, “material damage” such as financial loss, physical or mental injury, including recognised psychiatric injury (but not merely distress, injured feelings, indignation or annoyance):  see Watkins [2006] 2 AC at 403 [7], 410 [27].98    Because misfeasance in public office is an action on the case, it is a necessary element of the tort that the plaintiff (or applicant) suffer actual or “special” or “material” damage:  Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 527-528 per Bowen LJ for himself, Lord Esher MR and Fry LJ (see too Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O’Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 at 79 [56] per Gummow and Hayne JJ).  He said where “damage is the gist of the action” it was necessary to prove “actual temporal loss with certainty and precision” ([1892] 2 QB at 532), however this was “subject to the qualification of good sense and of justice” (at 531).  Bowen LJ explained that in an action on the case for injurious falsehood:The nature and circumstances of the publication of the falsehood may accordingly require the admission of evidence of general loss of business as the natural and direct result produced, and perhaps intended to be produced.99    At common law, ordinarily, slander or defamation orally or by spoken words was not actionable per se without an allegation and proof of special damage.  However, there were exceptions to that rule.  In some cases, slander was actionable without special damage, namely, where the defamatory publication related to the plaintiff’s business or profession or office of profit, “the mere imputation of want of ability to discharge the duties of that office is sufficient to support an action.  It is not necessary that there should be imputation [sic] of immoral or disgraceful conduct”:  Alexander v Jenkins [1892] 1 QB 797 at 800 per Lord Herschell, with whom Lindley and Kay LJJ agreed.  Lord Herschell explained that (at 800-801):It must be either something said of him in his office or business which may damage him in that office or business, or it must relate to some quality which would shew that he is a man who, by reason of his want of ability or honesty, is unfit to hold the office. So much with regard to offices of profit; the reason being that in all those cases the Court will presume, or perhaps I should rather say the law presumes, such a probability of pecuniary loss from such imputation, in that office, or employment, or profession, that it will not require special damage to be shewn. It may be said to be an arbitrary rule. Be it so;  (emphasis added)100    In Watkins [2006] 2 AC 395, the House of Lords rejected a claim by a prisoner that prison officers and the Home Secretary had committed misfeasance in public office when three prison officers maliciously opened letters to the prisoner from his lawyers.  That was because their Lordships found that the prisoner could not establish that he had suffered “material damage”, however unlawfully the three officers had acted.101    There is a distinction between that situation and the present case, where Mr Friend targeted his malice to have the two regulators take steps to cause Mr Nyoni to cease operating his pharmacy by raising matters with them that suggested that Mr Nyoni was unfit to properly conduct, or incapable of properly conducting, his profession or the business of a pharmacist.  The making of such an allegation by a public officer or body, such as Mr Friend or the Shire, to another government agency or authority with regulatory powers over a person in Mr Nyoni’s position should be presumed (as it would in cases of slander) to cause sufficient material or actual damage to support the action of misfeasance in public office.102    In substance, Mr Friend intended, maliciously, as his Honour found, to cause both economic and reputational harm to Mr Nyoni.  There is no reason why the law should ignore the reality that a professional person must suffer some real, material harm, when a public officer makes a complaint about the person to a regulator of his or her profession.103    The next question is whether in sending his email of 14 October 2010, and causing Mr Mitchell’s letter to be sent, to the Department and the Pharmaceutical Council, Mr Friend acted in exercise or purported exercise of a power of his public office.  It is inherent in the performance of the most senior executive office of a governmental institution, such as a Department of State or a local government council, that the office-holder must make representations and communications on behalf, or as the voice, of that institution to others, including other organs of government responsible for exercising functions or powers that affect the office-holder’s employer.104    Here, the provision of pharmacy services in Kellerberrin was a matter of concern to the Shire, as the local governmental body responsible for the provision of certain essential and other services to its constituents and others in Kellerberrin.  As his Honour found, from at latest January 2010, Mr Friend and his employer, the Shire, had engaged in a continuing campaign to persuade regulators of pharmacists to act in exercise of their powers so as to bring about the result that Mr Nyoni would cease operating the Kellerberrin pharmacy:  see [50] above.105    Mr Friend acted, in sending his email of 14 October 2010 and causing Mr Mitchell’s letter to be sent, with the intention that these would cause other public authorities to act on their powers to suspend or prevent Mr Nyoni from continuing to practice as a pharmacist or to dispense essential medicines.  That was, as the primary judge found, Mr Friend’s intention.  It is also safe to infer that Mr Friend advisedly employed the means that he believed would best give effect to the fulfilment of his intention.106    Mr Friend’s argument that, as chief executive officer, he “had no power to direct either of the institutions those officers [Mr Bateman and Mr van Bronswijk] represented to take any particular action” must be rejected.  This was not a case where Mr Friend had any power to direct those other institutions.  But he did have power, in his capacity as the Shire’s chief executive officer, to make and pursue complaints with, or make representations to, other governmental authorities about matters that directly affected, or advanced the interests of, the Shire as another governmental institution.107    Mr Friend was using the authority of the Shire and his own office to seek to cause two governmental institutions to send officers to Kellerberrin the next day with a view to them taking action adverse to Mr Nyoni because of the disconnection of the electricity supply to the pharmacy.  Hence, Mr Friend’s question at the conclusion of the 14 October 2010 email, “I assume I will see you both tomorrow?”  In effect, Mr Friend was making a complaint, using his office, to two regulatory bodies that a pharmacy in the Shire, that was an important, if not essential, service in Kellerberrin, could not operate properly without electricity.  As he acknowledged in his evidence to the primary judge, Mr Friend considered that the pharmacy was in the class of “hot issues” for the elected councillors, hence he copied all of them into his 14 October 2010 email.  Moreover, as the primary judge found, Mr Friend also procured the production and despatch to the two regulators of Mr Mitchell’s letter of 14 October 2010, that confirmed that the power supply had been disconnected, with the intention of harming Mr Nyoni.108    Where a very senior public official uses his or her own office, with the intention to cause harm, to make a complaint about another person to another governmental or other institution or body with power to adversely affect the person complained of, is it correct to say that the official, in doing so, is using a “power” of his or her office?  Appointment to a public office clothes an official with authority to exercise the powers and functions of the office on behalf of or for the appointor.  Mr Friend explained in his evidence that an aspect of his, and the Shire’s, office was to deal with “a great number of complaints … some of which obviously we need to refer to authorities”.109    The tort of misfeasance in public office involves a misuse of the power of the office.  The officer must either intend that misuse to cause harm (whether or not the exercise of the power is within its scope) or know that he or she is acting in excess of his or her power:  Mengel 185 CLR at 345.  That is, depending on the officer’s state of mind in exercising the power, the misuse can be one that would be within the power (i.e. a use that, if coupled with an intention to use it that was not to cause harm, would be lawful) or in excess of the power (i.e. a use for which, in essence, there is no power because the officer knows that the act is beyond – in excess of – the power).  Nonetheless, it is necessary to establish that the alleged misfeasance is connected to a power or function that the officer has by virtue, or as an incident, of his or her public office.110    The primary judge followed what Lord Bridge said in Calveley [1989] AC at 1240-1241, namely that if a police officer investigating suspected criminal or disciplinary activity maliciously (i.e. intending to cause harm to the suspect) makes a false report to a disciplinary officer which is defamatory of the suspect, the suspect has a cause of action in defamation against the officer.  But, his Lordship said:… the report is defamation not misfeasance in public office, since the mere making of a report is not a relevant exercise of power or authority by the investigating officer.111    His Honour reasoned that Mr Friend’s actions in sending the 14 October 2010 email and assisting in the production and despatch of Mr Mitchell’s letter were not done in the exercise of powers attaching to a public office, albeit that these were not communications to a superior officer as in Calveley [1989] AC 1228 or Emanuele 179 FCR at 300 [34].112    The principle in cases such as Calveley [1989] AC 1228 and Emanuele 179 FCR 290 appears to be that the action of making or furnishing internal communications or reports by employees to superiors within a governmental institution may not amount to an act done in the exercise of the author’s public office.  That is, such an act, whatever may be its ultimate influence or impact on those who are the superiors of the actor, does not have an immediate or direct consequence on the person who is, or in due course comes to be, injured by it.  In such a case, the injury arises directly from a subsequent act that, while it may have been caused by the earlier malicious report, is distinct from it.  It is likely that the cases on which his Honour relied had sought to distinguish intermediate actions in a chain of causation from the effective and immediate cause of injury, being the ultimate exercise of the public power such as, for example, the arrest or charging of the suspect by, or under the orders of, an officer other than the malicious author of the report.113    Here, the injury of which Mr Nyoni complained was Mr Friend’s acts, as chief executive officer, that, on 14 October 2010, initiated investigative and disciplinary actions by other authorities in relation to Mr Nyoni.  Mr Friend exercised the power to make an official complaint, on behalf of the Shire, against Mr Nyoni to the Department and the Pharmaceutical Council.  Mr Friend used a power of his office maliciously to make complaints to the two governmental authorities.  His exercise of that power was complete when he set the investigation processes in motion against Mr Nyoni.  114    Mr Friend had no other relevant power to exercise, unlike the situation in the cases involving internal reports.  He exercised the only power – the power to make an official complaint – that was relevantly available to him as chief executive officer of the Shire, deliberately to harm Mr Nyoni.  He used his office, and its authority, to inform the two institutions about the disconnection of electricity to Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy and ensured that Mr Mitchell’s confirmatory letter was sent to them in order to harm Mr Nyoni by causing the institutions to take action against him.  Each of the Pharmaceutical Council and the Department promptly wrote to Mr Nyoni on 15 and 19 October 2010, respectively, informing him that continuous supply of electricity to a pharmacy was essential and attributing to him the responsibility for the cessation of supply on 14 or 15 October 2010.  Moreover, the Department’s letter warned Mr Nyoni that if another disconnection were to “occur under similar circumstances” it would consider suspending his licence for the pharmacy.115    On his Honour’s findings, Mr Friend intended that his actions on 14 October 2010 would bring about, at least, such a result, namely that the two regulators would treat the disconnection of electricity to the pharmacy as a matter adverse to Mr Nyoni’s entitlement to continue to operate it.  Importantly, as noted above, his Honour found that no one, including Mr Friend, had advised Mr van Bronswijk or the Department that Mr Nyoni was not at fault for the electricity being disconnected and that Mr van Bronswijk was left with the impression that Mr Nyoni had been at fault.116    As a consequence, the two regulators maintained uncorrected on their records in relation to Mr Nyoni and the pharmacy, the false report, that Mr Friend had sent or caused Mr Mitchell to make, that Mr Nyoni was responsible for the disconnection of the pharmacy that would be used against him should there be a repetition.  That result advanced the campaign against Mr Nyoni that Mr Friend and the Shire had been pursuing.117    Mr Friend’s actions were not isolated or unexplained.  He had been acting on the instructions and with the authority of the Shire for months, in expressing complaints about Mr Nyoni to the Department, as his 6 January 2010 letter to its Minister showed, and the Pharmaceutical Council.118    In our opinion, based on the primary judge’s findings of fact, Mr Friend committed the tort of misfeasance in public office in acting as he did on 14 and 15 October 2010 by sending his email and assisting Mr Mitchell to produce and despatch his letter to convey that Mr Nyoni was at fault for the pharmacy’s disconnection.  In so acting Mr Friend was also acting as the Shire so as to make it also liable for misfeasance in public office:  Dunlop [1982] AC at 172F-G;  Hamilton 166 CLR at 127-129.  Their intention, of injuring Mr Nyoni in doing so, entailed that their exercise of a public power was done for an ulterior and an improper purpose and, so, was a misuse of their powers:  Futuris 237 CLR at 153-154 [11].  It was targeted malice.119    Given that the primary judge had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses over a lengthy trial, we consider that we should remit the assessment of damages, including aggravated and or exemplary damages, to his Honour which he should be able to do without the need for further submissions.The minutes claim – background120    Mr Nyoni alleged that, in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the Shire had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce by publishing the minutes of the meeting of the Shire Council of 16 February 2010.  He contended that the minutes conveyed eight representations (that the primary judge found were, in fact, conveyed), namely that:(a)    Mr Nyoni provided unacceptable service to his customers and had done so for many years;(b)    the community was dissatisfied with the service provided by Mr Nyoni;(c)    complaints had been made on a regular basis to the Shire’s staff;(d)    the pharmacy had irregular hours of opening;(e)    the pharmacy was in a dirty state;(f)    the pharmacy lacked stock;(g)    the pharmacy lacked prescription drugs;  and(h)    the community was not receiving access to essential services because of Mr Nyoni.121    Mr Nyoni claimed that each of the eight representations was false and that he had suffered loss and damage as a result of the publication of the minutes.122    The primary judge found that Mr Nyoni’s claim failed at the threshold.  That was because the publication of the minutes by the Shire on its website was not conduct in trade or commerce but rather was done pursuant to the statutory obligation under s 5.22 of the Local Government Act 1995 (WA) to keep minutes of all council meetings, and reg 13 of the Local Government (Administration) Regulations 1996 (WA) to make the minutes available to the public.  His Honour also considered whether Mr Nyoni had proved that each of the eight representations was false.  He found, after considering the evidence of numerous witnesses, that Mr Nyoni had not discharged his onus of proof to establish that any of the eight representations was false.123    In addition, the primary judge found that Mr Nyoni had adduced no evidence as to the financial position of the pharmacy business as at 16 February 2010 or of any deterioration of that position consequent on the publication of the minutes.  Accordingly, his Honour found that Mr Nyoni had not discharged his onus of proof to demonstrate that he had suffered any loss or damage by reason of the Shire’s allegedly misleading or deceptive conduct in publishing the minutes.  Thus, the minutes claim failed.The minutes claim – Mr Nyoni’s submissions124    Mr Nyoni contended that the primary judge erred in holding that, first, the Shire’s publication of the minutes was not in trade or commerce, secondly, Mr Nyoni had not proved that the eight representations were false and, thirdly, Mr Nyoni had failed to prove any loss or damage by the allegedly misleading or deceptive conduct.125    Mr Nyoni submitted that “[t]he leading authority on ‘in trade or commerce’ which has parallels with the current proceedings is Menhaden v Citibank NA (1984) 55 ALR 709” [1 FCR 542].  He argued that his Honour is bound to follow that case and Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575 to find that the publication of the minutes on the internet was “in trade and commerce” and that nothing in Nelson 169 CLR 594 was to the contrary.  He contended that this also followed because the Shire was a trading corporation.  Mr Nyoni submitted that the provisions of the Local Government Act could not exclude the application of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and that as a result, he argued, the publication of the minutes was in trade or commerce.126    Next, Mr Nyoni argued that his Honour erred in his assessment of the various witnesses when he found that Mr Nyoni had not discharged his onus to prove that each of the eight representations was false.  He submitted that the financial statements of the pharmacy business “were in many respects unreliable” because his accountant was being investigated on the basis of complaints that Mr Nyoni appears to have made against him.  Mr Nyoni also submitted that the pharmacy’s performance declined from 2007 as a result of actions of the Shire and that “the real loss and damage” was caused by all the matters that he raised in the appeal “such as the conspiracy between Robert Bateman and the Shire”.The minutes claim – consideration127    Mr Nyoni’s grounds of appeal relating to the minutes must be rejected.  The primary judge correctly held that the publication by the Shire of the minutes of the meeting of the Shire Council on 16 February 2010 was not conduct in trade or commerce.  Accordingly, s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and its analogue, s 10 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA), did not apply to that publication.128    The Shire had a statutory duty to publish the minutes of a meeting of the Shire Council held under s 5.22 of the Local Government Act.  Such meetings had to be open to the public, unless (which was not suggested to be the case here) the Council decided to close the meeting or part of it (s 5.23).  That Act provided for the regulations to provide for the Council to give public notice of the date and agenda for Council meetings and the circumstances and time in which notice papers and agenda relating to any council meeting were to be made available for inspection by members of the public (s 5.25(1)(g) and (j)).  Any person had a right to inspect any confirmed minutes of open council meetings, and any tabled notice papers and agenda relating to any council meeting (s 5.94(n), (p), 5.95(3), 5.96).  The Local Government (Administration) Regulations 1996 (WA) provided authority for the publication of the minutes of the meeting of 16 February 2010 and their contents relating to Mr Nyoni and the pharmacy in regs 11 and 14.129    The publication of the minutes of a meeting of a local government council is, like the publication of Hansard being a record of proceedings in a parliament, the communication of a record of the meeting of an elected statutory body of community representatives published for the purpose of making transparent and publicly available a record of that body’s official proceedings that had taken place in public.130    The meeting of the Shire Council was not in trade or commerce.  Rather, the meeting was governmental in character.  The minutes recorded what transpired at the meeting.  The Local Government Regulations required any notice papers and agenda relating to the meeting, that were tabled or produced at it, to be made available for inspection by the public.  The portion of the minutes, the publication of which Mr Nyoni complained, was a verbatim reproduction of an agenda item that itself had to be published under regs 11 and 14, a publication that again is incapable of being characterised as “in trade or commerce”.131    Neither publication of the minutes or the reproduced agenda item was made in trade or commerce:  Nelson 169 CLR at 604.  Here, the publication of the minutes was an integral aspect of the Local Government Act’s requirements for the Shire to do so as an aspect of the governmental role of the Shire Council.  The publication had no trading or commercial character.  The decision of Toohey J in Menhaden 1 FCR 542 does not assist Mr Nyoni’s argument.  The only justice in Nelson 169 CLR 594 who referred to that decision was Toohey J himself in his concurring judgment (169 CLR at 611).  Unlike the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, Toohey J propounded a test that conduct could not contravene s 52:unless it is conduct of a character which misleads or deceives or is likely to mislead or deceive persons in their capacity as consumers of goods and services. 132    Toohey J’s approach was not that endorsed by the majority of the High Court.  The primary judge correctly applied the test propounded by the majority in Nelson 169 CLR at 603-604.  Nor was the decision in Gutnick 210 CLR 575 of any relevance to this issue.  It did not concern the test to be applied in deciding whether or not conduct engaged in was “in trade or commerce”.  Accordingly, because the publication of the minutes did not occur in trade or commerce, Mr Nyoni’s grounds of appeal concerning the publication of the minutes cannot succeed.133    Moreover, none of Mr Nyoni’s arguments that challenged his Honour’s findings that he had not discharged his onus to prove the falsity of the eight representations or that he had suffered any loss or damage by their publication, identified any basis upon which an appellate court could interfere with those findings: Robinson Helicopter 331 ALR at 558-559 [43].  His Honour saw and heard many witnesses who gave evidence about the truth or falsity of the eight representations.  Once the primary judge had not been satisfied that any of the eight representations was false, Mr Nyoni’s claim also had to fail.134    Mr Nyoni’s submissions failed to establish any arguable error in the primary judge’s acceptance or rejection of evidence to support the findings that he made on the minutes claim.  His Honour based those findings on his assessment of disputed evidence by witnesses for the reasons that he gave.  His Honour’s reasons explained clearly why he found as he did.  Those findings, including the finding that Mr Nyoni had not proved any falsity of any representation or any loss or damage caused by the publication of the minutes, were open on the evidence.135    It follows that the minutes claim fails.Conclusion136    For the reasons we have given, the appeal must be allowed, in part, against his Honour’s dismissal of the proceedings against the Shire and Mr Friend and the orders for costs in its and his favour.   The assessment of damages on the misfeasance claim and any question of costs of the proceedings below as between Mr Nyoni, the Shire and Mr Friend should be remitted to the primary judge;  otherwise the appeal against Mr Peczka, Mr McDonnell and Mr Mitchell must be dismissed with costs.  The Shire and Mr Friend should pay 50% of Mr Nyoni’s costs, if any, of the appeal in respect of the grounds of appeal against the Shire and Mr Friend.I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-six (136) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justices North and Rares.Associate:Dated:    13 April 2017REASONS FOR JUDGMENTDOWSETT J:INTRODUCTION137    As North and Rares JJ have outlined the facts of the case, I need not do so in detail.  Although I otherwise agree with their Honours’ reasons, I disagree with the conclusion that the allegation of misfeasance in public office against Mr Friend has been proven.  My reasons for that conclusion are substantially the same as those of the primary Judge.  There are, however, a number of matters which I should address.THE PLEADING138    The pleading of Mr Nyoni’s case is in an unusual form.  The claim seems to be identified in a document headed “Draft Statement of Issues” in which, under the heading “Misfeasance in Public Office” the following paragraphs appear:16    Whether by the engaging in alleged acts in authorising and/or directing Mr Mitchell to disconnect the electricity supply of Mr Nyoni, Mr Friend and/or Mr McDonnell deliberately acted beyond power, with the intention of harming Mr Nyoni’s business.17    Whether the Shire or Mr Friend or Mr McDonnell engaged in the conduct pleaded at paragraph 55 of the April statement of claim; and if so, whether the Shire is thereby liable for the conduct of Mr Friend or Mr McDonnell.18    Whether Mr Nyoni suffered loss and damage by reason of their conduct, and if so the quantum of the loss.  Whether aggravated and/or exemplary damages are payable.139    The reference to para 55 of the “April statement of claim” is to an earlier statement of claim or draft statement of claim in which para 55 was as follows:55.    Following the disconnection of electricity as pleaded in paragraph 50 above, the Shire, or alternatively, Mr Friend, and or Mr McDonnell:55.1.    Immediately caused both the Pharmaceutical Council of Western Australia and the Western Australian Department of Health to be informed, by telephone, facsimile transmission, email transmission, or by letter posted that the Pharmacy had lost its electricity on 14 October 2010.55.2.    Caused the Western Australian Department of Health to be informed that Western Power had requested the electricity to be disconnected , which was not true; and55.3.    Did not inform the Pharmaceutical Council of Western Australia, nor the Western Australian Department of Health either, that the disconnection of the electricity was not the Applicant's fault (as was the case), nor that the Shire, Mr Friend and or Mr McDonnell had caused the electricity to be disconnected (as was the case).140    Paragraph 50 relates to conduct which occurred on 15 March 2010 when the electricity supply to Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy was disconnected.  However it is clear that at the trial, the claim of misfeasance in public office concerned the disconnection of such supply on 14 October 2010.  See the reasons at [19] and [351] and ground 7 in the notice of appeal.  In the notice of appeal the cause of action seems to have been conflated with a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct.141    In any event, the relevant conduct for present purposes is set out in the primary Judge’s reasons at [357]-[359] as follows:357    However, I have already found that on 14 October 2010, Mr Friend wrote and sent the email to Mr Bateman and Mr van Bronswijk advising them of the impending disconnection of the electricity to the pharmacy.  I have also found that Mr Friend procured the production and dispatch of the letter signed by Mr Mitchell later on 14 October 2010.358    I have also found that Mr Friend’s intention in communicating with these authorities was to harm Mr Nyoni by causing the authorities to take action against Mr Nyoni as a consequence of the disconnection of the electricity.  (See, [314] above.)359    The question, therefore, is whether this conduct by Mr Friend constitutes the tort of misfeasance in public office.THE HISTORY142    The evidence demonstrates that for some years prior to 14 October 2010, the Kellerberrin Shire Council (the “Shire Council”), and/or persons associated with it had been dissatisfied with the way in which Mr Nyoni was conducting his pharmacy, the only pharmacy in the relevant area.  There had been attempts to remove him from practice in the area and/or to induce another pharmacist to set up business there.  Both the Pharmacy Board and the State Health Department had been drawn into the campaign against Mr Nyoni.  The Pharmacy Board was a statutory body, responsible for administering Western Australian legislation concerning the practice of pharmacy.  For present purposes, the relevant officer of the Pharmacy Board was Mr van Bronswijk a “pharmacist field officer”.  The Health Department’s involvement seems to have been primarily in connection with the statutory control of the distribution of poisons.  A Mr Bateman was the officer of the Department who was relevantly involved for present purposes.  Prior to 14 October 2010, the electricity supply to the pharmacy premises had been cut off for non-payment of a bill.  That event was presumably the result of action by the electricity supplier.  However it caused concerns about Mr Nyoni’s capacity to continue as a pharmacist in the area.EVENTS ON 14-15 OCTOBER 2010143    On 14 October 2010, Mr Mitchell was, as he understood it, instructed by a Mr Varney to disconnect the electricity supply to Mr Nyoni’s properties.  Mr Mitchell was an electrical contractor.  Mr Varney owned a company which provided services to the electricity supplier.  Mr Mitchell understood that he had been directed to disconnect the electricity supply to both Mr Nyoni’s home and to the pharmacy.  Before carrying out his instructions, Mr Mitchell spoke to Mr Friend, the chief executive officer of the Shire Council.  It seems that Mr Friend had previously been involved in the campaign against Mr Nyoni.  Mr Mitchell told him that he had been instructed to disconnect the electricity supply to the pharmacy.  As a result, at 3.31pm Mr Friend sent the following email to Mr van Bronswijk and Mr Bateman:Tim/Robert I have been advised by Peter Mitchell, the local electrician, that he is cutting the power at both the pharmacy and Nyoni residence on Bedford Street this afternoon.  I assume I will see you both tomorrow?144    His Honour observed at [288]-[290]:288    Mr Friend said in evidence that the reason he contacted Mr van Bronswijk and Mr Bateman was that in April 2010, he and Mr Tucker had met with Mr van Bronswijk and Mr Bateman when they came to inspect the pharmacy and that they had told him at that meeting, that if there were any issues in relation to the pharmacy, they should be contacted immediately.289    At 4:04 pm on 14 October, Mr van Bronswijk replied to Mr Friend in the following terms:Please arrange to have the electrician confirm to me in writing on his letterhead (electronically or by facsimile) that he has carried out disconnection of the power supply to both premises once he has done so.290    Mr van Bronswijk said, in cross-examination, that on receiving the email from Mr Friend advising him of the imminent disconnection of the electricity to Mr Nyoni’s pharmacy and house on 14 October 2010, that he sought confirmation of the disconnection for the purposes of pursuing disciplinary action against Mr Nyoni.  I accept that evidence.145    At about 3.00pm Mr Mitchell disconnected the electricity supply to Mr Nyoni’s home.  He then went to the pharmacy.  After a heated exchange with Mrs Nyoni, he disconnected the supply to the pharmacy.  He then went to the Shire Council’s premises and again spoke to Mr Friend.  At about that time, or perhaps a little later, he signed a letter which had been prepared by somebody else, probably somebody working for the Shire Council.  It was sent from the Shire Council’s premises to Mr van Bronswijk.  The letter read as follows:To Whom It May ConcernRe disconnection of power to both sites owned by Chemist one being house and other being owner’s business.Meter number for house is…disconnected at 3.01 pm on 14 OctoberMeter number for chemist shop is…disconnected at 3.32 pm on 14 OctoberPlease note this is not the first time this has occurred on the same premises.146    At [283] his Honour said:Mr Mitchell said that he then drove home and once he was at home he telephoned Mr Varney to give him the meter numbers and the meter readings.  Mr Mitchell said that he could not remember the exact time but he thought it was between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm.  Mr Mitchell said that he then reported to Mr Varney that he had disconnected the electricity to the pharmacy and Mr Nyoni’s house, and he gave Mr Varney the meter readings for both locations.  Mr Mitchell said that Mr Varney then said words to the effect:  “Oh did you do both?” and he said words to the effect: “Yes.  That’s what you told me to do this morning.”  According to Mr Mitchell, Mr Varney then said words to the effect:  “Oh look sorry I have made a mistake.  It was only his house that needed doing.  Can you go and put the pharmacy back on?”147    At [293]-[298] his Honour said:293    The electricity to the pharmacy was reconnected by Mr Mitchell at around 9:45 am on 15 October 2010.294    By email sent at 10:58 am on 15 October 2010, Mr Friend advised Mr van Bronswijk that the electricity to the pharmacy had been switched back on.  Mr van Bronswijk gave evidence that neither Mr Friend nor anybody else had advised him that the electricity had been switched off through no fault of Mr Nyoni.  I find this to be the fact.295    Mr van Bronswijk emailed Mr Friend on 15 October 2010 saying:Thanks for letting us know, we have taken legal advice on the matter and will be writing to Mr Nyoni today regarding this issue.Given that the issue has been rectified, and the Council ceases to exist at 5.00 pm today, there is little else we can legitimately do at this point in time…296    Mr van Bronswijk was left with the impression that Mr Nyoni was to blame for the disconnection of the electricity.  On 15 October 2010, the registrar of the Pharmaceutical Council wrote a letter to Mr Nyoni stating:On 14 October 2010 the Council was advised by a licenced electrical contractor that at 3.32 pm on 14 October he disconnected the electricity supply to Kellerberrin pharmacy.Council was subsequently advised that the electricity supply to the pharmacy was reconnected at around 10.00 am this morning.This Council regards the continuous supply of electricity to registered pharmacy premises as essential to the provision of a professional pharmacy service.  It is concerned that interruption of electricity supply to any pharmacy may render the provision of a safe and timely pharmacy service difficult.I suggest you take steps to ensure that this episode is not repeated in the future.297    On 19 October 2010, Dr Robertson of the Health Department wrote the following letter to Mr Nyoni:I am writing to you as the Licence Holder for Kellerberrin Pharmacy (Pharmaceutical Chemist Licence 1983, issued under the Poisons Act 1964).The Department has been advised that the electrical power to Kellerberrin Pharmacy was disconnected, at the request of Western Power, at 3.32 pm on 14 October 2010.  I understand the power was reconnected at approximately 10 am on 15 October 2010.  I am aware that the electrical power was similarly disconnected from Kellerberrin Pharmacy between 15 March 2010 and 17 March 2010.Obviously power outages do occur at times as a result of natural disasters.  However, this does not appear to be the case in the instances described above.I am very concerned that continued disconnection of electrical power from Kellerberrin Pharmacy makes it very difficult for scheduled medicines to be stored at the correct temperature, especially over the summer months and particularly if the pharmacy stocks medicines which require refrigeration.  Should you choose to operate the pharmacy while the power is off, the risk of non-compliance with the labelling and recording requirements for Schedule 4 and Schedule 8 medicines, as specified in the Poisons Regulations 1965, is also likely to be increased unless you have a back-up power supply for operation of your dispensing computer system.Section 24 of the Poisons Act 1964 requires the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to be satisfied that the premises of the applicant is suitable for the purpose for which the application is made and is properly and hygienically equipped for that purpose, before the CEO issues a licence under the Act.  Regular and prolonged disconnection of electrical power could be considered to render the premises unsuitable for use as a pharmacy.  This letter is to advise you that, should another power disconnection occur under similar circumstances, consideration will be given to suspending your Pharmaceutical Chemist Licence for Kellerberrin Pharmacy.298    I infer from the contents of this letter that the Health Department had prior to Dr Robertson writing the letter, also been sent the confirmation letter of 14 October signed by Mr Mitchell.  I also infer that neither Dr Robertson nor anybody else at the Health Department, had been advised that the disconnection of the electricity to the pharmacy had not been attributable to any fault on the part of Mr Nyoni.148    At [314] his Honour concluded:I find that Mr Friend’s intention in sending the email to Mr Bateman and Mr van Bronswijk advising of the impending disconnection of the electricity to the pharmacy, and in procuring the production and dispatch to Mr van Bronswijk of the letter of confirmation signed by Mr Mitchell, was to persuade the Pharmaceutical Council to consider taking disciplinary action against Mr Nyoni.  The same is true in relation to the dispatch of the letter of confirmation to the Health Department.  This action was part of a continuing campaign by Mr Friend and the Shire to persuade the various bodies which regulated the practice of a pharmacist, either to withhold benefits from, or impose sanctions against, Mr Nyoni so that Mr Nyoni would cease operating the Kellerberrin pharmacy and would be replaced by another pharmacist.  That this was Mr Friend’s and the Shire Council’s objective from, at the latest, early January 2010, is obvious from the activities engaged in by Mr Friend and the Shire which are described in [90] to [137] above.  The closing submissions of the second, third and fourth respondents, correctly acknowledge this to be the case.149    As far as I can see, there is no evidence as to Mr Varney’s reason for ordering disconnection of the electricity supply to either Mr Nyoni’s home or to the pharmacy (if he in fact did so).  Nor is there any evidence that Mr Friend or Mr Mitchell had any view as to why the electricity was to be disconnected at either site.  Perhaps they inferred that a bill had not been paid.  His Honour seems to have concluded that although Mr Friend’s correspondence with Mr van Bronswijk, Mr Bateman and the Health Department did not say so, it led the recipients to infer as much.  Any such inference may have been prompted by the fact that on a previous occasion, disconnection had been prompted by non-payment of a bill.  It may also be that his Honour considered that most people would consider that the likely cause of any unexplained disconnection would be non-payment.MISFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE150    In this country, the authoritative statement of the law concerning the tort of misfeasance in public office is to be found in the decision of the majority of the High Court (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) in Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307.  At 345, their Honours said:It was recognised as recently as 1973 that the precise limits of the tort of misfeasance in public office were then undefined.  In important respects, that is still true.  However, the weight of authority here and in the United Kingdom is clearly to the effect that it is a deliberate tort in the sense that there is no liability unless either there is an intention to cause harm or the officer concerned knowingly acts in excess of his or her power.151    After expressing doubts about possible extensions of the circumstances which might constitute the tort, their Honours discussed aspects of the second form of the tort, that is acting with knowledge that the relevant actions were in excess of power.  I am not entirely sure as to whether the present case is based upon the performance of duties with malice or knowing excess of power.  The latter basis was pleaded, but the primary Judge seems to have treated the case as being based upon the former.  This appeal has been conducted on the same basis.  The primary Judge dismissed the claim upon the basis that the alleged misconduct did not occur in the exercise of powers attaching to a public office.  That finding, if correct, would dispose of both forms of the tort.  As I understand the passage from Mengel cited above, their Honours identified two situations which might constitute misfeasance in public office: the exercise of power with malice, and conduct knowingly performed in excess of power.  There may, however, be room for debate about the meaning of the term “power” in that passage and in the primary Judge’s reasons.152    I should mention a number of other cases.  In Emanuele v Hedley and Others (1998) 179 FCR 290 at 300-301, the Full Court held that merely reporting a conversation to a superior cannot generally found an action for misfeasance in public office.  The Court endorsed the following observation by the primary Judge in that matter:However, the prosecution of Emanuele did not follow and was not the consequence of any power given to Hedley to act so as to report that conversation.  He did not purport, for example, to declare Emanuele an ineligible tenderer by reference to some supposed head of executive or legislative power in reliance on that conversation.  Nor is that alleged.  He simply made an allegation to his superior which, if true, might have indicated a criminal intent on Emanuele's part and led to the exclusion of him and his companies from the tender process.  That might have been defamation or injurious falsehood.  However, as it did not lead to the exercise by him of any legislative or executive power, it is not malfeasance in public office on his part.153    There has been no challenge to the correctness of this proposition.154    The Full Court also accepted as correct the following proposition which appears in the reasons of Slade LJ in Jones v Swansea City Council [1990] 1 WLR 54 at 71:The essence of the tort, as I understand it, is that someone holding public office has misconducted himself by purporting to exercise powers which were conferred on him not for his personal advantage but for the benefit of the public or a section of the public, either with intent to injure another or in the knowledge that he was acting ultra vires.  All powers possessed by a local authority, whether conferred by statute or by contract are possessed `solely in order that it may use them for the public good:' see Wade, Administrative Law, 6th ed. (1988), p. 400.  In the present context, in my judgment, it is not the juridical nature of the relevant power but the nature of the council's office which is the important consideration.155    In Jones, the relevant power was the council’s power to pass a resolution concerning the proposed use of a particular site, owned by the council and leased to Jones.  Such consent was required from the council as owner, and not in exercise of any power under a town planning scheme or other local government responsibility.  The power was nonetheless exercised by the council in its public capacity.156    The decision in Jones was handed down in the Court of Appeal on 3 March 1989.  On 16 March 1989, the House of Lords published its reasons in Calveley v Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police [1989] 1AC 1228.  The case involved an allegation that a police officer in investigating alleged corruption by another officer, in the course of the investigation, had made malicious and misleading reports to a superior officer.  Lord Bridge of Harwich said at 1240-1241, (the other four members of the House concurring):I do not regard this as an occasion where it is necessary to explore, still less to attempt to define, the precise limits of the tort of misfeasance in public office.  It suffices for present purposes to say that it must at least involve an act done in the exercise or purported exercise by the public officer of some power or authority with which he is clothed by virtue of the office he holds and which is done in bad faith or (possibly) without reasonable cause.  The decision to suspend the plaintiff Park under regulation 24 was taken by the deputy Chief Constable.  If this had been done maliciously in the sense indicated, this would certainly be capable of constituting the tort of misfeasance in public office.  But it was conceded that no malice is alleged against the deputy Chief Constable and that malice on the part of Grant cannot be imputed to him.  The pleaded case must therefore stand or fall according as to whether it identifies any act done by Grant in the exercise or purported exercise of a power or authority vested in him as investigating officer which was infected by the malice pleaded against him.  I can find no such act identified by the pleading.  No formal application to amend the pleading was made in the course of the argument, but at a late stage a document was placed before your Lordships indicating a pleading of additional particulars under paragraphs 22 and 24 which the plaintiff might seek leave to add by way of amendment if those two paragraphs in the statement of claim were allowed to stand.  The particulars which it is suggested might be added under paragraph 24 would read:""From an early stage (the date whereof the plaintiff cannot further particularise until after discovery and/or interrogatories herein) Grant knew or believed that there were no proper grounds for suspending the plaintiff yet procured the imposition of and/or the continuation of the suspension by continuing the investigation and giving misleading and/or incomplete reports concerning the same.""It is evident that if a police officer investigating suspected criminal or disciplinary offences makes a false report to his superior officer which is defamatory of the suspect and that report is made maliciously so as to lose its status of qualified privilege, the suspect has a cause of action in tort against the author of the report.  But the tort is defamation not misfeasance in public office, since the mere making of a report is not a relevant exercise of power or authority by the investigating officer.157    In Garrett v Attorney-General [1997] 2 NZLR 332 at 349, Blanchard J, on behalf of the Court said, concerning the tort of abuse of process:The tort has at its base conscious disregard for the interests of those who will be affected by official decision making.  There must be an actual or, in the case of recklessness, presumed intent to transgress the limits of power even though it will follow that a person or persons  will  be likely  to be harmed.158    In Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2AC 1 at 191, Lord Steyn identified the ingredients of the tort of misfeasance in public office as:    the defendant must be a public officer;    he or she must exercise power as a public officer; and    he or she must either specifically intend to injure a person or persons; or knowing that he or she has no power, do an act which will probably injure the relevant plaintiff.159    In Odhavji Estate v Woodhouse [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263 Iacobucci J said on behalf of the Court at [22]-[23]:22    What then are the essential ingredients of the tort, at least insofar as it is necessary to determine the issues that arise on the pleadings in this case?  In Three Rivers, the House of Lords held that the tort of misfeasance in a public office can arise in one of two ways, what I shall call Category A and Category B.  Category A involves conduct that is specifically intended to injure a person or class of persons.  Category B involves a public officer who acts with knowledge both that she or he has no power to do the act complained of and that the act is likely to injure the plaintiff.  This understanding of the tort has been endorsed by a number of Canadian courts: see for example Powder Mountain Resorts, supra; Alberta (Minister of Public Works, Supply and Services) (C.A.), supra; and Granite Power Corp. v. Ontario, [2002] O.J. No. 2188 (QL) (S.C.J.).  It is important, however, to recall that the two categories merely represent two different ways in which a public officer can commit the tort; in each instance, the plaintiff must prove each of the tort’s constituent elements.  It is thus necessary to consider the elements that are common to each form of the tort.  23    In my view, there are two such elements.  First, the public officer must have engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct in his or her capacity as a public officer.  Second, the public officer must have been aware both that his or her conduct was unlawful and that it was likely to harm the plaintiff.  What distinguishes one form of misfeasance in a public office from the other is the manner in which the plaintiff proves each ingredient of the tort.  In Category B, the plaintiff must prove the two ingredients of the tort independently of one another.  In Category A, the fact that the public officer has acted for the express purpose of harming the plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy each ingredient of the tort, owing to the fact that a public officer does not have the authority to exercise his or her powers for an improper purpose, such as deliberately harming a member of the public.  In each instance, the tort involves deliberate disregard of official duty coupled with knowledge that the misconduct is likely to injure the plaintiff.160    It is difficult to see why the formula “conduct in his or her capacity as a public officer”, should be substituted for the words, “exercise of power”, used in Mengel; “the exercise ... of any legislative or executive power”, as in Emanuele; “purporting to exercise powers which were conferred on him ... for the benefit of the public”, as in Jones; “a relevant exercise of power or authority”, as in Calveley; or “exercise of power as a public officer”, as in Three Rivers.  Whilst it may be accepted that the power need not be a statutory power or a prerogative power, it does not follow that any action by a public officer-holder which causes harm to another may, without more, constitute misfeasance in public office.  There must be some connection between the discharge of his or her official responsibilities and the conduct in question.  A public officer-holder will generally discharge his or her function by dealing with other public officers and/or with members of the public.  Not everything that he or she does will be done in discharge of such functions.  There might be quite minor conduct, such as offering a member of the public a cup of tea, which is clearly not part of the public officer’s functions.  Such actions may be performed out of politeness or kindness.  There may be more significant conduct which is, nonetheless, not part of the discharge of his or her functions.  Providing information about a matter not directly related to such functions may be an example.  Agreeing to enquire of another officer, about an unrelated matter, might be another.  Offering to ascertain the policy of another government agency might be yet another.  161    The decisions in Emanuele and Calveley demonstrate that public officers may take other actions, much more closely involved with their public functions, which actions will, nonetheless, not be in performance of public duty for the purposes of the tort of misfeasance in public office.  Both cases seem to have addressed the effect, or absence of effect of the conduct upon the relevant complainant.  Where the conduct in question did not, itself, result in such effect, it was not conduct in public office, even if the possible effect of the conduct was that somebody else might take action with an adverse effect upon the complainant.162    The use of the term “power or authority” in Calveley, and the statement in Garrett that (the tort of misfeasance in public office) has at its base conscious disregard for the interests of “those who will be affected by official decision making”, assist in determining the meaning of the word “power” in the cases to which I have referred.  The definition of that word in the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed) discloses two relevant meanings.  They are:Ability to do or effect something or anything, or to act upon a person or thing; andAuthority, given or committed; hence, sometimes, liberty or permission to act.  163    The first definition reflects the view in Garrett that the tort is concerned with effects on people.  The second focusses on authority, a word used in Calveley.  In my view, the word “power” is used in the cases to describe the capacity of a public office-holder to act in such a way as to produce an effect on another’s rights or interests.  I accept that the power need not be expressly conferred by statute.  I accept that there will be cases in which the “misfeasance” is a failure to act.  However the party alleging misfeasance in public office must prove that the relevant conduct was “in public office”.  In the usual course, the matter would be addressed in the pleading.  It would not necessarily be enough to say that X was a public officer, and that he or she acted with malice towards the relevant party.  It would generally be necessary that the relevant party plead the facts which demonstrated that the conduct occurred in public office.  That enquiry might involve an examination of the functions of the agency in which the public officer works, and the duties assigned to him or her within that agency.164    The difficulty in the present case is identification of the basis upon which it is said that Mr Friend’s conduct occurred in the performance of his function as chief executive officer of the Shire Council.  It was not demonstrated that it was any part of the Shire Council’s function to safeguard the availability of pharmaceutical services in the area in question.  The responsibility for that function clearly lay with the Pharmacy Board and perhaps, the Health Department.  Nor was it demonstrated that any such function was part of Mr Friend’s function as chief executive officer.  General statements as to functions and powers of a local authority are hardly likely to justify its interference in matters which are the responsibility of the state government and its agencies.165    No doubt it will be politically convenient, from time to time, for a local authority to use established lines of communication with other levels of government, to convey concerns about particular matters, whether such concerns are held by the authority itself, or by its voters.  It was in this context that the primary Judge concluded that the relevant conduct did not occur in the exercise of power or functions attaching to Mr Friend’s public office or to that of the Shire Council.  There may well have been good political reasons for the Shire Council to deal with the perceived problem.  It may be that other government agencies would be more likely to listen to the complaints of a local authority, or its chief executive officer than to a private citizen.  However the relevant conduct was no more performed in public office than was the preparation of a report in Calveley or the reporting of a conversation in Emanuele.  Further, it was not conduct which could adversely affect anybody.  Only conduct by officers of other agencies could have had that effect.166    The appeal should be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding thirty (30) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.Associate:  Dated:    13 April 2017SCHEDULE OF PARTIESWAD 734 of 2015RespondentsFourth Respondent:Frank PeczkaFifth Respondent:Peter Mitchell",2017-04-13 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia
4276182,R v Macdonald; R v Maitland [2015] NSWSC 1704,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: This is an application by John William Maitland to be tried separately from his co-accused, Ian Michael Macdonald.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald is charged with two counts of misconduct in public office. Mr Maitland is charged, in the same indictment, with two counts of aiding and abetting the alleged offences of misconduct in public office said to have been committed by Mr Macdonald. The charges concern the grant of consent to Doyles Creek Mining Limited to apply for an exploration licence under the Mining Act 1992, and then the grant of the exploration licence itself. The grants were allegedly made by Mr Macdonald in his capacity as Minister for Mineral Resources.
	
	
	Each Accused has pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him. A joint trial is listed to proceed in this Court commencing on 14 March 2016.
	


The Present Application


	
	In support of the application for separate trials, the affidavit of Robert Leslie Whyburn sworn 4 September 2015 was read on behalf of Mr Maitland.
	
	
	Mr Massey, counsel for Mr Maitland, has acknowledged that there are strong reasons of principle and public policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly should be tried together. Mr Massey accepted that Mr Maitland bears the onus of demonstrating that an order for separate trials should be made. He submitted that the material attached to the affidavit of Mr Whyburn indicating media publicity critical of Mr Macdonald was such that, if Mr Maitland was tried with him, there would be a positive injustice caused to Mr Maitland.
	
	
	Mr Massey contended that the publicity with respect to the proceedings was likely to increase at the time of trial. He submitted that an order for separate trials should be made.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the order, pointing to the strong starting position that there should ordinarily be a joint trial of persons charged as alleged co-offenders.
	
	
	The Crown noted that the media publicity concerning Mr Macdonald occurred in a period between July 2009 and November 2013, when Mr Macdonald was involved in inquiries before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (“ICAC”). The Crown pointed to the substantial time gap between November 2013 and the scheduled trial date in March 2016.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that there are mechanisms available, in the context of a criminal trial, to reduce the prospect of exposure to past media publicity.
	
	
	In any event, the Crown submitted that an application of this type should not be approached upon the basis that potential jurors would be likely to succumb to past media publicity by way of influencing the determination of any jury.
	


Decision


	
	The principles to be applied on a separate trial application under s.21 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 are well settled. There are strong reasons of principle and public policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly should be tried together: Webb and Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 at 88-89. These public interest concerns include conserving costs, avoiding inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts: Symss v R [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [68]. The third concern is particularly important where one accused may try to cast blame on the other accused: Webb and Hay v The Queen at 88-89.
	
	
	Mr Maitland bears the onus of establishing the reasons for the making of an order granting a separate trial: R v Bikic [2000] NSWCCA 106; 112 A Crim R 300 at 305 [21]. To succeed, the applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk that a positive injustice would be caused to him as a consequence of a joint trial: R v CE [2005] NSWCCA 326 at [4].
	
	
	In R v CE, Grove J (Hall J and Smart AJ agreeing) continued at [5], citing the well-known statement of Hunt J in R v Middis (unreported, 27 March 1991, BC9102181):
	


“It is inevitable that an application must be considered prospectively. In R v Middis NSWSC, unreported 27 March 1991, Hunt J observed: 

‘I do not believe that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Oliver intended an applicant for a separate trial to demonstrate that positive injustice would more likely than not be caused by a joint trial (as it was suggested in argument); nor do I accept that a mere possibility of prejudice is sufficient (as it was also suggested in argument). In my view, what the Court of Criminal Appeal was saying was that as some prejudice to one or other accused is inevitable in any joint trial, it must be shown by an applicant for a separate trial that the particular prejudice upon which reliance is placed by him would - if it arises - result in positive injustice to him in a joint trial’.”


	
	The single basis advanced in support of this separate trial application is the suggested prejudice that may flow, in a derivative fashion, to Mr Maitland as a result of adverse media publicity concerning Mr Macdonald some years ago.
	
	
	There is no closed category of circumstances which may give rise to an order for separate trials. Exercise of the relevant discretion may be considered, in an appropriate case, where the basis of the application is adverse media publicity concerning a co-accused. However, what is required is an assessment, in the particular case, of the nature and strength of the evidence of publicity, and its proximity to the trial.

	The date range of these 18 articles is from 15 July 2009 to 12 November 2013, with the majority (13) published between 2011 and 2013. The articles relate to Mr Macdonald’s alleged corrupt conduct and matters which were the subject of investigation by the ICAC.
	
	
	From time to time, this Court considers the suggested impact of media publicity in the context of an application for trial by Judge alone under s.132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Statements made in judgments of that type concerning the robust nature of jurors and the jury system have application, as well, in the context of this application.
	
	
	In R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258, Spigelman CJ emphasised at 261 [17] that the Courts “have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice”. The Chief Justice observed, as well, in R v Jamal at 262 [21] that the “perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their oaths and comply with a trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years”.
	
	
	It has been emphasised that the risk of jurors conducting internet searches for previously published material is mitigated by s.68C of the Jury Act 1977 and standard judicial directions: R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357 at [67]-[69], [79].
	
	
	The Courts have recognised, as well, that the lapse of time between media publicity and the trial itself is a significant factor: Montgomery v HM Advocate [2003] 1 AC 641 at 673; R v McNeil at [66], [75].
	
	
	There was a period of fairly regular adverse media publicity with respect to Mr Macdonald, in particular, in the period 2011 to 2013. It may be noted that Mr Maitland is mentioned once only (and in passing) in one article (Annexure Q to the Whyburn affidavit, referred to above at [16](o)).
	
	
	Further, and importantly, the last article complained of appeared on 12 November 2013, some two years and four months before the scheduled trial date. The passage of time is a significant factor in assessing the possible impact of adverse media publicity.
	
	
	It should be noted, as the Crown submits, that there has been no publicity in more recent times of the type relied upon in support of this application.
	
	
	Insofar as counsel for Mr Maitland submitted that there was a prospect of publicity emerging between now and the time scheduled for the trial, it is appropriate to have regard to the different context existing now as compared with that up to 2013, when Mr Macdonald was before the ICAC. The media will be well aware of the law of contempt of court, and its capacity to apply with respect to adverse publicity concerning accused persons in the period preceding and during a criminal trial: R v McNeil at [73]. Considerations of this type did not apply at the time of the investigatory processes of the ICAC with respect to Mr Macdonald. I note the Crown submission (which is correct) that should publicity arise concerning the forthcoming trial, there are other mechanisms available to the Court.
	
	
	With respect to the risk of jurors accessing adverse material on the internet, the provisions contained in s.68C Jury Act 1977 and expected judicial directions from the trial Judge are fundamentally important aspects to be taken into account on this application.
	
	
	Mr Maitland has not demonstrated that there is a real (as opposed to a theoretical) possibility that the past media reporting concerning Mr Macdonald will cause prejudice at a joint trial of the kind that would result in positive injustice to him.
	


Conclusion


	
	Mr Maitland has not made good his application for a separate trial. I make the following orders:
	



	
	I decline the application by John William Maitland to be tried separately from Ian Michael Macdonald;
	
	
	Mr Maitland’s Notice of Motion filed 7 September 2015 is dismissed.

4276209,R v Brooks [2017] NSWSC 188,"Judgment


	
	Bradley Brooks is charged with the murder of Gregory Gibbins (count 1) and with wounding Adam Swindell with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (count 2). The incident giving rise to those allegations occurred shortly after midnight on 6 April 2015 outside or near the Beachcomber Hotel in Main Road Toukley. The prosecution case is that Bradley Brooks stabbed Gregory Gibbins in the chest and that, a very short time later, he and his brother (Joel Brooks) each inflicted a stab wound on Adam Swindell. Joel Brooks was a co-accused in the present proceedings but the Director of Public Prosecutions elected to conduct the trial separately and Joel Brooks and his trial have been remitted to the District Court.
	
	
	Before a jury was empanelled counsel for the accused raised a number of objections to evidence that the prosecution seeks to adduce. He also sought an advance ruling as to whether the prosecution would be entitled to lead particular evidence if he introduced evidence of an incident that occurred on 27 February 2015 when he was the victim of an assault at the Beachcomber Hotel.
	


THE OBJECTIONS


	
	The accused tendered a folder of material on the voir dire that contained the evidence to which objection was taken. [1]  This included an index enumerating 18 witnesses or items of evidence to which his objections related. Following discussion between the parties, the Crown agreed not to lead nine of those items of evidence [2] . The controversy surrounding a tenth item of evidence [3]  evaporated when the accused withdrew his objection. Adopting the numbers in the index to the material provided by the accused, the outstanding objections relate to the following pieces of evidence:
	


8. Various parts of the evidence of Madison Valentine [4] .

9. Two parts of the evidence of Christopher Hughes.

10. Certain items of evidence to be tendered through a police officer, Detective Senior Constable Bagnall. I understand that these are, essentially, Items 11-18. Subject to ruling as to items 11, 12, 16, 17 and 18, I understand the parties will agree on the form and substance of the evidence to be led from the police officer.

11. An electronically recorded interview with the accused (“the ERISP”).

12. Six CCTV images showing the accused and his friends and family leaving the Beachcomber Hotel shortly before midnight on 5 April 2015.

16. A telephone intercept of 11 February 2016 between Bradley and his father, Corry Brooks.

17. Eight forensic procedure photographs of Bradley Brooks.

18. Forty seven photographs of items seized during a search of premises associated with the accused.


	
	In relation to these objections, there are two overarching legal issues. One issue is whether the Crown can rely on evidence of post offence conduct to establish a consciousness of guilt in the accused where a possible explanation for that conduct is that the accused was attempting to distance himself from the incident, rather than demonstrating a consciousness of guilt to the specific crimes charged in the indictment. The other overarching legal issue concerns the extent to which the making of formal admissions creates a bar to the prosecution from adducing evidence going to prove matters no longer subject of dispute. Each of those issues, which intersect in the circumstances of the present case, engages the question and definition of relevance in sections 55 and 56 of the Evidence Act as well as an assessment of the probative value of the evidence.
	
	
	Neither issue is free of controversy. Each has led to somewhat inconsistent statements of principle from the higher courts although the application of those principles is ultimately a matter to be determined based on the individual circumstances of any particular trial. In other words, the true or live issues in the trial must be identified and an assessment made as to extent to which the formal admissions alleviate the necessity to prove particular matters, including proof by leading evidence of the post-offence conduct. A determination must be made as to whether the admissions essentially create a bar to the prosecution adducing the evidence, and whether allowing the Crown to lead particular items of evidence might create unfairness or result in an undue waste of time. It is also necessary to decide whether post offence conduct such as the telling of lies, disposing of weapons and washing clothing worn during the incident is capable of rationally affecting an assessment of the live issues in the trial; that is, is it relevant? If it is relevant, as assessment must be made of the extent to which such conduct could rationally affect the assessment of those issues by demonstrating a consciousness of guilt in circumstances where there may be another explanation for such conduct, namely a consciousness of guilt arising from an offence less serious than homicide or merely an attempt simply to distance oneself from the incident giving rise to the charges.
	
	
	Returning to the evidence to which objection is taken, the learned Crown Prosecutor (without demur from counsel for the accused), placed the objections into five categories. First, there are three objections to the evidence to be led through Madison Valentine. These relate to (i) the purchase of the knife used in the stabbing, (ii) alleged admissions that Bradley Brooks told her (or indicated by pointing) that he stabbed the victim or victims in the arms or chest and (iii) two telephone intercepts recorded on 3 and 22 of October 2015 in which she and the accused discussed the possibility of Mr Brooks pleading guilty and (iv) evidence that between the time of the incident and the time of his arrest, she and the accused discussed the fact that Mr Gibbins (by inference) had died. Second, there is an objection to the evidence of Christopher Hughes to the effect that when he saw the accused he was not wearing a shirt and also his opinion as to the state of mind of the accused and his brother. Third, there is an objection to the whole of the ERISP in which Mr Brooks gave a false account. Fourth, there is an objection to a telephone intercept between the accused and his father on 11 February 2016 in which there was a discussion of the state of the police evidence and specifically reference to the absence of DNA evidence inculpating Mr Brooks. Fifth, there is objection to CCTV stills and a number of photographs taken by police during a forensic procedure and after a search of the accused’s premises.
	


THE ADVANCE RULING [5] 


	
	The advance ruling concerns the details of an incident that occurred on 27 February 2015. It appears to be common ground that Mr Brooks was assaulted on that date and suffered injury. The accused seeks to elicit evidence from three witnesses establishing the facts of the incident and its impact on him. He submits that it is relevant to his reaction to events on 5-6 April 2015 and to the issue of self-defence. I understand that the Crown does not object to that evidence, but seeks to adduce evidence from a security guard who spoke to the accused on the night. The security guard asserts that the accused said, with reference to his assailant, “I’m going to stab that cunt” and “I’m going to stab the cunt, I know where he lives. I’m going to stab him.”
	
	
	The accused objects to this and seeks an advance ruling to enable him to make an informed decision as to whether to adduce the evidence of the earlier assault.
	


THE PROSECUTION CASE


	
	The prosecution tendered an Outline of the Crown Case on the voir dire. [6]  It is unnecessary to set out the detail contained in that document. In short, the prosecution alleges that the accused and his brother attended a music festival at the Beachcomber Hotel in Toukley on the afternoon and evening of 5 April 2015. They were in a group of friends and relatives. Gregory Gibbins and Adam Swindell also attended the festival. The Hotel closed at midnight and a large crowd gathered outside the hotel and a nearby pizza shop. A dispute arose between the Brooks’ group and a young woman who sought assistance from Mr Gibbins. Mr Swindell pushed Joel Brooks who moved backwards. Mr Gibbins was standing next to Mr Swindell. The accused pulled a knife from his pants and stabbed Mr Gibbins in the chest. Mr Swindell ran. Joel Brooks and the accused pursued Mr Swindell and stabbed him in the arm and chest.
	
	
	The accused and his brother fled the scene. Mr Gibbins stumbled and fell onto the roadway. He was unresponsive to treatment at the scene by bystanders and paramedics. He was pronounced dead a Gosford Hospital at 1:05am. Post mortem examination established that he died from a single stab wound to the chest that penetrated his chest plate and entered his heart. The degree of force required to inflict this injury was estimated to be “moderate to high”. Mr Swindell was treated for his injuries. He had two stab wounds, a 3 centimetre wound to his armpit and a 5 centimetre wound to his upper arm.
	
	
	Suspicion quickly fell upon Bradley and Joel Brooks. A driver’s licence was found at the scene that belonged to Joel Brooks and two witnesses identified Joel Books as one of the stabbers when they looked at the licence. A black resin object was found at the scene and the prosecution alleges that this object came off the handle of the knife used by the accused when he dropped it. Police executed a search warrant and located the shoes worn by the brothers in the washing machine. A presumptive test for blood on the shoes was positive although DNA testing was unsuccessful. Police interviewed both brothers on 6 April 2015. They both claimed that they left the venue at around 11pm but security checks demonstrated that they left an hour later. The accused was charged with murder and wounding with intent on 7 April 2015. His brother was charged three weeks later.
	
	
	Madison Valentine told police that she purchased a knife for the accused around three weeks before the incident. She showed police a similar knife, but of a different colour, at the shop. The knife matched the description given by witnesses and had a resin insert “strikingly similar” to that found at the scene.
	
	
	The prosecution’s case is that the accused is a principal in the first degree in relation to both offences. That is, the Crown asserts that he actually inflicted the stab wound that caused the death of Mr Gibbins and that he stabbed Mr Swindell with intent to cause really serious injury. In relation to the second charge, the Crown also relies on joint criminal enterprise. That is, the Crown asserts that the accused and his brother agreed to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Swindell and that the each is responsible for the acts carried out by the other in furtherance of that common purpose.
	
	
	To prove murder the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the act of the accused caused the death of Mr Gibbins and that he carried out the act with an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. [7]  The Crown must also establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused acted unlawfully in the sense that he did not act in self-defence. [8] 
	
	
	If the Crown fails to prove the specific intention for murder, it may be open to the jury to return a verdict of guilty to manslaughter on the ground of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Manslaughter may also arise if the Crown has not eliminated (beyond reasonable doubt) that the accused believed it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself or another person but the Crown has proved (beyond reasonable doubt) that the response was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be. [9] 
	
	
	To prove the second count, the Crown must establish that either the accused or his brother caused the wounds to Mr Swindell and that the accused either committed the act himself while intending to inflict grievous bodily harm or the common purpose included acting with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. Again, the Crown must eliminate self-defence beyond reasonable doubt.
	


THE PROPOSED ADMISSIONS, THEIR LEGAL EFFECT AND IMPACT ON THE LIVE ISSUES IN THE TRIAL


	
	The accused intends to make formal admissions in relation to a number of factual matters. [10]  Those admissions will take a different form depending on the evidentiary rulings that are made, particularly the rulings dictating whether the Crown is permitted to lead evidence of post offence conduct said to establish a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	Two draft forms of the admissions were tendered at the commencement of the voir dire. [11]  On the second day of the voir dire, two further drafts were tendered. [12]  These second draft admissions addressed issues raised by the Crown Prosecutor in his submission on the first day. These documents represent the substance of the admissions that will be made in the trial although there may be some tweaking of the document before it is tendered or read.
	
	
	If the Crown is not permitted to lead the post offence conduct as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the admissions would be in the following terms:
	


ADMISSIONS

I, Bradley Brooks make the following admissions at my trial pursuant to s 184 Evidence Act. I have received advice about the making of these admissions from my barrister, Andrew Boe and my solicitor, Carol Younes, and I understand the consequences of making these admissions.

1.   I am the biological son of Corry and Mandy Brooks. I was born on 16 November, 1995.

2.   As at 5 April 2015:

2.1.   I was 19 years old, and approximately 6’2” tall; and

2.2.   I resided at 6 Hibbard Street, Canton Beach with my fiancé, Madison Valentine.

3.   On the evening of 5 April 2015:

3.1.   I attended the ‘Sunbay’ music festival at the Beachcomber Hotel on Main Road Toukley (‘the Beachcomber’) with Joel Brooks, Corry Brooks, Billy Weldon and Jake Deville (collectively referred to as ‘my family group’).

3.2.   I was wearing a red singlet, grey coloured chino trousers, white and blue Nike brand shoes and a black ‘bum bag’. These clothes are as depicted in a photograph taken that night at the Beachcomber, a copy of which is Attachment 1.

4.   Joel Brooks is my adopted brother.

5.   Billy Weldon is my father Corry Brooks’ half-brother.

6.   Jack Deville is my cousin (on my mother’s side).

7.   My family group travelled together to the Beachcomber in my father’s white dual cab utility which was driven there by my father and parked in the gravel carpark adjacent to Aldas Pizza. This store is diagonally across, and about 90m down from the Beachcomber.

8.   At around midnight, at about the time the festival ended, I left the Beachcomber, crossed the road and walked to Aldas Pizza and ordered some pizzas.

9.   As I waited for the pizzas, I stood immediately outside the store. I lit a cigarette and had my left arm outstretched so I could lean against the front wall of Aldas Pizza (on the side closest to Dunleigh Street). I was facing away from the direction of the Beachcomber. Members of my family group were standing a few metres away (behind me) on the other side of the entrance to the pizza shop.

10.   As I was waiting for the pizza order to be filled, I heard and saw a young woman, who I now believe to be Amber Pellizzon, gesticulating and yelling at my family group whilst they were outside the store. At that stage she was on her own. She then went to the car park area and returned, leading two men from the car park. They went past me and went directly to my family group. She started yelling at my family group again. I then saw one of these men knock my brother Joel to the ground.

11.   I immediately stepped towards this man and pulled out a knife that was clipped to the inside of my trousers and stood facing him with the knife blade protruding out of my fist next to my right thumb. I repeatedly yelled that I had a ‘fucking knife’. I then engaged in a physical altercation with these two men in an area on the roadway at or about the front of the store. I now believe that these two men were Adam Swindell and Gregory Gibbins.

12.   I had no prior interaction with either Adam Swindell, Gregory Gibbins or their companion Shaun Morabito prior to this physical alteration.

13.   I am right handed and held and deliberately used the knife in my right hand throughout the altercation. Throughout the entire altercation the knife was held tightly in my right fist with the blade protruding next to my right thumb.

14.   During the physical altercation in which I deliberately used the knife:

14.1.   Gregory Gibbins sustained a knife wound to his chest and subsequently died as a result of this wound;

14.2.   Adam Swindell sustained serious knife wounds to his right bicep and the left side of his chest, which wounds amounted to grievous bodily harm.

15.   Although I do not know whether in fact I did, I admit the reasonable possibility that I caused each of these wounds.

16.   The knife that I used in the altercation:

16.1.   was a foldable knife;

16.2.   was given to me on or about 19 March 2015 by my fiancé Madison Valentine, as a gift;

16.3.   I was present when she purchased the knife from CTC Tobacconists at Toukley that day;

16.4.   was clipped to the inside of my trousers’ waistband with the blade in the folded position from when I arrived at the Beachcomber; and

16.5.   is the same type and appearance as the knife depicted in Attachment 2 to these admissions.

17.   At no stage in the circumstances in which Madison Valentine gave me the knife was there any discussion of the events that occurred at the Beachcomber Hotel on 27 February 2015, when I had been assaulted in her presence.

18.   The item depicted in photograph 42 of 163 in the Statement of Terry Flippence, and located at Point 1 in photograph 3 of 163 (of the same statement) is a piece of the handle of the knife I used, that must have fallen off just before or during the course of the physical altercation in which I was involved.

19.   When I was given my knife by Madison I suggested to her that we also buy a knife for Joel for his 19th birthday. Madison purchased a second knife from CTC Tobacconists at Toukley which we gave to Joel later that day. It is the same type and appearance as the one depicted in Attachment 3.

20.   Immediately following the physical altercation, I ran down Dunleigh Street (away from Main Street), at some point Joel caught up with me and together we ran to my house at 6 Hibbard Street, arriving there about fifteen minutes or so after leaving Aldas Pizza.

21.   I was arrested on 6 April 2015 and charged with the present offences the following day.


	
	If the Crown is permitted to lead the post offence conduct as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, the admissions will take the following form:
	


ADMISSIONS

I, Bradley Brooks make the following admissions at my trial pursuant to s 184 Evidence Act. I have received advice about the making of these admissions from my barrister, Andrew Boe and my solicitor, Carol Younes, and I understand the consequences of making these admissions.

7.   My family group travelled together to the Beachcomber in my father’s white dual cab utility which was driven there by my father and parked in the gravel carpark adjacent to Aldas Pizza. This store is diagonally across, and about 90m down from the Beachcomber

.

8.   At around midnight, at about the time the festival ended, I left the Beachcomber, crossed the road and walked to Aldas Pizza and ordered some pizzas for the group.

9.   As I waited for the pizzas, I stood immediately outside the store.

14.   During the physical altercation in which I deliberately used the knife:

14.1.   Gregory Gibbins sustained a knife wound to his chest and subsequently died as a result of this wound;

14.2.   Adam Swindell sustained serious knife wounds to his right bicep and the left side of his chest, which wounds amounted to grievous bodily harm.

15.   Although I do not know whether in fact I did, I admit the reasonable possibility that I caused each of these wounds.

16.   The knife that I used in the altercation:

16.1.   was a foldable knife;

16.2.   was given to me on or about 19 March 2015 by my fiancé Madison Valentine, as a gift;

16.3.   I was present when she purchased the knife from CTC Tobacconists at Toukley that day;

16.4.   was clipped to the inside of my trousers’ waistband with the blade in the folded position from when I arrived at the Beachcomber; and

16.5.   is the same type and appearance as the knife depicted in Attachment 2 to these admissions.

17.   At no stage in the circumstances in which Madison Valentine gave me the knife was there any discussion of the events that occurred at the Beachcomber Hotel on 27 February 2015, when I had been assaulted in her presence.

18.   Upon arriving at my house at 6 Hibbard Street, I ran inside and changed out of my clothes. I then retrieved the keys to my mother’s vehicle (gold coloured Lexus IS 200, registration number BZB-85V) and drove it from there, with Joel Brooks in the front passenger seat, to our parents’ house at 157 Manoa Road, Budgewoi. I took the clothes that I had been wearing with me in the car to my parents’ house.

19.   I stopped on the way to my parents’ house and disposed of the knife I used, as well as a knife that Joel was carrying with him. I threw both knives into the ocean at Budgewoi Beach. I believe that the knife I took from Joel to be a knife that Madison and I had given to him in or about March 2015 for his 19th birthday. I was present when Madison purchased this knife from CTC Tobacconists at Toukley. It is the same type and appearance as the one depicted in Attachment 3.

20.   Upon arriving at my parent’s house, I put the clothes that I was wearing earlier that night on the floor in the laundry. These clothes were located by police soaking in the washing machine on 6 April 2015.

21.   I was arrested on 6 April 2015. During a recorded interview with police on 7 April 2015, I falsely denied any involvement in the physical altercation, owning or possessing any knife or even being present at or near where the altercation occurred. 


	
	The making of these admissions alleviates the need for the Crown to prove the matters admitted in the document. There is some authority for the proposition that the making of such admissions may preclude the Crown from proving such matters. For example, in R v Longford [13]  Gibbs J [14]  said “the Crown ought not to call evidence to prove a matter which has been the subject of an admission, at least if the calling of such evidence would be likely to have any prejudicial effect on the accused.” His Honour went on to say that if the evidence was probative of another issue, the admission of one fact does not prevent the evidence as to that fact being given when it is relevant to another issue. Gibbs J (sitting in the High Court) made a similar observation in Yager v The Queen. [15]   In Stubley v Western Australia, Heydon J cited this approach with apparent approval. [16]  In fact, his Honour may have gone further (by omitting reference to possibility of prejudice) when he said:
	


“It is a particularly advantageous tactic because there is substantial authority for the view that once an admission of a matter of fact has been made by the defence, not only is it not necessary for the prosecution to call further evidence on that matter of fact, but it is not open to it to do so, unless that evidence is relevant to another issue.”


	
	The remaining members of the High Court did not resolve or deal with this issue. In the footnote referring to the “substantial authority” to which he referred, Heydon J noted that in R v Smith [17]  the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal denied that Longford reflected the law and practice in New South Wales. In Smith v R, Street CJ (with whom Samuels JA and Slattery J agreed) unambiguously declared that the propositions enunciated in R v Longford do not reflect the law of New South Wales. [18]  Judges sitting in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal have followed Smith and made similar, and stronger, statements on the matter. [19] 
	
	
	The binding authorities in this state establish that there is no bar to the Crown leading evidence to prove matters that are subject to admissions. However, I accept Mr Boe’s submission that the effect of such admissions may mean that a particular matter is no longer a “fact in issue”. This may impact on the question of whether the evidence is “relevant evidence” under s 55 of the Evidence Act and also on a proper assessment of the probative value of the evidence for the purpose of ss 135 and 137. “Probative value” is defined as “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” [20]  In each case, it will be necessary to compare the matters that the Crown is required to prove with the substance of the admission made by the accused. In some cases, it may be that the evidence is no longer relevant because the fact is not in issue in the proceedings. More commonly, it may be that the probative value of the evidence is reduced and, if the evidence would result in an undue waste of time (s 135) or create unfair prejudice (s 137), it may be inadmissible in the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	Returning to the facts of the present case, it is conspicuous and significant that Mr Brooks does not admit deliberately stabbing either Mr Gibbins or Mr Swindell. The admission he will make is that he “deliberately used” the knife in the course of the physical altercation. How he used it is not clear. Further, the admissions go no further than allowing for the “reasonable possibility” that the accused caused the wounds to Mr Gibbins and Mr Swindell. There is no clear admission that he in fact caused the wounds.
	
	
	These admissions are not sufficient for the prosecution’s purposes and would certainly not support a conviction. The Crown will be required to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Brooks in fact caused the wound to Mr Gibbins and that either he, or his brother, or both, caused the two wounds suffered by Mr Swindell. The Crown must also prove an intention to kill or to inflict really serious injury. Establishing that the accused “deliberately used” the knife is not likely to do this. The Crown may seek to establish (by direct evidence or by inferences available from other evidence) that Mr Brooks deliberately stabbed the victim(s). The admissions do not go that far.
	


SHOULD THE PROSECUTION BE ALLOWED TO LEAD EVIDENCE OF MR BROOKS’ POST OFFENCE CONDUCT TO ESTABLISH A CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT?


	
	Central to a number of the objections raised by the accused is the question of whether the prosecution should be permitted to adduce evidence of conduct of the accused that occurred after the stabbings. The Crown contends that the conduct may lead the jury to conclude that the accused was exhibiting a consciousness of guilt. The Crown does not rely on the evidence that the accused fled the scene immediately after the incident as evidence of “flight”. However, it seeks to lead evidence that Mr Brooks disposed of two knives (at least one of which was used in the course of the incident), that he washed his shoes shortly after the stabbing and that he told a number of material lies when interviewed by police. It seeks to use that evidence as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt on the part of Mr Brooks. The accused objects to this evidence on the basis that it is not relevant to the facts that remain in issue in the light of his formal admissions or, alternatively, that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The accused submits that, in the face of his formal admissions, the evidence said to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt is not relevant in the sense that it “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding”. [21]  It is submitted that the real or live issues in the case have been narrowed so that there are only two issues, namely, whether the accused acted in self-defence and whether the accused had the requisite intention to be guilty of the crime of murder. The conduct said by the Crown to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt was conduct equally explicable to by the fact that the accused may have been attempting to distance himself from his involvement in a fight in which he produced a knife and/or that he had a consciousness of guilt related to a lesser crime (in particular, manslaughter). To adopt the language employed in some of the authorities, the evidence was “intractably neutral as between murder and manslaughter”. [22] 
	
	
	Reliance was placed on the seminal authorities concerning consciousness of guilt evidence such as R v Lucas [23]  and Edwards v The Queen. [24]  These authorities emphasise the fact that for evidence of post offence conduct to be admissible to establish a consciousness of guilt it must “relate to a material issue” and must be “explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence with which he is charged.” [25] 
	
	
	It was further submitted that jury directions on the issue would be unduly complicated, circular and confusing. Accordingly, even if it were accepted that the evidence had some relevance, the accused relies on the Court’s power to exclude evidence where the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As with the argument concerning relevance, this contention relies on the narrowing of the issues by reference to the formal admissions and the fact the post offence conduct cannot properly be directed solely to the crime of murder.
	
	
	The accused’s argument receives support in the judgments of Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in R v Cook, [26]  R v Sievers [27]  and Steer v R. [28]  In Cook her Honour held that evidence that the appellant took flight and hid from police in a manhole was wrongly admitted because to explain his actions the accused would have to disclose other criminal offences with a “disturbingly close relationship to the offence with which he was charged”. The conduct was equally explicable by a consciousness of guilt of those other offences. However, her Honour did not accept that there was any general rule that evidence was inadmissible because it would “put the accused person in the position of explaining his conduct in such a manner as would disclose the commission of other offences.” [29]  Cook and similar cases are concerned with the situation where explaining the post offence conduct may result in the disclosure of other criminal conduct. [30]  The present case is different because the argument is that the conduct may be explicable by reference to the accused person’s involvement in the incident giving rise to the charges but is not necessarily indicative of a consciousness that he is guilty of murder (or manslaughter).
	
	
	In R v Sievers the appellant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of provocation. The prosecution relied on evidence that the accused disposed of a knife, cleaned up the crime scene, disposed of the body and took flight interstate. This evidence “compelled the conclusion that he was motivated by a consciousness of guilt”. [31]  The ground raised in the Court of Criminal Appeal concerned the directions given to the jury, which failed to distinguish between a consciousness of guilt for murder and consciousness of guilt for manslaughter. The case did not concern the admissibility of the evidence. The majority (Levine and Barr JJ) held there was no error in the directions. However, Simpson J would have upheld the appeal on this ground and made the following observations:
	


""79 The evidence was certainly capable of establishing that the appellant had a consciousness of guilt of having committed a crime; that crime being the killing of the victim. But that much had been admitted from the outset. That therefore was not an issue.

80 The directions given by the trial judge in relation to this issue are comprehensively set out in the judgment of Barr J and I do not propose to repeat them, except to observe that his Honour repeatedly emphasised that consciousness of guilt evidence could only go to a consciousness of guilt of the crime charged, and not of some other crime. This is a conventional point to be made in any case where the Crown relies on evidence said to signify a consciousness of guilt.

81 It is not, however, in my opinion, an appropriate direction to give where the only issue in the trial is whether the accused person is guilty of murder or of manslaughter. The direction implies that the accused person is aware of the sometimes subtle and sophisticated distinction between conduct constituting the crime of murder and conduct constituting the crime of manslaughter. In the present case it assumes an appreciation in the appellant of circumstances that would render this crime manslaughter as distinct from murder.

82 The only issue in the trial was whether the Crown had eliminated provocation. To be relevant, the evidence had to be capable of showing that the appellant knew he was guilty of the crime of murder as distinct from the crime of manslaughter. It could not have been relevant for that purpose unless it went to the appellant’s knowledge – and knowledge at the time of the acts said to evidence consciousness of guilt – of circumstances relevant to the Crown’s attempted rebuttal of the provocation defence. To show consciousness of guilt of murder as distinct from manslaughter in the circumstances of this case, the evidence had to be capable of showing that, at the time he did the acts, the appellant knew that he did not lose his self-control, or that any loss of self-control was not induced by any conduct of the deceased, or that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the appellant to have so far lost his self control as to form an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. That presupposes that, at the time he did the acts, the appellant appreciated the circumstances that make a killing murder as distinct from manslaughter. There is no reason to suppose that the appellant ever had any such appreciation. The evidence was not capable of going to any of the matters to which I have referred – i.e. the s23(2) matters.

83 The complaint that is now made is not about the admission of the evidence but about the directions given as to the use that could be made of that evidence. But the point remains good. The directions must have led the jury to believe that the evidence was relevant to the only issue in the trial. In my opinion it was not, and the directions were therefore misleading.

84 In my opinion, the only guilt of which the appellant could reasonably be said to have been conscious was of guilt of killing – even unlawfully killing – the victim. But that was not in issue. It was abundantly clear that his guilt of unlawful killing was accepted. None of the evidence in question – disposal of the weapon, cleaning up the crime scene, disposing of the body, false denials, or interstate moves – could in any way go to establish that the appellant was conscious that he was guilty, not of manslaughter, but of murder.

85 In my respectful opinion the directions were irrelevant. They also were capable of leading the jury to believe that the evidence in some way could assist them in the only determination they had to make. In this respect it is important to recall that the issue of provocation was effectively the only issue in the trial.”


	
	I agree with those observations while accepting that her Honour’s was a dissenting judgment, and that the judgment of the majority is binding subject to further developments in the law.
	
	
	A similar issue arose in Steer.  The accused killed the man for whom his partner had rejected him and the Crown relied on his conduct after the event to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt. That conduct included committing a bank robbery to fund his intended flight and disappearance. The issues left to the jury were self-defence and provocation. Objection was taken to the consciousness of guilt evidence but the trial judge held that the evidence was admissible as it “might be found by the jury to reflect an awareness on his part that his action in killing the deceased did not flow from a belief that he had been acting in defence of his person”. [32]  McClellan CJ at CL held that the evidence was properly admitted and “capable of being understood by the jury as reflecting a consciousness in the appellant that he had wrongfully killed the deceased” and that he knew that “he had not acted in self-defence”. [33]  However, the majority (Simpson and McCallum JJ) held that the directions were inadequate. [34]  Simpson J acknowledged that her judgment in Sievers was a minority opinion but adhered to the view that she had expressed in that case. Her Honour explained:
	


“72 Self defence and provocation are legal concepts. Unless the evidence otherwise establishes, an accused person should not, ordinarily, be presumed to know what they mean or what circumstances make them available.

73 The directions given by the trial judge made the same assumption. In my opinion, those directions were inadequate to meet the requirements of Edwards, and were not moulded to fit the circumstances of the case.”


	
	While the majority in Steer held that the directions were inadequate, it is unclear whether they concluded that the evidence was wrongly admitted. [35]  Ultimately, the majority applied the proviso based on the basis of an “extremely strong” prosecution case.
	
	
	In Gall v R [36]  it was held at [93] that the appellant’s “submission that the evidence of his post offence conduct could not distinguish between a consciousness of guilt for murder or manslaughter is misconceived”. However, this was on the basis that there was no suggestion at the trial that “the post offence conduct could be used in this way or was capable by itself of establishing guilt of any particular offence.” It was held that the evidence was relevant to the question of intention and to negative self-defence.
	
	
	In Mulvilhil v R [37]  it was held that “post-offence conduct may also be relevant to negative a defence of self-defence or provocation”. Gall was cited as authority for that proposition.
	
	
	A five-judge bench in the Victorian Court of Appeal considered the issue in R v Ciantar. [38]  The Court accepted at [40] that “there may be some circumstances in which post-offence conduct is equally consistent with two or more possible offences or is otherwise intractably neutral.” [39]  However, the Court rejected the proposition that would “usually be so” and declined to follow an earlier Victorian case and two Canadian cases that suggested the evidence should be rejected as having no probative value “where an accused conduct may be equally explained by reference to consciousness of guilt of two or more offences.” [40]  The Court was “not persuaded that it is either necessary or desirable so to restrict the circumstances in which a jury may find evidence of post-offence conduct to be probative of guilt of a specific offence as opposed to a lesser included offence or other offences on a multiple-count presentment”. [41]  Ciantar was not a case of murder but involved a culpable driving charge in circumstances where less serious offences (such as dangerous driving or drink driving) may have explained the post-offence conduct.
	
	
	In Baden-Clay v The Queen [42]  the High Court unanimously held that “there is no hard and fast rule that evidence of post-offence concealment and lies is always intractably neutral as between murder and manslaughter”. [43]  That observation plainly acknowledges that there will be cases where the evidence is intractably neutral as between the two forms of homicide. The Court adopted what was said by Major J in the Canadian case of R v White [44] : “The result will always turn on the nature of the evidence in question and its relevance to the real issue in dispute.”
	
	
	As presently advised, on the basis of the material tendered on the voir dire, I am of the view that the evidence of post-offence conduct is “intractably neutral” as between murder and manslaughter. That view may change depending on how the evidence falls and how the case is conducted. Ultimately, it is a view that will inform the appropriate directions to be given to the jury in the course of the summing up. However, it is not determinative of the issue of admissibility that is presently raised.
	
	
	For the evidence to be inadmissible altogether on the basis of relevance, a conclusion must be reached that evidence is neutral as between homicide (murder or manslaughter) and the proposition that Mr Brook’s post offence conduct was explicable by reference to a desire to distance himself from the incident and/or the fact that he produced a knife and used it in the physical altercation. It would be necessary to find that the evidence could not rationally impact on the jury’s consideration of whether Mr Brooks acted as he did because he knew that he deliberately stabbed the victims or knew that he did not act in self-defence. Alternatively, if the evidence is relevant, it could be excluded if the probative value was considered to be low or otherwise outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	As I have observed, the formal admissions fall short of acknowledging a deliberate stabbing. As to causation, all that is admitted is the “reasonable possibility” that Mr Brooks caused the three stab wounds sustained by Mr Gibbins and Mr Swindell.
	
	
	It would be open to the jury to find that the actions of Mr Brooks after the incident supports the prosecution case that he deliberately inflicted the stab wounds, that he did not act in self-defence and, perhaps, that he acted with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. At this point, I remain to be convinced that the evidence could properly inform the jury’s determination of whether Mr Books acted with the specific intent required to establish murder. But even if it is accepted that the evidence is “intractably neutral” when it comes to distinguishing between the crime of murder and the crime of manslaughter, the evidence has both relevance and substantial probative force on the question of whether or not the accused acted unlawfully and knew that he acted unlawfully. It will be necessary to fashion careful directions to ensure that the evidence is not misused. However, I am not persuaded that such directions will be, or need to be, unduly complicated, confusing or result in a risk of circular reasoning.
	
	
	Accordingly, the evidence of Mr Brooks’ post offence conduct is admissible. It may go to the proof of either manslaughter or murder in the way explained in the various cases. As I have implied, I will need to be convinced that the evidence should be left to the jury on the basis that it might support a conviction for murder, as opposed to a conviction for manslaughter. In that regard, I find the reasoning of Justice Simpson in Steer and Sievers to be unimpeachable. Nothing in the decisions of Gall, Mulvihill or Baden-Clay require me to the direct the jury that the evidence might provide corroboration for the crime of murder as distinct from manslaughter (either by unlawful and dangerous act or excessive self-defence).
	


RULINGS ON OBJECTIONS

Madison Valentine


	
	At the time of the incident giving rise to the present proceedings, Madison Valentine was in a romantic relationship with the accused. It is also the case that she is a relative of Mr Swindell. She was interviewed on at least three occasions. In the first of the interviews, which took place on 7 April 2015, it seems that Ms Valentine misled the police in relation to a number of significant matters. On 27 April 2015 she was again interviewed by the police and on this occasion, at least according to the Crown, she provided an honest and accurate account. Finally, on 27 May 2016, she provided an account of certain admissions that she alleges were made by the accused to her. There are also several statements provided by her to police and there are two telephone intercepts of conversations between her and the accused which occurred on the 3 and 22 October 2015.
	
	
	The material contained in Ms Valentine’s interviews with police is discursive and, at least on its face, charged with emotion. Many of the answers are, with respect to the witness, non-responsive and apparently the result of a stream of consciousness rather than a direct response to the questions being posed by the investigators. The upshot is that it was difficult for counsel for the accused to determine precisely what parts of the material the Crown proposed to lead, particularly when much of the material was on its face inadmissible because it comprised of opinions, rumour, innuendo and hearsay. In the course of submissions, counsel undertook to agree on those parts of Ms Valentine’s evidence agreed to be admissible. I am grateful to counsel for the fact that this has been done. There remained three objections to the evidence of Ms Valentine.
	


The purchase of the knife


	
	The first objection concerned her evidence of purchasing the knife for the accused that was used in the incident. The accused submitted that there was no issue that he produced and used a knife and that it was the knife purchased for him by Ms Valentine. Accordingly, her evidence of buying the knife was of little or no probative value to the live issues in the case. Further, it is clear from reading her interviews that Ms Valentine became emotional when speaking about this subject. No doubt, in view of what happened and its dire consequences, Ms Valentine felt guilty about purchasing the knife and, perhaps, responsible for what happened. The risk that Ms Valentine may become emotional if questioned on this topic was said to give rise to the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In answer to the submissions of the Crown that the evidence was relevant to rebut the suggestion that the knife was purchased in response to the events of 27 March 2015 when the accused was assaulted, the agreed facts as proposed were amended to include the further additional paragraph which says:
	


“At no stage in the circumstances in which Madison Valentine gave me the knife was there any discussion of the events that occurred at the Beachcomber hotel on 27 February 2015, when I had been assaulted in her presence.”


	
	In those circumstances, I accept Mr Boe’s submission that the probative value of any evidence that Ms Valentine might give in relation to the purchase of the knife is slight. Based on those authorities to which I have earlier referred concerning the effect on the conduct of criminal proceedings of formal and detailed admissions, I accept the submission that the Crown should not be permitted to lead this evidence. In reaching that conclusion I have taken into account the possibility that the emotion likely to be engendered may create unfair prejudice. While that is not ordinarily a matter that would result in evidence being excluded, the peculiar circumstances pertaining here and the clear admission made on behalf of the accused, eschewing any connection between the purchase of the knife and the events of 27 February 2015, satisfies me that the evidence is not admissible at this stage.
	
	
	I say “at this stage” because it may be that the Crown would seek to re-ventilate this ruling if the accused took a course in cross-examination or in conducting his case that might be seen to suggest that Ms Valentine and/or the accused were motivated in purchasing the knife by the events of 27 February 2015.
	
	
	The second area of dispute between the parties in respect of Ms Valentine’s evidence concerns her assertion that the accused made an admission to her in relation to stabbing the deceased and/ or Mr Swindell. Precisely what evidence Ms Valentine may give on this subject is not completely clear from the recorded interviews with the police. However, what is clear is that she asserted that the accused said things that suggested he was aware that he stabbed the “victims” in the arms and chest. One relevant passage is in her interview of 27 May 2016:
	


Q36.    That’s O.K. In your conversation with him did he, did his answers, were they to a question from you or did he tell you what it was that he’d done?

A    I said “Did you do it”.

Q37   O.K.

A   And I said “Stop lying to me I want to know” and he told me yes he did. And then I said “Well if you did it show me where you did it”. And he pointed but I can’t remember, I don’t want to say exactly ‘cause I don’t want to be wrong.

…

Q55   O.K. Yeah. And what, when you asked him ---

A   I just remember him saying like in the arm or in, I just, I can’t. I don’t want to say exactly where ‘cause I don’t remember. I don’t want to say the wrong thing if that makes sense.

Q56   O.K. What is it, what do you remember him saying?

A   I just remember him telling me he did it and that’s it.

Q57   O.K. When he told you when you asked him where he did it did he, and you said you don’t remember what he said. Was it, did he say words, did he show you, did he ---

A    He pointed.

Q58    O.K. And where did he point to?

A    I don’t, I’m pretty sure he just pointed to one of his arms and the chest that was it. I just, I don’t know if it was the left arm or the right arm. I don’t, I don’t remember ‘cause it was so long ago.


	
	Because the terms of the formal admissions go no further than acknowledging the “deliberate use” of the knife and the “reasonable possibility” that Mr Brooks caused the wounds, the evidence that Ms Valentine may give as to admissions made by the accused is relevant and probative of matters remaining in issue in the trial. Those issues are whether the accused committed a deliberate stabbing and whether he caused the injuries to the arm and chest(s). It is not clear from the proposed admissions that the accused is admitting that he deliberately stabbed somebody as opposed to some other use of the knife within the fight. It might be thought that one logically flows from the other, but in the absence of complete clarity, the Crown is entitled to prove its case. The evidence is relevant to the question of intention.
	


The telephone intercepts.


	
	The final objection to the evidence to be elicited through Ms Valentine concerns two telephone intercepts relating to conversations between Bradley Brooks and Madison Valentine on 3 October 2015 and then on 22 October 2015. In the first of those conversations, there is reference to the fact that Mr Brooks intended to “plead”. It can be inferred that the intention was to plead guilty but the offence to which he intended to plead is not made explicit. Later in the conversation there is reference to a “deal” and also reference to sentencing proceedings that may result in a sentence of “three, four, five years on the bottom.” To a lawyer experienced in the criminal law, it may be obvious that Mr Brooks intended to offer to plead guilty to manslaughter. However, it would not be clear to a lay jury in the absence of evidence explaining the way in which charge bargains and negotiations proceed. A jury may well be misled into thinking that the accused was offering to plead guilty to murder or be given an erroneous understanding of the kinds of sentences that are imposed in cases such as these. One problem with this evidence is that it is unclear, and cannot properly be made clear, what legal advice Mr Brooks may have received that informed his decision to “plead” and “offer a deal”.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the conversation is capable of rationally affecting the probability that Bradley Brooks intentionally stabbed one, or other, or both of the victims. Put another way, a decision to plead guilty is consistent with the accused acknowledging his guilt or demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. It is also said that the conversation supports Ms Valentine’s evidence that the accused had previously made admissions to her and that this explains his use of the expression doing the right thing.
	
	
	I am told by Mr Boe, and accept unreservedly, that at about the time of these conversations, there was a formal offer by the accused to plead guilty to the crime of manslaughter.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the submissions made by the learned Crown Prosecutor. There is no clear connection between the conversation and any earlier (alleged) conversation in which Mr Brooks admitted his guilt to Ms Valentine. Further, not every plea of guilty is the result of a genuine acknowledgement or consciousness of guilt. [45]  Often, a plea of guilty is entered as a result of what I might call a risk analysis. That is particularly so in homicide cases where the sentencing outcomes on conviction for murder are so extreme and the parties often discuss the possible bases upon which a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment might be justified or appropriate.
	
	
	In my estimation, the probative value of the evidence is slight and the danger of unfair prejudice is very high. Even if the evidence was led in such a way as to make it clear that the offer to plead guilty related to a lesser crime (such as manslaughter or the malicious wounding of Mr Swindell), the risk of misuse of this evidence remains very high. Further, where the jury may be called upon to determine whether or not the accused is in fact guilty of manslaughter, there is real prejudice in eliciting evidence that the accused, on legal advice that is not known and not able to be known, made a forensic or tactical choice to offer to plead guilty to manslaughter. I am not satisfied that such conduct in the circumstances prevailing here is conduct that can properly be said to have arisen as a result of a genuine consciousness of guilt, let alone that it constitutes some kind of tacit admission that he committed a deliberate stabbing or did not act in self-defence.
	
	
	The second of the intercepted telephone conversations involves an argument between Mr Brooks and Ms Valentine because the witness seems to be of the belief that the accused was reneging on his decision to offer the plea of guilty to manslaughter. There is nothing in that second conversation which elevates the probative value of the evidence when considering the live issues that will be before the jury.
	
	
	Accordingly, while the evidence passes the threshold of relevance, I reject the evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act. The probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. I also find that there is a real risk that the evidence would be misleading and confusing, and the necessity to explain the intricacies surrounding the process of “charge bargaining” in homicide cases will result in an undue waste of time. Accordingly, I would also find that section 135 is engaged and would also exclude the evidence in the exercise of discretion under that section.
	


Discussion that Mr Gibbins had died


	
	In her interview with police on 27 April 2015, Ms Valentine provided an account of conversations she had with Mr Brooks between the time of the incident and Mr Brooks’ arrest. There is an objection to evidence of a conversation recorded at Q 158-159 of that interview. Because of the discursive nature of the answers in and around the impugned passage, it is difficult to discern exactly when the conversation occurred and what was said. However, it seems clear that Ms Valentine saw something on a social media site and discussed this with Mr Brooks. She looked up “what happened at the Beachcomber” and “sent a picture of the guy that died” and said “look at this, Brad, like, and …. died”. In spite of what I assume is an indecipherable portion indicated by the four dots and the incoherence of the passage as transcribed, it is reasonably clear that it was communicated to Mr Brooks that Mr Gibbins had died (although it seems he was not mentioned by name). Ms Valentine claims that Mr Brooks looked at the picture for “probably 5 minutes straight”, as assertion that seems unlikely, and from which no rational inference could be drawn in any event. She spoke about her feelings, her fears for her children and various other prejudicial irrelevancies.
	
	
	This conversation cannot be led in the form disclosed in the answer to Q 158 but the evidence that Ms Valentine told Mr Brooks that the person stabbed outside the Beachcomber had died is relevant evidence. It has a capacity, rationally, to affect the jury’s assessment of the interview made by accused a day or so later. His knowledge that the victim died is relevant to the jury’s understanding of his conduct after he was arrested. Provided the learned Crown Prosecutor takes care in eliciting the evidence to ensure that the witness does not volunteer irrelevant or prejudicial material, I am unable to discern any danger of unfair prejudice in the evidence. The evidence is admissible.
	


Christopher Hughes


	
	Objection is taken to specific paragraphs in a statement made by Christopher Hughes. Each of those paragraphs relates to the fact that between the time of the incident and when the accused arrived home he had removed his shirt. Mr Hughes describes him as “no longer wearing a shirt (and I didn’t see him carrying it)” and later said that Mr Brooks was “now wearing a white singlet”. As I understand it, the question of whether this evidence is, or is not, admissible turns on the question of whether the Crown is successful in its attempt to tender evidence relating to the post offence conduct of the accused giving rise to an inference that he acted with a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	For the reasons I have explained, the evidence of such conduct is admissible. I understand that such a finding will result in a further, specific admission by the accused and that it may not be necessary to call Mr Hughes. In any event, I hold that the evidence of Mr Hughes in paragraphs 16 and 22 is admissible although I note that parts of those paragraphs that contain opinions as to other people’s mental state will not be led in the trial.
	


The Electronically Recorded Interview


	
	On 7 April 2015, that is two days after the incident that caused the death of Gregory Gibbins and the wounding of Adam Swindell, Mr Brooks was interviewed at the Wyong police station. The result was a recording that lasts for a little less than 2 hours and a transcript that runs to 84 pages. The Crown asserts that a number of answers are demonstrably false. The accused, by his offer of formal admissions acknowledges this. The latest version of those admissions includes the following relevant paragraph:
	


“21. I was arrested on 6 April 2015. During a recorded interview with police on 7 April 2015, I falsely denied any involvement in the physical altercation, owning or possession any knife or even been present at or near where the altercation occurred.”


	
	If the ERISP is not admissible, this paragraph of the admissions would be deleted.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor identified four categories of lies within the ERISP and carefully outlined the answers in which those lies were told. In view of the general conclusion that I have reached as to the admissibility of evidence demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, it is unnecessary to go into great detail. However, for the purposes of determining the admissibility of the evidence, I accept the prosecution submission that the lies are intricate, detailed and persistent.
	
	
	The first category of lie identified by the Crown relates to the time that the accused left the premises and what he did thereafter, thus setting up a false alibi. The second is that he was wearing a black shirt (whereas he was, in fact, wearing a red singlet) and when confronted with photographic evidence, made further (allegedly) false assertions as to the fact that another man was wearing his black shirt. The third category of lie concerns the reasons he washed his shoes and the fourth concerns his denial of being in possession of a knife on the night.
	
	
	It would be open to the jury to find that these lies were material and told out of a consciousness of guilt. Careful directions will be required as to the care that must be taken before using this evidence or in concluding that there is no other explanation for the telling of the lies. However, for reasons earlier identified, the evidence is admissible.
	


Telephone intercept of call between Mr Brooks and his father


	
	The accused objects to a telephone intercept between he and his father that was recorded on 11 February 2016. In that call, the parties discuss the state of the police brief and the results of some DNA evidence. The father says “there’s fucken nothing Brad. They’re fucken idiots these cunts”. When he is told there is no DNA “even on the shoes”, the accused responds “fucken oath” and “sweet as”. Earlier when told that there is “nothing” the accused responds “Fuck. Cheering.” There is reference to opinions that were provided by the accused’s legal team as to the state of the evidence.
	
	
	I am unable to identify any direct admission in this conversation and am unable to see how a jury acting rationally could infer from it a consciousness of guilt. It is hardly surprising that a young man charged with murder, and his father, should express relief, even excitement, at the prospect that the forensic case being mounted by the police has uncovered no inculpatory evidence. Divining a guilty mind out of this evidence would amount to pure speculation and not the product of deductive or logical reasoning. Particularly given the formal admissions to be made, any probative value that this evidence has is very slight. Further, the language employed in the conversation may suggest flippancy and callousness on the part of the accused in view of the tragic circumstances. In this regard the evidence creates a danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and s 137 of the Evidence Act mandates its exclusion.
	


CCTV stills of the accused and his group leaving the Beachcomber Hotel


	
	The Crown seeks to tender six images captured by CCTV cameras. These depict Mr Brooks and his group leaving the Beachcomber Hotel at 11:57pm. The images are relevant to the size of the group, the timing of the departure, the clothing worn by various people and the size of the accused. I can see no danger of unfair prejudice in these images and the evidence is admissible.
	


Forensic procedure photographs


	
	The Crown presses eight photographs of the accused taken during the course of a forensic procedure to which he consented. These include two photographs of his head and shoulders, one full-length photograph, four photographs of his hands and a photograph of his elbow and forearm. The Crown submits that the evidence is relevant as showing the size and stature of Mr Brooks a day or so after the incident. I am unable to accept that submission. The photographs do not include any scale so are unable to provide any guidance as to his size. Insofar as they demonstrate his stature or build, there are other photographs to be tendered that are capable of establishing that matter. In particular, the CCTV stills that will be admitted over objection depict the accused with other people so there is at least some point of comparison.
	
	
	In light of the formal admissions to be made by the accused, the forensic procedure photographs could not rationally affect the assessment of a fact in issue. They fail the test of relevance and should be excluded.
	


Photographs of items seized during the search


	
	Neither counsel took me through the 47 photographs of items seized during the search or explained why they were relevant or how they might create the danger of unfair prejudice. A brief perusal of the photographs suggests that many of them are not relevant and do have some danger to create prejudice.
	
	
	For example, the first and second photograph depicts a pair of serrated interlocking knives with ornate handles. As far as I know, these have nothing to do with the case.
	
	
	There are photographs of the accused’s driver’s licence, some telephones and a handwritten note that records a fight between two parties that, as far as I am aware, are not involved in the current case. There are many photographs of various items of clothing and shoes. I am simply unable to determine the relevance of this evidence.
	
	
	On the other hand, I understand that some of the photographs depict the shoes that the accused and/or his brother was wearing at the time of the incident. Those photographs are relevant and I can see no danger of unfair prejudice in their admission.
	
	
	At this stage, I will simply indicate the provisional view that, unless a particular photograph depicts an item that is relevant to the incident on 5-6 April 2015 (for example, the shoes or clothing worn by the accused or his brother) I am inclined to the view that it is not relevant or admissible.
	


DECISION ON ADVANCE RULING


	
	I accept that the accused is entitled to introduce evidence that he was assaulted on 27 February 2015 and the impact that this assault had on him. I accept that this may be relevant to the issue of self-defence and may provide some evidence as to why he was carrying a knife. I do not perceive that the Crown contends otherwise.
	
	
	However, the Crown submits that it should be entitled to adduce evidence of things he said that night to a doorman and specifically that he told the doorman that he would “stab the cunt”, that he knew where he lived and was going “to stab him”. The Crown says this evidence demonstrates that the accused was not fearful but angry. The accused, argues that that part of the narrative of the incident on 27 February 2015 ought not to be given because (i) it is not relevant to the issues in the trial, (ii) if it is relevant, its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and (iii) if it is relevant, it is only relevant to establish a tendency in the accused towards violence or stabbing and its probative value lacks the significant probative value required for its admission under section 97 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I accept the submissions made by counsel for the accused. The threat to “stab the cunt” was a direct reference to the person who had assaulted him and there is no suggestion that Mr Brooks carried out that threat even though he claimed to know where his assailant lived. The threat was obviously uttered while the accused was angry but this does not impact on its probative value to the issues for which the accused seeks to elicit the evidence in the present trial. There is a risk that a jury, even with firm and careful direction, may misuse the evidence as demonstrating a tendency in the accused towards violence. There is a risk that the evidence may be misused and a danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make an advance ruling under s 192A of the Evidence Act that the accused may introduce the evidence of the incident of 27 February 2015 and the Crown may not introduce evidence that the accused threatened to stab the person who assaulted him.
	


RULINGS


	
	I make the following evidentiary rulings:
	



	
	The evidence of Madison Valentine concerning the purchase of the knife is not admissible.
	
	
	The evidence of Madison Valentine concerning oral admissions made by the accused is admissible.
	
	
	The two telephone intercepts between Madison Valentine and the accused dated 3 and 22 October 2015 are not admissible.
	
	
	The evidence that Madison Valentine spoke to the accused about the fact that “the guy” died after “what happened at the Beachcomber” is admissible.
	
	
	The evidence of Christopher Hughes as to clothing worn (or not worn) by the accused after the incident is admissible.
	
	
	The electronically recorded interview with the accused on 7 April 2015 is admissible.
	
	
	The CCTV still images captured at 11:57pm on 5 April 2015 are admissible.
	
	
	The telephone intercept between the accused and his father on 11 February 2016 is not admissible.
	
	
	The photographs taken during the course of the forensic procedure are not admissible.
	



	
	I indicate the provisional view that, unless a particular photograph of an item seized during the search of the Manoa Road premises depicts an item that is relevant to the incident on 5-6 April 2015 (for example, the shoes or clothing worn by the accused or his brother), I am inclined to the view that it is not admissible.
	
	
	I make an advance ruling under s 192A of the Evidence Act that the accused may introduce the evidence of the incident of 27 February 2015 and the Crown may not introduce evidence that the accused threatened to stab the person who assaulted him.

Introduction

The charges against the accused Macdonald


	
	The accused Macdonald stands charged on an indictment presented on 6 February 2017 with two counts of wilful misconduct in public office as follows:
	


1.   On or about 21 August 2008 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales, then holding public office as Minister for Mineral Resources did in the course of and connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by granting Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd consent to apply for an exploration licence under the Mining Act 1992, without reasonable cause or justification, where such misconduct is serious and meriting criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.

3.   On or about 15 December 2008 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales, then holding public office as Minister for Mineral Resources did in the course of and connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by granting to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd Exploration Licence No. 7270 under the Mining Act 1992, without reasonable cause or justification, where such misconduct is serious and meriting criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.


	
	The Crown case against the accused Macdonald on count 1 is that his conduct in granting consent under the Mining Act 1992 (NSW) to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd to apply for an exploration licence was misfeasance in the exercise of his power because he granted consent with an improper motivation: that of benefiting Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd and John Maitland, who was its Chairman and one of its shareholders. Count 3 relates to the grant of an exploration licence to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd with the same improper motivation.
	
	
	For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the effect of s 13(4) of the Mining Act is that an application for an exploration licence in respect of coal in New South Wales could not be made except with the consent of the Minister. Under s 22 of the Mining Act, the Minister has the power to grant an exploration licence.
	


The charges against the accused Maitland


	
	The accused Maitland is charged with being an accessory before the fact to the two principal offences with which Mr Macdonald is charged. Count 2 charges that the accused Maitland, in respect of the principal offence (count 1):
	


“Between 17 January 2007 and 22 August 2008 in Sydney and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did beforehand, aid, abet, counsel and procure the commission of the said offence.”


	
	Count 4 charges that the accused Maitland, in respect of the principal offence (count 3):
	


“Between 21 August 2008 and 16 December 2008 in Sydney and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did beforehand, aid, abet, counsel and procure the commission of the said offence.”

Overview of the debate regarding the elements


	
	There was considerable debate about the elements of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office. I proposed that documents setting out the elements of each offence charged be given to the jury before addresses, in order to assist counsel to focus on the elements in their addresses, as well as to direct the jury as to these elements for the purposes of their deliberations. The debate largely concerned count 1, on the basis that the wording of the elements would not be materially different for count 3, except in so far as it was necessary to accommodate the different conduct (grant of the exploration licence) and date (15 December 2008). The accused Maitland also had an interest in the debate as the first element of each offence with which he stands charged is the accused Macdonald’s guilt of the respective principal offence.
	
	
	There was also debate about the formulation of various elements in the Crown case against the accused Maitland, including the mens rea required to be proved with respect to the element that Mr Macdonald’s misconduct be so serious as to merit criminal punishment.
	
	
	There were several iterations of the draft elements circulated, including those proposed by the Crown and the accused Macdonald. The purpose of these reasons is to explain why I rejected particular formulations contended for by the Crown and those proposed by Mr Johnston SC, who appeared on behalf of the accused Macdonald, which were supported by Mr Jordan SC, who appeared with Mr Kerkyasharian on behalf of the co-accused Maitland. It is not necessary to set out all these iterations (each of which was marked for identification). However portions will be extracted, where necessary.
	
	
	As noted in the cover sheet, debate on the elements took place over several days, including before 10am. The reason for this was so as to minimise disruption to the jury, which was empanelled on 6 February 2017.
	
	
	I have included, at the end of these reasons, two appendices which contain the elements as handed to the jury. Appendix 1 relates to counts 1 and 3 against the accused Macdonald and Appendix 2 relates to counts 2 and 4 against the accused Maitland. My final decision as to the elements of the offences was made on 8 March 2017 (although rulings as to particular elements had been made before that date), before the Crown began its address. These reasons were made available to the parties on 31 March 2017, after the conclusion of the trial.
	


The ambit of the dispute concerning count 1 and, by analogy, count 3

The holding of public office, the alleged act and the requirement that the alleged act be in connection with public office


	
	It was common ground that the Crown was required to establish that the accused Macdonald was a public official; that he granted consent to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd to apply for an exploration licence; and that the grant of consent was in the course of, or in connection with, his public office. These three matters became the first three elements.
	


The requisite mental state of the accused

The Crown’s initial proposal


	
	The Crown accepted that it needed to prove that the alleged misconduct was both intentional and wilful. The Crown also accepted that it would not be sufficient to establish that the accused Macdonald had no genuine belief that the granting of consent was in the interests of the State of New South Wales, but that it must also prove that the accused was improperly motivated: Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR (2002) 5 HKCFAR 381 at [81] and [83] per Mason NPJ.
	
	
	The Crown initially proposed the following (taken from MFI 16 which was handed up on 23 February 2017):
	


“(3)   In so acting, Mr Macdonald wilfully misconducted himself,

To prove this element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

(a)   Mr Macdonald engaged in the conduct identified in the indictment, that is he granted Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd consent to apply for an exploration licence under the Mining Act 1992; and

(b)   Such conduct as you are satisfied Mr Macdonald engaged in was misconduct because it was performed by Mr Macdonald:

(i)   with an improper motive to confer a selective benefit on John William Maitland and company of which he was director and chairman; and

(ii)   in disregard of the interests of the State of New South Wales;

(c)   That such misconduct you find Mr Macdonald engaged in was ‘wilful’, that is Mr Macdonald knew that he was obliged not to use his position in that way or he knew that it was possible that he was obliged not to use his position in that way but chose to do so anyway.”

The accuseds’ proposal


	
	Mr Johnston proposed that the element that the accused wilfully misconducted himself ought be formulated as follows (taken from MFI 43 which was handed up on 23 February 2017):
	


“(4) In granting consent the accused wilfully misconducted himself;

To prove this element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

(a)   The accused granted such consent with the sole intention of conferring a benefit on John Maitland knowing it was not in the interests of the State; and

(b)   The accused did not have a genuine belief that the grant was in any way in the interests of the State of New South Wales;

(c)   The accused's conduct in granting the consent was misconduct that was a breach of the duties and obligations of the accused's office as a Minister exercising his power under the Mining Act; and

(d)    The accused's conduct was wilful in that he knew that he was obliged not to use his position in that way.”

Intentional misconduct


	
	It was submitted on behalf of both accused that the Crown must prove, as an element of the offence, that the accused Macdonald’s “sole intention” was to benefit Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd and Mr Maitland. They also contended that the Crown had to prove that the accused Macdonald did not have a genuine belief that the grant was “in any way” in the interests of the State of New South Wales. They submitted that this formulation was necessary not only because of the elements of the offence itself, but also because of the way the Crown opened its case.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of both accused, in support of Mr Johnston’s formulation on intention (elements (4)(a) and 4(b) set out above), that this case was relevantly indistinguishable from the trial on indictment of Mr Obeid and that, accordingly, I should adopt a formulation along the lines of that directed by Beech-Jones J in that trial (which is set out in my reasons below).
	


Wilful misconduct


	
	It was submitted on behalf of both accused that knowledge of misconduct was required for the element of “wilfulness” and that recklessness was not sufficient. However, they accepted that, consistently with the judgment of Beech-Jones J in R v Obeid (No. 11) [2016] NSWSC 974, I would include recklessness as an alternative to knowledge in the component of the elements relating to wilfulness (see element 5a. and 5b.).
	


The Crown’s response to the accuseds’ proposal


	
	Subsequently the Crown proposed the following (taken from MFI 49 which was handed up on 24 February 2017) in response to a draft which I circulated:
	


“In so acting, the accused wilfully misconducted himself;

To prove this element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

(a)   The accused engaged in the conduct identified in the indictment, that is he granted Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd consent to apply for an exploration licence under the Mining Act 1992; and

(b)   Such conduct as you are satisfied the accused engaged in was misconduct as it was performed by the accused:

(i) while, to a significant degree, improperly motivated to confer a benefit on John Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd; and

(ii) in breach of the duties and obligations of the accused's office as a Minister exercising power under the Mining Act.

(c)   That such misconduct you find the accused engaged in was 'wilful', that is the accused knew that he was obliged not to use his position in that way or he knew that it was possible that he was obliged not to use his position in that way but chose to do so anyway;”

Consideration

The mental elements of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office

General principles


	
	The gravamen of the offence of misconduct in public office was described by PD Finn in “Public Officers: Some Personal Liabilities” (1977) 51 ALJ 313 at 315 in the following terms:
	


“The kernel of the offence is that an officer, having been entrusted with powers and duties for the public benefit, has in some way abused them, or has abused his official position.”


	
	The formulation of the mental element in the offence was described by Dr Finn in “Official Misconduct” [1978] 2 Crim LJ 307 (Official Misconduct), at 311, as “a source of difficulty in the cases ancient and modern and in both the United Kingdom and the United States”. Of the reasons postulated by the author for this difficulty, the one of present relevance is “the subsumption under one offence of diverse types of misconduct each having very distinctive characteristics” (312).
	
	
	The formulation of the elements of the offence of misuse of public office requires consideration of: the nature of the public office; the nature of the conduct alleged; and whether misfeasance or nonfeasance is alleged. I am indebted to the detailed analysis of the categories of the offence; their elements; and relevant cases, which was undertaken by Dr Finn in Official Misconduct, which has been widely cited with approval: see Question of Law Reserved (No. 2 of 1996) (1996) 67 SASR 63 at 64-65 per Doyle CJ (Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia); Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR at [68] per Mason NPJ (Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal); R v Boulanger [2006] 2 S.C.R. 49 at 55; 2006 SCC 32 (Supreme Court of Canada); R v Quach (2010) 27 VR 310; [2010] VSCA 106 at [7] per Redlich JA, Ashley JA and Hansen AJA agreeing (Victorian Court of Appeal); and R v W(M) [2010] Q.B. 787 at [8] (UK Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)).
	
	
	The conduct alleged in counts 1 and 3 belongs to the category of misconduct in public office, identified by Dr Finn as “malicious” exercise of official power; or misfeasance by abuse of discretion. A discretion is abused where an official, in the exercise of his or her powers, makes a decision from an improper motivation. Dr Finn summarised the requisite mental element, at 319 of Official Misconduct, as follows:
	


“Thus the issue upon which the offence turns in this context is not the correctness or otherwise of the decision as an exercise of official power, but is, rather, the state of mind which informed the decision. Or, to use the language of Abbott C.J., [R v Borron (1820) 3 B. & Ald. 432, at 434; 106 E.R. 721 at 721] “. . . whenever [officers] have been challenged upon this head . . . the question has always been, not whether the act done might, upon full and mature investigation, be found strictly right, but from what motive it had proceeded.” And the “motive” will always be offensive when the official wilfully deviates from a proper exercise of power and a proper discharge of duty in order to pursue some unauthorised end.”


	
	Favouritism to an individual or a group, or preferential treatment to an associate or relative, constitutes an improper motivation. In the present case, the alleged improper motivation was that the accused Macdonald intended to benefit the accused Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd.
	


The element of motivation as distinct from belief or intention


	
	It is apparent from the authorities analysed by Dr Finn that the relevant mental element is motivation, as distinct from knowledge, belief, or intention. For this reason, I do not consider that the formulation for which both accused contended accords with the law. It is the motivation, not the intention or belief, which determines whether the giving of consent or the grant of the licence, as the case may be, amounts to misconduct. As the root of the wrong to be remedied by the law is the same, whether in a civil or criminal context, it is appropriate that the language used to describe the wrong be consistent. In a civil action, an administrative decision can be quashed or set aside on the basis that the decision-maker made the decision from an “improper motive”. The reason for the use of the term “motivation” in the elements, rather than “motive” (which is more usual in the civil context), is so as to maintain the distinction between motivation and motive, which is relevant in a criminal trial for such an offence. This distinction will be addressed in more detail below.
	
	
	To require the Crown to prove, as contended on behalf of both accused, that “the accused granted such consent with the sole intention of conferring a benefit on John Maitland knowing it was not in the interests of the State” and that “the accused did not have a genuine belief that the grant was in any way in the interests of the State of New South Wales” would, in my view, be erroneous.
	
	
	First, to express the requisite mental element in terms of intention, as distinct from motivation, is problematic since it has the potential to import concepts of purpose, which are apt to confuse in a case such as the present, where an inevitable consequence of the grant of consent to apply for an exploration licence, as well as the grant of the licence itself, is to benefit the recipient of the consent or the holder of the exploration licence. In Iannella v French (1968) 119 CLR 84 at 95, Barwick CJ said:
	


“Further, the word intention itself obscures a difficulty. Thus it is said on some occasions to be satisfied by mere volition to do the specific act in question. But in truth, in my opinion, the word contains in its connotation elements of purpose. It is not merely that the mind goes with the act but that the mind intends by the act to achieve something.”


	
	In Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, the High Court (Dixon CJ, Webb and Kitto JJ) said:
	


“The introduction of the maxim or statement that a man is presumed to intend the reasonable consequences of his act is seldom helpful and always dangerous. For it either does no more than state a self-evident proposition of fact or it produces an illegitimate transfer of the burden of proof of a real issue of intent to the person denying the allegation.”


	
	Secondly, the use of the words “sole intention” creates an additional difficulty because the expression tends implies a dichotomy which is, in my view, a false one. This question is addressed below by reference to the decision of the England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Speechley [2005] 2. Cr. App. R. (S.) 15.
	
	
	Thirdly, in so far as it would require proof of knowledge, it would import into the element an inapposite mental state. It is not an element of the offence that the accused knew that the decision was not in the interests of the State. A public officer may believe, or even know, that it is in the interests of the State to grant a licence to a relative but, if the motivation for granting the licence was to benefit the relative, the public officer has misconducted himself or herself.
	
	
	For these reasons I consider it to be clearer in the circumstances of the present case to express the requisite mental element for the accused Macdonald in terms of motivation.
	
	
	Applying these principles to the present case, the question whether the accused Macdonald believed that it was in the public interest to grant consent to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd under s 13(4) or to grant the exploration licence to it under s 22 of the Mining Act, while relevant, is not determinative. He may have believed the giving of consent (or the grant of the exploration licence) to have been in the public interest, but if his motivation in giving consent (or granting the exploration licence) was to benefit Mr Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd, the element of misconduct has been made out. Of course, whenever a Minister gives consent to an applicant to apply for an exploration licence, the Minister confers a benefit on the applicant. But as long as the Minister is motivated to grant the consent because he or she believes it to be in the public interest to do so, there is no misconduct even though a consequence of the grant will be to benefit the applicant.
	
	
	In order to prove the accused Macdonald’s guilt, the Crown must exclude the reasonable possibility that the accused Macdonald was motivated to grant consent for a proper purpose; for example, because he was motivated by the fact that he genuinely believed that giving consent to apply for an exploration licence to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd with the conditions attached regarding the training mine was in the public interest, although he knew that it would incidentally benefit the accused Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd: see, in a different context, Porter v Magill [2002] 2 AC 357 at [144] per Lord Scott of Foscote. For this reason, I do not accept the Crown’s submission that it would be sufficient for it to prove that the accused Macdonald was substantially motivated by the desire to confer a benefit on the accused Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd (which became a. of element 4). In my view, the Crown must also prove, as part of the element regarding motivation, the negative: namely, that the accused Macdonald was not motivated to any significant degree by the object of furthering the interests of the State of New South Wales.
	


R v Speechley and the requirement of substantial motivation


	
	The Crown referred me to the case of R v Speechley. Although the facts are substantially different, the Court of Appeal’s consideration of the mental element required for the offence of wilful misconduct in public office and the question of so-called “mixed motives” is of assistance. R v Speechley concerned a councillor who owned land in Crowland. He was elected to the Crowland Council and became its Leader. He registered his interest in the land but not in such a way as to enable anyone inspecting the register to identify the land in which he was interested. He believed that a particular road, the A1073, ought be realigned because of the number of accidents. It became his “pet project”. The particulars of the offence alleged that the appellant misconducted himself in his public office of Leader of the City Council in that:
	


“He sought to influence the route to be taken by the A1073 road improvement scheme in the area of Crowland with a view to gaining a personal advantage thereby, namely the potential increase in value of a field owned by him at Barbers Drove South, Crowland.”


	
	The appellant challenged the trial judge’s formulation of intention. The Court of Appeal recorded, at [40], that the trial judge relevantly told the jury that it had to be satisfied:
	


“That in influencing the route, the driving force in his mind and his motivation was dishonest.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The Court of Appeal, at [40], set out the following extract from the summing up:
	


"".... if you found -- and it is entirely a matter for you -- that in early 2000 he not only thought that there was potentially something in it for him in shifting the line -- in other words personal financial gain -- but that by moving the line it would, for example, help the inhabitants of Barbers Drove and address the problem of the trees -- two of the things he says he was concerned about -- then what would be the position? He would have two motives for influencing the line, one honest and the other dishonest.

As I have said, and I repeat, if you find he was, or might have been acting solely -- I stress 'solely' -- for perfectly proper motives, namely acting as the local County Councillor for the benefit of the community, as he says, then there can be no dishonesty, no misconduct, and you will acquit him.

However, if he had, so to speak, these dual motives, what is your approach? I said a moment ago that you cannot, and must not, convict unless each of the six things were proved so that you are sure. That remains the case. Even if you were to conclude that Mr Speechley had a genuine and honest motive or motives as well as the dishonest one, I repeat, you can only convict providing you are sure that in influencing the route, the driving force -- that is the key phrase here, 'the driving force' -- in his mind and his motivation was the dishonest one. If, as I say, you are sure of that, you will be entitled to convict. Anything less than sure, you acquit.""


	
	The appellant submitted that the trial judge ought to have given the jury more assistance on the question of “mixed motives” and, in particular, that his Honour ought to have told the jury that it was not enough to show that the appellant knew “by a side wind” that he was going to gain some personal benefit: R v Speechley at [41]. This formulation was taken from R v Llewellyn-Jones (1967) 51 Cr. App. R. 4, which was a decision about the particulars on the indictment.
	
	
	Lord Justice Kennedy, who gave the judgment of the Court, accepted the respondent Crown’s argument that to add a passage about the “side wind” would have created confusion. The Court confirmed that motivation was the relevant factor and said at [44]:
	


“If dishonesty was the driving force in the appellant's mind, and his motivation was dishonest, he cannot have been someone honestly seeking a legitimate goal but knowing that if he succeeded he was going to get some personal benefit by a side wind.”


	
	The Court in R v Speechley added, obiter, that the trial judge had gone further than required in favour of the defence, since it was not necessary that the improper motivation be “the driving force”, and said at [45]:
	


“. . . it would have been sufficient to say that at some relevant time when attempting to influence the route his motivation was dishonest in that he was motivated to a significant degree by considerations of personal advantage. What amounts to a significant degree is something that could properly be left to the good sense of the jury.”


	
	I have incorporated what was said in R v Speechley into the element regarding motivation (which became a. in element 4) to take account of the need for the Crown to prove, not that the improper motivation was the sole one, but that it was a substantial one. In so doing, I have rejected the formulation proposed by the accused, which was largely based on the wording of the direction given by Beech-Jones J in R v Obeid. My reasons for including b. in element 4 have already been addressed above.
	


The relevance of R v Obeid


	
	In order to explain why I consider the formulation in R v Obeid to be inapposite in the present case, it is necessary to consider the indictment presented against Mr Obeid. Mr Obeid was a Member of Parliament who was not, at the relevant time, a Minister. He was charged (and convicted) of wilful misconduct in public office for making representations to Mr Dunn, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Maritime Authority. The indictment presented on 6 June 2016 charged the accused Obeid as follows:
	


“Between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007 in Sydney in the State of New South Wales, then holding public office as a Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales did in the course of or connected to his public office wilfully misconduct himself by making representations to Stephen Paul Dunn, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, Maritime Property Division of the Maritime Authority of New South Wales, with the intention of securing an outcome from the said Maritime Authority favourable to Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Ltd in respect of its tenancies of properties at Circular Quay knowing at the time he made the representations that he had a commercial and/or beneficial and/or family and/or personal interest in the said tenancies which he did not disclose to Stephen Paul Dunn.”


	
	In R v Obeid, Beech-Jones J directed the jury that the Crown had to prove that, between 1 August 2007 and 30 November 2007:
	


“(1)   The accused was a public official;

(2)   The accused acted in the course of or connected to his public office;

(3)   In so acting the accused wilfully misconducted himself;

To prove this element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that:

(a)   The accused engaged in the conduct identified in the indictment that is he made representations to Stephen Paul Dunn with the intention of securing an outcome from the Maritime Authority favourable to Circular Quay Restaurants Pty Ltd in respect of its tenancies of properties at Circular Quay knowing at the time he made the representations that he had a commercial and/or beneficial and/or family and/or personal interest in the tenancies which he did not disclose to Stephen Paul Dunn

(b)   Such conduct as you are satisfied the accused engaged was misconduct, that is a breach of the duties and obligations of his office as a member of the Legislative Council; and

(c)   That such misconduct you find the accused engaged in was 'wilful' that is the accused knew that he was obliged not to use his position in that way or he knew that it was possible that he was obliged not to use his position in that way but chose to do so anyway; and

(4)   The accused's conduct was misconduct that was serious and merits criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.”


	
	As is evident from the prefatory words in element 3(a) and from the indictment, element 3(a) was extracted verbatim from the indictment, which expressly alleged a particular intention. In the summing up, Beech-Jones J said:
	


“Critically are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the accused in making the representations to Mr Dunn was undertaken with the intention of benefitting Circular Quay Restaurants, that is for the purpose of promoting Mr Obeid's pecuniary interests or those of his family or those close to him and that it was not undertaken because he in any way genuinely believed it was in the public interests or the interests of the electorate or even part of the electorate?”


	
	It is apparent from the following passage in the sentencing judgment (R v Obeid (No. 12) [2016] NSWSC 1815) that the direction Beech-Jones J gave in the summing up, extracted above, was given because of the way the indictment was worded:
	


“[47] At this point, it is important to note a specific direction given to the jury about this part of the indictment; ie that part that refers to Mr Obeid having an “intention of securing an outcome” favourable to CQR. At the trial, Mr Tripodi, gave evidence that he had served on a parliamentary committee with Mr Obeid from 1996 to 1998. Mr Tripodi said that he recalled that Mr Obeid had instanced the Circular Quay lessees as examples of government tenants who had been mistreated and referred to other government departments “where they did have a right of renewal and he felt that was good policy”. There was also an agreed fact that Mr Obeid and Mr Tripodi had discussions on that topic after Mr Tripodi became Minister for Ports and Waterways.

[48] Thus, on behalf of Mr Obeid it was submitted to the jury that he had a long held view about unfair government treatment of tenants, including those at Circular Quay. It was also submitted that that matter, and the supposedly innocuous nature of his intervention, negated any suggestion that Mr Obeid intervened to promote his or his family’s financial interests and instead suggested he intervened because he believed the Maritime Authority was mistreating the Circular Quay tenants. A submission to similar effect was made on behalf of Mr Obeid at the sentencing hearing.

[49] This aspect of Mr Obeid’s case raised a possibility that the jury might conclude that, or be left with a doubt about whether, Mr Obeid made representations to Mr Dunn having both an intention to secure a favourable outcome for CQR and a belief that it was part of his duty to his constituents to point out unfair treatment by the Maritime Authority. Over the objection of the Crown, I directed the jury that it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of Mr Obeid “in making the representations to Mr Dunn was undertaken with the intention of benefitting [CQR], that is for the purpose of promoting Mr Obeid’s pecuniary interests or those of his family or those close to him and that it was not undertaken because he in any way genuinely believed it was in the public interest or the interests of the electorate or even part of the electorate”. I directed the jury that if it were not so satisfied then Mr Obeid had to be acquitted.

[50] It follows from its verdict that the jury rejected the reasonable possibility that Mr Obeid was even partly motivated to speak to Mr Dunn by a genuine belief that doing so was in the public interest, the interests of the electorate or even the interests of part of the electorate. Instead, the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Obeid was solely motivated to benefit CQR and through it himself or his family. That aspect of the jury’s finding is especially significant to an assessment of Mr Obeid’s criminality.”

[Footnotes omitted.]


	
	In a subsequent bail judgment (R v Obeid (No. 13) [2016] NSWSC 1840) Beech-Jones J explained that the passage from the summing up set out above arose from the wording of the indictment, which required the Crown to prove the matters alleged: [29]. His Honour said at [30]:
	


“As explained in R v Obeid No 12, the jury's verdict necessarily means that it was satisfied of that and, in particular, that Mr Obeid's sole motivation in speaking with Mr Dunn was to benefit CQR and through it himself or his family. That direction in the context of the trial was potentially overly favourably to Mr Obeid. Be that as it may, there is no inconsistency between that direction and the direction given in respect of his duty because the former concerned a matter of fact alleged in the indictment.”


	
	The present case against the accused Macdonald is relevantly distinguishable. Unlike the indictment in R v Obeid, the indictment presented against the accused Macdonald did not allege any particular mental state. Because of this significant difference between the present charges against the accused Macdonald and the charge in R v Obeid, I am satisfied that it would not correctly reflect the law to articulate the element of motivation in the same way as was done in R v Obeid, as contended for on behalf of both accused in the present case.
	


Conclusion regarding the mental element for misconduct (element 4 of counts 1 and 3)


	
	For the reasons given above, I consider that the mental element for misconduct (which became the fourth element of the offence) ought be expressed as follows:
	


“In granting consent the accused misconducted himself.

To prove this element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, that in granting such consent:

a.   the accused was substantially motivated by the desire to confer a benefit on John Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd; and

b.   the accused was not motivated to any significant degree by the object of furthering the interests of the State of New South Wales.”

The effect of the Crown’s opening on the formulation of the elements


	
	It was further argued on behalf of both accused that the Crown had limited its case against the accused Macdonald in its opening, such that it would be unfair for the Crown to be required to prove only the element as set out above. Both accused contended that, in light of the Crown’s opening, the Crown was obliged to prove that the accused’s “sole intention” was to confer a benefit on Mr Maitland “knowing it was not in the interests of the State”; and that the accused Macdonald “did not have a genuine belief that the grant was in any way in the interests of the State of New South Wales”.
	


The distinction between motive and motivation


	
	Before turning to the way in which the Crown opened its case, I note the important distinction in the present case between motive on the one hand and motivation on the other. For the reasons given above, the motivation of the accused Macdonald is an element of the offence, which therefore needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Motive is a different thing. For example, in the present case, the Crown suggested various possible motives the accused Macdonald’s wanting to benefit Mr Maitland, including: friendship; repayment of a political debt for helping him obtain pre-selection for the March 2007 election; expectation of benefit to his daughter, Sasha; and maintenance of a strategic relationship that had proved to be of mutual benefit in the past and could be expected to help the accused Macdonald after he left Parliament.
	
	
	It is not essential that the Crown establish any particular motive. Evidence tending to establish a motive of that sort is no more than one of many strands of evidence which might contribute to proof of a circumstantial case: Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 242-243 per Dixon CJ (Kitto and Taylor JJ agreeing) and 247-250 per Menzies J; Lane v R (2013) 241 A Crim R 321; [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [275] (Bathurst CJ, Simpson and Adamson JJ). Thus, to prove that, in granting consent, the accused Macdonald was substantially motivated to benefit Mr Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd, the Crown does not have to prove why the accused Macdonald was substantially motivated to confer a benefit on Mr Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd. It just has to prove that, at the relevant time, Mr Macdonald was substantially motivated to confer a benefit on Mr Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd.
	


The Crown’s opening


	
	In its opening, the Crown suggested various motives for the accused Macdonald wanting to benefit the accused Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd by giving consent and granting the exploration licence. At tr. 30 the Crown referred to a possible motive for the accused Macdonald conferring a benefit on the accused Maitland in the following terms:
	


“. . . pursuant to a motive of friendship with Mr Maitland and out of a desire to

maintain and secure that friendship, in circumstances where Mr Macdonald

knew that he was leaving parliament in the foreseeable future.”


	
	The Crown continued, at tr. 31, to open on the questions of motivation and motive as follows:
	


“Mr Macdonald was aware, the Crown says, Mr Maitland stood to gain a personal benefit by his actions in DCM to apply for the exploration licence, and initial exploration licence for the company. As chairman of a company with an exploration licence and the prospect of a mine development, Mr Macdonald knew that Mr Maitland would be in a significantly better position. Now again the Crown says that Mr Macdonald was motivated to grant the consent of 21 August 2008 and to issue the exploration licence, and thus confer the selected benefit on DCM. Because he and Mr Maitland were friends, and political associates. In this regard Mr Macdonald and Mr Maitland had been from the same faction of the Labor Party. And Mr Macdonald's preselections for the 2007 New South Wales elections had been supported by Mr Maitland.

The Crown says further that Mr Macdonald was also motivated to confer this

benefit on Mr Maitland because his political career was due to come to an end in the near future, and Mr Maitland had influence and significant connections in the mining industry, and in particular he was the chairman of DCM. Mr Macdonald's cultivation of the friendship and loyalty to Mr Maitland by granting a direct allocation of the exploration licence to DCM was calculated to enhance the prospect that upon Mr Macdonald's departure from parliament, Mr Maitland and DCM might be useful to him.

And there was nothing, the Crown says, apart from this relationship between

them to distinguish the DCM application from many other companies which

might have been interested in acquiring the exploration licence over the Doyles Creek area on the same sorts of conditions given to DCM. That is the training mine, or training fund, and to which Mr Macdonald did not extend that

opportunity.”


	
	The Crown’s opening of its case against the accused Maitland referred to the requirement of proof of knowledge of the essential facts that made the accused Macdonald’s conduct criminal in the following terms at tr. 33-34:
	


“The Crown says Mr Maitland had knowledge of the essential facts performed

Mr Macdonald which made Mr Macdonald's conduct criminal, and Mr Maitland intentionally encouraged or assisted Mr Macdonald to perform the acts which led to the commission of the crime alleged against Mr Macdonald. The crime of misconduct in public office. The Crown says Mr Maitland must have known the only reason justifying the exercise of the former minister's discretion in favour of DCM was his long-standing relationship with Mr Macdonald. The Crown alleges that Mr Maitland knew enough about mining, and the Doyles Creek proposal, to understand that the very small proportion of coal which was to be extracted under training conditions was something any commercial mine operator would readily agree to in order to obtain an exploration licence. He, therefore, knew, that is Mr Maitland knew, the only considerations against a competitive tender process, and in favour of the direct allocation of DCM, was his friendship with Mr Macdonald, and his position of chairman of that company. The Crown alleges Mr Maitland also knew that if a competitive tender process was adopted, a large additional financial contribution would likely be bid by other interested parties.

. . .

For the purpose of the Crown opening, the Crown says, keeping in mind the

knowledge which the Crown says Mr Maitland must have had, was that Mr

Macdonald's decision to grant DCM consent to apply for exploration licence

was exercised improperly for reasons of impartiality towards Mr Maitland and the company which he was a director and chairman of. Once possessed with

that knowledge, it is the Crown case Mr Maitland committed a series of acts

which he intended would serve the purpose of encouraging Mr Macdonald to

commit the acts specified in Count 1 and in Count 2 of the indictment.”

Submissions on behalf of both accused on the effect of the opening on the elements of the offences


	
	It was argued on behalf of both accused that, by reason of the way the Crown had opened its case, the Crown should have to prove, as an element of the offence, that the accused Macdonald’s sole motivation in granting the consent and the exploration licence was to benefit the accused Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd, and that, accordingly, the elements should be drafted to reflect that requirement.
	
	
	It was further argued by Mr Jordan, on behalf of the accused Maitland, that the Crown had opened the Crown case on the footing that the accused Maitland must have known that the only reason the accused Macdonald had for giving consent to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd to apply for an exploration licence was his long-standing friendship or political or professional relationship with the accused Maitland. I note for completeness that this argument also formed the basis of a no case to answer submission made by the accused Maitland which is the subject of a separate judgment: R v Maitland [2017] NSWSC 167. Mr Jordan submitted that the Crown’s opening with respect to the accused Maitland’s knowledge should have the following consequence: that the Crown was required to prove (as element 1 in count 2, and, necessarily, element 4 in count 1) that the accused Macdonald’s sole motivation in granting consent was the desire to benefit the accused Maitland and Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd.
	


Consideration


	
	I do not accept the interpretation of the Crown opening contended for on behalf of the two accused. The passages referred to, and set out above, from the opening ought, in my view, to be understood as the Crown’s suggesting possible motives for the accused Macdonald’s alleged motivation to benefit the accused Maitland.
	
	
	Further, in so far as the Crown alleged that the accused Maitland knew that the only reason the accused Macdonald would not adopt a competitive tender process was his relationship, whether of friendship, strategic alliance or otherwise, with the accused Macdonald, I understood the Crown to be referring to a process of reasoning by which the jury might infer that the accused Maitland knew that Mr Macdonald had wilfully misconducted himself.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the articulation of the elements of either the offence of wilful misconduct in public office; or for accessory before the fact to that offence, ought be constrained, or modified, in the way for which Mr Johnston and Mr Jordan contended.
	


Whether an element ought be included that the charged conduct was in breach of the duties and obligations of the accused’s public office


	
	The following element was included in my original draft:
	


“The accused’s conduct in granting the consent was misconduct that was a breach of the duties and obligations of the accused’s office as a Minister exercising power under the Mining Act.”


	
	A similarly worded element was included in the draft originally proposed by Mr Johnston, which was supported by Mr Jordan. The inclusion of this element accorded with the list of elements articulated by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Quach, which were approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P and Leeming JA) in Obeid v R (2015) 91 NSWLR 226; [2015] NSWCCA 309 at [133].
	
	
	However, in the course of argument on 27 February 2017, Mr Johnston submitted that this element was otiose and, potentially, duplicitous because it was difficult to see what, if anything, it added to the element regarding motivation. Mr Jordan supported this submission. The Crown did not speak against its removal from the list of elements, although it contended that directions would need to be given about the duties and obligations of a Minister of the Crown in the context of the powers under the Mining Act.
	
	
	Although the concessions made by the parties that this element, as originally drafted (extracted above), need not be included relieves me of the obligation to give reasons for deleting that element, I propose to explain why I consider it to be unnecessary in the present case to express the matter in terms of duty and breach.
	
	
	The present case is to be distinguished from that of Mr Obeid, who was charged with making representations to a public official with a particular intention and R v Quach, in which a police officer was alleged to have wrongfully used his office to procure sexual penetration of a woman. A parliamentarian is entitled to make representations to public authorities on behalf of the public, or a sector of the public. The nature and extent of the duties and obligations of a Member of Parliament when making representations therefore needed to be articulated and proved, together with the alleged breach, as an element of the offence.
	
	
	The wilful misconduct alleged against the accused Macdonald belongs to a different category: the nature of the office of Minister and the limits on the motivations for which statutory powers such as those under the Mining Act may be exercised are so well established as not to require articulation in terms of duties and obligations and their breach. The powers under ss 13(4) and 22 of the Mining Act are conferred on the Minister on the basis that they are to be exercised in the public interest and not for the personal advantage of the Minister or for the benefit of his or her friends, family or associates. It would inevitably be a breach of the duties and obligations of a Minister exercising power under ss 13(4) and 22 of the Mining Act for the Minister to be motivated to a significant degree by the desire to confer a benefit on a particular individual or company and not to be motivated to a significant degree by the furtherance of the interests of the State of New South Wales.
	
	
	Accordingly, if the jury found the element regarding motivation (which became 4a. and 4b.) proved to the requisite standard, it must necessarily be satisfied of the draft element expressed in terms of duties and breach. I am persuaded that to include the additional element would have the potential to confuse the jury since it would imply that there might be other unarticulated matters of breach of duties or obligations which constitute an element of the offence.
	
	
	The proposition that it is unnecessary to refer to duties and obligations separately when the duties are so well-established as not to require additional articulation (as in the present case) as opposed to other cases (such as R v Obeid) finds support in the authorities reviewed in Official Misconduct. In State v Furey 318 A.2d 783 (NJ 1974) the Superior Court of New Jersey (Appellate Division) set out and applied the following principles:
	



	
	“Misconduct in office” means any act or omission in breach of a duty of public concern by one who has accepted public office; or the violation of a prescribed duty to the public for which the offender may be indicted at common law.
	
	
	Subject to (3) below, an indictment for misconduct in office must allege a prescribed duty and the facts constituting the breach.
	
	
	Where the prescribed duties of an officer arise out of the very nature of the office, the source of the duty need not be alleged since judicial notice may be taken of the duties of an office which arise out of the very nature of the office.
	



	
	For these reasons, I was satisfied that it would not be appropriate to include an element requiring the Crown to prove separately, in respect of count 1, that the accused Macdonald’s conduct in granting the consent was misconduct that was a breach of the duties and obligations of the accused Macdonald’s office as a Minister exercising power under the Mining Act.
	


The element of wilfulness (element 5 in counts 1 and 3)


	
	It was argued on behalf of both accused that the element of wilfulness could be satisfied only if the Crown proved that the accused Macdonald knew that he was obliged not to use his position in that way. The Crown contended that it could satisfy the element of wilfulness by proving either: that the accused Macdonald knew that he was obliged not to use his position in that way; or that he knew that it was possible that he was obliged not to use his position in that way but chose to do so anyway.
	
	
	The sufficiency of recklessness in this context was considered by Beech-Jones J in R v Obeid (No. 11). After reviewing the authorities, his Honour concluded at [23]:
	


“[23] It is firmly established in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong that the common law offence of wilful misconduct in public office is made out in circumstances where the accused is reckless as to whether their act or omission was in breach of the duties and obligations attaching to their office. The judgments which establish that proposition were the basis for the formulation of the elements of the office in Quach and the reference to “wilful misconduct” in Quach at [46] should be read consistently with those judgments. Such a conclusion is supported by those decisions that construe the phrase “wilfully” in a statutory context as requiring some advertence by the accused to the illegality of their conduct. Otherwise there is no reason in policy or principle why the offence should not be made out where the public officer is reckless as to their breach of duty.”


	
	I respectfully follow his Honour’s conclusion that recklessness is sufficient to establish the element of wilfulness. Accordingly, the element of wilfulness was expressed as follows (element 5 in counts 1 and 3 in the version provided to the jury which is set out in full in Appendix 1 to these reasons):
	


“The accused’s misconduct was wilful.

To prove this element the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew either that:

a.   he was obliged not to use his position in that way; or

b.   it was possible that he was obliged not to use his position in that way but chose to do so anyway.”

The element that the conduct be without reasonable cause or justification (element 6 in counts 1 and 3)


	
	It was proposed on behalf of both accused, and accepted by the Crown, that the absence of reasonable cause or justification ought be included as a separate element of the charges against the accused Macdonald. This element was included in the list of elements in R v Quach at [8] (taken from Sin Kam Wah & Lam Cheun Ip v HKSAR [2005] 2 HKLRD 375 at 391 per Mason NPJ), which was approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Obeid v R. I note that it was not included in the list of elements for the offence with which Obeid was charged in R v Obeid, the trial before Beech-Jones J referred to above. I assume that the issue of reasonable cause or justification was not a live one, having regard to the circumstances of that case.
	
	
	I raised with the parties the concern that the addition of this element in the present case was unnecessary, in that it did not add anything to the element about motivation (which was, ultimately, element 4). However both accused contended that it was a live issue in that it was part of the accused Macdonald’s case that he granted consent and the exploration licence because the Department had advised him that granting consent for a direct allocation was an available option and that the Department had recommended that he sign the documentation for the exploration licence. The Crown did not speak against the inclusion of the element that the conduct be without reasonable cause or justification. In these circumstances, I included as a separate element (which became element 6 of counts 1 and 3) that the conduct (the giving of consent or granting of the exploration licence) be without reasonable cause or justification.
	


The elements of the offence of being an accessory before the fact to the principal offence of wilful misconduct in public office

Whether Mr Macdonald committed the principal offence (element 1 in counts 2 and 4)


	
	There were two issues in relation to element 1 of counts 2 and 4. These issues were discussed by reference to count 2, although they were also applicable to count 4. First, Mr Jordan contended that no reference to count 1 ought be made in the elements of count 2, since the trials were separate, although they were being heard together. He submitted that count 2 was self-contained and the first element ought be worded to refer to the “principal offence” rather than to count 1. I accepted Mr Jordan’s submission (which was not opposed by the Crown). Second, Mr Jordan also submitted that the individual components of each element ought be set out in full to avoid the jury’s having to refer back to the elements for count 1 when considering count 2. I also accepted this submission (which was also not opposed by the Crown). Element 1 (of counts 2 and 4) in Appendix 2 reflects my acceptance of Mr Jordan’s submissions.
	


The separation of the intention and knowledge required to be proved against the accused Maitland into two elements


	
	The Crown initially proposed that the only additional element required to be proved in respect of count 2, apart from proof of the principal offence should be worded as follows (MFI 16):
	


“(2)   In respect of Count 1 on the indictment, between 17 January 2007 and 22 August 2008:

(a)   Mr Maitland had knowledge of all the essential facts performed by Mr Macdonald which made Mr Macdonald’s conduct criminal; and

(b)   Mr Maitland intentionally encouraged or assisted Mr Macdonald to perform the acts which led to the commission of the crime of misconduct in public office.”


	
	The reference to count 1 in the elements of count 2 has been addressed above. Mr Jordan submitted further that it would be more helpful for the jury if the matters of intention and knowledge were set out in full rather than incorporated in a summary way as contended for by the Crown. I accepted this submission. In my view, the formulation proposed by the Crown tends to beg the question of what the “essential facts” were.
	
	
	For these reasons, intention and knowledge are dealt with separately as elements 3 (for intention) and 4 (for knowledge) as set out in Appendix 2 to these reasons.
	


The knowledge of the accused Maitland (element 4 in counts 2 and 4)


	
	An issue arose as to what the Crown had to prove the accused Maitland knew of the chance that the accused Macdonald would grant the consent (in relation to count 2) or grant the exploration licence (in relation to count 4) at the time the accused Maitland encouraged and assisted the accused Macdonald. The first version I proposed (in a draft marked MFI 64) was as follows:
	


“4)   That, at the time the accused encouraged and assisted Mr Macdonald, he knew that:

. . .

b.   Mr Macdonald had the power to give consent to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd to apply for an exploration licence under the Mining Act 1992 (NSW) and that there was a real possibility that he would grant such consent.”


	
	On further reflection, I considered that the word “prospect” was preferable to “possibility” since it did not have the connotations of a chance less than 50% and did not invite comparison with “probability”. I note that Mr Jordan’s preference was for “prospect” and neither the Crown nor Mr Johnston wished to be heard against the word “prospect”.
	


The relationship between element 7 in counts 1 and 3 (whether the accused Macdonald’s misconduct merited criminal punishment) and element 5 in counts 2 and 4 (the mental state required of an accessory before the fact)

No mental state required to be proved in respect of the principal offender for the element of misconduct meriting criminal punishment


	
	It was common ground that element 7 in counts 1 and 3 required no mental element to be established by the Crown. It was also accepted that it ought be expressed in the following terms:
	


“The accused’s conduct was misconduct that was serious and merits criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.”

The mental state required for the alleged accessory before the fact


	
	The issue arose as to whether a mental element was required for element 5 of counts 2 and 4, in light of the acceptance that there was no mental element for the corresponding element, 7, for the alleged principal offender. It was accepted that the approach laid down in R v Chapman [2015] 2 Cr. App. R. 10 ought be followed. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd CJ, who delivered the judgment of the England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Chapman, addressed, in the context of the offence of wilful misconduct in public office, the effect of the requirement that an alleged aider and abettor know the essential matters that constituted the principal offence. Lord Thomas said at [55] that the jury’s assessment of whether the principal offender’s misconduct was so serious as to merit criminal punishment had to be made solely by reference to what the aider and abettor actually knew. The element was therefore formulated to include that restriction to make it clear that the jury was prohibited from taking into account, in their assessment of whether the misconduct was so serious as to merit criminal punishment, any matter unless they were satisfied that the aider and abetter was aware of it.
	
	
	This approach was followed with approval by the Court of Appeal in France v R [2016] EWCA Crim 1588 at [8]-[10] by Lady Justice Hallett who delivered the reasons of the Court (which also comprised King and Dove JJ).
	
	
	For these reasons, I directed the jury that element 5 in counts 2 and 4 required proof of the following:
	


“That the facts of which the accused was aware were sufficient to result in Mr Macdonald’s misconduct being serious and meriting criminal punishment having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those objects.”

4276212,R v Brooks (No 2) [2017] NSWSC 260,"Judgment


	
	At the conclusion of Mr Boe’s opening address, the learned Crown Prosecutor made an application that the jury be discharged. The basis of the application was that Mr Boe’s opening exceeded the boundaries set by s 159 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). I declined the application for discharge of the jury and the trial is continuing. These are my reasons for that decision.
	
	
	The Crown submitted generally that defence counsel’s opening was argumentative in that it contained submissions rather than elucidating the issues that would arise in the trial. Specific complaint was made of the following passage which came at the end of the opening address [1] :
	


“As his Honour said no matter what happens to this case it is terribly sad. I am not here in any respect to impart blame on anybody else. I am here to give Mr Bradley Brooks a chance. Just remember this, you heard he's been in custody. He's been sitting in gaol for two years waiting to be able to give you his account of what happened on this night. For that reason I ask you to be patient because the Crown case as you would expect is all one way. Some of it will be addressed in cross examination but please be patient. Please give Bradley the opportunity to explain what happened and you will get that from the evidence. Listen to the law and his Honour will explain to you the important the issue that Bradley does not have to prove that he had to do that in self defence. Brad does not have to prove he did not act with intent to cause grievous bodily harm or death. The Crown bears the onus on the very capable shoulders of Mr Baker to prove to you those elements. I have to keep this case short and focussed on what it is I am asking from you, the courtesy of allowing me to fairly present his case to you and to listen carefully to the evidence and the critical things I have identified, thank you.” [2] 


	
	Mr Boe conceded that he should not have said that his client had been in gaol for two years waiting to explain himself and that this was an unnecessary flourish. Apart from the emotive and argumentative impact of that statement, it creates an expectation in the jury that the accused will give evidence in the trial when he is under no obligation to do so and when, as I understand it, a decision on that critical forensic choice is yet to be made. [3] 
	
	
	However, Mr Boe defended the balance of his opening and maintained that he raised Mr Brooks’ custodial status as a response to the Crown Prosecutor raising the matter in his opening. As I indicated in argument, I had not picked up that part of the Crown’s opening. [4]  However, I accepted Mr Boe’s recollection, the learned Crown Prosecutor did not contest it and the transcript bears it out. The Crown Prosecutor’s opening included:
	


“Ms Valentine also told police later that she had spoken to Bradley Brooks after he was charged, and when he was in custody. Ms Valentine spoke to Mr Brooks about what had happened and this was at a time when Mr Brooks had been charged with both offences, the alleged offences of murdering Gregory Gibbins and also of wounding Adam Swindell.” [5] 


	
	This was a reference to some evidence that was admitted over objection. [6]  The basis of the objection concerned the ambiguity of the admission and the fact that the accused’s formal admissions reduced the probative value of the conversation (or made it irrelevant altogether). I did not understand the objection involved the contention that leading the evidence would necessarily disclose that the accused was in custody. Whether, in leading this evidence, it is necessary to refer to the fact that the accused was in custody at the time is doubtful. However, that matter was not raised in the pre-trial arguments and I am not aware whether counsel discussed the manner in which this evidence would be led prior to the opening addresses. In the course of the pre-trial hearing, objection was also taken to two telephone intercepts recorded when the accused was in gaol. One of the things relied on to establish prejudice was the fact that these would necessarily disclose that the accused was in custody. [7]  The recordings were excluded, but not on that basis. [8]  As I said in argument, the fact that an accused person is in custody in a murder case is not surprising and any prejudice can usually be cured by direction. [9]  Nevertheless, where the evidence can remain silent or neutral on the issue, it is preferable that the matter is not raised because it is irrelevant and at least capable of giving rise to some prejudice.
	
	
	As I said, I am not privy to any conversations between counsel as to how this evidence is to be adduced or whether there was any discussion about leading the evidence of the conversation without reference to where the conversation took place. In any event, for present purposes, all that needs to be observed is that the accused’s custodial status was referred to in the Crown Prosecutor’s opening and defence counsel was entitled to respond to that matter. However, as Mr Boe accepts, the response included an unnecessary and inappropriate flourish. That part of the defence opening was argumentative and emotive.
	
	
	Two questions arise. The first is whether there was a breach of the statutory provision that allows an accused to make an “opening address”. The second concerns the consequences that flow from such a breach and, more particularly, whether it is necessary or appropriate to discharge the jury.
	
	
	Section 159 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1989 (NSW) allows the defence to make an opening statement but it places some restrictions on its content. The section is in the following terms:
	


“159 Opening address to jury by accused person

(1) An accused person or his or her Australian legal practitioner may address the jury immediately after the opening address of the prosecutor.

(2) Any such opening address is to be limited generally to an address on:

(a) the matters disclosed in the prosecutor’s opening address, including those that are in dispute and those that are not in dispute, and

(b) the matters to be raised by the accused person.

(3) If the accused person intends to give evidence or to call any witness in support of the defence, the accused person or his or her Australian legal practitioner is entitled to open the case for the defence before calling evidence, whether or not an address has been made to the jury.”


	
	In R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 81; (2004) 145 A Crim R 148 the Court of Criminal Appeal (Levine and Howie JJ, Smart AJ) made observations about the limitations the statute is said to place upon counsel for an accused person. The ground of appeal with which their Honours were concerned was that the trial miscarried as a result of the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address. In particular, the ground complained that the address “undermined the effect of the directions his Honour gave concerning the need to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with great care and the problems caused by the very lengthy delay in complaint.” In separate judgments, and to varying degrees, the members of the Court indicated that the Crown Prosecutor had exceeded the bounds of appropriateness and propriety in his closing address. However, in spite of what seems to have been an egregious breach of the special position held by the Crown Prosecutor in the system of criminal justice, [10]  the majority held that the conduct did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. Smart AJ came to the contrary view and would have quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial.
	
	
	The Judges considered that the impugned part of the Crown’s closing address appeared to be a response to the opening statement of defence counsel that exceeded the parameters established by s 159. The impermissible passage in the defence opening was identified by Smart AJ at [189] as follows:
	


“Reference has been made by the learned Crown to the fact that these matters are very old, 19 or 20 years ago. In many respects we are stepping back in time, not only in relation to the events that occurred, but to the law that existed then. You have heard the term buggery used. They referred to them as an abominable crime of buggery you might think that represented the sort of morality that existed then even in relation to this offence. It is not referred to in that term any more. So looking back the time as events that occurred, but looking back in time in relation to the law that was applied then and that has a number of effects and I would ask you to keep that in the forefront of your mind when you are considering the evidence, because you have to assess this evidence to that degree of your being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	Levine and Howie JJ, while finding the Crown to have acted inappropriately, declined to uphold this ground of appeal on the basis that it did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. Howie J, in particular, came to that conclusion because the prosecutor was responding to the impermissible part of the defence counsel’s opening statement. His Honour then delivered the following, often enough quoted, passage concerning the restrictions created by s 159:
	


“The purpose of the defence opening address under s 159(2), therefore, is to define, for the jury’s benefit, the real issues in the trial and what the accused might say in answer to the Crown’s allegation. It is not an opportunity for defence counsel to embark upon a dissertation on the onus and standard of proof, or the functions of judge and jury, or to anticipate the directions or warnings to be given by the trial judge, or to urge upon the jury the way that they should assess the evidence of a witness to be called in the Crown case. It behoves trial judges to ensure that the addresses of counsel are not open to abuse, particularly in a case where the contents of the address is circumscribed by a provision of an Act. To permit counsel to ignore such a limitation is not in the interests of justice, either generally or in the particular case. It may be appropriate for a trial judge to ensure, before the defence opens and in the absence of the jury, that defence counsel is aware of the limited basis of an opening under s 159 and that the address will comply with it.”


	
	Howie J quoted the second reading speech introducing s 159 into the Criminal Procedure Act. [11]  The extent to which it is appropriate to resort to such secondary materials is well established. [12]  The terms of s 159 are reasonably clear. Defence counsel is permitted to open both (i) in response to matters raised in the prosecutor’s opening and (ii) in respect of matters that will be raised by the accused. The inclusion of the word “generally” supports the proposition that the legislation ought not to be read in “a narrow and pedantic manner”. [13]  The legislature did not restrict defence counsel to a statement that “outline[s] the issues in contention between the prosecution and defence”. [14]  In Karapandzk, Doyle CJ observed that the New South Wales provision “appears to give somewhat more latitude to counsel than does” its South Australian equivalent. [15]  His Honour approved the comments of Howie J in MM.
	
	
	As I indicated in argument, it may be that I take a more relaxed view than other judges but it is well accepted that defence counsel is not permitted (any more than the Crown Prosecutor is permitted) to engage in emotive and argumentative advocacy in opening the case for the jury. However, the section allows defence counsel to do more than simply identify the issues to be litigated in the proceedings. It should be remembered that trials like the present generate a great deal of emotion. In the present case, there are to be agreed facts concerning the injuries and cause of death of the victims and the accused has made extensive formal admissions. [16]  Nevertheless, the learned Crown Prosecutor, quite properly, detailed the injuries in his opening address. [17]  This caused people, who I assume are members of the victim’s family, and who are sitting with a large contingent of supporters in the public gallery, to become noticeably emotional. Some people in the public gallery were crying. Some of defence counsel’s opening was calculated to neutralise such emotion and to invite the jury put aside such emotion and focus on the true issues in the trial. Mr Boe invited the jury to “get rid of all the noise that is going to go on in this case and get down to the true issue”. [18] 
	
	
	The defence opening sailed somewhat close to the wind when Mr Boe referred to the evidence to be given by some of the witnesses to be called by the Crown. The address came perilously close to argument. In particular, the defence opening referred to the fact that the victim of the second count, Mr Swindell, only conceded that he pushed Joel Brooks to the ground after being asked many questions by the police in the recorded interview. [19]  However, that part of the opening was a response to the learned Crown Prosecutor’s opening statement in which he said that the evidence would show that Mr Swindell pushed Joel Brooks “causing him to move backwards”. [20] . In view of the fact that one of the issues is whether Bradley Brooks’ action immediately thereafter was an act done in self-defence, it is clearly relevant for the jury to know that there is a dispute in relation to exactly what had happened between Mr Swindell and Joel Brooks before the accused intervened. It was open to the defence to point out that the summary provided by the Crown, while entirely proper and based on part of the evidence expected to be called, did not represent all of the evidence that would be called, that the narrative was in dispute and that there was an issue surrounding the credibility of the witnesses. These are “matters to be raised by the accused person.” [21] 
	
	
	While I accept Mr Boe’s concession that he exceeded the appropriate boundaries by telling the jury that his client had waited for two years in gaol to tell his story, I am otherwise not persuaded that the address breached the terms of s 159. Any reference to the onus of proof or matters of law was fleeting and merely echoed things that both the learned Crown Prosecutor and I had said to the jury. Those parts of the opening address that bordered on argument were truly responsive to matters raised by the Crown, were “matters to be raised by the accused”, or both.
	
	
	A matter of great importance in determining the application to discharge the jury was the tone of the opening statement. There was nothing unduly emotive in the tone of the address. The delivery was quiet and restrained. At one stage, the delivery was so quiet that the court reporters and others in the courtroom had difficulties hearing counsel.
	
	
	It is also important to remember that the opening occurred in the afternoon of the first day of a trial that is expected to last two to three weeks. It came in the face of both counsel and myself telling the jury that the barristers’ opening addresses were not evidence. After the address was given and the admissions were tendered as Exhibit 1, I reminded the jury that Exhibit 1 was the first piece of evidence tendered in the trial and that the addresses of counsel were not evidence. [22] 
	
	
	In that context, I can see little merit in the argument that defence counsel’s opening address has affected the fairness of the trial adversely or that the jury’s ability to consider the issues fairly and objectively has been compromised in any way. I expect that the opening addresses, while of great assistance to the jury in understanding the issues that it will have to decide, will have no impact when the jury comes to consider its verdicts in two or three weeks time.
	
	
	It has been held that there must be “a high degree of need” before a trial Judge accedes to an application to discharge a jury. [23]  In Miller v R [24]  the Court of Criminal Appeal summarised some of the relevant principles:
	


“The principles relating to an application for the discharge of the jury and appellate review thereof were reviewed by this Court in Khazaal v R [2010] NSWCC 129 per Hall J at [265] ff. The following principles emerge from his Honour’s review and from the two leading cases he cites Crofts v R [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427 and Maric v R (1978) 52 ALJR 631:

1) In determining whether the jury must be discharged following the wrongful admission of evidence, there is no rigid rule to be applied: Crofts at 440.

2) In deciding an application to discharge the jury, key considerations include:

a) the fairness of the trial: Crofts at 440;

b) the nature of the statements said to have given rise to the prejudice, including whether they were such as to “have been left vividly etched on the mind of the jury”: Crofts at 441;

c) the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues: Crofts at 440;

d) the stage at which the mishap occurs: Crofts at 440; Maric at 635;

e) the deliberateness of the wrongful conduct: Crofts at 440; Maric at 635;

f) the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome the apprehended impact of the evidence, and particularly the difficulty of formulating a direction that does not refer specifically to the evidence and by doing so reinforce the prejudice: Crofts at 440-441; Maric at 635.

3) Such damage as was caused by the wrongly admitted evidence may not be capable of remedy by trial directions: Maric at 635.

4) The test to be applied by appellate courts reviewing the discretion to discharge has been stated in a variety of ways. However, in Maric, at 635, it was noted that ‘[a]t basis, the question is whether [the court] can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict’, and in Crofts, at 441, the question was put similarly as whether, in the circumstances, the appellate court can ‘say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable’.

5) Significant leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations, bearing in mind:

‘… that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript’: Crofts at 440-441.

6) Nevertheless, the duty of an appellate court considering a challenge to the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge ‘is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind’: Crofts at 441, but rather must apply the broader test stated at (4) above’”


	
	Any prejudice caused by defence counsel’s opening was easily remedied by direction. Immediately on the conclusion of the opening I reminded the jury that the addresses were not evidence. [25]  As to the reference that the accused had been held in custody, the jury was directed at the end of the second day:
	


“Finally, I want to give you a direction of law that is a specific example of a general direction I gave you when I spoke to you just after you were empanelled as a jury yesterday. What I told you yesterday was that as judges you are to disregard and put out of your minds matters of prejudice and sympathy.

Something that was said by both of the barristers in their openings leads me to give you this more specific direction about it. Both barristers mentioned, when they opened the case to you, that Mr Brooks was in custody after he was charged. Mr Crown referred to a conversation he had with Madison Valentine and said he was in custody when he spoke to Ms Valentine. Mr Boe then went on to say that he had been sitting in gaol waiting to give you his account of what happened.

The fact that Mr Brooks has been in custody, and assuming there is evidence of that as opposed to what the barristers told you in their openings which, as I have said, is not evidence; even if there is evidence of it, that is not a relevant consideration of the things you are going to have to decide in two or three weeks time.

The fact is that in New South Wales these days it is very rare for a person charged with murder to get bail and be released before their trial is held. That is the case, even when the person is young, even when the person has no criminal record or even if there might be a delay for two years before the trial is held. The usual situation is that the person does not get bail awaiting trial.

The fact that Mr Brooks has been held in custody must not be used against him in any way. You should not draw any inferences against him. It is just the way the system works.

But, equally, the fact should not be used in any way in his favour, because you are sympathetic to him because he has been in custody awaiting his trial and is a young man presumed by the law to be innocent. You cannot take the matter into account in either way: there is no prejudice because he has been locked up, or sympathy because he has been locked up. You should simply regard it as having nothing to do with the things you are going to have to decide.” [26] 


	
	Taking into account the relevant principles and bearing in mind the relatively minor nature of the breach, the period of time that will elapse before the jury retires to consider its verdicts and the capacity of directions to cure any prejudice that might flow to the prosecution; I discerned no merit in the application to abort the trial. There was certainly no “high degree of need” to discharge the jury in the circumstances that prevailed.
	
	
	For those reasons, the application to discharge the jury was refused.

		17 November 2017",2017-03-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276217,R v Brooks (No 3) [2017] NSWSC 261,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	The accused has objected to evidence proposed to be adduced through the next witness, Mr Sean Bailey. The evidence concerns statements made to Mr Bailey in the immediate aftermath of the stabbing of the witness and alleged victim, Adam Swindell. While Mr Swindell is not identified by name, it appears to be common ground that the jury may readily infer that the person to whom Mr Bailey was speaking was Mr Swindell. For one thing it seems that he was the only person in the area who had been stabbed in the arm.
	
	
	The statement of Mr Bailey tendered on the voir dire as exhibit VD6 records the following conversation and circumstances:
	


“11.   I then saw a number of people crouching down around the guy I saw trip on the gutter. It is at this point one of our guards Bernadette walked over. When Bernadette was over there, she yelled out to me to come over. When I went over there, the first thing I noticed was blood everywhere on this guy in the gutter. Not just on him but on the road too. I saw someone had taken their shirt off and placed it in the wound of the guy that was on the ground.

12.    Whilst standing there, I had a male walk up to me that had been stabbed in the arm. From Memory I think the stab wound was on his left arm but cannot remember 100%.

13.   I had a conversation with this male. I said, ‘What happened?’

He said, ‘I’ve been stabbed.’

I said, ‘By who?

He said, ‘By two guys’. As he said this, he was pointing in the direction of west on Main Road.

I said, ‘Was that the guy in the red shirt?’

He said, ‘Yeah’. This guy started to talk to other people then.”


	
	It is the prosecution case that the guy in the “red shirt” – really a red singlet according to a photograph taken earlier on the night and the accused's formal admissions in exhibit 1 – is the accused Bradley Brooks.
	
	
	Something like eleven eyewitnesses have given evidence to this point in the trial and it is fair to say that there is a good deal of inconsistency between the various versions of events given by those witnesses. As the Crown opened its case, it contends that there were two incidents that occurred very shortly after one another. In the first incident Bradley Brooks is alleged to have stabbed Gregory Gibbins in the chest while they were standing outside a pizza shop on Main Road at Toukley. That stabbing occurred immediately after a confrontation between Joel Brooks and Adam Swindell in which the latter pushed the former backwards and possibly to the ground.
	
	
	The second incident occurred a very short distance away from the pizza shop and around the corner in a vacant lot or parking area. On the prosecution case, this second incident occurred when Adam Swindell ran and was chased by Joel and Bradley Brooks. Again, there is a good deal of inconsistency in the evidence as to whether Bradley Brooks – that is, the man in the red shirt or singlet – was present during that second incident.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Bailey to which objection is taken is hearsay evidence. Accordingly it is inadmissible under s 59 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) unless there is an exception to the hearsay rule. In this case the prosecution relies on the exception in s 66 of the Evidence Act which applies in criminal proceedings where the maker of a previous representation is available to give evidence about the asserted fact. In this case the maker of the previous representation is Adam Swindell. The asserted fact or facts that may be established by the alleged representation to Mr Bailey include that Mr Swindell was stabbed by two guys and that one of them was the guy in the red shirt.
	
	
	Section 66 provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation, that is given by (a) the person (that is Mr Swindell) or (and I underline or) (b) a person who saw or heard the representation being made (that is Mr Bailey) provided that ""when the representation was made the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation"" (again, that is Mr Swindell).
	
	
	Section 66 only applies if the person who made the representation has been, or is to be, called in the proceedings. In this case Mr Swindell has been called to give evidence. He was the first eyewitness in the case and has been excused.
	
	
	The basis of the objection developed over the course of the argument. [1]  Ultimately, it was conceded that s 66 applied to the evidence. In particular it was accepted that Mr Swindell had been called to give evidence and that the asserted fact was fresh in his memory at the time that Mr Swindell allegedly made the representation to Mr Bailey. However, it was submitted that there was unfairness in allowing the evidence to be given by Mr Bailey because Mr Swindell gave no evidence of making any such representation to any person. In fact, Mr Swindell was not asked by the learned Crown Prosecutor whether he spoke to a security guard or to any other person in the immediate aftermath of the stabbing.
	
	
	Accordingly, it was put that the defence did not have the opportunity to test Mr Swindell as to whether he made such a representation. [2]  Mr Boe accepted in argument that this submission was not strictly correct. [3]  The defence did have the opportunity to cross-examine on the issue but made the sound forensic decision not to raise the subject, given that the issue had not been examined upon in the evidence-in-chief.
	
	
	The provision in s 66 plainly contemplates circumstances where the maker of the representation does not give evidence of the representation. That is plain by the use of the word ""or"" in subs (2) between subparagraphs (a) and (b). In other words, the evidence of the previous representation can be given (to use the facts of this case) by Mr Swindell himself, or by Mr Bailey, or conceivably by both.
	
	
	There are a number of authorities supporting that construction. For example, in a restricted judgment, [4]  the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal held at [42]:
	


“[I]t also has to be borne in mind that s 66 does not require that the complainant remembers having made a complaint to someone else. By its express terms, s 66(2) contemplates circumstances where an offence is fresh in the complainant's mind at the time that a complaint is made, but the complainant does not later remember having made that complaint.""


	
	The Victorian Court of Appeal came to a similar conclusion in Singh v The Queen. [5]  In that case the complainant in a rape case had no memory either of the incident giving rise to the allegation of rape, or any memory of having complained to people after the event. The Crown case was that she was so drunk that she was incapable of giving consent to sexual intercourse. The prosecution was permitted to call evidence of the complaint she had made, even though she could give no evidence either of the rape itself or of any complaint that she made. The Court not only held that the evidence was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to s 66, but also rejected a variety of arguments that the admission of the evidence gave rise to unfair prejudice.
	
	
	In Griffin v The Queen [6]  the Victorian Court of Appeal held at [17]:
	


“The first matter raised on the hearing can be dealt with briefly. The High Court has determined the point. In Breen v The Queen the High Court made it clear that evidence of complaint could satisfy the requirements of the law with respect to the admissibility of complaints in cases of sexual offences even when the complainant gave no evidence of making the particular complaint.”


	
	Breen v The Queen [7]  was a case in the High Court decided well before the introduction of the Uniform Evidence Laws and at a time when evidence of complaint in sexual assault matters fell into a special exception to the hearsay rule. Further, the evidence in such cases was admitted not to prove the fact of the allegation but to bolster the complainant's credibility.    The extent to which that decision should guide the interpretation of s 66 may be thought to be questionable.
	
	
	However, the terms of s 66 are clear. There is no requirement that the complainant or the person who made the previous representation give evidence of the representation. Putting to one side the temporal proximity requirement (that is “fresh in the memory”), all that is required is that the person is available to give evidence and has been, or will be, called in the proceedings.
	
	
	It would be an unusual case where the operation of s 66 itself would give rise to relevant unfairness under ss 135 and 137. [8]  However, I accept that there may be such cases but I do not accept that this is one of them. While the representation to Mr Bailey itself was not subject to evidence, the facts sought to be established by the representation were given by Mr Swindell.
	
	
	While there was a substantial attack on the credibility of that part of his evidence, and while there are various inconsistencies arising from other evidence as to whether his account should be accepted, let alone be accepted beyond a reasonable doubt, I am unable to perceive any real unfairness or unfair prejudice in the admission of the evidence of Mr Bailey. Against that, the probative value of the evidence, that is the extent to which it is capable of affecting the probability of a fact in issue, is very high.
	
	
	If there were perceived to be any real unfairness to the accused it would be open to the Crown to recall Mr Swindell either to ask him about any such conversation or to allow counsel for the accused to cross-examine as to any such conversation. However, one could well imagine that counsel for the accused would prefer to be in the position where he can simply make the submission to the jury that Mr Swindell himself gave no such evidence.
	
	
	It is also the case that issues of reliability cannot guide a determination of whether the evidence should be admitted. [9]  Pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act a warning may be given that hearsay evidence such as this may be unreliable. The accused has indicated that he will request such a warning and unless I am persuaded that there are good reasons for not giving such a warning I am inclined to warn the jury about the use of such evidence and the reasons that it may be unreliable. However that determination does not need to be made at this point of the trial.
	
	
	My ruling is that the evidence is admissible.

		17 November 2017",2017-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276228,R v Kijurina [2017] NSWCCA 59,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 28 October 2016 Mr Kijurna was sentenced by Jeffreys DCJ for two offences of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount being not less than a commercial quantity. The supplies took place on 13 May 2014 and involved methylamphetamine oil. There were two such charges, for which the offender was sentenced to be imprisoned for two years and 15 months respectively, the sentences to be served concurrently and in each case to be served by way of an intensive correction order.
	
	
	The sentences were imposed on 28 October 2016. On 14 December 2016 the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of appeal contained a single ground, namely that the sentences pronounced were manifestly inadequate. Amended written submissions were filed in support of the appeal on 21 March 2017.
	
	
	In a matter such as this, it is in both the public interest and the interests of the offender that the appeal be heard and determined expeditiously.
	
	
	On Tuesday, 21 March the Registrar received an email from the offender’s father stating that, on the previous evening, the offender’s solicitor and barrister had withdrawn from the case.
	
	
	No formal application was made on behalf of the offender, nor was any affidavit filed in support of the application, until this morning. Nevertheless the Registrar was advised last night that Ms Goodwin of counsel would be appearing on the adjournment application, which she did. The Court is grateful for her assistance in this matter.
	
	
	On the basis of affidavit material read by Ms Goodwin it is clear that the reason behind the withdrawal was the failure of the offender and his family to raise the funds for private representation. As the communication noted and as the affidavit explained, assistance is being sought by way of legal aid, but has not yet been obtained.
	
	
	An application for an adjournment of an appeal in this Court, long after it has been listed and very close to the time of the hearing, is not encouraged. Not only does it delay the proper disposal of the case in question, but it means that another case will have been unnecessarily delayed. It is particularly undesirable to adjourn matters which have been listed expeditiously, as this matter was, for the reasons noted.
	
	
	Nevertheless the primary concern must be fairness to the offender, who faces the possibility of an increased sentence. There is no suggestion that the adjournment application has been manipulated in order to delay the determination of the appeal. There is obvious merit in the proposition that fairness to the offender requires that he be given the opportunity to obtain legal representation, through available providers. Accordingly, the Court should vacate the hearing of the appeal listed for today and return the matter to the Registrar to fix a new date for hearing. Nevertheless, the relisting should occur without undue delay, the intention being that the offender have a reasonable opportunity to obtain representation, not that the matter will not be relisted until representation is obtained. From what Ms Goodwin has said today, it is likely that representation will be obtained in the near future.
	
	
	Accordingly the Court should make the following orders:
	



	
	Vacate the hearing of the appeal listed for today.
	
	
	Return the matter to the Registrar to fix a new date for hearing of the Director’s appeal.
	
	
	Direct that the matter be listed before the Registrar for call-over on Thursday, 30 March 2017.

	On 22 November 2016, Michael Hadchiti pleaded not guilty to the murder of Billy Mack but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment.
	
	
	The deceased was killed on 30 October 2011. The following day the offender was arrested and charged with his murder. On 13 November 2013, he was convicted of that murder following a trial. He subsequently appealed against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 27 April 2016, his appeal was allowed, his conviction quashed and a new trial ordered: Hadchiti v R [2016] NSWCCA 63. The offender subsequently offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, which plea was ultimately accepted by the Crown.
	
	
	The offender was 20 years old at the time of the offence. He lived at home with his parents and other family members on a semi-rural property in Londonderry. The deceased was the boyfriend of the offender’s sister, Marian Roumanos. A violent altercation occurred between the offender and the deceased when the deceased attended the offender’s home one night to collect Ms Roumanos’ two young children. That altercation ended when the offender killed the deceased by cutting his throat.
	
	
	Section 421 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) provides a partial defence to the offence of murder. It reduces what would otherwise have been an offence of murder to manslaughter. This partial defence is made out if the offender believed that his conduct causing the death of the deceased was necessary to defend himself or another person, but that conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the offender perceived them. This form of manslaughter is described as manslaughter by excessive self-defence. It is on this basis that the Crown accepted the offender’s plea of guilty and it is upon this basis that the offender stands to be sentenced.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter, under s 18 of the Crimes Act, is imprisonment for 25 years: s 24 of the Crimes Act.
	


The facts on sentence


	
	The facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced are set out in a two-page document headed “Agreed Facts” signed by the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor who appeared on behalf of the Crown on sentence. As will become apparent, the facts were not entirely agreed upon as between the Crown and the offender. I shall return to the question of how the discrete factual dispute is to be resolved after setting out the “agreed” facts.
	
	
	The document headed “Agreed Facts” is in these terms:
	


“The deceased, Mr Billy Mack, was the new boyfriend of the offender's sister, Marian Roumanos. Ms Roumanos was separated from the father of her two children and it is clear that her parents, George and Sonia Hadchiti, were displeased about this situation.

On 30 October 2011, Ms Roumanos' two young children were at the Hadchiti family home on a semi-rural block in Londonderry on the outskirts of south-western Sydney. The deceased drove there, with Ms Roumanos and his 14 year old niece, [TB], to pick up the children, arriving at about 9:10pm. He and Ms Roumanos had been consuming ice (his blood at post-mortem was found to contain alprazolam (Xanax), delta-9-THC acid, diazepam, nordiazapam, methadone and methylamphetamine. Dr William Allender's report said the level of methylamphetamine was above the ""therapeutic"" range and ""may have contributed to increased aggressive and/or risk-taking behaviour"", so Ms Roumanos did not wish her family to see her. Ms Roumanos and [TB] remained outside the Hadchiti premises.

The deceased, then aged 26, drove into the yard and walked through the gate and toward the front of the Hadchiti house. The offender was at the front of the yard peeling an apple with a knife when the deceased walked past him. The offender's mother, Sonia Hadchiti, then aged 47, was on the steps of the house as the deceased approached her and started yelling about ""the kids"". The deceased then grabbed Mrs Hadchiti by the front of her shirt (which was torn and later found to have the deceased's DNA on it), and she fell to the ground. Mrs Hadchiti later complained of having been kicked. The offender, then aged 20, approached the deceased, who turned and swung at him, stabbing the offender in the arm. The wound later required suturing.

The offender, who was still holding a knife, then tackled the deceased. The deceased's head, shoulder and back came into contact with the rusted frame of a metal chair which was in the yard on a number of occasions. How that occurred remains a matter of dispute between the parties. The Crown's case is that the offender struck the deceased with the chair frame. This is based not only on the force likely to be required to inflict the injuries to the head, but also on the fact that DNA consistent with that of the offender was found on the bottoms of both of the legs on the front of the chair frame. The offender however maintains that the deceased struck the chair frame when he was tackled to the ground and that, ""We did get up at least twice and I did tackle him back down…there was chairs around"" (trial transcript at p 478).

During the struggle the offender's knife struck the deceased in the chest, causing a stab wound which penetrated the right lung.

The offender continued to struggle with the deceased and, while he was in a position on top of the deceased, gained control of the knife that he (the deceased) had been holding. The offender cut the deceased's throat with the knife, inflicting a long and deep, gaping wound which caused extensive lethal injury.

At 9:17pm, the offender's mother made a 000 call asking for the police and saying: ""He had a knife in his hand please hurry he attacked me"". Upon arrival of police and ambulance the deceased was clearly dead.

Two knives were found at the scene, both bearing the DNA of the offender and the deceased.

At post-mortem, the deceased was found to have suffered the following injuries:

a 70mm x 80mm complex area of laceration in the right temporoparietal region of the scalp, the majority extending down to the bone and localised surrounding abrasion;

associated with the forgoing injury, there was an area of 'micro-fracturing' measuring 10mm x 20mm with slight black discolouration of the surface of the skull. In one area there was minimal depression of the outer table of the skull;

a 43mm laceration in the occipital region of the scalp, no fracturing, only minimal bleeding;

13 other injuries to the head in the nature of lacerations, abrasions and scratch marks over the head and face;

the lethal wound was a 160mm x 70mm transversally aligned gaping incised wound across the anterior aspect of the neck, with a ""fish-tail like"" appearance to the right end (explained at the trial by the forensic pathologist, Dr Johan Duflou, as being most commonly caused by a ""to-ing and fro-ing motion of the knife....a sawing motion, if you like"") while on the left the end was clean and sharp. There was severe injury to underlying neck structures with partial severing of both sternocleidomastoid muscles, severing of the right common carotid artery and the adjacent right internal jugular vein. There was also incision of the anterior wall of the oesophagus, incision of the body of the thyroid cartilage with entry of the weapon into the larynx and injury to the right and left lobes of the thyroid and injury to the strap muscles of the neck;

6 other injuries of a minor nature to the neck, 3 associated with the lethal wound and 3 others which were not, being abrasions to the back of the net;

a 12mm diagonally aligned ""slit like"" stab wound to the right lateral chest with minimal surrounding bruising, the wound tract passing between ribs 7 and 8 and about 5mm into the lower lobe of the right lung with the total wound tract at least 40mm. Minimal bleeding along this wound tract indicated it was likely to have been inflicted after the wound to the neck.”

[emphasis added]


	
	During the proceedings on sentence it was suggested by the Crown Prosecutor that the above agreed facts could be supplemented by the further background facts set out in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Hadchiti v R at [3]-[17]. Senior counsel for the offender agreed with that course. I gave the parties leave to consider further precisely which paragraphs of that decision were appropriate to be before me on sentence. Subsequent correspondence from the parties confirmed that both the offender and the Crown agreed that the facts before me on sentence were to be supplemented by [3] – [8], [10] – [12] and [19] of the decision in Hadchiti v R. Although it is unusual for facts upon which an offender is to be sentenced to be before the court in this way, it was a course upon which experienced senior counsel agreed. Accordingly, I propose to sentence the offender on the above agreed facts supplemented by this further material. I have had regard to the relevant paragraphs in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal and it seems to me that the material contained therein, which is additional to what is already in the agreed facts, can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the offence the offender lived at the Hadchiti family home with his parents George and Sonia and brothers Mehriz and Rabih. Another son, John, lived with his wife and children in a granny flat at the back of the block
	
	
	At 8:50pm, the deceased purchased two bottles of soft drink and a bottle of water from a shop in North Richmond and made a call lasting 94 seconds to Sonia Hadchiti at 9:07pm, shortly before he arrived at the Hadchiti family home. (There was evidence that it would take around eight minutes to drive from the shop to the Hadchiti residence.)
	
	
	There was no street lighting outside the Hadchiti residence. The deceased walked into the front yard to collect the children alone while Ms Roumanos and the deceased’s niece TB remained outside the property.
	
	
	Sonia Hadchiti made two triple-0 calls that night. The first one was to the police at 9:17pm. The second call was made at 9.22pm to the ambulance service, in which she said, “Please hurry someone tried to stab me…someone is injured and the guy who stabbed me had a knife please hurry.”
	
	
	When the police arrived at 9:29pm the deceased was lying face down on the grassed area at the front of the house. The offender was sitting near the deceased with a brown-handled knife between his feet. There was a large amount of blood and his shoes and hands were stained with blood. Two knives were recovered from the property. One was a brown-handled pocket knife and the other was a “Columbia” brand knife. Both contained the deceased’s blood.
	
	
	A brown coloured steel chair frame was found by the police in the front yard of the Hadchiti premises. It was photographed by police, resting on its side. Underneath it were the black sunglasses the deceased had been wearing, and his car keys and a swipe pass. Numerous blood stains were also found on the steel chair frame. There was an injury to the middle of the deceased’s back at the level of the T3 vertebra, in the shape of a 23mm x 23mm square, which corresponded to the edge of the chair frame.
	
	
	The deceased had a background involving violence, including violence against women involving a knife. He had been charged with assaulting a woman outside her home in 2001, but was not convicted. He was charged in 2002 with two counts of common assault, including upon a previous girlfriend with whom he had a child, but was not convicted. He was apprehended by police in 2003 after throwing a knife onto the footpath. He confronted a woman in 2007 with a large bread knife and said, “I’m going to cut your throat.” Both of these matters resulted in convictions. In June 2008, he entered the Blacktown Methadone Clinic with a large knife. That incident did not result in a conviction.
	


Other factual material


	
	No further evidence was tendered at the commencement of the proceedings on sentence beyond the agreed facts. During submissions, the Crown Prosecutor tendered part of the report of the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem. There was no objection to that course. Accordingly, I also had before me on sentence that part of the report of Professor Johan Duflou dated 7 February 2012 that describes the knife wound to the chest of the deceased as follows:
	


“There was a 12mm diagonally aligned wound on the right lateral chest wall, located in the posterior axillary line, hundred and 60mm below the apex of the axilla. Minimal surrounding bruising of the tissues was evident on external examination, and no abrasion surrounded this slit-like wound.

The tract of the wound past medially without significant superior/inferior or anterior/posterior deflection, passing through ribs 78 laterally into the lower lobe of the right lung. The length of the tract within the right lung, which appeared well inflated, was approximately 5mm and the total length of the tract within the body with at least 4cm. There was minimal bleeding along this wound tract.”


	
	The relevance of this part of the report of Professor Duflou was that it was the Crown’s submission that the knife wound to the deceased’s chest was most likely inflicted after the fatal neck wound. This is because there was only minimal bleeding in the wound tract, consistent with Mr Mack being already deceased at the time that injury was inflicted.
	


Factual dispute on sentence


	
	The factual dispute that I must determine is that portion of the agreed facts highlighted in [7] above. It concerns how the deceased received his head injuries. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence is such that the Court could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender used a chair to strike the deceased over the head prior to inflicting the wound that killed him. A DNA profile consistent with that of the offender was located on two of the legs of the chair frame found in front of the house. A DNA profile consistent with that of the deceased was also found on the chair. Marks on the deceased’s back were noted at autopsy consistent with his being hit with a chair.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor conceded in her submissions that the fact that the chair was an item of furniture at the offender’s home presents a difficulty for the version advanced by the Crown. She also noted that the deceased’s head injuries appear not to have been inflicted with “maximum force” and that the forensic pathologist Professor Duflou declined to exclude the possibility that the deceased sustained those injuries from falling upon the chair. She accepted that it cannot be said that the injuries were inflicted with such force that they must have been caused by the offender’s striking the deceased’s head with the chair.
	
	
	The offender’s case was that the deceased fell into the chair as he and the offender were grappling with each other in the course of the fracas. Mr Dunn QC submitted that the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender threw the chair at the deceased or used the chair to strike the deceased. The chair is one that was ordinarily present at the offender’s home. The DNA on its legs cannot be dated; it may have been transferred from the offender to the chair at any point prior to the offence. The DNA of the deceased (and that of the offender) could have been deposited on the chair as the two men struggled in its vicinity.
	
	
	The manner in which the deceased incurred his head injuries is relevant to the question of the extent to which the offender’s conduct departed from what would have been a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them. A finding that the offender intentionally inflicted those injuries by hitting the deceased in the head with the chair would increase the seriousness of the offence. Thus, in order for me to sentence the offender on the basis that he struck the deceased with the chair, the Crown must prove this fact beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54.
	
	
	No other evidence was put before the Court to assist me in resolving this factual dispute. I have had regard to the description of the injuries to the deceased. The injuries, in addition to the fatal wound, were significant. The location of the offender’s DNA on the legs of the chairs is consistent with the chair being wielded, rather than simply touched in some way prior to the incident. Similarly, it is difficult to see how simply coming into contact with the chair as the deceased struggled with the offender could have caused the number of injuries to the deceased’s head.
	
	
	An aspect of the events of the night in question upon which the facts were silent was who was present at the time of the offence. The agreed facts only refer to the offender and his mother being present. In Mr Dunn’s submissions he described there being other people at the house, including a visitor, at the time the deceased arrived. No further detail was provided. It is somewhat unsatisfactory that the agreed facts were silent on this issue. Nonetheless, I am bound to sentence the offender on the basis of the material before me.
	
	
	In the absence of any further evidence on this issue, including the evidence of any eyewitnesses, and having regard to the concessions made by the Crown Prosecutor, I am unable to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender used the chair to strike the deceased.
	
	
	Although the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased with the chair, this does not mean that I am bound to sentence the offender on his version of events. In order for me to find that the injuries were incurred incidentally during the mêlée I would need to be satisfied of this on the balance of probabilities. I am not so satisfied for the reasons I have already given. Accordingly, I propose to proceed on the basis that neither of the competing possibilities is proved to the requisite standard: Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at 69 [64]; The Queen v Olbrich at [24].
	
	
	The offender is to be sentenced on the basis that the deceased received a number of other injuries prior to his death. It is not known whether they were inflicted by someone else present or who else in fact was present at the time, besides the offender’s mother. Nor is it known whether the injuries occurred during the struggle between the men on the ground. All that is established is the fact that, at the time of his death, the deceased had these injuries.
	


Seriousness of the offence


	
	It is my duty to impose a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence. Accordingly, I am required to have regard to the whole of the facts and circumstances of this case in order to assess the gravity of this particular offending.
	
	
	As Gleeson CJ observed in R v Blacklidge (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995):
	


“…the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability…What is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case.”


	
	By his plea of guilty, the offender accepts that at the time of the infliction of the fatal wound he had the mental element for murder. It was submitted on his behalf that I would sentence him on the basis that his intention was to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than to kill the deceased. In her written submissions, the Crown Prosecutor contended that the offender’s conduct evinced a clear intention to kill. It is thus necessary for me to make a finding in this regard.
	
	
	I have had regard to the nature of the fatal injury inflicted on the deceased. The offender agrees that after he gained control of the deceased’s knife he used it to cut his throat. That caused a gaping lethal wound measuring 160mm x 70mm across the front of his neck. It was described as having a ""fishtail like"" appearance to the right end. The agreed facts refer to this being explained at the trial by Professor Duflou as most commonly caused by a ""to-ing and fro-ing motion of the knife...a sawing motion, if you like.""
	
	
	The injury to the underlying neck structures was also severe. Both muscles on the sides of the neck were partially severed. The right common carotid artery and the adjacent right internal jugular vein were also both partially severed. The anterior wall of the oesophagus was incised as was the body of the thyroid cartilage. The knife entered into the larynx and injured the right and left lobes of the thyroid and the muscles on the front of the neck.
	
	
	Having regard to the position of the wound across the front of the deceased’s neck, the size and depth of the wound, the description by Professor Duflou of the wound being caused by a sawing motion and the use of a knife, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the deceased at the time he slit his throat.
	
	
	Turning to the other injuries suffered by the deceased, I have already stated that I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intentionally inflicted the deceased’s head injuries. It was not an agreed fact that the offender intentionally stabbed the deceased in the chest. There is insufficient material before me to find beyond reasonable doubt that the chest wound was inflicted deliberately, rather than inadvertently during the struggle when both men were armed. In any event, the Crown Prosecutor accepted that the chest wound more likely occurred after the fatal injury. Although on one view it seems unlikely that the deceased would have still been struggling after receiving the wound to his neck, that was the position of the Crown on sentence and I will sentence the offender on that basis.
	
	
	I am bound to proceed to sentence the offender on the basis that when he slit the deceased’s throat with a knife he honestly believed it was necessary to do so to defend himself and his mother from the deceased. I am next required to undertake an assessment of the circumstances as the offender perceived them that led him to form that belief and then evaluate the degree to which his conduct departed from what would have been a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them: R v Smith [2015] NSWCCA 193 by Simpson JA (with whom Leeming JA and Hamill J agreed) at [44]-[45] and [56] – [59]. I note that, unlike the sentencing judge in R v Smith who had presided over a trial prior to sentence, my assessment is necessarily based on more limited material given that it is confined to the material in the agreed facts.
	
	
	The circumstances that faced the offender are as follows. He was sitting on a milk crate in the front garden of his family home shortly after 9pm peeling an apple with a knife when the deceased arrived and got out of his car. The offender had not met the deceased before, but the evidence before me is that the deceased had telephoned the premises prior to his arrival to indicate that he was on his way. The children to be collected were still at the offender’s home. When the deceased arrived he yelled something about the “the kids” at the offender’s mother. The offender then saw the deceased grab his mother by the front of her shirt. His mother was 47 years old at the time. She fell to the ground. The agreed facts note that she “later complained of having been kicked.” The offender then approached the deceased, who swung at him with a knife and stabbed him in the arm. A violent confrontation ensued in which both men were armed with knives.
	
	
	I have had regard to the fact that the deceased came to the offender’s home at night armed with a knife and that the offender already had a knife in his hand at that time because he was peeling an apple. The evidence is that he then saw the deceased push his mother to the ground. Although his mother later complained that she had been kicked, there is no evidence before me as to the details of any kick: where it was, how strong it was, or in fact if it injured the offender’s mother in any way.
	
	
	The agreed facts disclose that the deceased had a level of methylamphetamine in his system above the therapeutic level at the time of his death. Also included in the agreed facts is the expert evidence that such a level may make a person more aggressive. I have taken that material into account as part of the facts.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the injuries that the deceased had suffered by the time of his death. The head injuries that he suffered were significant, although it is not suggested that they were of themselves fatal. Even putting to one side the fatal wound, the injuries suffered by the deceased were significantly greater than those inflicted on the offender. Moreover, it is an agreed fact that the deceased was killed with his own knife. This means that the offender was able to take the deceased’s knife from him.
	
	
	Consistent with the plea, I must sentence the offender on the basis that his actions departed from what would have been a reasonable response to the circumstances as perceived by him. The greater the departure his conduct was from what would have been a reasonable response in those circumstances, the more serious the offence. I am satisfied that his conduct seriously contravened the standard of reasonableness when comparing his conduct with the circumstance as her perceived them. He became involved in a violent altercation with Mr Mack following a threat to his mother that was not particularly serious. The deceased did not produce a knife when he confronted the offender’s mother. Rather, it was only after the offender confronted the deceased that a knife was produced. The deceased was injured during the mêlée but the offender was not, apart from the wound to his arm inflicted before that mêlée.
	
	
	Overall, I am satisfied that the offender’s conduct in slitting the offender’s throat, in the context of his other injuries, was done with an intention to kill and was a significant departure from what would have been a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them. Accordingly, I am satisfied that this was a serious example of manslaughter based upon excessive self-defence.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	An unsigned victim impact statement from Allan Mack, the father of the deceased, was tendered. Senior counsel for the offender took no objection to the tender of that unsigned document on the proceedings on sentence.
	
	
	The deceased’s father described how his son’s death has affected him, the deceased’s sister, the deceased’s niece (who was present on the night in question), and the deceased’s daughter. He acknowledged the pain of having a child die before you and stated that the pain will never end. He said that he has not been the same since his son’s death.
	
	
	On behalf the Court, I extend my condolences to the family of the deceased for their loss.
	
	
	I have had regard to Part 3, Division 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the CSP Act”), and in particular s 28. No application was made by the prosecutor that I take the victim impact statement into account in determining the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the death on the deceased’s family is an aspect of harm done to the community. Accordingly I have not done so.
	


Plea of guilty


	
	The offender was charged with murder on 31 October 2011. His first offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was in June 2016, nearly five years later. The Crown did not accept that plea until November 2016. It is the timing of the offer of the plea, rather than its acceptance, which is the relevant date for assessing the discount to be applied.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the lateness of this plea entitled the offender to a discount marginally above 10%, whereas Mr Dunn for the offender submitted that a significant discount was warranted in the circumstances.
	
	
	It was open to the offender to have approached the Crown to make an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter at any time since late 2011. The delay in indicating an offer to plead guilty reduced its utilitarian effect. I have assessed the utilitarian value of the plea largely based upon its timing, making some allowance for the complexity and length of the trial: R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309. I am satisfied that a discount in the order of 13% is warranted.
	


Offender's personal history


	
	A psychological report under the hand of Mr Chaic Awat was tendered on sentence, as were a number of letters from character witnesses. Reverend Mark Muss, the full time Anglican Chaplain at Lithgow Correctional Centre, gave evidence on behalf of the offender at the proceedings on sentence, as did the offender’s cousin Jessica Younan. An affidavit from the offender’s solicitor annexed further relevant material, including the offender’s case note reports from his NSW Department of Corrective Services file, his trade qualifications, and certificates from courses, including Bible studies, undertaken in custody. The following history is taken from this material.
	
	
	The offender’s parents migrated to Australia from Lebanon. The offender is the youngest of seven children, all of whom were born in Australia. He grew up on a semi-rural property where his parents grew vegetables commercially. His family is close-knit and supportive. He attended a local Catholic primary school and Richmond Secondary College. He played football at school and worked both on the family farm and part-time at a local fruit shop. In 2007, he commenced a Formwork apprenticeship, which involved carpentry. The offender completed a Certificate III in Construction Carpentry in 2013, while on bail pending his trial for this offence. The transcript of his academic record at TAFE was before me. He also has a certificate from TAFE in Warehousing Operations.
	
	
	The offender’s family is Maronite Catholic and the family attended church every Sunday. The offender is described by character referees as being devoted to his faith and family. Other character references from friends and family portray the offender as hardworking, well mannered, well liked and generous with his time, with strong family values.
	
	
	The offender’s former employer described him as hardworking, reliable and honest. He was described as completing his apprenticeship with “outstanding results.” A family friend who owns a farming property described how the offender had offered him a helping hand to do farm duties on many occasions.
	
	
	Whilst in custody, the offender organised a petition to have a priest attend the jail and say Mass for the inmates. I was provided with a copy of the letter written to the Bishop of Bathurst with respect to this request. Also tended was a certificate from Ken Marslew from the “Enough is Enough” anti-violence movement, confirming the offender’s participation in that course whilst in custody.
	
	
	The offender relied upon the case notes provided from his NSW Department of Corrective Services file to demonstrate that he has suffered from anxiety whilst in custody. Those notes show that when the offender was first taken into custody he reported high levels of anxiety, but was assessed as at low risk of self-harm. He indicated that he wished to attend chapel and see a psychologist, which he subsequently did. The notes report him suffering from anxiety, depression and panic attacks at various times thereafter. After sentence he was described as presenting as “stressed”, but as “experiencing a normal response to his situation (first time in custody, recent long sentence).” In a more recent case note of November 2016 the offender was described as not being interested in engaging with psychology services and as coping well with his change of placement. Not all case notes are favourable to the offender. One note described him as follows: “Can be arrogant, and argumentative. Normally he demands everything asap if things don’t go his way he had been seen throwing a tantrum [sic].”
	
	
	Reverend Muss described the offender as being a consistent attendee at chapel services and midweek Bible studies in custody. He stated that since becoming the Minister at Lithgow Correctional Centre he had never given evidence on behalf of a prisoner before. He described the offender as making helpful and positive contributions at meetings and always showing the highest respect for him and his office. He described the offender as “a sincere young man with remarkable depth of character.” Revered Muss also gave evidence about difficulties that the offender has experienced in custody. I have been asked to make a non-publication order in relation to that evidence and will address that issue further below.
	
	
	A letter from the Crossroad Bible Institute of Australia states that the offender has graduated with honours from that Institute’s “Great Truths of the Bible” course. His work was described as being done with a “high level of commitment, accuracy and timeliness.”
	
	
	The report of the psychologist, Mr Awat, states that the offender has experienced a number of symptoms consistent with suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The offender told Mr Awat that he sometimes feels like he is having “a long nightmare” and is just not waking up. The offender said that he was not coping well in prison and is in a “one out cell placement” requested by his psychiatrist. The offender told Mr Awat that he has nightmares and flashbacks. He suffers from sleeping disturbances and has become quite hypervigilant. He startles easily and is constantly watching everyone around him. He is being treated with medication for these symptoms. Mr Awat stated that, in his professional opinion, the offender would benefit from ongoing psychological treatment to alleviate his symptoms of post-traumatic stress.
	


Aggravating and mitigating factors


	
	On behalf of the offender it was conceded that the offence was aggravated by the actual use of a weapon. The Crown Prosecutor did not identify any other aggravating features and I am satisfied that no other aggravating features exist: s 21A(2) of the CSP Act.
	
	
	There were a number of mitigating factors relevant to the sentencing process: s 21A(3) of the CSP Act.
	
	
	The offence was mitigated by the fact that the offender did not have any criminal record as at the time of the commission of this offence. I am further satisfied that the offender was a young man of good character at the time of the offence. Based on the material before me, I also accept that the offender is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	It was submitted that I would take the absence of any planning into account as a mitigating factor on sentence. This feature would be present in almost all cases of manslaughter by excessive self-defence. The offender has already had what would otherwise have been liability for murder reduced to manslaughter on the basis that he acted in self-defence. Although I accept that this offence was not planned I am not satisfied that it would be appropriate to mitigate the sentence any further on that basis.
	
	
	There was evidence before the Court that the offender is remorseful. The offender did not give evidence at his proceedings on sentence. He wrote a letter that was tendered and became an exhibit on sentence. In that letter, the offender stated that he wished that it had never happened and that if he could go back in time and change things he would do anything to do that. He expressed sorrow for the pain caused to the victim’s family and stated that, “Since it happened I think about it all the time.” Reverend Muss described the offender as being “intensely remorseful” in his evidence.
	
	
	The offender told his psychologist that he has “…a lot of remorse for his actions, and that he is adamant that he never had any intent for the situation to get out of hand as it did.” He told the psychologist on two occasions throughout the session that if he had an opportunity to change the past he would because he continues to carry the knowledge that he has “taken life.” The psychologist stated:
	


“Mr Hadchiti expressed his remorse and shame in relation to the offence before the court on numerous occasions throughout the initial consultation. He advised that he continually relives the event and that it is something that he feels he will live through for the rest of his life”.


	
	He stated that, “[The offender] does not believe that there will be a day that he does not remember or regret his part in the offence before the court.”
	
	
	In order for me to find that the mitigating factor of the offender’s remorse exists in this matter, I must be satisfied that the offender has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the loss caused by his actions: s 21A(3)(k) of the CSP Act. Although much of the offender’s regret seems to be that he now finds himself incarcerated, I am nonetheless satisfied on the material before me that he is remorseful and that this is a further mitigating factor to be taken into account.
	
	
	There were two other mitigating factors upon which the offender relied.
	
	
	The first of these was the offender’s mental health. It was submitted that the evidence of the offender’s psychologist outlining the nature of the offender’s post-traumatic stress disorder is a relevant mitigating factor on sentence, in that the offender’s custodial sentence may be more onerous on him than the average prisoner: DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177]. It was not suggested that the offender had any mental health issue at the time of the commission of the offence, such that general deterrence was of less significance in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	I have had regard to the report of Dr Awat as well as the case notes. The diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was not challenged by the Crown. The offender is taking medication for anxiety, but the case notes suggest that his anxiety is caused by the legal process. On the material before me, the extent to which the offender’s sentence is more onerous on him than an average prisoner is not clear. Overall, I am prepared to accept that the offender suffers from PTSD and I have taken this factor into account to some extent in the overall sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the offender’s custodial conditions are such that his sentence should be further reduced. Revered Muss gave evidence about the offender’s experience in custody and counsel on behalf of the offender sought a non-publication order in relation to it. For the purposes of these sentencing reasons, it is sufficient merely to note that no challenge was made to any of that evidence and it is of such a nature that it is appropriate for me to take it into account as a further mitigating feature to some extent.
	


Delay and pre-sentence custody


	
	By the time of sentence in this matter, a period of five and a half years had passed since the offence. The offender was bail refused upon his arrest on 31 October 2011 and released on bail on strict conditions on 28 November 2011. He was convicted of murder on 13 November 2013 and bail refused. He has been in custody since that date.
	
	
	It is agreed by senior counsel for the offender and the Crown Prosecutor that the offender's sentence should be backdated to 16 September 2012 in order to take into account the period that he has already spent in custody.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the delay in this matter was not caused by any fault of the offender and it is appropriate to give weight to the fact that the offender has been left in a state of uncertain suspense for a considerable period of time. The relevant principles were recently considered by Bellew J in R v Sabra [2015] NSWCCA 38 at [27] to [38]. I am satisfied that the uncertainty, suspense and anxiety experienced by the offender over the last five and a half years are matters to which it is appropriate to give some weight in the exercise of my sentencing discretion.
	
	
	I note that while the offender was on bail he was subject to strict conditions that included a curfew. The offender told Dr Awat that he feels as if his prison sentence commenced from his initial time on bail. It was not suggested to me that those conditions of bail would amount to any form of quasi-custody, nor do I propose to take that material into account in that manner. Rather, I propose to take this material into account on the question of delay generally.
	


Special circumstances


	
	Senior Counsel for the offender submitted that I would find special circumstances in this matter, being a combination of the offender’s mental health, his youth, and the fact that this is first time in custody. The Crown Prosecutor did not oppose a finding of special circumstances based upon those matters and added that the offender’s “healthy” prospects of rehabilitation would be a further relevant matter in this regard.
	
	
	It is well established that factors such as an offender’s mental health, youth, prospects of rehabilitation, and the fact that it is an offender’s first time in custody are all matters capable of amounting to special circumstances such that the statutory ratio in s 44 of the CSP may be varied. Just because matters are capable of amounting to special circumstances does not necessarily mean that a variation in the usual ratio between the balance of term and the non-parole period is warranted: the circumstances must be “sufficiently special to justify a variation”: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22] per Spigelman CJ
	
	
	I have given consideration to whether the circumstances are sufficiently special in this case to warrant a departure from the statutory ratio. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that it was appropriate to do so. On balance, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to vary the statutory ratio on the basis of the offender’s youth and the fact that this is his first time in custody.
	


Other decisions


	
	The Crown relied upon three cases of manslaughter by excessive self-defence as being of assistance in this matter: Salah v R [2009] NSWCCA 2, Stewart v R [2009] NSWCCA 152 and R v Huang [2015] NSWSC 375.
	
	
	The applicant in Salah v R was involved in an altercation with the deceased, during which the deceased punched him in the side of the head, pulled his hair and threatened to kill him. Later that day, the applicant and the deceased were involved in another fight in which the deceased was armed with a knife. In the course of that fight, the applicant took control of the deceased’s knife and stabbed him six times with it. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the sixth day of a trial and was sentenced by Johnson J to a non-parole period of five years and nine months, with a balance of term of three years. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Rothman J, Bell JA and Price J agreeing) dismissed the applicant’s sentence appeal.
	
	
	The applicant in Stewart v R was convicted of manslaughter by a jury following a trial for murder. Applying a discount of 12.5%, Johnson J sentenced him to a non-parole period of seven years and three months, with a balance of term of three years and three months. The applicant and the deceased faced off at the applicant’s home over a dispute about loud music, the deceased arming himself with a sword and the applicant with a knife. The applicant left the house in the early hours of the morning and returned later that day with a push dagger. At that time, the applicant and the deceased fought and the applicant stabbed the deceased several times with the dagger, which he had concealed. The applicant sought leave to appeal his sentence on the sole ground of manifest excess. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Hodgson JA, Buddin and Price JJ agreeing) dismissed the appeal.
	
	
	Justice Beech-Jones sentenced the offender in R v Huang to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of five years and eleven months and a balance of term of one year and eleven months. The offender was convicted of manslaughter following a trial on an indictment for murder. The offender stabbed a co-worker (with whom he also resided) several times on the construction site where both men worked. The offender’s version was that the deceased had threatened to report him to the Department of Immigration and to kill him. He had armed himself with a knife before confronting the deceased on the day of the offence. His Honour indicated at [54] that the appropriate starting point for that case of manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence, involving a finding that the offender had an intention to kill the deceased, was 12 years’ imprisonment. He afforded a discount of 25% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the offender’s plea and a further discount of 10% for assistance.
	
	
	The offender submitted that the present case differs in important respects from these decisions and that the offender’s moral culpability is far lower than that of the offenders dealt with in those cases.
	
	
	The offender relied upon two cases said to deal with the question of spontaneity in offences of manslaughter by excessive self-defence. The first was Cioban v The Queen (2003) 139 A Crim R 265; [2003] NSWCCA 304. The appellant in that case was convicted of manslaughter. He and some of his friends became embroiled in a fight with the deceased, and a group of his friends, in the early hours of the morning in Kings Cross. The deceased threatened to assault the appellant in the course of the brawl and the appellant was punched and kicked by the deceased’s friends. The appellant produced a gun and shot at the deceased, but missed. The deceased then chased the appellant up the street and the two men struggled. The appellant fired the shot that killed the deceased in that struggle. Studdert J sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for eight years, with a non-parole period of five years. The appellant successfully appealed his sentence on a ground of manifest excess. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Mason P, Hidden J and Smart AJ agreeing) considered that a sentence of imprisonment for six years and six months, with a non-parole period of four years, was appropriate having regard to the facts and to the appellant’s positive subjective features. No other principle can be derived from that case.
	
	
	The second case upon which the offender relied in this regard was R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505; [2004] NSWCCA 43. The respondent in that case used a shotgun to shoot the deceased in the back of the head. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years and six months, with a non-parole period of four years and six months. The respondent and the deceased lived together. On the night of his death, there was a physical fight between them. As he was strangling her, the deceased said that he was going to kill the appellant and “smash her face in.” The respondent retrieved a shotgun and shot the deceased in the head as he was facing away from her. The Court of Criminal Appeal, by majority (James and Barr JJ, Santow JA in dissent) dismissed both the Crown appeal and the respondent’s sentence appeal. James J noted (at 529 [92]) that it was not helpful to compare the sentence imposed upon the respondent with other, lesser sentences imposed upon other offenders for excessive self-defence manslaughter. Barr J stated (at 532 [107]) that the decided cases were at that time so few that they could not be said to constitute a tariff.
	
	
	Overall, I have not found any of these cases to be particularly helpful, although the principles derived from them confirm the broad range of offending that is encompassed by the offence of manslaughter, even when that offence is confined to the particular species of manslaughter by excessive self-defence.
	


Conclusion and sentence


	
	In sentencing the offender I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the CSP Act. I note the comments of the High Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Hayden, Crennan Kiefel and Bell JJ) in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 at [20], that the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the CSP Act are “overlapping and, at times, conflicting” and “there is no attempt to rank them in order of priority.” In this matter I must impose a sentence that ensures that the offender is adequately punished for what I have found to be a serious example of manslaughter by excessive self-defence. I must impose a sentence which will deter others from committing similar offences and also make the offender accountable for his actions. I must also promote the rehabilitation of the offender who comes before this Court for sentencing as a person of previous good character with a favourable subjective case.
	
	
	In the exercise of my sentencing discretion, I have arrived at the sentence that I propose to apply by a process of instinctive synthesis, having regard to all of the objective and subjective features of this case.
	
	
	But for the plea of guilty I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 11 and a half years. I have allowed a discount of just over 13%, which reduces the head sentence to ten years. I have found special circumstances, being the offender’s youth and the fact that it is his first time in custody. Accordingly I have varied the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence.
	


SENTENCE


	
	Michael Hadchiti, for the manslaughter of Billy Mack you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of seven years commencing on 14 October 2013 and expiring on 13 October 2020 and an additional term of three years commencing on 14 October 2020 and expiring on 13 October 2023.
	
	
	The sentence is taken to have commenced on 14 October 2013. The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 13 October 2020.
	
	
	Mr Hadchiti, the offence of manslaughter is a ""serious violence offence"" as defined in s 5A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). I am obliged by s 25C of that Act to advise you of the existence of that legislation and of its application to the offence you have committed.

	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: On 17 August 2015 at the District Court in Lismore Jordan Burrows was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months, with a non‑parole period of 4 years specified, for an offence of specially aggravated break enter commit serious indictable offence, namely larceny, to which he had pleaded guilty. The circumstance of special aggravation relied upon by the Crown was the intentional wounding of a person. A number of circumstances of aggravation were also made out on the evidence, including being in company, being armed with an offensive weapon, and the use of corporal violence.
	
	
	The offence is one contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). It carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of that sentence, pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	There is no dispute as to the facts of the offence, and what follows is drawn from the sentence judgment of her Honour Judge Wells SC, and from other evidence that was before the sentencing court.
	
	
	The offence, of a type commonly known as a “home invasion”, occurred on the evening of 17 March 2014 at residential premises in Murwillumbah.
	
	
	The applicant was asked by a number of older men to accompany them on what was planned as a home invasion of the premises of a drug dealer. The applicant agreed to participate, knowing that his presence was required to make the group look more formidable, and seeing it as an opportunity to obtain drugs. He was aware that his co-offenders had previously committed other violent home invasions, and knew that bats and a shortened rifle were to be used that evening.
	
	
	The applicant travelled by car with his co-offenders from Banora Point to Murwillumbah to carry out the offence. During the drive he was provided with a balaclava and gloves. He saw his co-offenders arming themselves, including with a gun he had on an earlier occasion seen discharged. The co‑offenders also wore balaclavas and gloves.
	
	
	On reaching Murwillumbah the offenders forced their way into the wrong house; instead of the home of a drug dealer, the home invaded was that of an elderly couple in their seventies, Mr and Mrs Higgins. When the group entered, Mr Higgins tried to stop the offenders. He was beaten about the head and body by an offender (Jacob Huxstep), who was armed with an aluminium bat. He was struck repeatedly in the face with the gun. He was knocked to the ground and kicked in the ribs as he lay on the floor. Mr Higgins sustained a number of defensive and other injuries, including a serious wound to the head.
	
	
	Mrs Higgins was forced onto a lounge at gunpoint and, with the firearm levelled at her face, subjected to demands for money and drugs. Mr Higgins was further assaulted and Mrs Higgins was struck in the face. The couple pleaded with the offenders not to hurt them, asserting that they had no drugs.
	
	
	The offenders extensively ransacked the house searching for valuables, causing damage to the property. The applicant searched a roof cavity for drugs and cash but found nothing. The offenders fled with a quantity of jewellery and other items, valued collectively at over $7000. Mr and Mrs Higgins were threatened with being shot if they called police.
	
	
	The applicant was ultimately given nothing from the robbery by the other offenders.
	
	
	Mr Higgins was admitted to hospital for treatment of his injuries. Those injuries included a wound to the head that exposed skull and required nine sutures, two fractured ribs, sprained joints, bruising, swelling and pain. At the date of the sentence hearing, 5 August 2015, he was still experiencing ongoing pain and difficulty as a consequence of his injuries. Mrs Higgins suffered bruising to her face and upper body. Both had been deeply traumatised by their experience.
	
	
	The applicant was not arrested until January 2015. He was interviewed and admitted his role in the offence.
	


The Proceedings in the District Court


	
	The Crown tendered a statement of facts, statements from Mr and Mrs Higgins, photographs of Mr Higgins’ injuries and the damage to the house, a certificate noting Mr Higgins’ injuries, a transcript of the interview given to police by the applicant, a statement noting that he had no prior criminal history, and a pre-sentence report. Information was also provided as to the co-offenders, none of whom had been dealt with at that stage. A victim impact statement was given to the Court.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report noted that the applicant was a 19 year old man with no criminal history. (He was 18 years and 2 months at the time of the offence.) The author stated that the applicant lived with his mother and other family members; his partner and their new born baby also resided with the applicant. He had completed Year 10 and a later TAFE course in building and construction, being then employed on a casual basis at a fast food restaurant.
	
	
	The applicant gave a history of cannabis use from age 15, and said that the likelihood of obtaining cannabis was his motivation for participation in the offence. He claimed to have stopped using that drug in November 2014 and was unwilling to accept a referral for drug counselling. As to the offence, the applicant reported that he now felt “bad” about it. He demonstrated some insight into the impact the offence would have had on the victims.
	
	
	The author of the pre-sentence report considered the applicant to have changed his life by ceasing drug use, and entering into a stable relationship, in which he was taking his parenting role seriously. He was assessed as at “low/medium risk” of re-offending.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence before the sentencing judge, conceding the accuracy of the statement of facts, and stating that he had been truthful when speaking with the author of the pre-sentence report. He extended an apology to the victims of the offence.
	
	
	The applicant said that he no longer used prohibited drugs, and worked 15 hours per week. He said that he had committed no criminal offences since the home invasion, although he was forced to concede in cross-examination that in fact he had continued using drugs for some months after the home invasion, and he had stored an illicit firearm in his house for one of his co‑offenders for a time from August 2014.
	
	
	The applicant said that he had agreed to join in the home invasion because he thought he would get cannabis. He said that he had not been armed, and had not himself inflicted any violence on Mr or Mrs Higgins. He said his role was to look for valuables in the roof cavity, and to help the group “look more formidable”. He acknowledged that, although he thought the group had the wrong house, he did nothing to stop the offence, from a sense of self preservation.
	
	
	Sentence was imposed on 17 August 2015. The sentencing judge set out the facts of the offence, and noted that, on arrest, the applicant had made extensive admissions. She referred to both the content of the recorded interview, and the applicant’s sworn evidence. Her Honour concluded that the applicant had sought to minimise his knowledge of what took place in the house, and she did not accept his claims in evidence to not having seen or heard the assault upon Mr Higgins or the threats made to him. She said the motivation for participation in the offence was a desire to obtain cannabis.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that,
	


“It is accepted that he was not armed and took quite a passive role during the course of this home invasion.” (ROS 3)


	
	She said, however, that “he went into this venture, albeit reluctantly, with his eyes wide open.” (ROS 7)
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that the offence fell above the mid-range of seriousness for such an offence. She referred to the level of planning and organisation, and to the infliction of unnecessary violence and damage to the property. Her Honour regarded the victims as vulnerable because of their age, and the impact of the crime on them as very serious.
	
	
	The applicant’s subjective case was set out, with the sentencing judge referring to the fact that the applicant was a young man who had been 18 at the time of the home invasion. She accepted that he had commenced the process of rehabilitation by giving up drugs and ceasing to associate with his co-offenders. She noted his admissions to police and willingness to assist the authorities, although without that offer having been accepted by the Crown. She concluded that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	Her Honour said:
	


“The Court must have regard to the various purposes of sentencing as outlined in the legislation and to what has been said in the authorities as to the predominant purposes in sentencing an offender for an offence as serious as this. Whilst he is a very young offender in the scheme of things at the age of 18, and 19 now, with no prior record and good prospects of rehabilitation those matters cannot outweigh the objective seriousness of this offence. General deterrence and the protection of the community in relation to these types of offences are the overriding considerations.” (ROS 8)


	
	The sentence that would otherwise have been imposed was reduced by 25% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the applicant’s early plea of guilty. A finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) was made, and the ratio of sentence varied favourably to the applicant.
	


The Proposed Appeal


	
	The applicant seeks to advance three grounds:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge failed to properly assess the applicant’s culpability with regard to his role in the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give adequate weight to the applicant’s youth in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of sentences imposed on his co-offenders Jacob Huxstep, Dale Egan, and Blake Wood.
	



	
	The last ground was amended by leave granted on the hearing date.
	


Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge failed to properly assess the applicant’s culpability with regard to his role in the joint criminal enterprise.


	
	Although the applicant concedes that he made no submissions on this point at his sentence hearing in the District Court, he now asserts error in the purported failure of the sentencing judge to understand and properly assess the basis for his culpability for the offence. The applicant submits that the legal basis for culpability was an extended joint criminal enterprise and, whilst his plea contemplated the possibility that a participant to the enterprise would wound an occupant, it did not necessarily contemplate that it would be done with the severity or gratuitous violence actually involved. It is contended that the sentencing judge failed to make that assessment.
	
	
	As a general statement, all joint participants in the commission of a crime other than the agreed crime will be equally guilty regardless of the individual part played by each in its commission, provided that:
	


(i)   the accused had contemplated the other crime as a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime, and

(ii)   that, with that state of mind, he had continued to participate in the enterprise even though he may have expressly rejected any agreement that that other crime be committed.


	
	It does not matter that the crime committed does not correspond in every detail with that contemplated by the parties. What must be contemplated by the parties is the substantial risk that it will be committed.
	
	
	See generally R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-557.
	
	
	Where those matters are established, an offender is liable for the crime committed as part of the extended joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	On sentence, it is necessary for a sentencing judge to refer to the particular conduct of an individual offender with a view to identifying the level of culpability of that offender and for which the offender is to be sentenced: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [161]; Sheen v R [2014] NSWCCA 42 at [14].
	
	
	The principle was stated in R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3, at [28]-[29]:
	


“If this conduct by other persons was done in the carrying out of a joint criminal enterprise to which the respondent was a party, then the respondent was to be sentenced for that conduct under the principle that a party to a joint criminal enterprise is to be sentenced for the full range of the criminal acts done by any of the parties to the joint criminal enterprise in the carrying out of the enterprise R v Cotter & Ors [2003] NSWCCA 273 especially per Carruthers AJ at 90.

However, the respondent was not necessarily to receive the same punishment as would have been appropriate if he had himself personally performed all of those acts. In each case it depends on the circumstances whether a person who is criminally liable for an act as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory should be regarded as equally culpable, less culpable or even more culpable than the person who actually performed the criminal act.”


	
	Whilst some differentiation in culpability amongst co-offenders in a joint enterprise is ordinarily appropriate, the very existence of the enterprise and the participation of each in it provides a limit to the extent to which this can occur with respect to the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge referred to his role as “quite a passive one”. She observed that he had not been involved in the planning and organisation of the crime and that, unlike his co-offenders, he had not been armed. Although her Honour noted that the applicant had checked a roof cavity for money and drugs, she accepted that his understanding on joining the enterprise was that he would “make up the numbers” and aid the group to “look formidable”. There was no suggestion that her Honour concluded that the applicant had personally inflicted violence on either of the occupants.
	
	
	However, her Honour also noted that the applicant well understood the type of violent home invasions his co-offenders had committed in the recent past, and was well aware that weapons including a firearm were to be used. There was evidence before her Honour sufficient to establish both that the applicant had joined an enterprise to commit the offence charged, and that he had contemplated the possibility of it occurring as it in fact did.
	
	
	In cross examination before her Honour on 5 August 2015 the applicant gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. You knew they were going to commit acts of violence because you knew what they'd been up to previously?

A. Yes.

Q. You knew there were weapons involved?

A. Yes.

Q. There were firearms involved?

A. Yes.

Q. There were drugs involved?

A. Yes.

Q. This was an organised gang wasn't it? A. Yes.

Q. They had boasted about these sorts of home invasions on supposed drug dealers didn't they?

A. Yes.” (T19:12-30)


	
	Later, in answer to questions from her Honour, the applicant gave this evidence:
	


“HER HONOUR

Q. How may [sic] times would you have gone to the home, to the house where these people used to gather together prior to this home invasion?

A. I don't know.

Q. Sorry?

A. Too many to count.

Q. Too many to count so you were--

A. I was all the time.

Q. Sorry?

A. I was there all the time.

Q. You were there all the time, so you were well familiar with their activities? A. Yes.

Q. Engaging in home invasions correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Going into homes in groups, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And using weapons on people?

A. Yes.” (T22:03-28)


	
	With that knowledge, the applicant joined the enterprise, and continued in it as physical violence was inflicted on the occupants, including the assaults upon Mr Higgins using a bat. That violent attack was clearly within the scope of the original enterprise, that the applicant joined, and continued in.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to all of these features of the applicant’s participation in the crime. Whilst she did not characterise the analysis by reference to a precise determination of the basis of his legal liability for the crime, there was no issue about that during the sentence proceedings, and there was no need for the sentencing judge to resolve any dispute on that aspect of the matter.
	
	
	She did, however, give attention to the basis of the applicant’s culpability in the careful delineation of his personal participation in the crime and his state of mind. The sentence imposed reflects that careful consideration.
	
	
	No error has been established, and I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground 2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give adequate weight to the applicant’s youth in the sentencing exercise.


	
	The applicant submits that the sentencing judge impermissibly allowed considerations of general deterrence and the protection of the community to outweigh the principles applicable to sentencing young offenders.
	
	
	He relies upon the following passage from the judgment to assert error:
	


“Whilst he is a very young offender in the scheme of things at the age of 18, and 19 now, with no prior record and good prospects of rehabilitation those matters cannot outweigh the objective seriousness of this offence. General deterrence and the protection of the community in relation to these types of offences are the overriding considerations”. (ROS 8)


	
	It is that last sentence, and particularly the word “overriding” that, in the applicant’s submission, bespeaks error.
	
	
	A ground of appeal which asserts that insufficient or inadequate weight was given to a particular feature imports a tacit concession that some weight was given to it. If that is so, it is difficult to successfully maintain that the overall sentencing discretion miscarried. Questions of weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion are very much matters for the sentencing judge. It will be a rare case where considerations of the weight given to a particular feature justifies appellate intervention. In Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 Johnson J (with whom Simpson and McCallum JJ agreed) said, at [40]:
	


“The second, third and fourth grounds of appeal complain that the sentencing Judge had given “insufficient weight” to different aspects of the Applicant’s subjective case in passing sentence. In Stephens v R [2009] NSWCCA 240, Grove J (McClellan CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreeing) observed at [16]-[18], that there are inherent problems in a ground expressed in that fashion succeeding, as the ground tacitly concedes that some weight had been placed upon the factor by the sentencing Judge. Circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this Court are narrowly confined, whether the proceeding is a Crown appeal or an offender’s application for leave to appeal with respect to sentence: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]; Cao v R [2010] NSWCCA 109 at [57].”


	
	See also Bland v R [2014] NSWCCA 82; Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49 at [25]; and DF v R [2012] NSWCCA 171 at [77].
	
	
	Here, the sentencing judge plainly did have regard to the applicant’s age. She early referred to his age at the time of sentence, 19 (ROS 1). Later she referred to him as “a young man” who was 18 at the time of the offence, and who had fallen in with a group of older men, attracted to them by his use of cannabis (at ROS 5). Her Honour referred again to that feature of the matter at ROS 7, noting that the applicant provided a very real example of a young man who had fallen in with “the wrong crowd”, older persons engaged in serious criminal activity. At ROS 8 the sentencing judge again referred to the fact that the applicant was, at 18 and 19 at the time of sentence, “a young offender”, and she noted the importance of not imposing “a crushing sentence […] on this young man”.
	
	
	Her Honour made a finding of special circumstances in the applicant’s favour, on the basis of “his prior good record, his prospects of rehabilitation, and his age” (at ROS 8).
	
	
	Arguably, having taken the applicant’s youth into account when making a finding of special circumstances, it could be regarded as double counting to give any significant weight to it when assessing the sentence to be imposed: R v Loveridge (2014) 243 A Crim R 31, at 49 [136]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18].
	
	
	As the ground of appeal as framed by the applicant implies, it could not be said that her Honour was not alive to the issue of the applicant’s youth and did not take it into consideration when determining sentence and the ratio of sentence.
	
	
	In considering the claim that she gave inadequate weight to that feature, it should firstly be noted that the applicant was not a child; at 18 he was a young adult. The principles that apply to the sentencing of children and the considerations referred to in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), did not apply to him.
	
	
	Whilst it is well settled that allowances may be made for the youth and immaturity of an offender, considerations of punishment, general deterrence, and the protection of the community are not thereby rendered nugatory. Indeed, they may in an appropriate case remain significant and even “overriding” considerations.
	
	
	Although in the hearing before us senior counsel for the applicant referred to the crime as “a youthful aberration”, there was nothing childish or immature about the crime or the applicant’s participation in it. A “youthful aberration” might designate the failure of an otherwise diligent student to attend to homework; it cannot sensibly be applied to a very violent home invasion by masked offenders using weapons and force.
	
	
	There was nothing to suggest that the applicant’s participation in this offence was borne of his youth or immaturity. His choice to associate with an older group of men whom he well knew to be engaged in the commission of very serious crime arose from his drug habit, not from immaturity. His choice to continue with his participation in the offence even after the extent of the violence to be employed was clear to him arose from a keen sense of self preservation, not his age or immaturity.
	
	
	Indeed, there was no evidence before the sentencing court that established that the applicant was immature for his age. He did not present as such in his evidence before the sentencing court, and there was evidence that, at 19, he was a responsible partner and father who was employed part-time in gainful employment. Immaturity was not a significant feature.
	
	
	The applicant’s crime was an extremely grave one. As in Pham and Ly v R (1991) 55 A Crim R 128:
	


“[…] the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed    by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment, i.e., coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society.” (at 135)


	
	See also R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; (2004) 145 A Crim R 434 at [28]; and R v AEM Snr & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97]-[98].
	
	
	I can discern no error in the consideration given by the sentencing judge to the question of the applicant’s age, nor in the weight she ascribed to it. I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	


Ground 3. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of sentences imposed on his co-offenders Jacob Huxstep, Dale Egan, and Blake Wood.


	
	When sentence was imposed upon the applicant, on 17 August 2015, none of the other persons charged had been sentenced. Subsequently, Jason Huxstep was sentenced on 16 October 2015, Dale Egan was sentenced on 4 April 2016, and Blake Wood was sentenced on 2 September 2016. All of the offenders were sentenced by her Honour Judge Wells SC.
	
	
	When dealing with the applicant, her Honour had information as to the respective roles of the offenders, and she was provided with the criminal histories for Huxstep, Egan, and Woods. When sentencing the co-offenders her Honour referred to the sentence imposed upon the applicant and the differing objective and subjective cases of the respective offenders. It is clear that she was conscious of the application of the parity principle and at pains to address it.
	
	
	Given that, the applicant faces a difficult task in establishing a parity ground. As was noted by Howie J in Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28], with the agreement of Sully and Latham JJ,
	


“This is a ground where there are considerable obstacles placed before the applicant in circumstances where the sentencing judge is fully aware of sentences imposed upon co-offenders, the reasons for those sentences, and in the remarks indicates why the judge is departing from the sentences imposed upon the others.”


	
	See also Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236 at [58] per McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreed).
	
	
	In part, the applicant relies upon those matters advanced in support of grounds 1 and 2, in submitting that “significantly greater differentiation was required”. In light of the conclusions already reached, his task is even more difficult.
	
	
	A table prepared by the Crown, and accepted by the applicant to be accurate, provides a useful comparison of the sentences imposed upon each offender, and the respective conclusions of the sentencing court:

	As can be seen from the table, the offenders received different sentences, with Huxstep, the offender who had struck Mr Higgins, receiving the longest sentence. Her Honour was not able to attribute responsibility to any of the offenders for possession of the firearm, and nor could she apportion blame for each act of violence beyond the first blow struck to Mr Higgins.
	
	
	As the crime was committed by offenders participating in a joint criminal enterprise, each bore responsibility for acts done in furtherance of the enterprise. In that, there was commonality between each offender. The question is whether the differential treatment accorded each offender by her Honour represents a proper reflection of the differences in culpability, and appropriate recognition of the different subjective cases.
	
	
	The principles underlying the parity principle are well established. It is “an aspect of equal justice [which] requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them”: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 (at 301) per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. See also Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28].
	
	
	Mere disparity between sentences imposed on co-offenders is not of itself a ground for the intervention of an appellate court, rather the difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive so as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) CLR 606 (at 610) per Gibbs CJ; (at 611) per Mason J; (at 624) per Dawson J (with whom Wilson J also agreed); Postiglione v The Queen per Kirby J (at 338). Appellate intervention is only justified where the applicant demonstrates “gross”, “marked”, “glaring” or “manifest” disparity: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 (at [61]-[67]) per Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing).
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon the applicant was a lesser sentence than that imposed upon any of the other offenders. That difference comprehended his lesser role in the commission of the offence, his youth, and his generally positive subjective case. A lesser sentence could not in my opinion be justified by the parity principle or any other sentencing principle.
	
	
	Her Honour was well aware of the parity principle. She made a careful comparison of the objective and subjective cases of each offender and adjusted the sentences imposed to reflect the differing culpability and subjective cases. The level of differentiation was appropriate; certainly there is no “glaring” disparity such that the applicant is entitled to feel aggrieved.
	
	
	No error is established.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to advance this ground.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


Leave to appeal is refused.

4276236,R v Meenesh Kumar [2017] NSWDC 64,"Judgment

Facts


	
	On 24 February 2017, the offender was arraigned before me and pleaded guilty to one charge of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). [1] 
	
	
	The facts of the matter were as follows. The offender had an agreement with a male known as “Jay” to pick up and deliver an unknown quantity of an unknown prohibited drug from Hornsby. The offender was then supposed to collect another unknown quantity of an unknown prohibited drug and deliver it to a location in the city where he would receive payment for both quantities of unknown prohibited drug.
	
	
	Once he had delivered the prohibited drugs, the offender was to be shown how to use the Blackberry phone which he had been provided by “Jay.” From that, he would be told where to return and provide the money he was to receive the delivery of the unknown prohibited drug.
	
	
	Sometime on 16 April 2016, the offender attended an address at Hornsby where he met “Jay”. The offender remained in the driveway of this address and was given a plastic bag that he believed contained half a kilogram of a prohibited drug. The offender placed this bag in an internal side compartment in the boot of his vehicle.
	
	
	The offender was also provided with half of his payment, being $1250, and advised that he would be provided with the other half of the prohibited drugs within three hours.
	
	
	Subsequent to being provided with his payment, the offender was not feeling well and decided he would wait at home and return when the remainder of the prohibited drug was ready.
	
	
	The offender then left the address and as he was driving along Pennant Hills Road, West Pennant Hills, he was intercepted by highway patrol officers due to the manner of his driving.
	
	
	Police subsequently decided to undertake a search of the offender and his vehicle. Prior to the search commencing, police asked the offender if he had anything unlawful such as firearms or drugs, to which the offender replied: “No” and explained that he was nervous about losing his licence again.
	
	
	During the search, police located a dark plastic shopping bag hidden in an internal side compartment in the boot. The plastic bag was opened and inside was a large freezer bag containing a white crystalline substance.
	
	
	When asked about the plastic bag, the offender stated he was unaware of it. In a compartment to the right hand side of the steering wheel, police found $1250 in cash, comprised of $50 notes. A further $270 in cash was found in the offender’s wallet, making a total of $1520 found and seized by police. At the scene, the offender claimed that the $1,250 was money for the car repayment that he had received from his partner.
	
	
	As a result of what was found during the search, the offender was arrested and taken to Ryde Police Station where he was interviewed.
	
	
	In the first interview, the offender confirmed he had owned the BMW vehicle for about a month, having purchased it for $75,000 through BMW finance. He was the only person who used it. The car loan was his only significant debt and the repayments were $990 per month. He confirmed that he was a student claiming Centrelink benefits, but also earned cash in working for a friend as a delivery driver and providing personal training services.
	
	
	When asked about the plastic bag containing the suspected drugs, the offender stated he did not know how it came to be there. He stated that no one was forcing him to transport the drugs. The offender agreed the substance looked like a prohibited drug and assumed it was worth a lot of money.
	
	
	After the first interview was completed, a forensic procedure took place, after which the offender requested a further interview.
	
	
	In the second interview, the offender responded to police questioning as follows:-
	


“Q26: What would you like to tell us that you hadn’t told us in the first interview?

A26: That I was aware that the drugs were in the car.

A27: Yeah, I was aware, that I went to Hornsby to pick up the drug.

A28: And I was supposed to just drive em to the city, pick up ome cash and drop it back. I was unaware how much drugs, I was unaware of the drug type, I was just given it in the bag and I just put it in the car. I was unaware of the amount of money that I was picking up at the time, that I would be informed later and when I was to pick up the remaining drugs. I was also given the Blackberry then and that I was told that when I pick up the remaining drugs that I would be told, I would be shown how to use the [Blackberry] and that way I can communicate with the person that I was supposed to see in the city to organise the drop off and pick up the cash. And then head back to drop off the money.

A41 – 42: Like he told me that was something was coming up, recently. And told me today - - - That he would need me to drive for him. And to head up to Hornsby to pick up some drugs. And that I would need to drive it to the city and like, everything that I mentioned before. But the weeks leading up to were just like random conversations here and there about it. And I even asked him like why would you trust me to move a large amount of drugs? Yeah and then he goes, I asked him, isn’t there a risk? And he goes, like, that there’s no risk to him.

A44: Ah, I wasn’t sure how much I was supposed to pick up, I was just told to head down, when I got there I received one bag. And he kept, he referred to it as a half. And that I would be needing to pick up another half to take to the city. So I just assumed it would’ve been like a full kilo.

A68: I was informed to pull into the driveway. I pulled into the drive way, it was the house with the junk in front of it … So I pulled into there and waited for him to, he came, brought out the bag.

Q97: Did you know that you were supposed to pick up a kilo when you went there?

A97: No I was unaware of the amount of drugs or the tye [sic] of drugs that I was picking up.

Q98: But you knew it was drugs?

A98: Yeah.

Q101: You did it to make money?

A101: Yes.

Q116: Have you done this type of thing before?

A116: No I haven’t done it.

Q117: Would you have potentially done it again if …

A117: If I, all seriousness, if I was to get away with it today I probably would have done it again.”


	
	The offender went on to state that he communicated with “Jay” via the messaging application “Wickr”. He had met “Jay” about two weeks previously, when he was approached by him whilst sitting in his car with his partner. They talked about his car and the monthly repayments, and “Jay” said he could help him make money.
	
	
	The contents of the plastic bag were sent off for analysis and it was found to contain dimethylsulfone weighing 522.6 grams. Dimethylsulfone is not a prohibited drug but is used as a cutting agent to dilute prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The matter before this Court is based on offender’s role in having an agreement with “Jay” to supply an unknown person with an unknown prohibited drug in return for payment. The offender acknowledges that he was to be paid between $1,000 and $3,000 for making the delivery and the total amount of drugs he would be delivering in the two bags would be a kilogram.
	
	
	The offender was further charged in relation to dealing with suspected proceeds of crime contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) [2]  in respect of the money amount found in his possession. I have been requested to take this offence into account on a Form 1, pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). [3] 
	
	
	The Crown acknowledges that it was unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had agreed to deliver more than an indictable amount of a prohibited drug. The offender was however aware that he was agreeing to take part in the supply of an indictable quantity of an unknown prohibited drug.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The offender’s conduct involved him entering into an agreement to receive payment for transporting a prohibited drug. He was provided with a Blackberry phone. The offender transported the package which was not, as it turns out, a prohibited drug, but was in fact a cutting agent used to dilute prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The offence was committed for financial gain. However, the remuneration was transactional, not profit-based. [4] 
	
	
	There was no evidence or submission that the offender was substantially involved in the trafficking of prohibited drugs. [5]  Nor was he involved in the selling of the drugs. I accept that his agreement essentially involved him making two pick-ups and deliveries. His role was that of a courier/transporter.
	
	
	The offence involved an indictable quantity.
	
	
	In determining objective gravity, s 25(1) of the 1985 Act distinguishes drug types by reference to threshold quantities. I cannot determine the identity or purity of the prohibited drug that the offender had agreed to transport. What is known is that the offender agreed to transport approximately one kilogram of a prohibited drug. In these circumstances the offender can only be sentenced only on the basis of what is proved beyond reasonable doubt. [6]  This would be an agreement to supply in the bottom range of an indictable quantity. Mere quantity in any event is not the sole or even principal determinant of the sentence in relation to an offence of this kind and the role of the offender is more important as is the level of participation in the offence. [7]  Further, his moral culpability is not diminished by the fact that his offending did not involve a prohibited drug. [8] 
	
	
	Whilst the offence is serious, on the established facts, I would regard the offence as falling within the lower range of objective seriousness.
	


Mitigating factors

Plea of guilty


	
	On the offender’s behalf it was submitted that he had offered to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, and was entitled to a maximum discount of 25% in accordance with R v Thomson; R v Houlton [9]  and s 22 of the 1999 Act. The Crown made no contrary submission. I accept that a discount of 25% on account of his early willingness to plead is appropriate.
	


Discount for assistance to law enforcement authorities


	
	During the course of submissions the Crown acknowledged that but for the offender’s own admission, the proceedings against him would not have been able to be instituted. Nevertheless, the Crown argued that this was not a case where a further discount was appropriate.
	
	
	At the time of his admission to police, the offender was not aware that the package in his possession was not in fact a prohibited drug. He may well have believed himself to already be a suspect and that by coming forward his likely or inevitable conviction and sentence could be significantly discounted.
	
	
	In Panetta v R, Adams J with whom Ward JA agreed (on the reasons to uphold the appeal), stated:
	


“[50] very logic that accepts that sentences should be set to deter crime, by parity of reasoning, is set to deter persons who have committed crimes from voluntarily coming forward and admitting to them. The circumstances, of course, vary enormously. In some cases, the offender will already be a suspect and may think that by coming forward their likely or inevitable conviction and sentence can be significantly discounted. Where, however, the crime itself is not suspected and unlikely in the extreme to be detected, different considerations arise. The only motivation in such a case, as here, appears to be the attempt to assuage serious feelings of guilt …” [10] 


	
	In my view, the case falls within the parameters of s 23(1) of the 1999 Act. In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty and the nature and extent of the extent of the penalty I take account the factors in s 23(2) of the 1999 Act. I accept the offender was truthful, complete and reliable as to his own culpability. There is no evidence to suggest that information about the involvement of prohibited drugs and the agreement to transport two packages that he would have otherwise become known to authorities. I also bear in mind that he provided that assistance at the time of his arrest albeit that he did not at that point know that the package in his possession was not a prohibited drug. I also bear in mind that his admission relates to the offence on which he is being sentenced and benefit that will otherwise be reflected in terms of demonstrating remorse and rehabilitation.
	
	
	A further discount would be appropriate on this ground, being in the order of 25%.
	


Previous convictions


	
	The offender has no previous criminal convictions. His traffic antecedents were tendered. [11]  He was a suspended driver at the time of the offence. No submission was made that this was an aggravating factor going to sentence pursuant to s 21A(2)(d) of the 1999 Act.
	
	
	The offender was subsequently charged on 29 February 2016 with driving whilst suspended. On 16 May 2016, no conviction was entered upon him entering into a bond under s 10(1)(b) of the 1999 Act, for a period of two years.
	
	
	It was submitted on the offender’s behalf that at the time he was stopped by police in relation to the matter before me, the offender was anxious. He was facing Court and could be disqualified with consequence that he would have been out of work. 
	


Previous good character


	
	It was further submitted that the offender was also entitled to have his previous good character taken into account, in accordance with s 21A(3)(f) of the 1999 Act.
	
	
	Before the Court were references submitted on the offender’s behalf, including from: Mr Hamish Krishneil Kumar (the offender’s elder brother), Ms Reyna Saeesha Kumar (the offender’s younger sister) and from Ms Linda Gejakly. [12]  Needless to say, each of them refer to the offender’s conduct as being out of character.
	
	
	The Court also heard evidence from Ms Nikita Rao, who is the offender’s partner. She described as the “kindest person” that she knew, “caring” and the “biggest motivation in [her] life” and “respectful and always pushing to be better and trying to do the right thing.” She stated that she was shocked when she was informed as to what took place and did not know why he did it, but was aware that the offender was under financial stress and thinking about how to get money. It is unclear as to the extent of her knowledge however, in light of the offender’s earlier admission that his partner was in the car when he was first approached by “Jay”. Ms Rao stated that the offender was studying at university and was planning to go back to study Science, and was trying to establish a dismantling shop. She had known him for approximately one year and was very supportive.
	
	
	There was little challenge to her evidence.
	
	
	The offender’s absence of prior convictions and prior good character are acknowledged as going to rehabilitation and his likelihood of reoffending. However in a case of this nature it otherwise carries limited weight. [13]  In R v Leroy, Street CJ held:-
	


“Very frequently, those selected to play some part in the chain of drug trafficking, as the appellant plainly enough was, are selected because their records, their past and their lifestyles are not such as to attract suspicion. It is this in particular which has led the courts to take in the case of drug trafficking a view which does not involve the same degree of leniency being extended to first offenders.”

Remorse


	
	The Crown submits that there has been an absence of remorse. It draws attention to the agreed facts which record the offender when interviewed by police stating:
	


“Q117 Would you have potentially done it again if …

A117 If I, all seriousness, if I was to get away with it today I probably would have done it again.”


	
	Subsequent to this however the offender is recorded in the Pre-Sentence Report as describing his actions as “stupid” and “reflected that the criminal conviction will have ongoing consequences with regards to any future travel or employment ventures.”
	
	
	Ms Rao gave evidence that the offender was deeply sorry for what occurred and would “definitely not do it again.”
	
	
	The offender’s brother, Hamish Krishneil Kumar, states that he visited the offender in prison and he “showed great remorse for his actions and was ashamed of himself and what he had done.” [14] 
	
	
	The offender’s sister, Reyna Saeesha Kumar, states that the offender is “very remorseful of [sic] his actions and wants to continue bettering his life.” [15] 
	
	
	Abraham Jlailaty describes himself as “[the offender’s] long friend and now employer for the past three years.” He states that the offender has “great regrets [sic].” [16] 
	
	
	Another character witness being a close friend, Linda Gejakly, attests that the offender has told her “time and time again of his regret and remorse in regards to these charges and that fact is obvious as I see the pain on his face as he does so.” [17] 
	
	
	s 21A(3)(i) of the 1999 Act allows the Court to take remorse into account for mitigation of sentence but only if:
	



	
	The offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions; and
	
	
	The offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).
	



	
	I have borne in mind the offender’s statement to police at the time of the interview stating that if he was to get away with it he “probably would have done it again.” Nevertheless the offender’s plea of guilty and preparedness to confess to offending also need to be considered. Whilst many of the accounts of remorse come through testimonials of family and friends, I am on balance prepared to accept that he is genuinely remorseful and his initial statement to police has no longer reflects his position. In so finding, I accept that in part this arises from concern as to the consequences that now confront him
	


The offender’s likelihood of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The offender is the middle of three children having arrived in Australia from New Zealand from 1996. He was educated to the Year 12 level and completed his Higher School Certificate in 2009. He commenced tertiary studies in Science on two occasions, however deferred those studies owing to the loss of his licence.
	
	
	He has held employment from the age of 14, having worked in various part time positions in retail.
	
	
	In 2014, the offender secured employment in an automotive dismantling yard, undertaking deliveries and online advertising duties. Prior to the most recent loss of his licence, he stated it was his intention was to purchase the business from his employer, however he was unable to maintain employment after his driving suspension.
	
	
	The offender advised that since his release on bail, he has registered with a labour hire agency for casual work, however stated that his current bail curfew had been an impediment to securing work. Although the Pre-Sentence Report noted that he was not receiving casual work and had no source of income at the time, the sentencing hearing suggested he is now working.
	
	
	So far as his mental health was concerned, the offender reported as having suffered from depressive symptoms and a general feeling of being overwhelmed since the loss of his licence. He advised that this was compounded by the expected loss of his employment after making a considerable financial commitment in the form of a vehicle loan.
	
	
	The offender sought a referral to a psychologist and reported that to date, he has attended six sessions. He advised that this has assisted him in coping with matters relating to unemployment, the Court matters and his bail conditions, as well as unresolved family issues. Contact between Community Corrections and the offender’s psychologist indicated that the offender is yet to schedule future appointments owing to the uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter. However, the psychologist advised that the offender should continue with intervention to address stress, financial issues and crisis management.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report refers to the offender acknowledging that his involvement in the offence was financially motivated. Overall, he is assessed as requiring a low-medium level of intervention by Community Corrections.
	
	
	Although the offender was said to be suffering from emotional stress due to his parents’ break up, the Pre-Sentence Report does not ascribe much significance to this. The contact with the psychologist appears to be more associated with his financial stress. It is also noted that the offender disclosed a history of problematic gambling as a means of coping with his stress, estimating the first occurrence of this issue in 2013, when he would gamble his entire wage of poker machines. He reported recommencing gambling as a result of stress from the current matter, admitting to having gambled some $2000 in savings during the assessment period.
	
	
	The offender resides with his parents and siblings at Prestons. The Pre-Sentence Report records his upbringing in generally positive terms.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the offender has a supportive family.
	
	
	The offender is currently in a relationship of almost 12 months’ duration formed after several years of friendship with his partner. The Pre-Sentence Report also shows that she continues to support him.
	
	
	Since his release on remand on 6 May 2016, the offender has been subject to significant bail conditions. Those conditions have included reporting daily, residence, curfew restrictions and surrendering his passport. On the last occasion, the reporting condition was varied to four times per week and the curfew hours and conditions were relaxed. There have been no reported incidents of non-compliance.
	
	
	For the purposes of s 21A(3)(h) of the 1999 Act, I would assess the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable. For the purposes of s 21A(3)(g) of the 1999 Act, I find the offender has a low risk of reoffending.
	


Form 1 offence


	
	The facts of the offence of being in possession of proceeds of crime are encompassed in the charge the subject of the Form 1, which I have been requested to take into account pursuant to s 32(1) of the 1999 Act and I do so in accordance with the decision of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1) of 2002. [18]  
	


Pre-sentence custody


	
	The offender has spent 20 days in custody. I take this into account as required by s 24(a) of the 1999 Act.
	
	
	I further take into account the significant restraints on his liberty since been released on bail conditions. [19] 
	


Sentence


	
	Having regard to the purposes of sentencing contained in s 3A of the 1999 Act I accept that the offender has been specifically deterred, and that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. Therefore need to protect the community from the offender assumes relatively less consideration. However, it is necessary nonetheless to ensure the offender is adequately punished, his offending conduct is denounced and that he be made accountable for his actions.
	
	
	In R v Shi, [20]  the Court of Criminal Appeal stated:
	


“[34] … the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply networks is significant, and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehousemen and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution, would simply collapse: R v Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 and R v Laurentio and Becheru (1962) 63 A Crim R 402.” [21] 


	
	I have found the offence is in the lower range of objective seriousness. The offender’s admissions in circumstances that resulted in a charge that would otherwise not have been brought diminishes the need for general deterrence. However the sentence cannot fall so as to be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown did not submit that the threshold in s 5(1) of the 1999 Act was met such that no penalty other than a penalty of imprisonment was appropriate. Counsel for the offender submitted the case called for a suspended term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Overall, I have formed the view that the purposes of sentencing are such that no penalty other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	But for his plea of guilty and assistance, I would have sentenced the offender to a term of 16 months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	Taking into account the plea and assistance and bearing in mind the need for adequate punishment, I have formed the view that the nature of the sentence can be varied such that a suspended sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment properly serves the purposes of sentencing. [22] 
	


Orders


	
	The offender is convicted;
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to a term of 16 months’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1)(a) of the 1999 Act, I suspend execution of the whole of the sentence for 16 months; and
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1)(b) of the 1999 Act, I direct that the offender be released on the condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a period of 16 months.
	
	
	In so ordering, I take into account the offence on the Form 1.

4276238,Chung v R [2017] NSWCCA 48,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was convicted by a jury of breaking and entering a dwelling-house and committing a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation, in contravention of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 112(2). The serious indictable offence was intimidation and the circumstances of aggravation were the fact that he knew a person was in the dwelling-house at the time.

At the time of the offence, the applicant was in a relationship with a woman who claimed to have been owed approximately $300,000 by the complainant’s brother. The applicant was trying to help her recover this money.

On 16 September 2012, the complainant was at home. The screen door at the front of the house was closed but not locked. There was an issue at trial as to whether the front wooden door was slightly ajar, or wide open. The Crown case was that the applicant had rung the doorbell, entered the dwelling-house without permission and demanded to know where the complainant’s brother was. The applicant then assaulted the complainant, kicking him in the stomach and punching him in the face. This led to a fight, in the course of which the applicant produced a knife. The fight continued outside the house.

The applicant’s case was that he had rung the doorbell and entered in response to a voice calling out “[p]lease come in” in the Korean language. The applicant explained that he needed money from the complainant’s brother and claimed that the complainant told him to get out and pushed him. The applicant then pushed the complainant, leading the complainant to punch him and chase him out of the house with a golf club. The fight then continued outside, where both men fell to the ground. The applicant claimed that the complainant then produced a knife.

The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, commencing on 16 October 2015. The maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years imprisonment.

On appeal, the applicant sought leave to appeal against:

(i)   Conviction:

(1)   on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence

(ii)   Sentence, on the following grounds:

(2)   the sentencing judge erred in finding that the offending was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness;

(2A)   the sentencing judge erred in finding that the offending was aggravated by being committed in the home of the victim under s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW);

(3)   The sentencing judge erred in not quantifying the discount he gave to the applicant in relation to the delay in the proceedings and the applicant being on bail;

(4)   The sentence is manifestly excessive.

The Court:

In relation to ground 1:

(1)   It is a well-established principle of the criminal law that the assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of witnesses is for the jury’s determination. [23]

Atai v R [2014] NSWCCA 210

In relation to ground 2A:

(2)   It is not an element of an offence contrary to Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 112(2) that the premises which are the subject of offending be those of the victim. It follows that there is no double counting in considering the fact that an offence contrary to s 112(2) occurred in the premises of the victim as an aggravating factor under Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 21A(2)(eb). [47]-[48]

Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142; Smith v R [2013] NSWCCA 209; R v Bennett (2014) A Crim R 1

In relation to ground 2:

(3)   The Court will be slow to set aside a finding in respect of the objective seriousness of particular offending which has been made by a sentencing judge in the exercise of his or her discretion. [57]

Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282; Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35; Baines v R [2016] NSWCCA 132

In relation to ground 3:

(4)   A sentencing judge is not obliged to quantify the discount applied to sentence on account of a period on bail or delay in the progress of trial. [63]

R v Weismantel [2016] NSWCCA 204; Flaherty v R; R v Flaherty (2016) 92 NSWLR 290; [2016] NSWCCA 188

In relation to ground 4:

(5)   To show that a sentence is manifestly excessive, it is necessary to establish that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust. It has been observed on numerous occasions that there is no single correct sentence. [74], [80]

Background facts


	
	The applicant and the complainant, who were both born in Korea, were strangers. At the time of the offence, the applicant was in a relationship with a Ms Park. Ms Park claimed to have been owed approximately $300,000 by Mr Samuel Han, who is the complainant’s brother. The applicant was trying to assist Ms Park to recover the money.
	
	
	Mr Samuel Han had resided for a time at the complainant’s home but as at 16 September 2012, the date of the offence, he no longer did so. There was no suggestion that the complainant knew of Ms Park’s claim that his brother owed her any money.
	
	
	The front of the complainant’s dwelling had a lockable screen door and a deadbolted wooden door. On 16 September 2012, the complainant had returned home from church in the afternoon. He used a key to open the door. He closed the screen door but did not lock it. There was an issue at trial as to whether the wooden door was slightly ajar, or wide open.
	
	
	The complainant’s two stepchildren were at home at the time but his wife was at work. The complainant was in his lounge room, which was just off the front entrance to the dwelling, at the computer.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the applicant had rung the doorbell, had entered the dwelling-house without permission, asked the complainant whether he was “James” (the name of another brother of the complainant) and then demanded to know where “Sam” was. The applicant assaulted the complainant, kicking him in the stomach and punching him in the face. Both men fell to the floor and were wrestling with each other when, the complainant stated, the applicant pulled out a knife.
	
	
	The complainant called out to his stepchildren. The children each saw the struggle taking place and went to their respective bedrooms and made Triple-0 calls. Neither child saw a knife but there was evidence that their view of the struggle was partially obscured by a sofa. The complainant’s wife and his two stepchildren said that they had not seen the knife that was used in the struggle before and that it was not the complainant’s knife.
	
	
	The applicant’s case at trial was that he had rung the front doorbell to the dwelling-house and had entered in response to a voice inside calling out “[p]lease come in”, spoken in the Korean language. The applicant said that the complainant asked him “[who] are you, what is it about?”, to which he responded “I’m after Samuel Han”. The applicant said that the complainant asked “[w]hat for?” and that he explained that he needed “to get $300,000 from Samuel Han on my friend’s behalf”. The applicant said that the complainant then told him to get out and pushed him. The applicant pushed the complainant in response, at which point the complainant punched him in the face. The complainant pursued the applicant out of the house wielding a golf club.
	
	
	The fight between the two men continued outside on the lawn. The complainant was wielding a golf club. The applicant gave evidence that there was a struggle over the golf club, at which point both men fell to the ground. The applicant said that he then tried to leave the premises but the complainant:
	


“… grabbed me from behind. And then he came on top of me. And he was hitting me …”

The applicant said that was when he saw a knife in the complainant’s hand.


	
	The police arrived fairly promptly and at a point when the two men were still struggling on the ground at the front of the house. Each man claimed he had thrown the knife over the fence. Both men had injuries, including head injuries, cuts and bruises and DNA evidence of both was found on the knife.
	


Ground 1: The conviction appeal


	
	The applicant claimed that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence. The sole challenge made under this ground was as to the jury’s satisfaction that it had been established that the applicant had broken and entered the complainant’s home, ‘break and enter’ being an element of the offence charged.
	
	
	The case was conducted on the basis that the outcome was dependent upon whether the jury accepted the evidence of the complainant or the evidence of the applicant. This was made clear in the trial judge’s summing up to the jury which, on this point, was in the following terms:
	


“What the prosecution must prove is that [the applicant] broke and entered the dwelling house of [the complainant] … there is not much controversy about what these words and expressions mean. Break and enter means what you would expect it to mean. If the door is closed and you have no reason to think that you are invited into someone’s home and you push the door open and go in, in other words if what happened is the same as what [the complainant’s] account is, then that is a break and enter. And so if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what [the applicant] did was to push open the door without an invitation, step into the house and go in, that is a break and enter.”


	
	The applicant’s approach to the appeal against conviction was to isolate various parts of the complainant’s evidence in chief and to contrast that evidence with suggested inconsistencies in his cross-examination and, in respect of one matter, whether the complainant had made a prior inconsistent statement. The applicant contended that an examination of these inconsistencies would demonstrate that the complainant was an unreliable witness, such that his evidence should not have been accepted.
	
	
	There were six categories of evidence isolated in this way. Those categories were as follows:
	



	
	whether the wooden front door was closed or was ajar;
	
	
	whether the applicant rang the doorbell;
	
	
	what happened upon the applicant’s entry into the house;
	
	
	when the complainant first saw the knife;
	
	
	the use of the golf club; and
	
	
	the use of a rock.
	



	
	The applicant requires leave to appeal against conviction: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(b). The Court considers that leave to appeal should be refused. In coming to that determination, we have not considered it necessary to set out in these reasons each and every piece of evidence to which the applicant referred. The evidence was considered in detail during the course of the oral submissions.
	
	
	In our opinion what the evidence demonstrates is that there were arguably some inconsistencies in portions of the complainant’s evidence, none of which were of any particular moment, and it was a matter for the jury to decide the evidence they accepted and the evidence they rejected.
	
	
	To demonstrate why we have determined to refuse leave, we have chosen what might be thought to be the strongest examples of the inconsistencies upon which the appellant relied as follows.
	



	
		
			
			Whether the complainant closed the wooden door
			
		
		
			
			Evidence in chief
			
			
			Evidence in cross-examination
			
		
		
			
			“The screen door: I completely closed the door in – I latched it. The inside wooden door: what I mean is, I latched it, which means I did not lock it, but I latched it.”
			
			
			“Q. You told the police in your statement on 3 October, approximately a little over three weeks or so after the events, you said in your statement,

			‘I just came back and went inside. I had the keys to the house. I had to open the main door with a key, but the screen door was open. When I went inside, I left the main door open, as I was expecting my wife to come back home from work around that time’?

			A. INTERPRETER: That’s right.

			…

			Q. Is your evidence that the screen door was closed, fully closed, but not locked?

			A. INTERPRETER: That’s right.

			Q. But the wooden door was not fully closed, but open about two or three centimetres?

			A. INTERPRETER: That’s right.

			Q. And not locked?

			A. INTERPRETER: That’s right.”
			
		
		
			
			Whether the complainant heard the doorbell ring
			
		
		
			
			Evidence in chief
			
			
			Evidence in cross-examination
			
		
		
			
			“Q. Why did you stop using the internet?

			A. INTERPRETER: I heard the doorbell ringing and I saw a man walking in so I stopped”
			
			
			“Q. Do you remember the solicitor asking the question, ‘Did you hear the door bell first’, and do you remember saying, ‘No, never. He never pressed the door bell. He opened the door and entered, so I said, who are you, why are you entering?’ Do you remember giving that answer in a conference with the prosecution’s solicitor, in October last year?

			…

			A. INTERPRETER: I can’t remember that very well.”
			
		
		
			
			Whether the applicant took a knife out when inside the house
			
		
		
			
			Evidence in chief
			
			
			Evidence in cross-examination
			
		
		
			
			“Q. He got on top of you and what did he do?

			A. He continuously assaulted me.

			Q. When you say he assaulted you what did he actually do?

			A. INTERPRETER: He began to hit on my face with the fists.

			Q. How many times did he hit you in the face with his fist?

			A. INTERPRETER: I remember it was many times.

			Q. Which hand did he use, which fist did he use to hit you in the face?

			A. INTERPRETER: He used many fists and I saw him take – I saw him taking a – took a knife out
			
			
			“Q. The question was, when was the very first time you noticed this person holding a knife – [the applicant]?

			A. INTERPRETER: As I was kicked on the stomach, I saw it.

			Q. Is the position, do you accept that you suggested to the police in your statement that you saw the man armed with a knife immediately you laid eyes on him?

			A. INTERPRETER: Yes, that is right.

			Q. In other words, when he came in the door?

			A. INTERPRETER: That is right.

			Q. He walked in the door and you saw he had a knife straight away, is that right?

			A. INTERPRETER: Yes I saw it.

			…

			Q. Yesterday, did you tell us that the first time you realised the person had a knife was when you had been struggling with him?

			A. INTERPRETER: What I meant was, it is not what I meant. What I meant was that the moment I saw him, that man kicked me so I called that as struggling against each other with bodies, from that moment onwards, and after that, I knew he had a knife.

			…

			Q. In your statement to the police in October, did you say this in paragraph 7, ‘I saw him pull out a knife from his clothes, I can’t remember if he took it out of his pants or his shirt pocket’, do you remember telling the police that?

			A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

			Q. Is it your evidence that you actually saw this man pull a knife out from his clothes?

			A. INTERPRETER: I did not see him taking the knife out but putting – but I saw he was having a knife.”
			
		
	



	
	A number of observations may be made about these examples of the evidence upon which the applicant relied. First, the complainant was giving his evidence through an interpreter. There was no evidence of who the interpreter was in the conference with the solicitor. At the time that the complainant made his statement to the police, the complainant’s stepson acted as interpreter. There is no evidence of the questions asked nor is there evidence of the accuracy of the translation.
	
	
	It is apparent that, when consideration is given to the sequence of questions and answers given in respect of the knife, set out above, the complainant was attempting to explain in a narrative way what happened: a person came into his house; he saw a knife and in that regard, he explained that it was when the man kicked him and they were struggling that he saw it.
	
	
	The inconsistencies that the applicant relies upon do not involve any stark withdrawal, if any withdrawal at all, from his essential version of the incident. To the extent that there was any divergence in the evidence in chief and the cross-examination, it does not touch upon the essential issue that was put in contest on this ground of appeal, namely, whether the applicant entered into the complainant’s home uninvited. The complainant said that he did not call out when the applicant rang the doorbell, “come in, come in”. He did not resile from that evidence at any time.
	
	
	The Court reiterates the well-established principle of the criminal law that the assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of witnesses is quintessentially one for a jury to determine: Atai v R [2014] NSWCCA 210 at [134].
	
	
	In this case, we are satisfied that the appeal against conviction is without merit and that it is an appropriate case to refuse leave to appeal against conviction.
	


The application for leave to appeal against sentence

Ground 2A: His Honour erred in finding that the offending was aggravated by being committed in the home of the victim under s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)


	
	This ground was added by leave following the conclusion of the hearing and arose out of matters raised in the course of argument. As the resolution of this ground may have a bearing upon ground 2 (which asserts an error in respect of the findings of the sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of the offending) it is appropriate to deal with it first.
	


The indictment


	
	The principal count in the indictment of which the applicant was found guilty by the jury was in the following terms:
	


“On 16 September 2012 at Granville in the State of New South Wales did break and enter the dwelling house of Hyn Tai Han … and then in the said dwelling house committed a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation of Hyun Tai in circumstances of aggravation namely that he knew a person was in the place where the offence was committed.” (emphasis added)


	
	That count alleged an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Act. Section 112 is in the following terms:
	


“112   Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence

(1)   A person who:

(a)   breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or

(b)   being in any dwelling-house or other building commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the dwelling-house or other building,

is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years.

(2)   Aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.

(3)   Specially aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (2) in circumstances of special aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.”


	
	The term “dwelling-house” is defined in s 4 of the Act in the following terms:
	


“Dwelling-house” includes:

(a)   any building or other structure intended for occupation as a dwelling and capable of being so occupied, although it has never been so occupied,

(b)   a boat or vehicle in or on which any person resides, and

(c)   any building or other structure within the same curtilage as a dwelling-house and occupied therewith or whose use is ancillary to the occupation of the dwelling-house.”

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge said (inter alia) the following:
	


“13.   In this case Mr Chung broke into his victim's home armed with a knife and attacked the householder. That is a further aggravating factor that the offence was committed in the home of Mr Han.” (emphasis added)


	
	His Honour then said:
	


“15.   Mr Chung said that a friend of his had been defrauded of a lot of money by a man who used to live in Mr Han’s household (the man was an in-law or brother). He went to the household – having apparently followed Mr Han’s wife – to find the man and seek his own justice for his friend.”

The relevant legislation


	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Sentencing Act) is in (inter alia) the following terms:
	


“Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing

…

(2)   Aggravating factors

The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

…

(eb)   the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person,

…

The Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.”


	
	The provisions of s 21A(2)(eb) were considered in Jonson v R [2016] NSWCCA 286. Bathurst CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) concluded, at [40], that the section does not impose, as a pre-condition for its operation, that the offender be an intruder into the victim’s home (although on the facts of the present case that was obviously the position). His Honour rejected, at [50], the suggestion that there was a rule of law that the fact that the offence was committed in the victim’s home could only be an aggravating factor on sentence if the offender was an intruder.
	
	
	The present ground raises the question whether, in the emphasised passage of that part of the remarks on sentence set out at [29] above, the sentencing judge was in breach of the suffix to s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act, or otherwise ‘double counted’ the fact that the offending was committed in the victim’s home.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	It was submitted that the applicant had gone to the premises because he wanted to ‘deal’ with a person whom he thought lived there. It was submitted that in these circumstances, having regard to the way in which the Crown put its case, it was an element of the offence that it was committed in the victim’s home.
	
	
	In advancing these submissions, counsel for the applicant made reference to decisions of this Court in Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 and R v Bennett (2014) 245 A Crim R 1; [2014] NSWCCA 197. Counsel submitted that to the extent that these authorities ran contrary to the position advanced on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground, they should not be followed.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that there was no error on the part of the sentencing judge. It was submitted that in both Palijan and Bennett, as well as in Smith v R [2013] NSWCCA 209, this Court had rejected the very proposition upon which this ground depended.
	
	
	To the extent that the position advanced on behalf of the applicant mounted a challenge to the correctness of these decisions, the Crown submitted that this Court was bound to follow them unless positively satisfied they were plainly wrong. It was submitted that each of the decisions was correct.
	


Consideration


	
	In Palijan the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated breaking and entering and committing the serious indictable offence of intimidation in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he used corporal violence on the victim, contrary to s 112(2) of the Act. The facts were that prior to a period of incarceration, the applicant had been in an intimate relationship with the victim. Upon his release from custody, the applicant approached the victim, who indicated that she did not wish to have any contact with him. The applicant persisted in attempting to contact the victim by telephone, with the victim refusing to take his calls. The applicant then sent a text message to the victim, informing her that he was coming to her home and asking her to telephone him. She did not do so. The applicant forced entry into the victim’s home in her absence. Upon her arrival, the applicant appeared and produced a knife which he had obtained from the kitchen of the premises, following which he threatened the victim.
	
	
	One of the grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant in that case was that the sentencing judge had erred in finding that the offending was aggravated by the fact that the premises which were the subject of the break in were those of the victim. Barr AJ (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed) said:
	


“[20]   It was submitted on appeal that, given that the offence was break and enter and that the aggravating feature was the use of corporal violence on the victim there was no increased criminality by virtue of the fact that the home broken into was the home of the victim.

[21]   The element of breaking and entering in s 112(2) Crimes Act does not require that the premises be the home of the victim. Section 21A(2)(eb) [of the] Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence include –

(eb)   the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person.

[22]   It seems to me that a law-abiding member of the community is entitled to feel safe in his or her own home. There is to my mind something particularly repugnant about the forced entry of an offender into a house and violating the safety of that place by carrying out an attack like that of the applicant. In my opinion his Honour was entitled to take that matter into account as aggravating the applicant’s criminality.”


	
	In Smith, the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation, contrary to s 112(2) of the Act. The circumstance of aggravation was that he knew that persons were present within the dwelling house. The applicant and the victim had been in a domestic relationship which had broken down. The applicant forced entry into the premises of the victim and her partner, before threatening and assaulting the victim. R A Hulme J (with whom Leeming JA and Button J agreed) said:
	


“[44]   Finally it was submitted that the judge erred by taking into account as an aggravating feature that the offence was committed in the victim's home, which was an element of the offence. The problem for the applicant in this respect is that in the written submissions provided by his then legal representative to the sentencing judge, it was conceded on the authority of this Court's judgment in Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [21]-[22] that this was an additional aggravating feature.

[45]   In Palijan the offender broke into the home of a woman with whom he had previously been in a relationship. He was sentenced for an offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely intimidation, in circumstances of aggravation, namely the infliction of corporal violence. There was also an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The first ground of appeal was that the judge erred when finding that the fact that the home broken into was the victim's home was an aggravating feature.

[46]   Barr AJ, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed, held that the element of breaking and entering in s 112(2) of the Crimes Act does not require that the premises be the home of the victim. Regard was had to s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

[47]   The concession by the applicant's representative in the court below was appropriate and no error is disclosed in the judge taking this matter into account, along with all of the other matters he mentioned, in his assessment of the seriousness of the offence.

[48]   I am not persuaded that there was any double counting in any of the respects contended. I would not uphold Ground 1.”


	
	In Bennett the respondent to the Crown appeal had known the victim for some time. They shared an interest in illicit drugs, the victim having previously supplied cannabis to the respondent from time to time. On the day of the offending the respondent consumed a significant quantity of alcohol before making attempts to contact the victim, with a view to obtaining a quantity of cannabis from him. A series of telephone calls from the respondent to the victim went unanswered, a circumstance which appeared to frustrate the respondent. In the company of another person, the respondent went to the victim’s premises. On arrival, the respondent banged on a door, before opening a glass sliding door to gain entry. He located the victim and began punching and threatening him. He pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Act, the circumstances of aggravation being that he knew there were persons inside the dwelling-house. The sentencing judge declined to make a finding that the offence was committed in the victim’s home for the purposes of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Act, on the basis that this was an element of the offence. The Crown argued that in doing so, his Honour had erred.
	
	
	Simpson J (as her Honour then was) concluded that this ground should be upheld. In doing so, her Honour said the following:
	


“[4]   By ground 2 the Crown asserts that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account, as an aggravating factor, that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. Hall J would reject that ground on the basis that that it was so committed is an element of the offence charged. I disagree, and would uphold the ground, for the following reasons.

[5]   Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) … sets out, in subs (2), aggravating factors that, when known, must be taken into account in sentencing. Paragraph (eb) prescribes as an aggravating factor that ‘the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person’. However, the suffix to s 21A(2) provides that a court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if that aggravating factor is an element of the offence.

…

[8]   The elements of an offence against s 112(2) are:

- that the accused person broke and entered into a dwelling house or other building;

and

- therein committed a serious indictable offence.

There is no element of this offence that the “dwelling house or other building” broken and entered is the home of the victim of the offence.

[9]   Section 112(2), by reference to s 112(1), is concerned with offences committed in ‘any dwelling-house or other building’. By s 4 of the Crimes Act, ‘dwelling house’ includes:

(a)   any building or other structure intended for occupation as a dwelling and capable of being so occupied, although it has never been so occupied,

(b)   a boat or vehicle in or on which a person resides, and

(c)   any building or other structure within the same curtilage as a dwelling-house, and occupied therewith or whose use is ancillary to the occupation of the dwellling-house.

[10]   That a ‘dwelling house’ includes unoccupied premises, and that s 112(2) envisages break and entry into buildings other than a dwelling house, both indicate that the offence created by the sub-section is not limited to buildings that constitute the home of the victim or any other person. That the building the subject of the break and entry was the home of the victim is therefore not an element of the offence charged.

[11]   The charge on the indictment was:

On the 18th day of November 2012, at ORANGE, in the State of New South Wales, [the respondent] did break and enter the dwelling house of [the victim] situate at [address] and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely, did intimidate [the victim], in circumstances of aggravation, namely, he knew that there were persons present within the said dwelling house.

[12]   That the indictment specified that the building that the respondent broke and entered was a dwelling house, and that it was the home of the victim, are not elements of the offence. They are no more than particulars of the offence against s 112(2).

[13]   It was, in my opinion, an error to find that the fact that the offence was committed in the home of the victim was an element of the offence and therefore not an aggravating factor within s 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.”


	
	Harrison J agreed with Simpson J.
	
	
	Hall J reached a contrary view:
	


“[46]   The Crown submitted that it was an error to find that it was not capable of constituting an aggravating factor. In support of this submission, the Crown referred to the decision of Barr AJ in Palijan v R [2012] NSWCCA 142 at [21] (McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing), which it asserted was authority for the proposition that a sentencing judge can regard the fact that the offence was committed in the home of the victim as an aggravating factor for an offence under s 112(2).

[47]   In Palijan, the offender pleaded guilty to an offence of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence (intimidation) in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he used corporal violence on the victim. In response to a submission that the sentencing judge in that case had erred in finding that the offence was aggravated on the basis that the offence was committed in the victim’s home, Barr AJ stated (at [21]) that, ‘[t]he element of breaking and entering in s 112(2) Crimes Act does not require that the premises be the home of the victim’.

[48]   It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that his Honour was correct to distinguish Palijan. In Palijan, the circumstance of aggravation that was charged in the indictment was the use of corporal violence. Whereas in the present case, the circumstance of aggravation as charged in the indictment was that the respondent knew there to be persons in the house. Counsel for the respondent submitted that there was a real risk of double counting if the sentencing judge were to take into account the offence having been committed in the home of the victim as an aggravating factor for the purpose of s 21A(2) in the present case. Such a risk was not present in Palijan.”


	
	Having referred to the terms of the indictment, his Honour continued:
	


“[50]   In his remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing judge said the following in respect of s 21A(2)(eb) …

As to (eb) I do not so find. In my view that is an element of the offence and to take that into account would result in double counting. The submission that the children are entitled to feel safe and secure in their home is accepted but not to the extent of promoting a finding of aggravation under this sub paragraph.

[51]   Section 21A(5) provides that the fact that any aggravating (or mitigating) factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase (or decrease) the sentence for the offence.

[52]   In circumstances in which the indictment pleaded the fact that the offence charged under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 involved the dwelling house of C that enabled the court to take into account, when determining the objective seriousness of the offence, the fact that the offence involved the dwelling house in which C and his two children were present at the time of the commission of the offence rather than considering it as a separate aggravating factor. No error as contended for in ground 2 has in my opinion been made out. This ground should be dismissed.”


	
	It is an error for a sentencing judge, when sentencing an offender, to take into account a circumstance of aggravation if that circumstance is an element of the offence: R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186 at [20]-[26] per Hunt AJA (Hulme and Johnson JJ agreeing). That proposition is consistent with the terms of the suffix to s 21A(2) which is directed against having additional regard to an element of the offence as an aggravating factor: Elyard v R (2006) 45 MVR 402; [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [8] per Basten JA (Howie J agreeing).
	
	
	The passage of the sentencing remarks set out at [29] above reflects two essential findings by the sentencing judge. The first was that the offending was aggravated by the fact that the applicant attacked the victim when he was armed. No complaint is made about that finding. The second, which is contained in the italicised portion of that passage, was that the offending was aggravated by the fact that it was committed in the home of the victim. That finding does not reflect error in the way suggested by counsel for the applicant. This is because the decisions in Palijan, Smith and Bennett discussed above stand as authority for the proposition that it is not an element of an offence contrary to s 112(2) that the premises which are the subject of the offending be those of the victim. Nothing put on behalf of the applicant supports a conclusion that those decisions are plainly wrong, and should not be followed.
	
	
	Properly understood, what the sentencing judge did was to find that the factors in the passage set out in [29] above aggravated the offending, thus rendering it more serious than might otherwise have been the case. None of those factors were elements of the offence with which the applicant was charged. It follows that there was no double counting, and that the suffix to s 21A(2) was not infringed.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, ground 2A is not made out.
	


Ground 2: His Honour erred in finding that the offending was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness

The reasons of the sentencing judge


	
	His Honour recounted the facts of the offending (which are summarised at [4]-[12] above). He found that the applicant:
	


(i)   broke into the premises in possession of a knife, the blade of which was about 10 cm long and which thus had the potential to cause serious or fatal injury;

(ii)   kicked the victim in the stomach;

(iii)   produced the knife and assaulted the victim.


	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant had gone to the premises to “find the man and seek his own revenge”. In reaching that conclusion, his Honour rejected a submission that the applicant had been motivated by misplaced altruism. He concluded that to describe the offending in that way failed to emphasise the seriousness of what had occurred.
	
	
	Further, and as previously discussed in considering ground 2A, his Honour found that the offending was aggravated by the fact that the applicant had broken into the premises armed with a knife, and attacked the victim in his own home. His Honour also found that the offending was aggravated by being committed in the presence of a child.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, his Honour concluded that the offending was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Whilst acknowledging the various aggravating features identified by the sentencing judge, counsel for the applicant pointed to a number of factors which, it was submitted, established error in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. Counsel relied, in particular, upon the fact that:
	


(i)   the relevant events occurred over a relatively short period of time;

(ii)   the conduct of the applicant was not motivated by a desire for financial gain for himself, but by a desire to assist another person; and

(iii)   the applicant did not produce the knife at the outset, which was said to support a conclusion that the offending was spontaneous rather than pre-meditated.

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the assessment of the objective seriousness of offending is a matter which is classically within the discretion of a sentencing judge, and something with which this Court will be reluctant to interfere. The Crown pointed to the particular findings made by the sentencing judge and submitted that the verdict of the jury reflected a conclusion that the applicant had gone to the victim’s premises with the express intention of intimidating one of the occupants. In these circumstances it was submitted that any suggestion that the offending was not premeditated should be rejected. The Crown further submitted that the offending was not mitigated by the fact that the applicant may have been motivated by a desire to assist a third party.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that the finding of the sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of the offending was entirely open.
	


Consideration


	
	This Court has observed on numerous occasions that it will be slow to set aside a finding in respect of the objective seriousness of particular offending which has been made by a sentencing judge in the exercise of his or her discretion: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]; [46]-[47]; Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 at [33]; Baines v R [2016] NSWCCA 132 at [15].
	
	
	His Honour’s principal findings as to the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending are set out at [50]-[52] above. Counsel for the applicant did not take issue with these (or any other) factual findings made by the sentencing judge. Viewed collectively, they support the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	It follows that ground 2 is not made out.
	


Ground 3: His Honour erred in not quantifying the discount he gave to the applicant in relation to the delay in the proceedings and the applicant being on bail

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge said:
	


“Given the seriousness of this crime and the fact that it lies within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but taking into account [the applicant’s] factors favourable to him, which I have referred to – including, I might add, the fact that he was on bail with restrictive conditions, including reporting, for some time, because his case was not reached twice – I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of six years imprisonment. Normally for a sentence of six years imprisonment the non-parole envisaged by the sentencing legislation would be four and a half years imprisonment. However, I think there are special circumstances for reducing this and I will reduce the non-parole period to three and a half years imprisonment. I have in mind his age and his health serving the time in prison will be harder for him in those circumstances.”

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour had erred by failing to quantify any discount that he had given to the applicant on account of his period on bail, and the delay in the progress of his trial. It was submitted that in these circumstances the applicant “simply did not know … what sentence his Honour was considering before taking these factors into account”.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that although his Honour did not apply a discrete discount in respect of the two factors in question, it was evident from the passage of his Honour’s remarks on sentence at [60] above that he had taken each of those matters into account in determining sentence. It was submitted that the sentencing judge was not required to quantify a discount in circumstances where it was clear that he had taken these matters into account in the process of instinctive synthesis which was adopted.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge was not obliged to specify a discount for either of the matters referred to by counsel for the applicant. In R v Weismantel [2016] NSWCCA 204 R A Hulme J (with whom Beazley P and R S Hulme AJ agreed) observed:
	


“[15]   There is one further matter that should not be allowed to pass without comment. R S Hulme AJ has noted that the learned sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15% for the respondent's facilitation of the administration of justice pursuant to s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) …

[16]   Why the respondent should receive a greater discount (15%) for running a trial in a co-operative fashion than he did for pleading guilty and avoiding the need for a trial altogether in the other matters (10%) was not explained.

[17]   But more importantly, quantification of the extent to which a mitigating factor has been taken into account is encouraged in relation to pleas of guilty (R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309) and statutorily required in relation to assistance to authorities (s 23 of the Act). It is otherwise regarded as an erroneous engagement in a two-staged approach to sentencing: see most recently Flaherty v R; R v Flaherty [2016] NSWCCA 188 at [76]-[77]. This is not an error upon which the Crown relied (indeed, it acquiesced in the judge's approach) so aside from making the observation it is otherwise of no moment in determining the outcome.”


	
	In the earlier decision of Flaherty v R; R v Flaherty (2016) 92 NSWLR 290; [2016] NSWCCA 188 to which his Honour referred, Simpson JA (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Price J agreed) observed:
	


“[76]   In Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584; [2001] HCA 64 Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:

‘[74]   … the reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal suggest a mathematical approach to sentencing in which there are to be ‘increment[s]’ to, or decrements from, a predetermined range of sentences. That kind of approach, usually referred to as a ‘two-stage approach’ to sentencing, not only is apt to give rise to error, it is an approach that departs from principle. It should not be adopted.

…

[76]   … So long as a sentencing judge must, or may, take account of all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, to single out some of those considerations and attribute specific numerical or proportionate value to some features, distorts the already difficult balancing exercise which the judge must perform.’ (footnote omitted)

[77]   This is a clear case of sentencing by the forbidden ‘two-stage’ approach, as revealed by [61] to [64] of the remarks (extracted above). Error is therefore demonstrated.” (emphasis in original)


	
	Had the sentencing judge approached the matter in the way for which counsel for the applicant contended, it may well have led to error of the kind to which Simpson J referred in Flaherty, and to which R A Hulme J referred in Weismantel.
	
	
	Ground 3 is not made out.
	


Ground 4: The sentence is manifestly excessive

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	We have set out the circumstances of the offending at [4]-[9] above. His Honour’s findings as to those circumstances are set out at [50]-[53]. We have rejected the challenges made to those findings which were the subject of grounds 2 and 2A.
	
	
	In terms of the applicant’s subjective case, his Honour found that the applicant:
	


(i)   was a person who was otherwise a good man who had contributed to the community and to his family;

(ii)   had “some health issues” including high blood pressure, gout, cataracts and glaucoma;

(iii)   was contrite;

(iv)   had good prospects of rehabilitation; and

(v)   had been on bail with restrictive conditions for some time due to the fact that his trial had not been reached on two occasions.

Submissions of the applicant


	
	In support of this ground, it was emphasised that the applicant:
	


(i)   was 59 years of age at the time of the offending;

(ii)   had no criminal history, save for a minor assault matter in 1991 which did not result in a conviction being recorded;

(iii)   was of “positively prior good character”;

(iv)   had not committed the offence for financial gain;

(v)   had been motivated by a “sense of injustice to his partner at the time”;

(vi)   was found to be contrite; and

(vii)   was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation.


	
	Counsel took the Court to relevant sentencing statistics, and to a number of other judgments, an analysis of which was said to demonstrate the manifest excess of the sentence imposed. It was submitted, in particular, that the applicant’s age and prior good character, and the objective characteristics of the offending, warranted a sentence of substantially less than 6 years imprisonment.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s offending was serious. The Crown emphasised the fact that the applicant had armed himself with a knife and attended the victim’s home for the express purpose of intimidating another person. The Crown pointed to the fact that the assault committed by the applicant was severe.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the applicant’s motive, far from being a mitigating factor, was one which required denunciation, as well as both general and specific deterrence. It was submitted that neither the statistical analyses provided by the applicant, nor counsel’s reliance upon sentences which were imposed in other cases, supported a conclusion that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown pointed to the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, and the standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment, as important guideposts in determining an appropriate sentence. Taking all of these factors into account, the Crown submitted that this ground was not made out.
	


Consideration


	
	In order to succeed on this ground, it is necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 257; [2005] HCA 25. We have already set out the circumstances surrounding the offending, and the findings made by the sentencing judge, both as to the objective seriousness of the offending, and the applicant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	As his Honour found, the applicant had a number of subjective factors operating in his favour. They included his age, along with the fact that he was properly regarded as a person of prior good character. A pre-sentence report noted that he had a partner and mature-age children, that he was gainfully employed at the time of the offending, and that he appeared to follow “pro-social pursuits”. The report recorded the applicant’s express acknowledgment that he should not have resorted to violence, and that he appeared to be regretful about his offending behaviour. There was also evidence of the applicant’s remorse, and his generally positive prospects of rehabilitation. The author of the pre-sentence report expressed the view that the applicant would benefit from a period of supervision, with a focus upon addressing issues of anger management. It is apparent that the sentencing judge had regard to all of these factors.
	
	
	Conversely, the applicant’s offending was grave. Armed with a knife, he went to the victim’s premises and engaged in an act of serious violence. Moreover, the offending was not spontaneous and was aggravated by the various factors to which the sentencing judge referred, and in particular by the fact that it occurred in the victim’s home, a place where he was entitled to feel safe.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant emphasised that the applicant was motivated (at least in part) by a desire to assist someone else. In our view, that does not mitigate the offending. The more important consideration is that the applicant’s form of ‘assistance’ involved the commission of an act of serious violence. The applicant’s motivation is to be denounced, rather than regarded as a mitigating factor. Similarly, the fact that the offending was, in relative terms, of short duration is of little assistance to the applicant. For the time over which the incident did extend, it would have been frightening for the victim.
	
	
	As we have noted, counsel for the applicant referred the Court to both sentencing statistics, and sentences imposed in cases which were said to involve ‘comparable’ offending. The principles governing the use of such material were summarised in MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183 at [41]-[44].
	
	
	In the present case, neither the statistical materials, nor the cases to which the Court was referred, supports a conclusion that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. In particular, each and every one of the cases relied upon by the applicant are distinguishable on the fundamental basis that the offender in each of them pleaded guilty (in the majority of cases, at an early stage) and thus received the benefit of a substantial discount. In contrast in this case, the applicant chose to proceed to trial.
	
	
	Moreover, it has been observed on numerous occasions that there is no single correct sentence. In Markarian Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ explained, at [27], that:
	


“Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach, and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”


	
	Finally, we accept the Crown’s submission that the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period set by the Parliament are important guideposts in determining this ground.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, we are not persuaded that the sentence is properly regarded as manifestly excessive, in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	It follows that this ground is not made out.
	


Orders


	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	


(1)   Refuse leave to appeal against conviction.

(2)   Grant leave to appeal against sentence.

(3)   Dismiss the appeal against sentence.

		24 March 2017",2017-03-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
4276242,JV v R [2017] NSWCCA 49,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with the reasons of N Adams J, and the orders her Honour proposes. I also agree with the reasons of Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with N Adams J’s reasons and with the orders her Honour proposes. The appellant’s contention that the trial miscarried as a result of failure to adduce evidence of his good character is seen to be untenable when it is recognised his counsel made a sound forensic decision upon another matter which was quite inconsistent with putting character in issue.
	
	
	Whenever the possibility of calling evidence of good character arises the first reflex of defence counsel is to ascertain what evidence the Crown might deploy in rebuttal. Here, the answer was obvious. Namely, highly damaging evidence of another niece of the applicant (NP) who would say that she, also, was indecently assaulted by him during the charge period. This was alleged to have taken the form of touching the side of her breast area when she was 12 years old, as compared to the complainant’s age of 11 to 12 years at the time of two offences with similar particulars. I agree with N Adams J’s reasons (at [106] – [108]) for saying that NP’s evidence of the appellant’s indecent conduct towards her would have been admissible as tending to show bad character.
	
	
	Before the first trial commenced defence counsel had made the understandable decision to apply formally for a ruling to exclude the evidence of NP concerning the indecent assault upon herself. That application did not have to be pursued because the Crown decided not to call the evidence. Defence counsel’s decision to keep this out was adhered to when he took objection during the first trial to the Crown leading from the complainant evidence of the applicant’s suicide attempt in September 2009. The basis of this objection was that in order to see the suicide attempt in a proper light the jury would have to know that it followed not just the complainant’s allegations, relayed through her mother and aunt at that stage, but also NP’s similar allegations. When defence counsel said (on 9 March 2015 at T 12) “Now obviously I cannot put any of this into evidence without ---” his answer was cut short by the learned trial judge. But it is clear he meant that, should evidence of the suicide attempt be received, he would only be able to put it in context by adducing evidence of NP’s complaint. Without NP’s evidence it would appear to the jury that the applicant had made an attempt on his own life solely in response to the complainant’s allegations which were the subject of the charges.
	
	
	It is apparent that at that stage defence counsel still wished to avoid the jury receiving evidence of NP’s complaint. In due course the defence accepted in the first trial that evidence of the suicide attempt would be led (in the Crown’s interests, to explain why the complainant had delayed going to the police for two years after telling her mother of the events which formed the basis of the charges), balanced with a warning to the jury not to treat the attempted suicide as an implicit admission of guilt. The Crown did not lead evidence of NP’s complaint and defence counsel adhered to his decision by not cross examining that complaint back in.
	
	
	Counsel stood by his decision throughout the second trial, allowing the complainant’s evidence at the first trial to be played back and not requiring that NP be called. He never deviated from the objective of keeping her complaint from the jury.
	
	
	The affidavits of defence counsel and his instructing solicitor which were read on the appeal, to the effect that they do not recall any discussion of character evidence during the trial, are beside the point. An objective assessment of whether any miscarriage of justice was occasioned by defence counsel’s conduct of the case is required: Nudd v The Queen  (2006) 162 A Crim R 301; [2006] HCA 9. The matters I have referred to show that the forensic decision to keep out evidence of NP’s complaint was sound and well open. It precluded putting character in issue as this would inevitably have led to the Crown calling NP in rebuttal. No miscarriage of justice resulted from defence counsel’s election between these alternatives, especially given that the potential character evidence, as read on the appeal, would have been of questionable utility. It relates to character exhibited at dates well after the alleged offending conduct.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: On 16 March 2015, the applicant was arraigned before Wells SC DCJ and a jury of twelve on three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent on a child under the age of sixteen years contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and two counts of aggravated indecent assault on a child under sixteen years of age contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The first three offences involved allegations of digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina. Those offences are said to have occurred on the same day, when the applicant and the complainant became separated from the rest of the group during a family outing. The complainant was between 8 and 10 years of age at the time of those offences. The other two offences involved touching of the complainant’s breasts during massages performed by the applicant when the complainant was 11 and 12 years of age respectively. The applicant is a qualified masseur who used to give massages to members of his extended family, including the complainant. At the time of the alleged offences he was aged in his early forties.
	
	
	On 19 March 2015, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all five counts. The applicant was subsequently sentenced in relation to all counts to a total effective term of imprisonment for five years, with a non-parole period of three years. The applicant is eligible for release on parole on 18 March 2018. There is no application for leave to appeal against that sentence before the Court.
	
	
	The applicant appeals against his convictions on the sole ground of appeal that his trial miscarried because of the failure of his counsel to lead evidence of his good character. Section 5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that a person convicted on indictment may appeal to this court against conviction on “any ground which involves a question of law alone”. The ground relied upon in this appeal does not involve a question of law alone and thus leave is required under s 5(1)(b): see Langelaar v R [2016] NSWCCA 143 at [46] and the authorities referred to therein.
	
	
	No objection to leave being granted in this matter was made by the respondent at the hearing of the appeal.
	


The Crown case at trial


	
	The complainant’s mother AS and the applicant’s former wife SR are sisters. At the time of the offences, the complainant was the applicant’s niece by marriage. AS and SR had a third sister, MB, who is the mother of KB. KB is therefore the complainant’s cousin. KB is only about 18 months younger than the complainant and the two girls were close. The extended family all holidayed together during the relevant time periods particularised on the indictment.
	
	
	The first three offences were said to have occurred on the same day, at a place described as “Tuckers Rock”. That day was on a date between 20 November 2004 and 19 March 2007, at which time the complainant was aged either eight, nine or ten years of age. The complainant’s family and the applicant’s family had gone cycling or bushwalking. During the day, the applicant and the complainant became separated from the rest of the group.
	


Counts 1-3


	
	The complainant’s evidence in chief at trial was largely adduced in the form of the recorded interview she made with police in 2011. The complainant was 18 years old by the time she gave evidence at trial in 2015.
	
	
	The complainant told police that the first assaults occurred on a bushwalk with her family and the applicant’s family when she was “between five and seven” years of age. She was alone with the applicant. He sat behind her when she was having a drink of water and put his hands down her pants. It was daytime. She was sitting on the ground with her legs crossed and he sat behind her or just “a little bit to the side behind”. The applicant rubbed her vagina with his hand, touching her vaginal area “outside and inside a little bit” (Count 1).
	
	
	The complainant told police that it happened again later the same day. What the applicant did on the second occasion was the same as the first time; that is, he put his hands down her pants. He was seated behind her again. She did not recall how he got there. He did the same thing as she had described in respect of Count 1 (Count 2). The complainant’s next memory was the applicant sitting behind her on a slope towards the beach, when “he did the same thing” (Count 3). She was asked what she meant by “the same thing”. She responded, “He got his hands down my pants and he’s rubbing my vagina…a bit of both…the inside and outside.” The complainant marked on a diagram tendered as Exhibit 1 what she meant by “the inside and outside” of her vagina. The markings are consistent with penetration of the complainant’s vagina. He said to her, at the time of the actions comprising Count 3, “You shouldn’t let me do this.”
	


Timing of these three offences


	
	When police interviewed the complainant she told them that she did not think that the beach incident (Count 3) occurred on the same day as Counts 1 and 2. She later recalled they had in fact all occurred on the same day. She made a subsequent statement to police on 12 August 2013 in which she explained that she believed that Counts 1, 2, and 3 all occurred on the same day.
	
	
	In her interview with police, the complainant stated that the incidents encompassed by Counts 1, 2 and 3 occurred when she was between the ages of five and seven years. She told police that she must not have been older than seven years of age at the time these offences occurred. She said, “I can remember sitting on my bed in Sydney, thinking about what happened, and kind of wondering why it was and stuff, and we moved out of there when I was seven, so I had to be younger than that.”
	
	
	The complainant subsequently told police in her 12 August 2013 statement that the sexual assaults took place at a time when the applicant and his family were living at a house near Tuckers Rock, because she remembered leaving from that address. It was an agreed fact at trial pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that the applicant and his family occupied the property described by the complainant from 20 November 2004 to 8 January 2008, at which time she was eight to eleven years old. The indictment accordingly alleged that the first three offences took place between 20 November 2004 and 19 March 2007, when the complainant was either eight, nine or ten years old. The complainant turned 11 on 20 March 2007.
	


Count 4


	
	Count 4 was said to have occurred at the applicant’s home between 20 March 2007 and 14 December 2007, at which time the complainant was 11 years of age. She described sitting on steps leading down to the kitchen at the applicant’s house. He was seated on the top step and she was on the second step. He started to massage her down the front of her top, but she jumped up and walked out the door because she was feeling uncomfortable. During the massage, the applicant said to her, “You wear bras now, do you?” The complainant was very embarrassed by this. She responded, “No it’s a singlet.” The applicant massaged his way down her top and, after he rubbed her breasts, the complainant jumped up and walked out. He apologised for hurting her.
	
	
	The complainant described the applicant’s massaging of her breasts as circular motions using two or three fingers. She said that he did not get as far down as the bottom of her breasts the first time. She was shown a diagram, which was subsequently tendered and became Exhibit 2, on which she marked where the applicant touched her breasts.
	
	
	The complainant estimated her age as being “probably” 11 years old at this time. She accepted that other children were at the house and that her mother and aunt were on the balcony having a cup of tea.
	


Count 5


	
	Count 5 was said to have occurred between 25 December 2008 and 19 March 2009, when the complainant was 12 years old. She recalled that the whole family was at her home. It was Christmas or someone’s birthday; it was a special occasion. She was sitting on the floor and the applicant was sitting on the lounge massaging her back. He worked his way down and rubbed his hands over her breasts. This time she stayed there and did not move.
	


Complaint evidence


	
	The complainant gave evidence that she spoke with her cousin KB a few weeks after the final incident. She told her that the applicant put his hand down her pants and down her top. KB told her to tell her mother. The complainant did not tell her mother until about the time of her thirteenth birthday in March 2009.
	
	
	KB gave evidence at the trial. She stated that, during the Christmas holidays when she was 10 or 11 years old, she and the complainant had a sleepover at their grandmother’s house. At that sleepover, the complainant told KB that the applicant had “sexually molested” her on more than one occasion. KB gave evidence that:
	


“She told me that one time they were bike riding or bushwalking in a national park and her and [the applicant] somehow were left alone and he grabbed and put his hands down her pants and touched her vagina and another time they are on the beach and they were sitting on the sand dunes and the same thing happened, he put his hand down her pants and he put his fingers into her vagina.”


	
	KB gave evidence that the complainant felt scared because she thought she would get in trouble, rather than the applicant. KB promised the complainant that she would not tell anyone.
	
	
	AS, the complainant’s mother, gave evidence that on an evening in March 2009 she had arranged for the complainant and her siblings to go to the applicant’s home so that AS’s sister (the applicant’s then wife) could mind them. The complainant was “adamant” that she would not go. When AS eventually decided to send the complainant to her grandmother’s house instead and to send only the complainant’s two siblings to the applicant’s house, the complainant was “really, really strong” about this not happening. She told her mother that her younger sister was not allowed to go. The complainant then said to her, “I’ll tell you something if you promise not to tell anyone.” She then said “…because [the applicant] sticks his hands down my pants and I don’t [sic] him to do that to [her sister].”
	
	
	AS promised the complainant that she would not tell anyone. In July 2009, AS told her sister MB (KB’s mother) about the allegation. They both agreed to speak to SR, the applicant’s then wife and their sister. They did so in either August or September 2009.
	
	
	AS gave evidence that there was discussion within the family about whether or not to report the matter to police. A decision was made not to formally report the matter out of concern for the applicant’s children. (SR and the applicant have three sons).
	
	
	The complainant’s father gave evidence that he first became aware of the allegations in either late 2008 or early 2009. When he did so, he went to the applicant’s house and confronted him, telling the applicant not to set foot on his property again.
	
	
	The applicant’s former wife SR gave evidence in the Crown case. Her evidence was that she first learned of the allegations from her sisters in September 2009. She confronted the applicant that night. She gave evidence that he told her:
	


“…about the beach incident that one time when he was on the beach and lying next to [the complainant], they were holding hands and [the complainant] put his hand in, in his lap, and he said that he told her that was inappropriate and he got straight up and I questioned [the applicant] to say ‘Well did you say anything to [AS] or me at the time’…”


	
	She gave evidence that, “He told [SR] that he didn’t think that would be the [right] thing and he would try to keep away from her.”
	
	
	The applicant also told SR about a time when he was massaging the complainant and he “massaged the front of her chest area”.
	
	
	On 17 December 2013, the applicant was arrested. He participated in an electronically recorded interview with police (“ERISP”). The allegations were put to him. He denied the allegations that form the basis of Counts 1, 2 and 3, but said the following:
	


“A: The thing that happened there it was I think it’s, was, actually more than cycling was we went for a walk to Tuckers Rock. Um, from Tuckers Rock to um, um, what’s the beach down the next headland? Um, I had a whole group of kids with me and while we, when we arrived at the other side, like, the walk was through um, um, this bush, bushland behind the dunes so we walked up there. It’s about a four or five-kilometre walk or something. Um, and then the kids at the other side, it was quite windy at the beach. I decided to stay in the shelter of the dunes and the other kids went up onto the beach, and there is a headland there where they can run up and down. And um, [the complainant] stayed with me and I had fallen asleep there. I had dozed off and she was with me. And at some stage I woke up and she was playing with my hand in her pants or with her, yeah I don’t exactly know and then I pulled my hand off and I said that I could, like, I felt guilty because that should not have happened at all. That, that’s—

And I said that’s, “You should never let anybody play with you like that.” You know and um, “That should, that should not have happened that”. So I um, so it was not something I did. She was playing with my hand. And, like, she was I don’t know, you know, what age, she was pretty young, about six or seven or something, I, I can’t remember exactly of what, what the age was. And um, so because it’s not something that I did to her, she played with my hand. And I told her that that was wrong and that that shouldn’t, shouldn’t happen.”

[emphasis added]


	
	The applicant went on to say:
	


“I considered it to be fairly innocent sort of thing with, that she, well kids to [sic] play with themselves sometimes so…I didn’t want to make a big issue out of it, but I said ‘You should never, never let anybody play with you like that, it’s they shouldn’t touch you there’.”


	
	The complainant was asked in examination in chief whether she in fact grabbed the applicant’s hand while he was asleep and moved it to near her genital area. She denied this.
	
	
	The final witness in the Crown case was Senior Constable Sara Andrews, who was the officer in charge of the investigation. She gave evidence concerning the arrest of the applicant and the conduct of his ERISP.
	
	
	The applicant has no prior criminal history. Senior Constable Andrews was not asked to confirm that this was the case during her evidence.
	


The defence case


	
	As well as participating in an ERISP (which was played and tendered in the Crown case), the applicant gave evidence at his trial and was cross-examined. He denied ever voluntarily putting his hand down the complainant’s pants or at any time touching her vagina or her breasts. He agreed that he had massaged her on between three to ten occasions. He did this because of her complaints of a sore neck and tight shoulder due to playing the violin. He recalled a time when the complainant stopped him giving her a massage. They were at her grandmother’s home. She got embarrassed and stopped the massage when other children were teasing her about wearing a bra. The applicant agreed that he probably did give the complainant a massage at his home, although he could not recall it. He recalled giving her a massage at home on Christmas Day in 2008. He recalled that there were numerous children and adults present when that massage took place.
	
	
	He gave evidence before the jury of the incident described above at [35]. He also gave evidence of being confronted by the complainant’s father in 2009.
	
	
	The applicant did not raise his own good character in his evidence, nor were any other witnesses called in the defence case.
	
	
	During cross-examination, the applicant was questioned about his version of events in relation to Counts 1, 2 and 3. That is, that the complainant had put his hand down her pants while he was asleep. He gave an answer that, at this time, there was “possibly” another adult in close proximity. The following exchange then took place between the applicant and the Crown Prosecutor:
	


Q: Sir, it is absurd to think that there would either be kids around or another adult around while your hand is down [the complainant’s] pants, isn’t it?

A: I don’t know it’s….

Q: This is you sir somehow trying to explain your paedophile tendencies.

[emphasis added]


	
	Her Honour rejected the last question.
	
	
	In cross-examination with respect to the events forming the basis of Count 4, it was put to the applicant that he made a comment to the complainant to the effect that she was wearing a bra. The applicant responded by asking rhetorically, “Why would I make a comment like that?” The following exchange between the Crown Prosecutor and the applicant then took place:
	


“Q: Because you had a real sexual interest in [the complainant] that’s why?

A: No I wouldn’t, don’t and---

Q: You had a sexual interest in her from when she was six years of age and it continued right until this incident with the massage and you touching her breasts twice?

A: In the meantime I’ve shown no interest in her whatsoever—“

[emphasis added]


	
	The trial judge indicated that she was not allowing any more questions “of that kind”.
	
	
	The following day, when discussing legal directions for the summing up, her Honour expressed concern about the above questioning because the Crown case was that the complainant was eight, nine or ten years old at the time of Counts 1, 2 and 3. Suggesting to the applicant that he had had a sexual interest in the complainant since she was six years old might have led the jury to speculate that there were earlier allegations of which they were not aware. The Crown Prosecutor defended this questioning by noting that, in her recorded interview, the complainant described the first incident as happening when she was between five and seven years old. He also noted that the applicant had said in his ERISP that the incident at Tuckers Rock had occurred when the complainant was six. Her Honour indicated that she would deal with this issue in her summing up, stating:
	


“I’m going to have to say something that the only evidence before them is the acts that are the subject of charges and although there’s been mention of the possibility of things happening outside that period there’s nothing before them of that kind.”


	
	In her summing up, her Honour told the jury:
	


“Of particular note, you might think, is that when she first spoke to the police she said that she thought she was six years or something of that kind but later she said she was somewhere between eight and ten years. You might think that is a fairly significant inconsistency.”


	
	Her Honour did not thereafter revisit the issue of the complainant’s age at the time of the first set of offences in her summing up. No further direction was sought.
	
	
	During his cross-examination, the applicant was asked whether he had ever discussed the complainant’s allegations with anyone prior to speaking with police in 2013. The applicant had discussed the incident with his psychiatrist in 2009. As a result of this exchange, an agreed fact was admitted into evidence pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act in these terms:
	


“That on 30 September 2009 [the applicant] spoke to a consultant psychiatrist Dr Barnes. Dr Barnes’ handwritten notes include the following:

‘Niece lying next to him at a beach playing with his hand while he was asleep - used his hand to touch herself, he recalls pulling away as soon as woke up’.”

The ground of appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal was in these terms:
	


“The trial miscarried as a result of the failure of the Applicant to lead evidence of good character.”


	
	The applicant relied upon seven affidavits on the appeal. They were all read without objection. No witnesses were required for cross-examination.
	


Affidavit evidence upon which the applicant relied


	
	First, an affidavit of trial counsel, Mr Hughes, affirmed 20 October 2016 was read. In it, he stated that he was briefed to appear for the applicant at trial at short notice when the applicant’s then counsel, Ms Lewer, became unavailable. He was briefed in late February 2015. The trial was listed on 9 March 2015. He received the brief a few days later. He met the applicant before court and they spoke regularly thoughout the trial. The first trial aborted on the basis of inadmissible material being before the jury. The second trial commenced on 16 March 2015. Mr Hughes stated that he did not recall any discussions concerning good character. He stated that “…the focus was very much upon the reliability of the complainant’s account.”
	
	
	Second, an affidavit of the applicant’s trial solicitor, Mr McGuiness, affirmed 21 June 2016 was read. In it, he stated that he did not recall any discussions with counsel and/or the applicant relating to the calling of character evidence.
	
	
	Third, an affidavit of the applicant affirmed 21 June 2016 was read. He deposed that he was not aware that he was able to raise good character at trial until after the trial. He stated that he had no criminal convictions in Australia or overseas, having arrived in Australian from the Netherlands in 1995. He had good friends who would have been willing to give such evidence.
	
	
	Fourth, an affidavit of Mr Parmenter affirmed 4 July 2016 was read. He first met the applicant in November 2012. He described the applicant as being a member of a choir run by his partner. The applicant spent time at their home for concerts, fundraisers and rehearsals. The applicant helped him around the house with building. The applicant was also regularly around his children and he had no concerns about that. He had consulted the applicant professionally for acupuncture. The applicant was professional and a good listener. Mr Parmenter deposed that he is aware of the allegations and would have been happy to have given this evidence at trial, but nobody asked him.
	
	
	Fifth, an affidavit of Ms Cobcroft affirmed 4 July 2016 was read. She is the partner of the previous deponent and first met the applicant in October 2012. She too confirmed that she saw the applicant regularly in 2012 and 2013. He advised her and her partner regarding organic farming. They socialised together. Ms Cobcroft and the applicant were the secretaries of an organisation that conducted musical matinees. He spent a lot of time with her children and she never had any concerns about that. She had seen him with other people’s children. She had never seen him behave inappropriately. She opined that the applicant is “a trustworthy and honest man of good character”. If she had been asked to provide a statement or to give evidence at his trial, she would have done so. She was not asked. She would have given evidence as to his “kindness, trustworthiness and honesty” and she would have “…told the court what a good friend he has been to myself and my family.”
	
	
	Sixth, an affidavit from Ms Clyne affirmed 18 August 2016 was read. She deposed that she had worked as a homeopath at a health food store with the applicant in 2011. They became friends and socialised together. She saw him interact with children and had at no time felt his behaviour to be out of the ordinary. She spent a lot of time with him. He helped her paint her clinic. She found him to be a man of “honour and integrity”. She stated that she was aware of the offences and that if she had been asked to come to court during the trial to give evidence on his behalf she would have done so.
	
	
	It is to be noted that the proposed character witnesses’ evidence was “new” evidence rather than “fresh” evidence, in that it was constructively available at trial: Abou-Chabake v R (2004) 149 A Crim R 417; [2004] NSWCCA 356 at [63].
	


Affidavit evidence upon which the Crown relied


	
	The Crown relied upon an affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor at trial, Mr Apps, affirmed on 20 October 2016. This affidavit set out some of the procedural history of the matter that was not otherwise before the Court. That material can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The matter was first listed for trial on 3 November 2014. Prior to that trial, the Crown served a tendency notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act on the applicant’s legal representatives. That notice foreshadowed that the Crown would seek to call evidence from NP, another cousin of the complainant, at trial and that the Crown would rely upon her evidence as evidence that the applicant had a tendency to “indecently assault girls under 16 years of age while massaging/treating them”.
	
	
	NP had made a statement to police on 16 April 2014 in which she stated that she had tonsillitis in 2007 when she was 12 years old. She decided to try a homeopathic remedy. She went to the applicant’s office. He was her uncle by marriage. He asked her questions. Her statement then reads as follows:
	


“[The applicant] then started to feel around my under arm and then down the side of my breast area. [The applicant] didn’t say anything at the time when he was doing this. At the time as a child I didn’t know any better and was unsure if I had glands in the side of my breast area. I didn’t question why he was doing this and I didn’t disclose to anyone that this had occurred as I thought that he was certified to practice this type of behaviour.

[The applicant] said that if he got underneath my shirt that he would be able to feel a bit better. [The applicant] placed one hand on the front of my top and pulled it away from my body and then reached down with his other hand. He was using his fingertips to massage press against my skin, that’s what it felt like. I felt really awkward about this and didn’t know exactly why he was feeling the side of my breast.

The incident lasted around 30 to 60 seconds before his son T walked into the office to ask his dad a question. T around the time would have been between 5 to 7 years of age.

What alerted me to this was the applicant’s manner in which he dealt with T. He told T to get out and then my child like mind questioned if he was actually certified to practice.

I can’t recall exactly what occurred after T left the office.”


	
	She went on to state:
	


“In 2009 I was around 14 years of age. I went back over to visit my family in New South Wales.

At the time I was having a sleep over at Auntie’s house [AS] with my two cousins [the complainant] and [KB]. We were sitting in a tent talking about random stuff. [The applicant] was accidentally mentioned in conversation between [the complainant] and [KB] and I asked what they were talking about, [the complainant] was very hesitant to mention anything.

[The complainant] gave me a very brief explanation as to [the applicant] being a creepy uncle and I explained that something happened to me. We both ran inside and explained to AS what [the applicant] did to me”.


	
	On 31 October 2014, the applicant’s solicitor filed a notice of motion seeking to have the evidence of NP excluded from the trial. Submissions dated 3 November 2014 prepared by Ms Lewer were filed in support of the application. A copy of those submissions was annexed to Mr Apps’ affidavit.
	
	
	The first trial before Letherbarrow SC DCJ commenced on 3 November 2014. Ms Lewer made a successful application to have a covert recording of a conversation between the complainant and the applicant excluded. The jury was discharged while Mr Apps sought instructions as to whether to bring an interlocutory appeal to this Court against that decision. No such appeal was ever lodged.
	
	
	The second trial commenced before Wells DCJ on 9 March 2015. The motion to have the evidence of NP excluded was never determined because the Crown ultimately decided not to rely upon that evidence. That trial was subsequently aborted because some of the material the subject of Letherbarrow DCJ’s ruling inadvertently went before the jury.
	
	
	Mr Apps asserted in his affidavit that, had the applicant sought to rely upon good character evidence at trial, he would have sought leave to call the evidence of NP to rebut it.
	


Applicant’s evidence in reply


	
	The seventh affidavit upon which the applicant relied was that of Ms Wearin affirmed 27 October 2017. Ms Wearin is the applicant’s solicitor on this appeal. Her affidavit was filed in response to the affidavit material filed by the Crown. It simply annexes the police statement of SR, the applicant’s ex-wife. The applicant placed reliance upon parts of the statement of SR that were not led at trial. That evidence is as follows.
	
	
	The morning after SR confronted the applicant about the allegation concerning the complainant, her sister MB told SR that the complainant had asked NP whether the applicant had ever done anything to her. MB responded that NP told her that the applicant had touched her on the breasts when she was sick.
	
	
	SR confronted the applicant the following day and told him something like, “I know that you’ve touched NP.” She went to work and got home at 1pm. She found four envelopes on the kitchen table. She called 000. The applicant was found unconscious in the bathroom. He had cut himself down his arms and on his neck. It was described by the hospital as a serious suicide attempt. SR disposed of the notes to protect her children. When she saw the applicant in hospital he said to her, “I didn’t do a good enough job.”
	
	
	SR subsequently had a conversation with NP in which NP told her, “She hadn’t been touched directly on the breast by the applicant and that he was touching the glands under her armpits.”
	


The complainant’s explanation for delay in complaint


	
	The complainant first made complaint about the conduct of the applicant to KB in January 2009. In March 2009, the complainant told her mother. In September 2009, SR was told about the complaints made by both the complainant and NP. She confronted the applicant about the allegations made by the complainant and then, a few days later, the allegation made by NP. It was after the complaint by NP was put to him that the applicant attempted suicide and was taken to hospital.
	
	
	The complainant did not go to police until 2011 and was interviewed on 24 February 2011. On 17 December 2013, the applicant was arrested and interviewed.
	
	
	On the first day of the second trial (the first before Wells DCJ), her Honour was asked to rule on a dispute as to what evidence the complainant should be permitted to give concerning the reason for her delay in complaining to police. The Crown Prosecutor informed her Honour that the complainant’s reasons for not wishing to proceed with the matter as at 2009 were both concern for her three cousins (the applicant’s three children) and the fact that the applicant had made a serious suicide attempt in 2009.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant objected to reliance upon the evidence of the suicide attempt because:
	


“There was another cousin who made a similar allegation and then retracted it and [the applicant’s] view was at the time that that second allegation was made that all hope was lost. He might stand a chance of defending where there’s one complainant but not two and that’s what led to the suicide attempt. Now obviously I cannot put any of that into evidence without…”


	
	The issue arose again later, when the complainant was about to give the proposed evidence. Further submissions were made at that time. The application of defence counsel was that the complainant should only be permitted to give half the reason for her delay in making complaint because the evidence of the suicide could be viewed as an admission. Her Honour permitted the complainant to give the evidence on the understanding that she would direct the jury as to the use that could permissibly be made of it. Her Honour ruled that the complainant would only be permitted to say that, “She was concerned because he had attempted suicide,” without going any further than that. Her Honour indicated her view that the probative value of the evidence, in terms of an explanation for why the complainant did not complain earlier, was strong.
	
	
	When the Crown Prosecutor tried to lead the evidence from the complainant consistent with the terms of her Honour’s ruling, the following exchange took place:
	


“Q: And you were concerned for those children as he’d tried to take his own life, he had attempted to commit suicide?

A: Yes, after I disclosed what happened.

Q: Was that a reason why you didn’t go to the police, out of concern for his kids?

A: Yes, that was the main reason.”         

[emphasis added]


	
	After the complainant gave the answer highlighted above, the trial judge (in the absence of the jury) expressed concern that the answer had not been given in the terms for which her ruling allowed. When the jury returned to court, her Honour immediately gave them a strong direction to the effect that the evidence of the attempted suicide could not be used as an implicit admission of guilt.
	
	
	As stated above, the first trial before Wells DCJ aborted on 10 March 2015 during the evidence of the last of six witnesses called in the Crown case. The complainant had concluded her evidence by that time. This meant that the Crown was entitled to rely upon the recording of the complainant’s evidence given at the first trial before Wells DCJ as her evidence in the final trial: s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	When the recording of the complainant’s evidence was played at the final trial, the direction given by her Honour concerning the complainant’s evidence of the timing of the suicide attempt was edited out of the material that went before the jury. However, the complainant’s evidence at [77] above was included. When it became apparent to the trial judge that her warning had been edited from the recording, she gave the jury the following direction:
	


“During the playing of the evidence of the complainant you heard her refer to the accused attempting suicide after she made her complaint. I need to tell you that that evidence is led for a very specific purpose and it is limited in the use to which you can put the evidence. The evidence is led in the trial to explain why she delayed her complaint, or part of the reason why she delayed her complaint, or why there was at least delay in any official action after she told her mother. So it’s used in order to explain why she acted or didn’t act as she did. That is the only purpose for which you are to use that evidence.  You’re not to assume that that is some evidence of the accused’s guilt.  It might be the case that a person in that position might take that sort of action by the mere making of a complaint by another person so it can’t necessarily - it may be but it can’t necessarily be any indication that what she is complaining about has in fact happened.  What you need to concentrate is on all of the evidence that you hear in this trial about that. In particular, the evidence of the complainant. So it’s really of no assistance to you in determining, of itself alone the question of guilt but it goes to explain her actions in the matter.”


	
	Later, her Honour gave a similar warning in the course of her summing up as follows:
	


“You have heard that she did not want to make a formal complaint once she told her mother. She really did not want to follow through once she had spoken to police for a period of time and this was, out of her concern for the children of the accused and the fact that he had attempted suicide. Again, I remind you that attempted suicide depending on what you make of it, is not evidence of guilt. At any rate the fact that she did not complain to anybody for a period of time does not mean that it is untrue but it is nevertheless a matter that you bear in mind in considering the allegations that she has made. She has told you why she did not complain.”


	
	A final part of the transcript concerning the evidence of the attempted suicide should be noted. SR was about to give evidence of confronting the applicant concerning the complainant’s allegations at the first trial before Wells DCJ when the jury was asked to take a short break. The question arose as to how to adduce her evidence at this stage without introducing the fact that NP had made a complaint as well. Her Honour indicated she would warn the witness not to make any reference to the complaint by NP. The applicant’s counsel indicated that his position in relation to the evidence of NP (upon which the Crown had decided not to rely) was as follows:
	


“I suspect it was cut off just in time, but that is – that is material which was the subject of a tendency notice...and there are contamination issues and I would prefer not – I would prefer that it is steered well clear of because anything of that nature will be objected to in the strongest terms.”   

[emphasis added]


	
	When SR returned to court, the trial judge warned her not to make any mention of the complaint made by NP.
	


Submissions on behalf of the applicant


	
	In his written submissions Mr Carroll of counsel contended that the trial had miscarried due to the failure to lead evidence of the applicant’s good character. He relied upon the affidavit evidence of the applicant’s trial counsel and solicitor to the effect that the failure was one of oversight. It was submitted that it was difficult to justify the failure to raise good character as a legitimate forensic decision. It could not be said that such evidence would not have made a difference to the jury’s assessment of the applicant’s credibility or of the likelihood of the commission of the alleged offences.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal Mr Carroll acknowledged that his written submissions were prepared without knowledge of the evidence of NP. He submitted that the potential for NP’s evidence to be introduced at trial did not alter the fact that the trial miscarried due to the absence of any evidence of good character. On the contrary, it was submitted, the availability of NP as a witness strengthened the ground of appeal. The basis for this submission was said to be that if both the evidence of NP and evidence of good character were before the court the trial would have been fairer. It was submitted that the evidence of NP was not capable of establishing bad character in that it is inconsistent with the evidence of the complainant.
	
	
	Mr Carroll relied upon differences between the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of NP. One difference was identified as being the location of the “massage”. The complaint’s allegation was that it occurred in a lounge room, whereas NP’s allegation was that it was in a consultation room. Another difference was that NP alleged touching of the sides of the breast rather than all over the breasts as described by the complainant.
	
	
	When pressed, Mr Carroll agreed that the applicant’s position was that having both the evidence of NP and the good character evidence at trial was preferable to having no character evidence at all. He also conceded that there are trial transcript references that are consistent with trial counsel for the applicant being aware of the evidence of NP and not wishing it to be before the jury.
	
	
	In addition to his submission that NP’s evidence should in fact have been adduced at trial, Mr Carroll made two further complaints concerning the trial.
	
	
	First, he submitted that certain cross-examination of the applicant at trial improperly introduced evidence of the applicant’s bad character, which increased the significance of the omission to lead evidence of his good character. That is the cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor extracted above at [43]. It was submitted that this Court should view the absence of any evidence of good character in the context of that questioning. Such a “holistic” approach, it was contended, would establish that the applicant had been denied the chance of an acquittal by reason of the failure of his counsel to adduce evidence of good character.
	
	
	Second, Mr Carroll submitted that the prejudicial evidence concerning the timing of the suicide attempt by the applicant could have been better explained to the jury if the evidence of NP were before them. The complainant’s answer extracted above at [77] was misleading, as the suicide attempt had apparently been the result of there being two complaints against the applicant, rather than one. If the evidence of NP had been adduced at trial, the full picture would have been before the jury and the trial would have been fairer.
	
	
	In his written submissions Mr Carroll relied upon a number of decisions regarding the important role character evidence can play in the outcome of a criminal trial and the circumstances in which appellate courts have ordered new trials because evidence of the accused’s good character was not before the jury: namely, Melbourne v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 1; [1999] HCA 32; Saw Wah v The Queen [2014] VSCA 7; De Silva v The Queen [2013] VSCA 339; Clay v The Queen [2014] VSCA 269; Sharma v The Queen [2011] VSCA 356; R v DBB [2012] QCA 96; and GZ v The Queen [2015] ACTCA 11.
	


Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	The Crown’s central submission was that, had trial counsel for the applicant sought to adduce evidence of good character, the Crown Prosecutor would have inevitably sought leave to call evidence from NP to rebut it.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case, having regard to the evidence at trial. That evidence included the fact that the applicant had made certain admissions.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Gust [1999] NSWCCA 265 at [22], where Dunford J (with whom Smart AJ agreed) observed:
	


“In my view, evidence of prior good character is of limited assistance in cases of sexual assault, because such offences are usually committed in private and one's friends and business associates are not aware of the conduct. This is a very different case to R v D where there was no corroboration of the complainant, the Crown case was much weaker than the present, the character evidence was far stronger and its effect in bolstering the accused's credibility would have been significant. Moreover, in this case the un-contradicted evidence of Mr Warwick is that his instructions were to proceed without character witnesses and not to raise the issue of character. I am not satisfied that the failure to raise character in this case led to any miscarriage of justice or that the position was not sufficiently explained to the applicant before he gave his instructions. The ground has not been made out.”


	
	As for the complaint concerning the cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, it was noted that no application was made by trial counsel to discharge the jury and no request was ever made to remind the jury that the only evidence of any alleged sexual or indecent assaults related to the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that if the applicant established his ground of appeal then this Court would apply the proviso because no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	


Consideration


	
	An accused person is usually bound by the way in which counsel conducts his or her trial. In order to succeed in relation to his ground of appeal, the applicant must establish that the conduct of his counsel has led to a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	The High Court considered this issue in TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 212 CLR 124; [2002] HCA 46 (“TKWJ”). The accused in that matter had been charged with sexually assaulting two children. The trials were separated. At the first of the two trials, counsel for the accused indicated that he proposed to rely upon character evidence. In response, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that if the accused did so, he would seek leave to adduce evidence from the other child about the allegations relating to her. As a result, defence counsel elected not to rely on character evidence. The High Court determined that there had been no miscarriage of justice in that matter.
	
	
	Chief Justice Gleeson observed in TKWJ at [8] (footnote omitted):
	


“On the face of it, that was an understandable decision. It was certainly not self-evidently unreasonable, or inexplicable. It was the kind of tactical decision routinely made by trial counsel, by which their clients are bound. And it was the kind of decision that a Court of Criminal Appeal would ordinarily have neither the duty nor the capacity to go behind. Decisions by trial counsel as to what evidence to call, or not to call, might later be regretted, but the wisdom of such decisions can rarely be the proper concern of appeal courts. It is only in exceptional cases that the adversarial system of justice will either require or permit counsel to explain decisions of that kind. A full explanation will normally involve revelation of matters that are confidential. A partial explanation will often be misleading. The appellate court will rarely be in as good a position as counsel to assess the relevant considerations. And, most importantly, the adversarial system proceeds upon the assumption that parties are bound by the conduct of their legal representatives”.


	
	Justice Gaudron (with whom Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed) observed at [32]:
	


“An accused will not ordinarily be deprived of a chance of acquittal that is fairly open if that chance is foreclosed by an informed and deliberate decision to pursue or not to pursue a particular course at trial.”


	
	Similarly, McHugh J observed the following at [52]:
	


“The decision not to call the good character evidence was a matter falling within the discretion of counsel as to how he would conduct the defence and did not constitute a material irregularity that led to a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	His Honour went on to observe at [74] (footnotes omitted):
	


“Ordinarily, a party is held to the way in which his or her counsel has presented the party's case. That is because counsel is in effect the party's agent. Counsel is ‘ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted.’ The discretion retained by counsel in the running of a case is very wide.”


	
	Justice McHugh later observed at [95], in a passage apposite to the current appeal:
	


“Some experienced counsel might think that the applicant would have had a better chance of acquittal if he had raised good character even if the Crown called K to rebut the claim of good character. Counsel for the applicant would have claimed that K and the complainant had colluded to convict an innocent man. But trial counsel's decision not to raise character was a proper one. If the jury believed K, then the applicant was a person of bad character. The chance of the jury then acquitting him of any of the charges would be much lower than if the jury had no evidence concerning the applicant’s character. The choice that trial counsel made - calling no character evidence - was a legitimate one, a choice that a competent counsel could fairly make. That is enough to dispose of this ground in this case. Not calling good character evidence, as the result of counsel's decision, was not an irregularity - material or otherwise. It resulted in no miscarriage of justice.”


	
	The High Court again considered the role of counsel at trial in Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614; [2006] HCA 9. In that matter, Gleeson CJ observed the following at [9]:
	


“A criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation. A cardinal principle of such litigation is that, subject to carefully controlled qualifications, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel, who exercise a wide discretion in deciding what issues to contest, what witnesses to call, what evidence to lead or to seek to have excluded, and what lines of argument to pursue. The law does not pursue that principle at all costs. It recognises the possibility that justice may demand exceptions. Nevertheless, the nature of adversarial litigation, with its principles concerning the role of counsel, sets the context in which these issues arise. Considerations of fairness often turn upon the choices made by counsel at a trial. In TKWJ v The Queen, the applicant complained that evidence of his good character was not led. This, it was said, was unfair. In rejecting that argument, this Court said that the failure to call the evidence was the result of a decision by counsel, and that, viewed objectively, it was a rational decision. That, in the circumstances of the case, was conclusive. It is the fairness of the process that is in question; not the wisdom of counsel. As a general rule, counsel's decisions bind the client. If it were otherwise, the adversarial system could not function. The fairness of the process is to be judged in that light. The nature of the adversarial system, and the assumptions on which it operates, will lead to the conclusion, in most cases, that a complaint that counsel's conduct has resulted in an unfair trial will be considered by reference to an objective standard, and without an investigation of the subjective reasons for that conduct.” (citations omitted)


	
	Counsel for the applicant sought to distinguish the present appeal on the basis that the evidence of NP was not capable of amounting to bad character. I do not accept that submission. In relation to Counts 4 and 5, the complainant’s evidence was that she felt uncomfortable when the applicant massaged her breasts and on the first occasion (Count 4) she jumped up and moved away when he did so. The evidence from NP was that she felt “awkward” when the applicant massaged the sides of her breasts under her top. A jury may well have questioned why it would have been necessary to massage a child’s breasts under her clothing in order to alleviate either a sore neck (the complainant) or tonsillitis (NP).
	
	
	The context in which NP complained to the complainant is also relevant. That potential evidence is extracted above at [63]. The conversation was about how “creepy” the applicant was. As soon as the two girls realised that, to their minds, the applicant had inappropriately touched both of them in a similar way they made immediate report to the complainant’s mother of the allegation by NP. It is difficult to see how this evidence could be described as anything other than evidence of bad character capable of rebutting the evidence of good character that is now said to have been available at trial.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the complaint of NP differed significantly from that of the complainant and hence did not assist the Crown case. In respect of this submission, it must be noted that evidence adduced to rebut good character need not meet the same statutory test as tendency evidence. In order to have been adduced as tendency evidence at trial, the evidence of NP would need to have satisfied the requirements in ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act. To adduce evidence to rebut good character evidence, leave is required: s 112 of the Evidence Act. Otherwise, the only statutory precondition to admissibility is that the evidence, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue at the trial: s 55 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	With this in mind, the first difference relied upon by the applicant was that the respective allegations were said to have taken place in different environments. Whereas Counts 4 and 5 were said to have taken place outside of the applicant’s consultation rooms, the incident pertaining to NP occurred in his consultation room. I do not accept that this is a significant point of distinction to make, given that both girls had the same response to what the applicant did to them. The second difference was that one allegation was of touching the breasts whereas the other was of touching the sides of the breast. Again, I do not consider this distinction to be of such significance in the evidence overall that it would deprive the evidence of its relevance.
	
	
	Nor do I accept the submission that a trial with both the proposed character evidence and the evidence of NP would have been “fairer”. The events on the indictment were said to have occurred between 2004 and 2009. The potential character evidence described above at [56] to [58] was from people that the applicant had only recently met, who all described the applicant’s character after the events in question. Of the three potential character witnesses, one had met the applicant in 2011 and the other two in 2012. In those circumstances it would have been open to the Crown Prosecutor to address the jury to the effect that, after two children had complained of sexual and indecent assaults by him in 2009, the applicant may well have been more careful around children. The applicant does not seek to rely upon any character evidence as to the applicant’s behaviour around children in the period of the indictment.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon a number of cases in which appellate courts ordered new trials due to the failure of counsel to adduce evidence of good character at trial. All of those cases differed from the present case in significant respects and are distinguishable on that basis. I shall briefly refer to the cases upon which the applicant relied in order to highlight those differences.
	
	
	In Saw Wah v The Queen, the Victorian Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had erred when he held that the Crown could call evidence of bad character if the accused called good character evidence. That evidence of bad character was evidence of “rumours” of prior sexual misconduct. It was held that the trial judge should have made it clear to counsel in that trial that evidence of “unspecified rumours” would not be admissible to rebut evidence of good character. That case concerned a trial where defence counsel sought to adduce evidence of good character and was precluded from doing so. It does not assist in the present appeal.
	
	
	In De Silva v The Queen, the Victorian Court of Appeal held that a miscarriage of justice had occurred when evidence of good character was not led at trial. The court (Priest and Coghlan JJA and Lasry AJA) observed at [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted):
	


“Although generally an accused person is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel at trial, and that ordinarily it matters not that an applicant’s trial might have been differently or more skilfully conducted, nonetheless the authorities recognise that there are cases where a substantial miscarriage of justice may be found to have occurred where counsel has failed to call evidence of the accused’s good character. This is, in our view, such a case.

We can discern no legitimate forensic reason for failing to call evidence of the applicant’s good character. Although other evidence was called by either side, this was very much a case of oath against oath. The applicant had available to him powerful character evidence, which bore not only on the unlikelihood of his commission of the offences but also on the credibility of his evidence denying his guilt. It may well have made a difference to the jury’s assessment of the applicant’s credibility, and hence of his guilt.”


	
	Again, what occurred in De Silva v The Queen is to be distinguished from the present case in that there was no legitimate forensic reason not to call the character evidence, unlike the present case.
	
	
	Similarly, in Clay v The Queen, the Victorian Court of Appeal held at [75] that there was “no conceivable reason” why character evidence was not before the jury, comparing the matter with See Wah v The Queen. Despite this, the Court observed that it would not have allowed the appeal on that ground alone; it was only in combination with other grounds that a miscarriage was established.
	
	
	Sharma v The Queen, another decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal, was a different case altogether. In that case, the accused person had no criminal convictions. When defence counsel asked the only police witness called by the Crown to confirm this, the officer stated that he could not comment as he did not know. This was not resolved before the close of evidence. When the trial judge was about to direct the jury, defence counsel agreed that there was no evidence of good character before the jury to warrant a character direction. Unlike the present case, there was no tactical reason for defence counsel not to have adduced good character evidence in that matter.
	
	
	In R v DBB, the Queensland Court of Appeal was ultimately persuaded that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the applicant had been deprived of a chance of acquittal by the failure of his counsel to adduce evidence of good character. In that matter the miscarriage was held at [55] to stem from a combination of factors; namely, the accused person had informed his solicitor of the availability of witnesses of good character, but the solicitor passed this information on to counsel without informing him of the substance of the proposed character evidence and in such a way as to minimise the significance of the evidence. Although the appeal was allowed, Muir JA (with whom White JA and Mullins J agreed) observed this at [51]:
	


“Sexual offending by adult males of previously unblemished reputations and who appear to their friends, relatives and business and social acquaintances to be of impeccable character is found to have occurred all too frequently. There is also ample evidence that adult males, as a general rule, are substantially more likely to commit sexual offences against their stepchildren than their own progeny. The publicity given to the great many cases involving sexual offending by clergymen against children in their care or subject to their influence has tended to devalue even glowing references by clerics in the circumstances under consideration.”


	
	The final decision relied upon by the applicant was that of GZ v The Queen, a decision of the ACT Court of Appeal. In that decision, the Court upheld an appeal against conviction for sexual offences where the trial judge had permitted evidence of “bad character”. The complainant gave evidence that there had been other occasions of sexual assault that were not on the indictment and that she could not remember. Defence counsel had failed to adduce evidence of good character. The Court (Murrell CJ, Burns J and Robinson AJ) observed at [16]:
	


“We can think of no forensic decision for the applicant’s then counsel not to have raised the applicant’s good character before the jury. There was no suggestion on appeal that the Crown, at trial, was in a position to rebut evidence of good character with evidence of bad character.”


	
	A miscarriage of justice will only be established on the basis of a failure to adduce evidence of good character if no rational basis can be gleaned from the transcript of the proceedings for failing to do so. In this appeal, the affidavit evidence of trial counsel upon which the applicant relied simply states that evidence of good character was not considered. But the question is not what counsel did or did not do at trial and why. Rather, the pertinent question is whether the trial transcript discloses that the trial has miscarried. There is authority for the proposition that affidavits from an applicant’s previous lawyers should not be read on an appeal as a matter of course. In Nudd v R, Gleeson CJ observed the following, at [10], with respect to the question of whether counsel should be called as a witness in appeal proceedings of this nature:
	


“To the extent to which it is reasonably possible, the focus of attention should be the objective features of the trial process. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances where it is relevant to ask why some act or omission occurred. In some cases, for example, it may be material to know that counsel took a certain course upon the instructions of the client. There could be circumstances in which it is material to know that a course was taken contrary to instructions. The possibility of a need to know the reason for conduct cannot altogether be eliminated. In general, however, as far as justice permits, the enquiry should be objective. As a matter of principle, such objectivity is consistent with the assumptions on which the adversarial system operates. As a matter of practicality, it avoids the difficulties inherent in turning a criminal appeal into an investigation of the performance of trial counsel.”


	
	See also Ahmu v R [2014] NSWCCA 312, Alkhair v R [2016] NSWCCA 4, Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187, Vella v R [2015] NSWCCA 148 and Langelaar v R [2016] NSWCCA 143.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the observation of Dunford J in Gust v R, extracted above at [94], to the effect that evidence of good character is of limited assistance in sexual assault trials. I am not satisfied that any such principle of general application can be derived from that decision. In that matter, the accused person had been told of the importance of character evidence. He told his solicitor that he did not want people in his home town to know of the charges. He was told by his trial counsel to have his character witnesses at court, but he failed to have them there. No questions were asked of the officer in charge about the accused’s lack of criminal history in NSW, in circumstances where he had a criminal record in Victoria for wilful damage and for maliciously killing a dog. In my view, the observation by Dunford J as to the limitations of character evidence in sexual assault trials must be viewed in that context.
	
	
	The decision of R v D (1996) 86 A Crim R 41 was referred to by Dunford J in R v Gust. In that decision, Hunt J observed that evidence of good character can be of substantial benefit to an accused person. A new trial was ordered in that matter because no evidence of good character had been adduced at trial. That trial concerned an allegation of sexual assault by the accused on his daughter. The Crown case relied almost solely upon the evidence of the complainant. Although it was elicited from the officer in charge that the accused had no criminal convictions, complaint was made on appeal that defence counsel failed to call a number of witnesses who were available and willing to give evidence for the accused, including cogent and detailed evidence from his local priest and the former Sheriff’s officer in the accused’s district. Hunt J observed (at 42):
	


“Evidence of good character can be of substantial benefit to an accused person. It may demonstrate that it is unlikely that, as a person of good character, he or she would have done the act charged. It may also support the credibility of the evidence of the accused denying guilt and hence the unlikelihood of his or her guilt. There is a vast difference in the likely effect upon a jury between the basic type of evidence which was in fact elicited at this trial and the further evidence which was available and to which I have referred; the jury is entitled to and may well in fact give greater weight to the evidence of witnesses who were able to speak directly to the good character of the accused than to evidence of the bare nature elicited in this case.”


	
	Those comments were made by his Honour over 22 years ago. It is to be accepted that there is now greater community awareness of the nature and extent of child sexual assault offending in our society and that persons of otherwise good character commit such offences. Despite this, it seems to me that evidence of an accused person’s good character in a trial on sexual assault offences may well play a significant role in the outcome of a criminal trial, depending upon the circumstances of the case and the nature of the character evidence to be adduced. In this trial the applicant participated in an ERISP with police and also gave evidence. Had evidence of good character been established, it would have been relevant to both credibility and propensity: Melbourne v The Queen at 14 [30] - [31]. The difficulties with the potential character evidence in this trial are both the existence of the evidence of NP and the fact that all of the proposed character evidence post-dates the alleged offending.
	
	
	I turn finally to address the last two complaints made in support of this ground: the complainant’s reference to the timing of the applicant’s suicide attempt and the cross-examination of the applicant by the Crown Prosecutor said to have introduced evidence of his bad character.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that one of the reasons for her delay in complaining to the authorities was that the applicant attempted suicide after being confronted by his then wife. This was technically incorrect as it was the complaint by both her and NP that led to the suicide attempt, rather than her complaint alone. The submission on appeal was that if both the evidence of the applicant’s good character and NP’s evidence were before the jury, the evidence as to the applicant’s suicide attempt could have been more fully explained.
	
	
	The difficulty with this submission is the sheer improbability that any trial counsel would have tactically decided that it would help the defence case if the jury knew that the suicide attempt was the result of two children making complaint rather than one. In any event, the judge gave a strong direction about this twice: the first time immediately after the evidence and then again in the summing up (see extracted above at [80]).
	
	
	Moreover, the evidence that the complainant gave about the suicide attempt was at the first aborted trial before Wells DCJ. The recording of her evidence made at the first trial was simply played to the jury as comprising her evidence at the second trial. The direction given by her Honour immediately after that evidence at the first trial was edited from the recording, but the evidence itself was not. In those circumstances, if there were any concern about that evidence, application could have been made by counsel to edit the recording and an agreed fact crafted as to what the complainant’s evidence was in a way consistent with the trial judge’s ruling. This was not done.
	
	
	The applicant’s remaining argument concerned the cross-examination of the applicant by the Crown Prosecutor extracted above at [43]. There is no doubt that the Crown Prosecutor should have used more careful language when he suggested that the assaults commenced when the complainant was six years old, rather than the age range in the indictment. Furthermore, the reference to the applicant’s having “paedophile tendencies” was also unnecessarily inflammatory in the circumstances of the allegations at trial. Despite this, I am satisfied that no unfairness was caused by the manner in which this evidence was left to the jury for the following three reasons.
	
	
	First, the trial judge gave the direction extracted above at [48]. The jury was instructed to have regard to the inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence as to the time she said that the assaults commenced (six years as against eight to ten years). Implicit in this direction was identification by the trial judge that any reference at trial to anything happening when the complainant was aged six years was a reference to the first three counts in the indictment.
	
	
	Second, the complainant did not make any reference in her evidence to any allegations other than those in the indictment.
	
	
	Third, KB only made reference to the complaint to her being about the matters on the indictment.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I am satisfied that, although there was some risk that the jury may have thought that the Crown Prosecutor was referring to another incident prior to the first matters on the indictment, the risk was not significant and any possible prejudice was cured by the direction that her Honour gave.
	
	
	Moreover, contrary to the applicant’s submission, I am not convinced that the combined effect of the evidence of NP and the proposed character evidence would have assisted the applicant in any event.
	
	
	There are two further difficulties with the applicant’s placing reliance on these last two matters.
	
	
	First, no leave was sought at the hearing of the appeal to rely upon these two complaints as separate grounds of appeal. There is a real question as to whether these discrete complaints logically form part of the sole ground of appeal in this matter.
	
	
	Second, no complaint was made about either of these matters at trial. In relation to the complainant’s evidence concerning the timing of the suicide attempt, no further direction was sought beyond that given and no attempt made to edit the material from the first trial before Wells DCJ. With respect to the cross-examination at trial, it was the trial judge who indicated that she proposed to say something to the jury about the only allegations being those on the indictment. No objection was made by defence counsel at trial nor was any further direction sought by him. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules thus applies in relation to both of these complaints.
	
	
	Rule 4 is in the following terms:
	


""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""


	
	The effect of the rule was described by McHugh J in Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297; [1999] HCA 37 as follows (at [72]):
	


“There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the applicant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the applicant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the applicant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the applicant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the applicant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the applicant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the applicant would have been acquitted...”


	
	In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ summarised the relevant authorities regarding the effect of Rule 4. After citing the above passage from Papakosmas, his Honour observed the following at [148]:
	


“Subsequent cases have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4:

The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA  [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The applicant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]- [13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]- [61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].”


	
	Having regard to the transcript as a whole and in particular the conduct of the applicant’s defence at trial, I am not satisfied that the applicant has lost either a real chance or a chance fairly open of being acquitted at trial. Accordingly, I would refuse leave to rely upon these latter arguments (whether as part of Ground 1 or otherwise).
	
	
	Trial counsel did not call evidence of good character at trial. There was a rational basis for that decision. The position advanced by counsel for the applicant on this appeal differed from that taken by trial counsel. It is not uncommon for a different view to be taken after a trial regarding tactical decisions made during a trial. That is an insufficient basis to establish that a trial has been unfair. In circumstances where the decision not to adduce evidence of good character at the applicant’s trial was a rational one, no miscarriage of justice has been established.
	
	
	I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the Court dismiss the appeal.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	PAYNE JA: Having reviewed the evidence as a whole, I agree with Button J, for the reasons his Honour gives, that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offence charged. I also agree that the applicant has not established that the trial miscarried by reason of the prosecutor’s submissions. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	BUTTON J:
	


Introduction


	
	On 12 March 2015, Nafez Rached Tabbah (the applicant) was arraigned in the District Court at Sydney before Judge Frearson SC and a jury panel. He pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing a single count. It alleged that, on 19 August 2013 at Mosman, he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting. That count was brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). At the conclusion of the trial by jury that ensued, a verdict of guilty was returned. Subsequently, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment. Because there is no appeal against sentence, the details of the sentence need not be further discussed.
	
	
	The following grounds of appeal against conviction were notified and pressed at the hearing before this Court:
	


Ground 1: The conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Ground 2: The trial miscarried by reason of the Prosecutor’s submission that the jury would be satisfied that the Complainant did not consent as she did not have the capacity to do so and the learned trial judge not adequately correcting that matter in summation.

Ground 3: The trial miscarried by reason of the Prosecutor’s submission that the jury would be satisfied that it was apparent to the Appellant that the Complainant was unable to consent and the learned trial judge not adequately correcting that matter in summation and not adequately directing the jury about the required state of mind of the Appellant.


	
	Grounds 2 and 3 call for consideration of what the prosecutor said in his opening and closing addresses to the jury, and the directions that his Honour subsequently gave to the jury in the summing-up. Ground 1 calls for a detailed examination of the evidence in the trial, to which I now turn.
	


Summary of evidence


	
	The Crown case in a nutshell was the following. In the early hours of a Monday morning, the applicant, a taxi driver, took advantage of the fact that the complainant, a passenger in his taxi, was grossly intoxicated. He did so by having penile/vaginal sexual intercourse (intercourse) with her without her providing free and voluntary agreement to that act, he well knowing that she was not so agreeing.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the following witnesses.
	


The complainant


	
	The complainant was a young woman, aged about 22 years, on the evening in question.
	
	
	On Sunday 18 August 2013, at about 9.20PM, she travelled from her home at Seaforth to Wynyard Station. There she met her friend, whom I shall call Lisa Hart in order to protect the anonymity of the complainant. They were intending to spend an evening out together.
	
	
	They walked from Wynyard to a takeaway food outlet on Oxford Street, Darlinghurst. There they purchased some food and, whilst sitting in the restaurant eating it, shared some wine and vodka from a bottle that was in the possession of Ms Hart. The complainant had two or three sips of vodka. Ms Hart drank about half the bottle.
	
	
	After that, the two of them walked a short distance to the Colombian Hotel on the same street in the same suburb. Whilst walking, they shared some cannabis that Ms Hart had brought with her. The complainant smoked about half a “joint”.
	
	
	The two young women arrived at the hotel between 10.30PM and 11PM. They spent the rest of the evening there, until the early hours of Monday 19 August 2013. In this time the complainant consumed (in order, over the course of the evening) a glass of wine, a glass of wine and a shot of tequila, and a further glass of wine.
	
	
	Whilst at the hotel, they met two men who were strangers to them. One of the men tried to purchase a drink for the complainant, but his credit card was declined, and the drink had to be returned over the bar. Before that occurred, the complainant had one or two sips from the glass. After some further conversation, the complainant found the man to be “creepy”, and she engaged the assistance of a security guard, who eventually asked the man to leave the hotel.
	
	
	Shortly after that, the complainant began to feel intoxicated in a way that was not referable to alcohol or cannabis. She formed the belief that some sort of drug had been placed in the glass from which she took two sips. She gave evidence that “something was wrong, like something was coming over me”, and that the experience was not the same as becoming intoxicated by alcohol. She also described how a degree of tension that she had felt towards her friend began to manifest itself, without the complainant being able to control that process.
	
	
	The two young women left the hotel, and walked down Oxford Street in the direction of Hyde Park towards Whitlam Square. CCTV footage from a camera positioned outside the hotel captured them leaving; it became Exhibit D.
	
	
	Eventually, the two of them sat down on a bench seat. The complainant had her head in her hands. She said in evidence that she “knew something was wrong with me, like this was not normal”.
	
	
	The tension between the two of them reached a point where the complainant stood up and entered a taxi without her friend. The complainant sat in the front passenger seat. Ms Hart declined to join her. The complainant left the area in the taxi. The driver of the taxi was the applicant.
	
	
	The taxi travelled from the centre of Sydney over the Harbour Bridge, along the intervening freeway, and thereafter onto Military Road, Neutral Bay. Whilst the taxi travelled that route, the complainant took a number of photographs with her iPhone. They included a copy of the taxi driver’s licence of the applicant, which was displayed on the inside of the front of the windscreen. The complainant said in evidence that, at the time she took the photographs, “physically I was feeling like I was coming undone”.
	
	
	At 3.16AM, the applicant pulled the taxi over. He also turned its meter off. CCTV footage from a camera positioned outside the Honey Rider Bar on Military Road, Neutral Bay shows the taxi pulling up. The complainant can be seen alighting from the taxi, squatting down for a while on the footpath, and then returning to the taxi, again sitting in the front passenger seat.
	
	
	Thereafter, electronic records show that the taxi commenced to move again, heading generally east on Military Road towards Mosman. Records show that the vehicle commenced moving again at 3.20AM. Notably, the applicant did not reactivate the meter, and it remained off.
	
	
	The Crown case, based upon the evidence of the complainant, was that, during that part of the journey, the applicant placed his hand on the leg of the complainant and asked “Do you want to have sex with me?” The evidence of the complainant was that she reacted with disbelief.
	
	
	At 3.21AM, the taxi pulled into the Midas Service Station, further to the east on Military Road. According to the complainant, the taxi came to a halt inside an open workshop. Electronic records show that the taxi was stationary between 3.21AM and 3.31AM. The complainant gave evidence that her body was adversely affected, and that the events were like “my worst nightmare is coming true right now”.
	
	
	At trial, there was no dispute that the applicant and the complainant had intercourse in the motor vehicle at that location.
	
	
	The evidence of the complainant was that the applicant undid his seatbelt, alighted from the driver’s seat of the taxi, and walked around the front of the vehicle to the passenger seat. He opened the front passenger door. The complainant tried to move her body towards the centre of the vehicle. She recalled that her left leg was out of the taxi, but her right leg was within it. Her evidence was that the applicant commenced to remove her tights, and undid one of her shoes. She attempted to keep her tights up by holding them with both of her hands.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that, due to her level of intoxication, she was unable to “fight”, and simply leant back in the seat. As the applicant undid his trousers, she looked away and focused on his taxi licence. She made an effort to remember the numbers 0811, in order to be able to recall the identity of the man who was sexually assaulting her.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that, whilst the applicant was removing her pants she said “Stop”. She recalled that the intercourse lasted one or two minutes. She said that, whilst it was occurring, she was doing “nothing”.
	
	
	Her evidence was that, after the intercourse had come to an end, the applicant returned to the driver’s seat and said “Put your clothes on and get out of my cab”. She alighted a minute or so later, and the applicant drove off.
	
	
	According to the complainant, she staggered from the service station to a nearby bus stop, of which she took a photograph that was subsequently located on her iPhone and tendered in the trial. The timestamp on the photograph was 3.36AM.
	
	
	Although the memory of the complainant about it was very unclear, the Crown case was that she walked from the service station to Spit Junction, a five or ten minute walk away. She then entered a second taxi, which was driven by Mr Nasreddine Bensaidi.
	
	
	In evidence-in-chief, the complainant said she had no recollection of the second taxi journey. Her first recollection was of alighting from the taxi in the street where she lived and asking for a receipt, although at one stage she believed that the receipt had been provided by the first taxi driver.
	
	
	A receipt subsequently found to be in the possession of the complainant was given to police. It became Exhibit G in the trial. It was on the letterhead “Silver Service”, and had a handwritten entry. The date was recorded as 19/06/13, and the number of the taxi as “2415”. The journey was shown as “city to home”, with a fare of $50. The taxi number on the receipt matched neither the number of the taxi driven by the applicant nor the taxi of Mr Bensaidi.
	
	
	CCTV footage from inside the taxi driven by Mr Bensaidi was tendered in the Crown case. In “stop motion” form, it shows Mr Bensaidi and the complainant over a period of 18 minutes.
	
	
	The next recollection of the complainant was of waking up the following day at about 12.30PM. She realised that she had changed her underpants but had no recollection of having done so. She entered a bathroom, and on her way out encountered her mother. When asked what was wrong, she burst into tears and told her mother what had happened: “I think I need the morning after pill he had sex with me”.
	
	
	Thereafter the police were contacted and attended the home. They retained items of clothing that had been worn by the complainant the previous evening. They also located one of the shoes that the complainant had been wearing at the time. It was found on top of a garbage bin outside the home.
	
	
	At about 8.15PM on the same day, the complainant attended a hospital where she was examined by a doctor. A number of injuries were observed, including scratches and abrasions, photographs of which became an exhibit in the trial.
	
	
	Turning now to cross-examination, the complainant agreed that she had made a detailed statement to police on 20 August 2013.
	
	
	She accepted that she made no complaint to the second taxi driver of having been sexually assaulted by the applicant.
	
	
	It was suggested that she could be seen kissing the second taxi driver on the CCTV from that taxi, and was avoiding that fact, including by way of her claim of amnesia about that trip.
	
	
	She did not recall asking the second taxi driver for $100.
	
	
	She agreed that she did not mention in her original statement anything about the first stop on Military Road. She agreed that it was only after being shown CCTV footage of that stop by police that that event came back to her.
	
	
	Her position was that she took the photographs of the licence of the applicant because she had, at that time, a “bad feeling”. Nevertheless, she accepted that, having alighted from the taxi of the applicant at the first stop, she re-entered the taxi.
	
	
	She was asked questions about her ability to walk from the Midas Service Station to the bus stop where she was picked up by the second taxi driver. She estimated that distance as being 100 metres or so.
	
	
	She agreed that in her first statement she had spoken of being sexually assaulted, but thereafter being driven all the way home by the applicant, a version of events that could not be correct.
	
	
	She agreed that her version, and her recollection, evolved over a series of statements, and that seeing the CCTV played a role in that evolution.
	
	
	She was taken to the details of events at the fast food restaurant and the hotel at Darlinghurst.
	
	
	She agreed that, in the original statement, she recorded nothing of note between her entering the taxi and the applicant suggesting sex to her, including the taking of the photographs and the feeling of apprehension.
	
	
	She also agreed that, in that statement, there was nothing about the first stop on Military Road and her re-entry to the taxi of the applicant. Nor was there anything at all about travelling in the second taxi. She confirmed that, despite her purported bad feeling, she re-entered the taxi of the applicant when she had a perfect opportunity to walk away.
	
	
	She agreed that she made no complaint to her parents of having been sexually assaulted when she arrived home.
	
	
	She confirmed that, watching the CCTV four months after the event, her recollection of important matters had changed.
	
	
	She agreed that, whilst walking along a main road after having been sexually assaulted, she neither phoned the police (despite having her mobile phone with her) nor otherwise sought assistance. She agreed that she did not do so, even though at the hotel she had been quite content to involve hotel security in order to remove a man whom she merely found disconcerting.
	
	
	It was put to her that the CCTV of the second taxi ride clearly shows her kissing the second taxi driver four times.
	
	
	She was asked a number of questions about whether she recalled certain interactions with the second taxi driver. Those questions were seemingly based on his statement to police. She recalled little or nothing, including the proposition that she had demanded $100 of the second taxi driver because he had kissed her.
	
	
	The following propositions were put to her by defence counsel as representing the defence case. As the first taxi travelled across the Harbour Bridge, she spoke to the applicant of having been out in an effort to “pick up” sailors. The first stop was at her instigation. After she returned to the taxi, she commenced to take off her pants and underpants. Thereafter she masturbated in the presence of the applicant. She said to him words to the effect of “give me $100, and we can have sex”. Intercourse took place between the two of them, and she agreed to it. After the intercourse, the applicant drove her to the point where she was picked up by the second taxi driver.
	
	
	Apart from accepting that the first stop may have been at her instigation, and that intercourse did indeed occur, the complainant bluntly denied all of the other propositions.
	


The mother of the complainant


	
	The next witness called in the Crown case was the complainant’s mother. On Monday 19 August 2013, she had been at work in the morning and returned home at about 12.20PM. Because the arrangement had been that her daughter was to sleep at the home of Ms Hart, her mother went to see why she was in fact at home. When she saw the complainant leaving the bathroom, her mother noted that she had “a look of despair”. The witness saw the complainant start to cry, and that she looked frightened. The complainant said to her mother “I need the morning after pill”. Her mother asked why, but she kept crying. The two of them spoke for about half an hour. The complainant was saying that a taxi driver had sex with her. The witness described the complainant as “crying” and “close to hysterical”. Her mother described the visit by police to the home, and the attendance at the hospital.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the witness agreed that she and the complainant enjoyed a very close relationship.
	


Lisa Hart


	
	Ms Hart was the third witness in the Crown case. As at August 2013, she had known the complainant for about 10 years, and they had been school friends. The witness confirmed that, on 18 August 2013, the two of them met at Wynyard at about 10.30PM. She confirmed that the two of them walked to the fast food outlet on Oxford Street, but her evidence was that, unlike the complainant, Ms Hart did not eat there. She described the two of them having a couple of sips of tequila and wine at the restaurant, over the course of about 20 minutes. After that they walked to the hotel. Her position – contrary to that of the complainant – was that the complainant did not consume any cannabis on the way to the hotel.
	
	
	She confirmed that, at the hotel, the two of them were drinking wine and tequila. Her recollection was that they consumed three rounds of drinks during the night.
	
	
	Ms Hart also confirmed that the two of them met two previously unknown men in the smoking area of the hotel. The complainant briefly went to the bar with one of the men in order to obtain some drinks. Eventually, one of the men was asked to leave by hotel security.
	
	
	Before she went to the bar with the man, the demeanour of the complainant was fine. Afterwards, she became agitated and angry. The two young women left the hotel because the complainant was becoming distressed. Ms Hart described the complainant as “very upset” and “clearly upset with me”.
	
	
	According to the witness, the two of them walked down Oxford Street with the intention of returning to Wynyard to catch separate buses home. After walking about 100 to 200 metres, they stopped outside a bar so that the complainant could compose herself. She remained agitated, rose to her feet, and told Ms Hart that she was leaving and that Ms Hart needed to “figure it out”.
	
	
	The complainant very quickly entered a taxi and departed. That was at about 3AM. Ms Hart returned to Wynyard Station, and caught a bus back to her home.
	
	
	At the time of the departure of the complainant, Ms Hart described herself as being quite aware of the world around her, and not feeling drunk.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Hart said that, at the hotel, the complainant drank the same amount of alcohol as she did.
	


Medical examination


	
	Dr Yvonne Bloomfield gave evidence of an examination of the complainant at about 8.15PM on 19 August 2013 after her complaint of having been sexually assaulted.
	
	
	She saw that the body of the complainant had suffered a number of linear abrasions. They were: a small abrasion on the left side of her chin; a linear abrasion on her left forearm; and a smaller horizontal abrasion on the outside of her left forearm that was a little distance from the other scratch. The complainant also had a lesion about 3-4 millimetres wide on the inner aspect of her left lower leg. There were also a number of smaller linear scratches on the inside of her left lower leg. Photographs of those injuries became Exhibit J in the trial.
	
	
	According to the doctor, the complainant had given a history of having consumed five to six glasses of wine and two tequila shots on the evening in question.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the doctor agreed that she did not observe any abnormalities to the genitals of the complainant, although in re-examination she agreed that that finding did not contradict the history of intercourse without consent that she had been given.
	
	
	As for the injuries that she did observe, the doctor expressed the view that they could be consistent with the history given by the complainant, but they could also have been caused by other mechanisms, such as a fall.
	


DNA matches


	
	A DNA expert gave evidence that a high vaginal swab taken from the complainant showed a mixture of DNA from two individuals. The mixture was consistent with originating from the complainant and the applicant.
	
	
	A tape lift taken from the inner and outer sides of underwear worn by the complainant showed a DNA profile that emanated from three individuals. The DNA from the third contributor was found at a very low level. It was very likely that the other two contributors were the complainant and the applicant.
	
	
	A further tape lift from the inner and outer sides of the waistband of the black tights of the complainant revealed DNA that appeared to originate from two main individuals. The complainant and the applicant could not be excluded as the major contributors to that mixture.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the witness was asked about secondary transfer of DNA, and whether it could be excluded as a possible explanation for the DNA profile of the applicant being found on the items of clothing detailed above. Although the witness expressed the view that the strength of the DNA profile argued against secondary transfer, she accepted that it could not be absolutely excluded as a possibility.
	


Pharmacologist


	
	Dr Perl, pharmacologist, gave evidence of the well-known effects of alcohol.
	
	
	She noted that at 8.15PM on 19 August 2013 blood and urine samples were taken from the complainant. No alcohol was detected in her blood sample, although signs of cannabis consumption were detected. Also found was an unspecified concentration of the drug Doxylamine, an antihistamine that can have a powerful sedative effect.
	
	
	The pharmacologist explained that cannabis and alcohol enhance the effects of each other if used together.
	
	
	It was also said that Doxylamine has very potent effects as a central nervous system depressant. It can be used therapeutically if a patient is experiencing difficulty sleeping due to severe pain. Again, the pharmacologist explained that Doxylamine interacts with alcohol and increases the level of impairment.
	
	
	As for the time at which the drug Doxylamine entered the body of the complainant, without knowing the quantity consumed the pharmacologist stated that it could have been at any time within the day or two preceding 8.15PM on 19 August 2013.
	
	
	Noting that alcohol was found in the urine of the complainant but not in her blood, and making a number of different assumptions, the pharmacologist posited a range of likely blood alcohol concentrations of the complainant as at 3.30AM on 19 August 2013 (the time of the intercourse) of between 0.104 and 0.251.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the witness accepted that the effect of alcohol on a person would depend on his or her level of tolerance. The pharmacologist also explained how alcohol remains in one’s urine longer than it remains in one’s blood.
	
	
	She spoke of the effects of cannabis generally lasting for 4-6 hours after ingestion. The degree of intoxication would depend upon how much was consumed, and the strength of it. Again, tolerance could play a part in the reduction of intoxication of chronic users.
	


Two witnesses about taxi systems


	
	The despatcher for the Silver Service taxi company was the next witness in the Crown case. He described how information sent and received from taxis was retained as a Selected History Record (SHR), and could be subsequently accessed. The jury was provided with the SHRs in relation to the applicant and Mr Bensaidi as Exhibit N and Exhibit O. They were referred to in the cross-examination of the witness to show the movement, speed and journey of both taxis.
	
	
	In similar vein, an electronic technician described the CCTV cameras fitted to taxis and how they operate. He explained that they take shots every few seconds and work off a trigger such as the opening of the doors, turning the meter on or off, or the driver pressing an alarm switch on or off. The witness explained that when the camera was switched on by any of those events, it would take footage with one image being captured every four seconds.
	
	
	No footage was retrievable from the taxi driven by the applicant, because (the witness explained) it had been overridden by new images, in accordance with the system in place. In the case of the taxi driven by the second taxi driver, Mr Bensaidi, such a recording was available, and it was placed before the jury as Exhibit A.
	


Officer-in-charge


	
	The detective in charge of the investigation was the next witness. He explained the provenance of a number of exhibits in the trial. He also gave evidence that the distance along Military Road from the Honey Rider Bar (the location of the complainant first alighting from the taxi of the applicant and the meter being turned off) to the Midas Service Station (the location of the intercourse) was about 1.6 kilometres. His estimate was that the distance from that service station to the bus stop further along Military Road (from which the complainant caught the second taxi) was about 1 kilometre.
	
	
	He also gave evidence of two recorded interviews in which the applicant took part on 23 September 3013 and 18 November 2013, the details of which I shall set out shortly.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he estimated the distance between the takeaway food outlet and the hotel on Oxford Street as being about 240 metres.
	


The second taxi driver


	
	The next witness in the Crown case was Mr Bensaidi, the second taxi driver. He gave evidence that, in the early hours of 19 August 2013, after he briefly stopped at a coffee shop in Neutral Bay, the complainant signalled him to pull over. At that stage she was at the intersection of Spit Junction and Military Road.
	
	
	On entering the taxi, she told him that she wanted to go to Seaforth. She told him that she was “OK” and had been at a party at the home of a friend. As they were driving down through the curves of Spit Road toward the Spit Bridge, the complainant fell over onto him, and he pushed her back into the passenger seat. He gave evidence that that happened a number of times.
	
	
	He also gave evidence that the complainant “was showing like she wanted to have a kiss”, and that he had kissed her “just to keep her calm and quiet”. After that, whilst the taxi was stopped in Sydney Road facing in the direction of Seaforth, Mr Bensaidi asked the complainant for her street or house number. Although she did not reply, and fell onto him again, he formed the opinion that “she wanted to have a kiss again”, and kissed her.
	
	
	Eventually, they arrived at the home of the complainant. He asked her for payment of the fare, which was about $17 or $18. According to the witness, the complainant claimed not to have cash on her, and provided a credit card, which was declined. Mr Bensaidi asked whether she could go inside and obtain some cash, but the complainant refused, claiming that it would wake others. The witness gave evidence that he told the complainant that he would forego the fare, but the complainant responded by stating that he owed her $100 because he had kissed her. His response was that he had not wanted to kiss her, and that it was she who had wanted to kiss him. Because at the time the complainant was smiling and laughing, the witness formed the view that she was joking about claiming $100 as payment from him for the kiss.
	
	
	The witness gave evidence that the complainant kissed him again to thank him for the free trip in the taxi. According to the witness, she wished to kiss him on the lips, but he offered his cheek instead.
	
	
	As to the level of intoxication of the complainant, his assessment was that before she entered the cab she “appeared as normal for me”.
	
	
	Once she was inside the vehicle and commenced falling onto him, the witness gave evidence that one could tell that she was “over the limit” with regard to drink driving. His assessment was that her level of intoxication was 6 to 7 out of 10.
	
	
	When showed the taxi receipt that I have detailed, Mr Bensaidi gave evidence that the handwriting on it was not his.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he agreed that there were several kisses between himself and the complainant. His evidence was that when they were stopped at Seaforth he had said to the complainant “I can’t do this, I’m a married man”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he agreed that he had previously said in conference with the lawyers for the prosecution that, after the journey, he had come to think that the complainant was actually pretending to be intoxicated, in order to avoid having to pay the taxi fare.
	


First recorded interview of the applicant


	
	In the first record of interview of 23 September 2013, the applicant said the following.
	
	
	He had picked up the complainant as a taxi passenger in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst. A friend who was with her did not enter the cab. Once in the cab, the complainant began to talk about how she and her friend had been out in an effort to meet sailors.
	
	
	The complainant had asked to be taken to Neutral Bay. When they reached Military Road, Neutral Bay she asked the applicant to stop so that she could alight. At the stage, the taxi meter read $37. She provided a $50 note to the applicant, got out, and left the door open. Then she unexpectedly re-entered the cab.
	
	
	She thereafter asked to be driven home. On the way, the complainant commenced to disrobe, and “enticed” the applicant to have intercourse with her. The cab was stopped by the applicant, but he found that he could not have intercourse with her because “I’ve never done that since I got married, I just couldn’t do that”. The applicant asked the complainant to put her clothes back on, whereupon she demanded $100. She claimed that the applicant had told her that he would give her $100, a proposition that he denied. The complainant then asked to be driven to the Spit Junction. The applicant drove her there and “this is the end of the story”.
	
	
	In terms of the level of intoxication of the complainant, the applicant said that, although she smelt of alcohol, the complainant was not drunk. From over two decades of taxi driving experience, the applicant assessed her intoxication as 2 or 3 out of 10.
	
	
	During the journey, the complainant had spoken of having lost some of her money. Subsequently, the applicant came to the view that the disrobing by the complainant and her demand for $100 cash were motivated by that lost money, and a desire by the complainant to “take advantage of him”.
	
	
	When asked by police why he did not reactivate the meter after the complainant returned to the taxi, he told them that it was because he had already been provided with $50 cash. It was when she returned to the taxi that she commenced to take her clothes off. The applicant denied that he had removed them.
	
	
	The position of the applicant was that, despite disrobing in his presence, the complainant said nothing about sexual contact of any kind.
	
	
	In relation to the event at the service station, the applicant claimed that he parked the taxi in the car park and stopped the car. The complainant removed her pants but left her top on. The two of them were at the service station for about four or five minutes.
	
	
	According to the applicant, the complainant was masturbating, and he proposed to have intercourse with her. The applicant claimed, however, that “the smell of her” dissuaded him from having intercourse with the complainant, and “he just couldn’t do it”. According to the applicant he did not remove his pants, he did not undo his fly, nor did he expose his penis. The applicant also claimed that a medical condition interfered with his ability to maintain an erection.
	
	
	He told the police that the fact that, whilst he was driving the taxi, the complainant removed her clothes, was masturbating, and had previously mentioned how she and her friend had gone out “to pick up” sailors in combination made him think that “maybe” the complainant wished to have sex with him.
	
	
	He agreed that the complainant did not say anything to him about wanting to have intercourse with him. He said that “when I came around she never said nothing to me. She never said yes or no or anything.”
	
	
	At the car park of the service station, the applicant walked around to the front passenger side of the vehicle to where the complainant was sitting and climbed on top of her. She was sitting in the seat inside the taxi, and no part of her body was outside of the car. That was because, when they arrived at the service station, the complainant herself had reclined the front passenger seat.
	
	
	The applicant denied that his penis entered the vagina of the complainant. To his recollection, his penis did not touch any part of her body to any degree.
	
	
	Towards the end of the first recorded interview, the applicant admitted that he had digital/vaginal intercourse with the complainant. His position was that he touched her vagina with his hand, and inserted one or two of his fingers for about 1 minute. He then climbed off her and “begged her to put her clothes on”. At that time, the position of the complainant “just was lying”.
	


Second recorded interview of the applicant


	
	The applicant engaged in a second recorded interview on 18 November 2013. It may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	At an early stage of the interview, the applicant was informed by police that a profile derived from semen found on high vaginal swabs taken from complainant had been matched with his own DNA. In response, he claimed that, after the conclusion of the first interview, he had always wished to talk to police about whether he had in truth had intercourse with the complainant, and that he wished to apologise to the police for misleading them. He told them at no stage did he threaten or harm the complainant; nor did he force her to have sexual intercourse with him. The applicant readily accepted that he had denied intercourse a number of times in the first interview, but said he had done so because he was “scared”. He also spoke of having been married for 23 years, and never having been unfaithful to his wife before.
	
	
	His position in short was that, although he had lied with regard to one aspect, “everything [else] in the [first] interview was a hundred percent truth”. He maintained the position that he had believed that the complainant wished to have sexual contact with him because of her behaviour. During the second interview, he claimed that the complainant explicitly told him that she had gone out that evening because she “wanted to have sex with somebody”. He agreed with police that the complainant did not say that she wished to have sexual contact with him. He maintained the position that the complainant removed her own stocking and tights and was masturbating in front of him in the taxi before they had intercourse.
	
	
	The applicant maintained the position that he took off only his clothes, not those of the complainant. He told police that he was now being truthful and that there was “nothing else I got to hide”.
	
	
	According to the applicant, it was whilst watching the complainant masturbating and seeing that she was becoming sexually aroused that he decided to pull the taxi over at the service station with the intention of having sexual intercourse with the complainant. Once they pulled into the service station “it was all perfect”. The applicant emphasised that the complainant never said no – indeed she never said anything – and that the applicant never forced the complainant to have intercourse with him.
	
	
	In the second interview, the applicant maintained the position that the complainant had spoken of sexual contact in return for $100. He provided police with the thesis that the complaint of sexual assault really stemmed from his refusal to pay $100 to the complainant after the intercourse had finished.
	
	
	His assessment of the level of intoxication of the complainant at the second interview was that she was affected by alcohol “about 50%” and that she appeared to have been drinking but was not intoxicated or heavily drunk.
	
	
	That concludes my summary of the Crown case. The applicant did not give evidence, called no evidence, and did not raise character in the Crown case.
	


Ground 2

The trial miscarried by reason of the Prosecutor’s submission that the jury would be satisfied that the Complainant did not consent as she did not have the capacity to do so and the learned trial judge not adequately correcting that matter in summation.

Ground 3

The trial miscarried by reason of the Prosecutor’s submission that the jury would be satisfied that it was apparent to the Appellant that the Complainant was unable to consent and the learned trial judge not adequately correcting that matter in summation and not adequately directing the jury about the required state of mind of the Appellant.


	
	It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. It is also convenient to deal with them before turning to the assertion that the verdict is unreasonable.
	


Relevant aspects of the trial


	
	As can be seen, the grounds are based upon things said by the prosecutor to the jury at various stages of the trial, and the response of the trial judge in the summing-up. Counsel for the applicant explained that the following passages form the basis of the grounds.
	
	
	First, in his opening to the jury, the prosecutor said the following (12/3/15, T11.47-12.18):
	


The next element that you’re going to need to look at is without [the complainant’s] consent. The Crown is going to be relying to prove that element on what [the complainant] tells you that she did not wish to consent to the act of sexual intercourse. Consent, the Crown will be submitting to you, requires a conscious and voluntary agreement to have sexual intercourse. One of the things the Crown is going to be asking you to look at is [the complainant’s] state of intoxication. Now if a person has sex whilst substantially intoxicated by alcohol that can be something – that means that they are not consenting. So you are going to be, the Crown submits, wanting to have a look at that. The Crown will be relying on the evidence of [Ms Hart], [the complainant], Dr Perl and what can be seen in the CCTV video from both the City of Sydney, the Honey Rider Bar and Mr Bensadi’s car to illustrate that particular point.

The final aspect is that the accused knows that [the complainant] is not consenting. The Crown will be asking you to look at the circumstances as a whole. The Crown is going to have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew [the complainant] was not consenting. In order to do that the Crown is going to ask you to look at all the circumstances of the event, [the complainant’s] response, [the complainant’s] behaviour, [the complainant’s] intoxication and what the accused has said about the matter to police. Those elements that you can look at to get inside the accused’s mind to satisfy yourself that the accused knew [the complainant] was not consenting.


	
	Secondly, the following exchange occurred between his Honour and the prosecutor in the absence of the jury, after that opening (12/3/15, T14.12-32):
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, when you opened you opened on knowledge of lack of consent, you didn’t open on recklessness and you didn’t open on no reasonable grounds for belief. It seems to be the classic case of--

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Of recklessness.

HIS HONOUR: Or no reasonable grounds for belief because on your case the complainant didn’t say anything during the act. It’s almost the classic case of, yes.

TRIAL ADVOCATE: I must admit I was kicking myself for that when I sat down, but I will--

HIS HONOUR: I wanted to raise it before the cross-examination starts because otherwise it’s misleading if you then--

TRIAL ADVOCATE: Yes, I do understand your Honour. I would probably be inclined to expand it to the recklessness approach your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: At the moment I’m proposing to give directions on what the Act says about knowledge of lack of consent, the whole lot of it…


	
	Thirdly, in his closing address to the jury the prosecutor said the following (18/3/15, TT169.9-14):
	


The Crown is submitting to you that on the basis of all the evidence that’s being led before you, you will come to the conclusion that [the complainant] was substantially affected by alcohol and, in those circumstances, incapable of consent, and, in those circumstances, readily apparent to the accused, that she was so affected by alcohol that she couldn’t consent. Those may be the main features you really want to focus on in relation to that.


	
	Fourthly, later in his closing address, the prosecutor said the following to the jury (20/3/15, TT208.16-19):
	


“… It is not a description of somebody offering themselves for money. It is a description of how [the complainant] was on that might [scil. night]; intoxicated by alcohol, unable to consent and at the mercy of the accused. The Crown submits on that you will find the accused guilty…”


	
	Fifthly, after the closing address of the prosecutor, but part way through the closing address of counsel for the applicant, an exchange occurred in the absence of the jury between his Honour and the prosecutor: at TT214.3-4 (20/3/15). His Honour remarked that the prosecutor had “pitched” the Crown case on the basis of actual knowledge and not “recklessness or [scil. no] reasonable grounds of belief [in consent]”. Accordingly, his Honour indicated that he would not be directing the jury about those bases of inculpation during the summing-up.
	
	
	Sixthly, his Honour summed up to the jury as follows (20/3/15, T4-5):
	


A person consents if the person freely and voluntarily agrees to have sexual intercourse. Consent involves free and voluntary agreement to have sexual intercourse. Consent, or lack of consent, may be communicated by words or actions, either one. The lack of physical resistance, by that reason alone, by reason only of that fact, is not regarded as consent. It can be taken into account, but it is not regarded as consent by that reason alone. You take all of the circumstances into account. Substantial intoxication is relevant to the question of consent, you must take substantial intoxication into account if you find there was substantial intoxication. But substantial intoxication of itself does not preclude consent, it is relevant to the question of whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent, did not freely and voluntarily agree to have sexual intercourse. It is something that you take into account on that issue. And that’s the state of mind of the complainant. The Crown relies upon the complainant’s evidence, the complainant said she did not consent.


	
	Seventhly and finally, later in the summing-up his Honour directed the jury as follows (23/3/15, T3-4):
	


As I understand the Crown case, it is essentially this. That the complainant, for one reason or another was substantially intoxicated. The Crown submits, you just need to look at the other evidence apart from what people say. Look at her in the second cab, she was just not normal. She was in no condition when she was in the accused’s cab to offer any physical resistance at all. The Crown case is she was opportunistically exploited by the accused, who took advantage of her very obvious intoxication. That is the case in a nutshell. She didn’t consent to the sexual intercourse and he well knew it on the Crown case.

[emphasis added by me in all of the above extracts]

Submissions about grounds 2 and 3


	
	The position before this Court of counsel for the applicant may be summarised as follows. She submitted that much of what the prosecutor had said to the jury, both in opening and closing, was legally incorrect, and a misunderstanding of the various sub-sections of s 61HA of the Crimes Act (the section). Having said that, she accepted that all that his Honour had said on the topic in the summing-up was entirely correct. In other words, her complaint was not that there was any misdirection in the summing-up. Rather, the nub of these grounds is that, despite the correctness of the directions given by his Honour to the jury at the end of the trial, it was possible that the jury remained confused, in light of the legal errors in the addresses of the prosecutor. In short, her submission was that the summing-up was not erroneous, but rather inadequate, in that his Honour did not explicitly invite attention to, and correct, the erroneous things that had been said to the jury about the law by one of the advocates.
	
	
	She accepted that her contention before us had not been put forward by counsel then appearing at the trial. She also accepted that, as a result, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) must be overcome. But she submitted that, in light of the centrality to the trial of the questions of the state of mind of the complainant and of the applicant at the time of the intercourse, the rule should not stand in the way of either ground being upheld.
	
	
	Separately, counsel for the applicant made a particular complaint. It was said that, although his Honour confined the Crown case to “actual knowledge”, in the circumstances of this case a specific direction should have been given to the jury, as follows. If they came to the view that the applicant genuinely but mistakenly believed that the complainant was consenting (or rather, if they had a reasonable doubt about that), then the jury must return a verdict of not guilty, in light of the circumscription of the Crown case.
	
	
	The Crown conceded before this Court that there were legal errors in what was said by the prosecutor, both in opening and in closing. The submission was, however, that the directions in the summing-up were correct and perfectly clear. It was also submitted that the absence of any application by trial counsel for further directions, explicitly inviting attention to what the prosecutor had said and disavowing it, shows that defence counsel was content with what his Honour had said, and satisfied that the jury understood it. In those circumstances, she submitted, each ground should be rejected.
	


Determination of grounds 2 and 3


	
	Turning to my determination of these two grounds, it is convenient first to set out the entirety of the section:
	


61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences

(1) Offences to which section applies

This section applies for the purposes of the offences, or attempts to commit the offences, under sections 61I, 61J and 61JA.

(2) Meaning of consent

A person consents to sexual intercourse if the person freely and voluntarily agrees to the sexual intercourse.

(3) Knowledge about consent

A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if:

(a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or

(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or

(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case:

(d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but

(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person.

(4) Negation of consent

A person does not consent to sexual intercourse:

(a) if the person does not have the capacity to consent to the sexual intercourse, including because of age or cognitive incapacity, or

(b) if the person does not have the opportunity to consent to the sexual intercourse because the person is unconscious or asleep, or

(c) if the person consents to the sexual intercourse because of threats of force or terror (whether the threats are against, or the terror is instilled in, that person or any other person), or

(d) if the person consents to the sexual intercourse because the person is unlawfully detained.

(5) A person who consents to sexual intercourse with another person:

(a) under a mistaken belief as to the identity of the other person, or

(b) under a mistaken belief that the other person is married to the person, or

(c) under a mistaken belief that the sexual intercourse is for health or hygienic purposes (or under any other mistaken belief about the nature of the act induced by fraudulent means),

does not consent to the sexual intercourse. For the purposes of subsection (3), the other person knows that the person does not consent to sexual intercourse if the other person knows the person consents to sexual intercourse under such a mistaken belief.

(6) The grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse include:

(a) if the person has sexual intercourse while substantially intoxicated by alcohol or any drug, or

(b) if the person has sexual intercourse because of intimidatory or coercive conduct, or other threat, that does not involve a threat of force, or

(c) if the person has sexual intercourse because of the abuse of a position of authority or trust.

(7) A person who does not offer actual physical resistance to sexual intercourse is not, by reason only of that fact, to be regarded as consenting to the sexual intercourse.

(8) This section does not limit the grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse.


	
	A number of aspects of the section can be noted.
	
	
	First, as can be seen from sub-section (1), the section as a whole applied to the trial of the applicant on the count brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Secondly, the section deals with the subject matter of both the state of mind of the complainant and the state of mind of the accused that needs to be proven beyond reasonable doubt in a sexual assault trial to which the section applies.
	
	
	Thirdly, the latter topic is not without its complications: as sub-section (3) shows, the inculpatory state of mind of an accused person can be proven in three different ways, the last of which may be characterised as including objective culpability: see [Decision Restricted] [2016] NSWCCA 52 at [155]. It is separately established that recklessness on the part of an accused person with regard to a sexual offence can be proven in a number of ways, including complete non-advertence: see R v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696 at 702, referring to Henning v R (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 May 1990, unrep) at 31.
	
	
	Fourthly, the section as a whole is an unusual amalgam of concepts. In sub-section (2), it defines consent (and therefore, conversely, lack of consent) in a clear and concise way. In the latter part of sub-section (3), it mandates things that must and must not be taken into account by the jury in assessing whether the Crown has proven the requisite mental element on the part of the accused. In sub-sections (4) and (5), it conclusively defines circumstances in which a complainant is to be regarded as not consenting. In the latter part of sub-section (5), it reverts to the topic of the inculpatory state of mind of the accused, and defines a further basis upon which that may be established. In sub-section (6), it sets out a non-exclusive list of “grounds” that may lead to a conclusion by the jury that a complainant was not consenting. In sub-section (7), it is made clear that lack of “actual physical resistance” on the part of a complainant does not, of itself, establish consent on his or her part. Finally, in sub-section (8), it is emphasised that this section (including the list in sub-section (6)) is not exclusive of other grounds on which it may be established that a person does not consent to sexual intercourse.
	
	
	Turning to this particular example of application of the section, a number of the things said by the prosecutor to the jury were not strictly correct or at least potentially confusing; I infer that they occurred because of the difficult aspects of the section that I have summarised above.
	
	
	In particular, one way of reading the extract of the opening in [124] above is that the fact that a person is substantially intoxicated by alcohol “means” that he or she is not consenting to intercourse. As sub-section (6) demonstrates, that is merely a ground upon which it may be established that the person was not consenting: whether or not that factor actually establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was not giving free and voluntary agreement is a matter for the satisfaction of the jury.
	
	
	Separately, I consider that the first extract from the closing address of the prosecutor that appears at [123] above also features an elision of concepts. Self-evidently, a person does not consent to sexual intercourse if he or she does not have the capacity to do so: as a matter of practical reality, human beings do not do things that they are incapable of doing. That principle is reflected in sub-section (4)(a). But to suggest that the circumstance of a person being substantially affected by alcohol meant of itself that he or she was incapable of consent was not correct. Nor would the fact that the complainant was substantially affected by alcohol mean that, of itself, it demonstrated that it was “readily apparent” to the applicant that she was incapable of consenting. As sub-section (6) envisages, much will depend on the evidence in a particular trial, and the evaluation of it by the jury.
	
	
	Thirdly, although the submission to the jury of the prosecutor that the complainant was “unable to consent” may have been open on the evidence, and was consistent with the equivalence between incapacity to consent and lack of consent created by sub-section (4)(a), the reference was apt to confuse. That is because the state of mind of the complainant that needed to be proven beyond reasonable doubt was simply that the intercourse had occurred without her consent; in other words, without her free and voluntary agreement. The Crown did not have to go further and prove that the complainant was incapable of consenting. Although they are closely related, an incapacity to do something (whether it be to form a state of mind, to perform a physical act, or anything else) is conceptually separate from a failure to do that thing. In other words, if one did not have the capacity to do something, one cannot have done it; on the other hand, simply because one did have that capacity, does not mean that one actually did it.
	
	
	In short, I accept the joint position of counsel before this Court that some of the legal concepts discussed in the two addresses of the prosecutor were presented in a confused and confusing way to the jury.
	
	
	That by no means leads, however, to the success of either ground. That is because, to adopt again the joint position, the directions given by his Honour were, with respect, perfectly correct. As can be seen from my extracts at [126] and [127], his Honour correctly defined consent (in accordance with sub-section (2)); referred to the lack of physical resistance as not demonstrating consent (in accordance with sub-section (7)); referred to substantial intoxication as something to be taken into account with regard to the question of lack of consent (in accordance with sub-section (6)); and, finally, restricted the inculpatory mental element to actual knowledge of lack of consent (in accordance with sub-section (3)(a)). That was done in accordance with the exchange between his Honour and the prosecutor based upon the opening and closing addresses of the latter. That restriction to proof of “actual knowledge” on his part undoubtedly favoured the applicant.
	
	
	I do not accept that it was a miscarriage of justice for his Honour to fail to go further, and draw attention to the errors in the addresses of the prosecutor in order to correct them. Such a step may have been disadvantageous to the applicant for at least two reasons. First, it may have confused the jury to repeat the errors of the prosecutor in order to correct them. Secondly, the repetition of the incorrect concepts may have emphasised them in a way that could perhaps have made them attractive to the jury, and led to inappropriately closed reasoning about intoxication, lack of consent, and knowledge of both on the part of the applicant.
	
	
	Of course, it may sometimes be appropriate in summing-up for a trial judge to correct errors about legal or factual matters in the address of either counsel by explicitly drawing attention to them. But that way of dealing with such a problem is by no means mandatory. Much will depend on the circumstances of the particular trial. Here, the approach taken by his Honour was perfectly open.
	
	
	I am fortified in that view by the fact that defence counsel sought no redirection about these topics at the end of the summing-up. That not only plays a role with regard to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules; it also supports my opinion that to have adopted the course for which counsel for the applicant now contends may well have done more harm than good, in terms of jury comprehension and the applicant being accorded a fair trial.
	
	
	In short, whilst I accept that the prosecutor was unclear and confusing in some things he said about the law with regard to sexual assault, I do not consider that, in light of the clarity and correctness of the directions in the summing-up, they occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	As for the separate submission about the further explanation that it is now said his Honour should have given about an honest but mistaken belief in consent, I do not accept it. His Honour made it perfectly clear that what the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt was actual knowledge on the part of the applicant that the complainant was not giving free and voluntary agreement to the intercourse. As I have said, that restriction with regard to the mental element of the applicant that the Crown needed to prove was highly advantageous to the applicant, bearing in mind the breadth of sub-section (3) of the section. To speak of a genuine but mistaken belief, when the success of the Crown case was circumscribed in that way, would almost certainly have muddied the waters of comprehension, quite possibly adversely to the applicant. And in any event, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to this submission, and plays the same two roles.
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose that grounds 2 and 3 be rejected.
	


Ground 1

The conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Submissions about ground 1


	
	The written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant summarise the submissions made by defence counsel at trial. They separately set out the aspects of the evidence that are said to show that this ground should succeed. The following summary is a melding of both of those sets of submissions against conviction.
	
	
	The complainant did not remember the second taxi ride because she did not wish to. She made no complaint to the second taxi driver, and appeared cheerful to him. Nor did she complain to her parents upon arriving home.
	
	
	There was a striking similarity between the version of the applicant and the evidence of the second taxi driver with regard to the complainant demanding $100 (in the former case, in return for intercourse; in the latter case, in return for a kiss). It is noteworthy that the second taxi driver did not have his version impugned by the Crown by way of an application to cross-examine pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	As for the level of intoxication of the complainant, the CCTV from outside the hotel in Darlinghurst did not suggest that it was significant. Ms Hart, who had drunk roughly the same amount of alcohol as the complainant, was not particularly affected. The applicant was sufficiently unaffected to walk something in the order of 1 kilometre along Military Road.
	
	
	No scientific evidence linked the false receipt to the applicant.
	
	
	The lie told by the applicant in the first interview about not having penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with the complainant was not probative of consciousness of guilt; patently, there were other explanations for it.
	
	
	The reliability of the memory of the complainant about all events could be tested by her complete amnesia with regard to the second taxi journey.
	
	
	The lower end of the estimate provided by the pharmacologist with regard to the blood alcohol reading of the complainant – 0.104 – was not overly high. Although Ms Hart described the demeanour of the complainant as having altered, she did not observe frank signs of intoxication such as impaired motor skills and the like.
	
	
	It would be unlikely for the complainant to have been drugged by taking two sips from a glass. The finding of a sedative in her urine sample, in light of the absence of other evidence, did not corroborate that she had been drugged. In any event, she was quite capable of walking along Military Road.
	
	
	In her interaction with the second taxi driver, the complainant had described herself as “OK”, had not appeared distressed, and had kissed him on four occasions.
	


Determination of ground 1


	
	The test to be applied in resolving a ground such as this was not the subject of controversy before us. As Hoeben CJ at CL said most recently in this Court in MG v R [2017] NSWCCA 14 at [82]:
	


The correct approach in determining this ground of appeal is stated in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 where the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said:

“11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

…

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" [Footnotes omitted]


	
	Here, I consider that it was perfectly open to the jury to find the applicant guilty of the offence upon which he had been arraigned. I say that for the following reasons, in generally descending order of importance.
	
	
	First, in my opinion, the change of position of the applicant between the first and second recorded interviews destroyed the credibility of his denials, and rendered them worthless. Not only that, his adamant and repeated denials that penile/vaginal sexual intercourse had taken place in the first interview – completely disavowed once he was confronted with scientific evidence to the contrary – was compelling evidence of consciousness of guilt on his part (that was the only portion of the Crown case that his Honour had permitted to be left to the jury on that basis).
	
	
	Secondly, repeated watching of the CCTV taken from the second taxi shows that the complainant was grossly intoxicated. Not only did she fall from the front passenger seat many times, she is also to be seen (at picture 80/172 on camera 2) to be lolling back in the car seat with her eyes half-closed in a state of grossly compromised consciousness. That graphic visual depiction of how the complainant appeared, minutes after the intercourse took place, very powerfully supports the proposition that, at the time, she was not providing free and voluntary agreement to it, and the applicant well knew that fact.
	
	
	Thirdly, the jury saw the complainant give evidence in person. In the same vein, the jury saw and heard two lengthy recorded interviews in which the applicant engaged. As a result, the jury was in an immeasurably better position than members of this Court to assess the credibility of the complainant and the applicant.
	
	
	Fourthly, despite the possibility of secondary transfer, the finding of a DNA profile identical to that of the applicant, on more than one location on the clothing of the complainant, strongly supported the proposition that he had removed her clothing. That proposition is not only inconsistent with the final position of the applicant as to what he did or did not do shortly before the intercourse took place. In the circumstances of this case, it is also more consistent with intercourse without consent than intercourse with consent.
	
	
	Fifthly, although cross-examination of the complainant was firm and extensive, no “knock-out blow” was landed. In particular, many of the inconsistencies and gaps in recollection on her part could be amply explained by her gross intoxication, the evidence for which came from many sources: the complainant herself, Ms Hart, the second taxi driver, the finding of the shoe on the garbage bin, and the CCTV from the second taxi.
	
	
	Sixthly, the suggestion that a young woman would not only disrobe in front of a taxi driver (whom she had met a matter of minutes before), but also proceed to masturbate in front of him whilst sitting in the front passenger seat, must be assessed as inherently incredible.
	
	
	Seventhly, it is true that the complainant did not speak to anyone upon her arrival at home, and only complained of having been sexually assaulted the following day to her mother. But I repeat: the CCTV from the second taxi shows that she was grossly intoxicated. The finding of one of her shoes on top of a garbage bin outside the home the following day supports that proposition. It is also to be recalled that, when she spoke to her mother, the complainant spoke bluntly and with distress of having been sexually assaulted. To my mind, the complaint evidence does not detract from the Crown case; indeed, it plays a role in its strength.
	
	
	Eighthly, it is true that the various injuries seen to the person of the complainant the following evening on medical examination could be explained by her falling down, bumping into objects, and the like. But they were also available for the consideration of the jury as to whether she had in fact been sexually assaulted in the close confines of a motor vehicle. And in any event, the alternative explanation was a “two-edged sword” from the perspective of the applicant: if the complainant was indeed so intoxicated as to be falling and injuring herself, that hardly assisted his case.
	
	
	Ninthly and finally, little was made at the trial of the presence of a sedative in the bloodstream of the complainant on examination. No doubt that was because the evidence was equivocal. Nevertheless, to my mind that evidence supports the proposition that the complainant had indeed been drugged at the hotel, and was not merely affected by the combination of alcohol and cannabis. That in turn goes quite a long way to supporting the proposition that she was as intoxicated as she claimed, and not as little affected as the applicant claimed.
	
	
	Separately, one would have thought that the seeming provision of a receipt with a false taxi number on it, and the failure to reactivate the meter after the first stop on Military Road (with the effect that the CCTV in the taxi of the applicant was not engaged at that time), might be suggestive of consciousness of guilt on the part of the applicant. Because his Honour declined to leave that evidence to the jury on that basis, however, those parts of the Crown case have not formed part of my reasoning about this ground.
	
	
	Finally, it is quite true that the similarity between the alleged conduct of the complainant towards the applicant and her conduct towards the second taxi driver – claiming $100 from each of them for some sort of intimacy – should be noted. In the absence of any application pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act, one must approach the evidence of Mr Bensaidi about that topic as being truthful and correct.
	
	
	It is possible that in her grossly intoxicated state the complainant was saying such things. But it was quintessentially a matter for the jury to determine what one should make of the similarity between the assertions of the two men; to determine what role, if any, that similarity should play in assessing the credibility of the complainant; and to determine what role it should play in the question of lack of consent and knowledge thereof generally. And in any event, in my opinion, the exculpatory effect that that evidence may have had is simply swamped by the strength of the other matters to which I have referred.
	
	
	Apart from that aspect, I respectfully think that the other matters relied upon by counsel for the applicant with regard to this ground are of little moment. The criticisms of the evidence of the complainant can readily be explained by her gross intoxication.
	
	
	In short, far from this being a case in which the verdict is unreasonable, to my mind the Crown case at trial was very strong. To my mind, it was well open to the jury to return a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	It follows that I would not uphold ground 1.

4276269,R v Nassim Eid [2017] NSWDC 69,"Judgment


	
	The offender came for sentence before on 3 March 2017 in respect of an offence of supply prohibited drug, namely 54.7 grams of cocaine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). [1]  The matter was originally listed for trial on 7 November 2016. A guilty plea was ultimately entered on 9 November 2016. In sentencing the offender, I have been requested to take into account, pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), [2]  one offence also said to have occurred on 31 May 2015 relating to deal with property suspected of being proceeds of crime, contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). [3] 
	


Agreed facts


	
	At about 1:30 am on 31 May 2015, police attended Stevens Street, Ermington for an unrelated matter. Police parked on the northern kerb of Stevens Street, just west of Oxley Street facing west. Police observed a red Audi A4 parked on the southern kerb also facing west, however parked just east of Oxley Street.
	
	
	Police got out of their vehicle and noticed a shadow moving inside the Audi. Police walked toward the front of the Audi and flashed a torch through the front windscreen and saw the offender sit up from inside the rear foot well behind the front passenger seat. As police walked closer to the vehicle, the offender exited the vehicle from the rear passenger door.
	
	
	A conversation then took place with the police, whilst the offender locked the door of his vehicle, before being asked by police if he could open the door for them. The offender declined, stating: “Nah, my brother will be here any second, it’s his car, he has the keys.”
	
	
	Police thereafter submitted the offender and the motor vehicle to a search. They found a black Apple iPhone in his right pants pocket, along with the sum of $1,880 in cash, in denominations of $100, $50 and $20 notes. The offender told police that the money belonged to his “mates … my mate” who had had accidentally left it in his car, so he was “just holding onto it for him.”
	
	
	Police then proceeded to search the vehicle and located two clear plastic sandwich bags containing 54.7 g of cocaine. In the middle of the back seat, police located a black Nokia mobile phone. The offender was placed under arrest and cautioned. Police asked the offender whether the cocaine belonged to him, to which he replied: “Nah, I have never seen it before, what is it?” The offender told police that the black Nokia mobile phone belonged to him. At this time, a silver BMW sedan containing at least 3 males was stopped where the police and the offender were talking, which was just behind the red Audi. When they noticed police, the BMW quickly sped away from the location.
	
	
	The offender was then conveyed to Parramatta Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview. He was asked a number of questions in relation to the incident, but answered “no comment” for the majority of the questions asked of him.
	
	
	During the charge process, the black Nokia mobile phone located in the vehicle began to ring. A contact listed as “BLK” called the mobile phone. Police answered the call and a male voice said: “Hey it’s me, can you come to the big park where everyone works out. I just want a ticket.” Police disconnected the call. Police examined the black Nokia phone and found what appeared to be a number of coded messages.
	
	
	As part of the Crown’s tender bundle, an analyst certificate was produced in accordance with the provisions of s 43 of the 1985 Act and Part 3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Regulation 2011 (NSW). The testing carried out on the substance identified it as being cocaine, having a purity of 89%.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The offender’s conduct involved the use of a mobile phone with coded messaging, a vehicle with dark tinted windows and two bags of prohibited drugs weighing a total of 54.7 grams, of 89% purity and currency in multiple denominations that he conceded did not belong to him.
	
	
	As the quantity involved is not less than the trafficable quantity it is deemed by s 29 of the 1985 Act to have been in possession for the purposes of supply. The offender did not seek to prove that he had the drugs in his possession, otherwise than for the purposes of supply. [4] 
	
	
	The threshold for an indictable quantity of cocaine is from 5.00 g to below 250.00 g. Whilst the amount in this case sits at towards the lower end of the weight spectrum it is still more than ten times the threshold indictable quantity. The purity is at the high end of the spectrum.
	
	
	The state in which the drugs were found in (two bags) and their high purity satisfy me that the offender’s role was somewhat more than a street dealer. However I am not satisfied that his role falls at the higher end of the distribution chain. Nonetheless the agreed facts satisfy me that the offender was involved in trafficking drugs to a substantial degree. [5] 
	
	
	The Crown made no submission that the offence was aggravated by reason of being part of a planned or organised criminal activity – it being acknowledged that it is generally an inherent part of an offence of supplying drugs. [6] 
	
	
	Overall I would regard this matter as sitting just below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


Financial gain/consumer of drugs


	
	The offender acknowledged that the offence was committed for financial gain. [7] 
	
	
	As will be discussed below, the offender at the time of the offence was a user of illicit substances. Counsel for the offender submitted that the offender’s drug addiction does not operate as a mitigating factor, but entitles his criminality to be assessed at a lower level than had he been dealing with drugs purely for greed. It was asserted that the offender’s addiction served to explain (although not excuse) that the offence was committed whilst on bail. [8]  Reliance in this regard was placed on the decisions of Studdert J in R v Selim [9]  and Hall J in Vu v R. [10] 
	
	
	In Vu v R, Hall J (with whom James and Buddin JJ agreed) specifically referred to Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry. [11]  The offender’s submission did not specifically identify which of the principles referred to therein, were engaged. The offence was not impulsive. Nor was it committed in circumstances where the offender’s state of mind or capacity to exercise judgment was affected. Even if the offender’s judgment had been clouded by his use of drugs it was self-induced and provides little by way of mitigation. [12]  Moreover Dr Nielssen notes in relation to the offender’s use of methamphetamine and cocaine for three years “they made me feel superior … I was just high.”
	


Conditional liberty


	
	It was acknowledged that the offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail for other offences including another offence of supply a prohibited drug – an aggravating factor in sentence.  [13] 
	


Plea of guilty


	
	The offender pleaded guilty to the charge on the second day that the matter was listed for trial and submitted that the appropriate discount, in accordance with the decision in R v Thomson & Houlton [14]  should be 10%. The Crown for its part, accepted that it should be no higher than 15%. I accept that 10% is the correct discount in the circumstances.
	


Remorse


	
	The report of Dr Olav Nielssen [15]  records the offender’s sister stating:
	


“She said that he often spoke about his regret about what he has done and that he was ‘trying to change.’”


	
	The offender in evidence before me stated that as a result of this offence he has learnt the hard way. He stated that he had hurt his family, the community and others around him. He stated that he knows how bad drugs are. He stated that it was “half my fault” but “at the end of the day I make my own decisions.”
	
	
	The qualification in his evidence about it being “half his fault” does not on balance detract from the fact that the offender has accepted responsibility and I accept remorse has been demonstrated within the terms of s 21A(3)(i) of the 1999 Act.
	


Likelihood of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The offender is the third of four children with a sister aged 24, who is married with children; a brother a year older than himself and works as a plumber; and a younger sister who has completed high school and works in childcare.
	
	
	According to a report prepared by Dr Nielssen, the offender describes himself as the “black sheep of the family.” [16]  The offender’s father is currently off work and his mother did not work because of health problems.
	
	
	The offender grew up in Ermington and attended Ermington West Public School, Al Faisal College for Year 7 and Marsden High School in West Ryde to Year Ten, although he repeated Year 9 because of poor attendance and did not complete the School Certificate. He was taken on as an apprentice carpenter and completed a year of the TAFE course associated with the apprenticeship, but told Dr Nielssen: “it was too hard for me ... the fees cost too much and I was only getting $300 max a week.” [17] 
	
	
	The offender reported several short term relationships but had been in contact with a girl since coming into custody and hoped to form a long term relationship on his release. [18] 
	
	
	He expressed the view to Dr Nielssen that he has “big plans” for the future, including staying out of gaol, seeking treatment for his anxiety disorder, finding work and “hopefully get[ting] married.” [19] 
	
	
	Despite his relatively poor level of education, Mr Eid gave evidence that since entering into custody he has completed courses in English and Mathematics. The details of this are unclear. Overall, he is a person of limited education and skill.
	
	
	Notwithstanding this, Mr Rabih Dandan, director of RNS Construction Pty Ltd, supplied a letter confirming that upon the offender’s release, he proposes to employ him as a carpenter on a full time, permanent basis, six days per week from Monday to Saturday from approximately 7:30 am to 3:30 – 4:00 pm each day, depending on site locations and respective travel times. [20]  Mr Dandan also gave evidence before me and was not challenged.
	
	
	The offending record is a relatively recent one, dating from 2011. In short it is not unblemished, comprising a range of summary matters and it is not advanced as a ground of mitigation under s 21A(3)(e) of the 1999 Act. The prison term commencing on 24 June 2015 was the first occasion that the offender came into custody. It is also of concern is that since entering into custody, he has had seven correctional transgressions including three failures to comply with correctional centre routine, two failure to obey directions, and one of create and possess prohibited good and one of intimidation.
	


Previous drug use


	
	The offender gave a history to Dr Nielssen as to his previous drug use. Dr Nielssen records that the offender previously worked as an apprentice carpenter but left when he “caught up with a couple of people … [and] they told me how I could make easier money.” [21] 
	
	
	Dr Nielssen further records:-
	


“When asked about his own drug use, Mr Eid said ‘I had a bit of a drug problem from when I turned sixteen until I got locked up’. He said ‘I was smoking Ice and I was on a lot of cocaine’ and said that he used one or other of those drugs every day. He said that he often went days without sleep, and fell asleep from exhaustion after three or four days, often after smoking cannabis.

Mr Eid said that being charged and taken into custody had allowed him to break the cycle of drug use and drug debt, and said ‘I am happy this has happened to me … I am thinking about the positives … it has rehabilitated me.’

When asked about his emotional state at the time, Mr Eid said ‘I have this problem where I struggle to breathe and I think something is going to happen … like I am going to die … I get hot flushes … I feel sick in the stomach … I think something is happened but nothing is [sic] … I have been to the nurses and they told me it was anxiety … one of the inmates told me to get a bag and breather’. He said ‘I have tried to do courses in gaol … I have done four or five courses but its nothing to do with that [management of anxiety symptoms].” [22] 


	
	Dr Nielssen reports that Mr Eid used methamphetamine and cocaine for three years from the age of 17 until he was incarcerated at the age of 20. The offender told him: “They made me feel superior … I was just high.” Dr Nielssen also reports some use of medication to get to sleep, but no history of admission to drug rehabilitation centres or substance related counselling. [23] 
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that at the time of the offence, he was using four grams of cocaine a day and “three points” of ice. He described a “point” of ice as being 0.1 grams. He stated that at the date of the offence, he had been using for two years. He stated that all the time, he lived “day by day.” He also stated that he was not scared of what happened, in terms of him being relieved when he was caught. He stated that he did not care much at the time but now that has changed. He feels as though he has been rehabilitated even though he has not had any drug rehabilitation.
	
	
	In conclusion, Dr Nielssen diagnosed an anxiety disorder (panic disorder) and substance use disorder, in remission. Dr Nielssen noted that factors that are contributing to the development of the anxiety disorder include possible inherited vulnerability to the condition, as his mother had also been treated for anxiety and his sister reported being anxious and his use of stimulant drugs, which are a potent trigger to panic attacks. [24] 
	
	
	Dr Nielssen stated that the substance abuse disorder diagnosis was made on the basis of a history of use of a drug known to have harmful psychological effects and the complications of his drug use, including his history of transient perceptual disturbances and persecutory ideas, the role of stimulant drug use in triggering panic disorder and the role of his own use in his involvement in this offence. [25] 
	
	
	Whilst Dr Nielssen stated that the disorder has been described as being in remission, this was based on his account of what the offender describes as “nearly two years” of abstinence whilst in custody. [26] 
	
	
	Dr Nielssen in summary stated:-
	


“Mr Eid has a common psychiatric disorder in the form panic disorder for which effective treatment is readily available in the form of evidence based face to face counselling or a free, Commonwealth funded online course at mindspot.org.au, which achieves results that are equivalent to face to face care. He did not appear depressed, or to have a major psychiatric disorder for which he required treatment with any kind of psychotropic medication. However, if he continues to have panic attacks, and develops a disabling pattern of avoidance of some situations because of fear of having an attack, treatment with antidepressant medication may complement face to face or self-guided cognitive behaviour therapy.” [27] 


	
	Dr Nielssen also opines that the offender will need:
	



	
	to remain abstinent from drugs;
	
	
	to avoid drug using associates; and
	
	
	to participate in longer term counselling and intermittent drug testing. [28] 
	



	
	The offender has not undertaken any courses to address his offending behaviour and substance abuse issues. It is submitted nevertheless that he has good prospects of rehabilitation bearing in mind that he was only 20 years of age when the offence was committed and since coming into custody, has ceased using drugs. The offender gave evidence about the availability of drugs within the prison system and the fact that he has not had a positive drug test.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the submissions made, on the basis of Dr Nielssen’s report and the custodial record, I would regard the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation overall as reasonable and his likelihood of re-offending as medium-risk.
	


Commencement of sentence


	
	At the time of committing the subject offence, the offender was on bail for an offence of supply prohibited drug of which he had been charged on 11 April 2015. The offender had also been charged with an offence of affray, said to have occurred on 23 September 2013. On 23 September 2014, he was sentenced to serve 70 hours of community service in respect of this offence. It appears that this order had not been satisfactorily completed, and accordingly on 24 November 2015, whilst still bail refused in relation to the matter before me, the community service order was revoked and the offender was sentenced to serve a period of 3 months imprisonment commencing on 22 May 2015 and concluding on 21 August 2015. In relation to the offence of supply prohibited drug of 11 April 2015, the offender was sentenced to a period of 5 months’ imprisonment commencing on 24 June 2015 and concluding on 23 November 2015.
	
	
	On the offender’s behalf it was submitted that the commencement of any sentence in respect of the matter before me should date from the period of the mid-point of 22 May 2015 and 23 November 2015. It was contended that the course of action taken by the Magistrate in revoking the community service order and imposing a prison term, as well as the sentence imposed for the supply of prohibited drug, reflected the fact that the offender was then being incarcerated having been bail refused in relation to the charge before me since 31 May 2015.
	
	
	Counsel for the offender drew attention to a photograph of the narcotics the subject of the supply charge dealt with by the Magistrate, in respect of the offence said to have taken place on 11 April 2015, being Exhibit 3 in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	The question of the date of commencement of the sentence is a discretionary decision.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by the Magistrate were not appealed from and they in any event provided for a limited level of accumulation. This is not an occasion to go behind those sentences for the purposes of examining their merits. In all of the circumstances, I would propose to commence the sentence on 24 November 2015.
	


Sentence


	
	The offence of deal with property suspected of being proceeds of crime is encompassed in the Form 1, which I have been requested to take into account pursuant to s 32(1) of the 1999 Act . I do so in accordance with the decision of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1) of 2002. [29]  
	
	
	The primary offence in respect of which I am imposing sentence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or 2,000 penalty units. [30] 
	
	
	Counsel for the offender and the Crown agreed that no sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate within the terms of s 5(1) of the 1999 Act.
	
	
	I have regard to the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the 1999 Act.
	
	
	In R v Shi, Wood CJ at CL stated:
	


“[34] … the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply networks is significant, and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehousemen and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution, would simply collapse: R v Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 and R v Laurentio and Becheru (1962) 63 A Crim R 402.”  [31] 


	
	The need for general deterrence and specific deterrence looms large. The offender’s conduct needs to be denounced and he needs to be made accountable for his actions.
	
	
	He is a young male with limited education and no vocational skills but with good family and community support. For the reasons given, I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as being reasonable and regard his likelihood of reoffending as medium-risk.
	
	
	In light of the fact that that this is the offender’s first period in custody when combined with the previous sentences, his youth, prospects of rehabilitation, the need for an extended time under supervision and the need maintain an overall balance in ratio between time spent in custody and parole, I am satisfied that the case calls for a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	But for the plea of guilty I would have sentenced the offender to serve a term of 3 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	In light of his plea and bearing in mind my finding of special circumstances, I set a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months’ imprisonment commencing on 24 November 2015 and expiring on 23 February 2018 and an additional term of 1 year and 1 month imprisonment to commence on 24 February 2018 and to expire on 23 March 2019. [32] 
	
	
	The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 24 February 2018.
	
	
	The overall sentence is of 3 years and 4 months to commence on 24 November 2015 and expire on 23 March 2019.

4276270,Safe Work (NSW) v Karimbla Constructions Services (NSW) Pty Ltd [2017] NSWDC 68,"sentence


	
	Karimbla Constructions Services (NSW) Pty Ltd (the offender) appears for sentence after it pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to section 32 Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act). The offence was committed when the offender breached its health and safety duty owed pursuant to section 19(1) of the Act and thereby exposed Oteki Felemi to a risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender was the principal contractor for construction work at 19-33 Kent Road Mascot (the site). A multi-storey mixed use residential building was under construction.
	
	
	Mr Felemi was employed by Freyssinet Australia Pty Ltd (Freyssinet) as a concrete stressor. Freyssinet had contracted with Karimbla to undertake post stressing at the site.
	
	
	On 10 February 2015 Mr Felemi had finished work for the day on the sixth floor of the site. He was walking down an internal concrete stairway (the stairs) from the ground level to the underground car park levels to access a locker room that was being used by the Freyssinet employees, with 3 workmates. The stairs had a temporary timber handrail installed of a post and rail design that consisted only of a top rail. In other words, it provided no impediment to a person failing under the top rail.
	
	
	Mr Felemi lost his footing and fell under the top rail, falling about 3m onto a concrete landing below. There was no intermediate rail, but a toeboard was in place along to the edge of the stairs. The stairs were permanent and a completed part of the building. They were clean and clear of any debris.
	
	
	Mr Felemi suffered serious injuries, including a severe head injury, spinal injuries and chest and facial fractures. He was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) where he remained for 7 weeks, 3 of which were spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Mr Felemi is still in rehabilitation as an outpatient at Westmead Hospital and has not returned to work.
	
	
	At induction each worker on the site was trained on how to identify risks on the site, even if the risk was not associated with that workers task. The workers were trained on the procedure to be followed if a risk was identified.
	
	
	Freyssinet conducted inspections and notified the offender of risks identified. Those inspections were documented and provided to the offender.
	
	
	The offender fixed each reported hazard immediately or arranged a sub-contractor to do so.
	
	
	The offender had not been notified of the hazard presented by the insufficiency of the handrail to the stairs, or of a risk in the area where Mr Felemi fell.
	
	
	The Australian Standard AS 1657-2013 required the installation of an intermediate rail or the fixing of mesh, to prevent a person falling underneath the top rail.
	
	
	On the day of the incident the offender installed an intermediate rail. On 11 February 2015 the offender installed steel wire mesh over the top rail and the intermediate rail at the direction of SafeWork NSW.
	
	
	It was a further agreed fact that the stairs were used daily by employees and the employees of contractors on site.
	


The Offender’s Case on Sentence


	
	The offender relied on an affidavit of James Sylvester Sykes, sworn 30 January 2017. Mr Sykes was present in Court for the sentence hearing but not required for cross-examination. The affidavit can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Mr Sykes is the Group Safety Manager of the Meriton Group of companies (the group) to which the offender belongs. It was incorporated in 2011.
	
	
	Mr Sykes has been employed in the field of industrial safety for 15 years. He was first employed by the group in 2009 and was promoted 6 months later to his present position. That position includes responsibility of oversight of safety issues on all of the offender’s sites.
	
	
	Mr Sykes was appointed the Work Health Safety and Environment Manager for the site.
	
	
	Mr Sykes was present on site when Mr Felemi fell. At the time, he was conducting a “safety walk” with one of the offender’s safety officers.
	
	
	He directed that the stairs be cordoned off and liaised with the SafeWork inspectors and union representatives that attended the site.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, the offender had adopted a Safety Management Plan for the site. It had conducted a project risk assessment for the site. There were 3 safety officers and 3 safety labourers employed at the site to provide supervision, conduct tool box talks, facilitate safety meetings and carry out the activities identified in the Safety Management Plan.
	
	
	The offender also required all contractors to submit a safety plan before commencing work on the site. Freyssinet had submitted a safety plan.
	
	
	The offender had also adopted a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) for the construction work taking place at the site. Each contractor was also required to have a SWMS for their work.
	
	
	Each worker was inducted when entering the site. That induction included checking the worker’s qualifications, ensuring that the worker had read the induction booklet and site rules and had undertaken a site specific induction. As part of the induction quizzes were administered to ensure that the worker understood the material delivered in the training. If the worker got an answer wrong the relevant training on that issue was repeated. The training included a direction not to enter an area without adequate edge protection and the requirement to notify a supervisor if such an area was identified so that it could be immediately rectified. A check was also performed to ensure that a worker had signed all relevant safety documents and they were asked to sign the Induction Register.
	
	
	The Safety Officers completed “safety walks” on a daily basis and were required to document any areas of concern.
	
	
	Freyssinet and all sub-contractors were required to have a supervisor on site to supervise its employees. The supervisor was required to provide a monthly safety report to the Safety Officers to indicate that the sub-contractors SWMS was up to date and to report on safety matters. In addition the supervisor was required to submit a weekly safety checklist, carry out weekly tool box talks, to attend weekly safety meetings with the Safety Officers and Mr Sykes and to carry out weekly supervision of a task referred to in the SWMS to verify that the relevant control measures were being followed.
	
	
	All contractors were also required to nominate a trained employee to be part of the Safety Committee, organised by the Safety Officers. The Safety Committee met weekly.
	
	
	The Safety Officers were required to report weekly to Mr Sykes.
	
	
	Mr Sykes deposed that the stairs were a completed part of the building that were being used by the Freyssinet employees on a daily basis to access lockers.
	
	
	The handrail in place at the time of the incident was a temporary one. The installation of a permanent handrail was a task covered by an SWMS. Mr Sykes accepted that the temporary handrail was installed by a labourer employed by the offender and that it should have had an intermediate rail.
	
	
	To avoid the situation occurring again the offender has purchased pre-formed temporary handrails to be used that have a mid rail and comply with the Standard. The cost associated with that was over $200,000.
	
	
	Prior to the incident, none of the workers at the site had reported to the offender the lack of an intermediate rail on the stairs.
	
	
	Mr Sykes’ review of the SWMS relating to the site revealed a heavy focus on the work activity. The Safety Officers were reminded of the need to assess the whole site and the SWMSs were updated.
	
	
	Mr Sykes has made enquiries of Freyssinet as to Mr Felemi’s progress. Money has been raised on a number of the offender’s sites to assist Mr Felemi and his family. Immediately following the incident the offender arranged for meals to be delivered to Mr Felemi’s family.
	
	
	Mr Sykes expressed distress that the absence of a simple control measure could have prevented serious injury to Mr Felemi.
	
	
	Exhibited to the affidavit were all of the documents that I have referred to. Of particular note were the safety reports of the Freyssinet supervisor. Those documents corroborated Mr Sykes’ evidence, but also identified safety concerns that were communicated to the offender by the employees of Freyssinet.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective Seriousness


	
	The risk of serious injury or death to a person using the stairs was obvious, but there was a handrail that did provide some fall protection. What it did not do was prevent a person falling underneath the top rail as a result of losing their footing. Clearly, the lack of an intermediate rail did not raise the concerns of workers using the stairs on a daily basis. Nevertheless the offender was on notice of the risk posed in general by inadequate edge protection.
	
	
	The likelihood of the risk occurring was moderate, although in reality it occurred once in the context of extensive use of the stairs by workers at the site. The workers came into contact with the risk regularly, probably in the order of 3 or 4 times per day when they accessed their lockers at the start of the day, at lunch time, at the end of the day and potentially at other times.
	
	
	There were simple and inexpensive measures available to avoid the risk. The existence of them was known to the offender and within its capacity to easily adopt.
	
	
	The gravity of the risk was significant and it included a risk of death.
	
	
	The offender had adopted a thorough multi-layered safety system. It failed in part because none of the employees of the offender nor the employees of the sub-contractors identified the risk posed by the stairs, despite the fact that they were all trained to identify and report any risks on site. The failure of the workers to identify the risk was a circumstance relating to the offence that should properly be regarded as a circumstance of mitigation in assessing objective seriousness: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The system also failed because the safe work practices focussed too much on the work performed on site and did not pay adequate attention to the dangers presented by the conditions of the site itself, in this limited regard.
	
	
	The breach arose primarily because an employee of the offender installed an inadequate temporary handrail that did not comply with the Standard.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offence is in the mid range.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	There is also a need for specific deterrence, however in this case it is reduced. The offender had taken extensive steps prior to the incident to comply with the requirements of its health and safety duty. After the incident, the offender took immediate steps to improve its systems. Specific deterrence remains relevant to the sentencing exercise because the offender continues to operate a business that is inherently dangerous to its employees and other persons who may be working at its sites.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The injury, emotional harm and loss caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Felemi’s injuries and the ongoing disabilities suffered by him are substantial.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The offender does not have any previous convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender has been in business since 2011. It carries out high risk construction work and has sub-contractors also carrying out that work at its sites on a daily basis.
	
	
	The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation: section 21A(3)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Prior to the incident the offender had substantial systems in place to identify risks to the safety of workers involved in its operations. The system was multi-layered and involved its own employees and the sub-contractors’ employees in identifying risks to safety. The offender’s response to the incident was swift and it has been extremely thorough. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender has accepted responsibility for its failings that led to the incident. Mr Sykes has expressed distress at the serious injury suffered by Mr Felemi. The offender has enquired as to Mr Felemi’s welfare and has allowed funds to be raised for him on a number of its sites. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty: section 21A(3)(k) and section 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall is the timing of the plea, so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. The appropriate discount is 25%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the SafeWork investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Finally, the offender’s moral culpability for the offence is reduced because whilst the system it adopted failed, it took extensive steps to comply with its health and safety duty. Its departure from the standard expected of a responsible and safe person conducting a business or undertaking was not substantial.
	


Penalty


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	I have taken into account the Victim Impact Statement of Mr Felemi. He continues to suffer pain and needs to take medication. He would like to return to work but cannot do so.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $180,000 that will be reduced by 25% to reflect the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $135,000.
	
	
	I order that pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that the offender pay the prosecutors costs as agreed in the sum of $27,000.

		31 March 2017",2017-03-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4276271,R v Fang (No. 4) [2017] NSWSC 323,"JUDGMENT


	
	JOHNSON J: The Offender, Zhen Fang, was found guilty by a jury on 23 November 2016 of the murder of Ting Huang (“the victim”) in Sydney between 31 August 2014 and 11 September 2014.
	
	
	The circumstances of this case reveal, in graphic terms, the devastating consequences flowing from the use of methylamphetamine (“Ice”) by members of the community. As will be seen, both the Offender and the victim were users of Ice and both were under the influence of Ice at the time when the Offender stabbed the victim to death. One man is dead and the other faces a lengthy term of imprisonment. Their families have been left to salvage what they can from the human wreckage left from these terrible events.
	
	
	The present task of the Court is to impose sentence upon the Offender for this crime. The maximum penalty for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life: s.19A(1) Crimes Act 1900. If the Court does not impose a life sentence, the Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term: s.21(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. A standard non-parole period of 20 years applies for the crime of murder: ss.54A-54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	It falls to me as the trial Judge to determine punishment, and for that purpose, to make findings of fact relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me for the purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378.
	
	
	The Court may not take facts into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of the Offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. If there are matters which the Offender relies upon in mitigation of penalty, it is for the Offender to prove those matters on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27].
	


Facts of the Offence


	
	What follows constitutes my findings of fact.
	
	
	The Offender was born in the People’s Republic of China in 1978. He came to Australia in the early 2000’s and worked in a self-employed capacity as a gyprocker. He married his wife in Australia and there are two daughters of the marriage born in 2002 and 2011. He is a permanent resident of Australia.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender encountered pressures in his life from a number of sources in the years leading up to 2013 - 2014. His wife had a miscarriage and, as a result of an associated medical procedure, she became infertile.
	
	
	The Offender’s mother, who lived in China, suffered serious injuries after being struck by a motor vehicle in about 2011. The Offender’s mother and father were both later diagnosed with cancer (T137).
	


The Offender Commences to Use Ice


	
	These circumstances had a significant effect on the Offender and provided the context in which he commenced to use Ice in 2013. He was, by that time, about 35 years old.
	
	
	The victim was born in 1988 in the People’s Republic of China. He was 25 years old at the time of his death. He came to Australia at the age of 22 years and found work as a gyprocker. Mr Huang married and a daughter was born of the marriage. He separated from his wife and daughter and he was badly affected by that development.
	
	
	The Offender met the victim through their employment. The victim was a user of Ice. Through his association with the victim, the Offender commenced to use Ice.
	
	
	The evidence of the Offender’s (by then) former wife at the trial indicated areas of concern with his behaviour in 2014 and the discovery in their Campsie home (by one of their daughters) of a bottle used by the Offender to smoke Ice (T127). She said that the Offender was a regular user of marijuana and Ice (T127). The Offender’s wife said that the he “hadn’t been normal for a period of time” before September 2014 and “was often not at home” (T127). She described mood changes in the Offender, stating that “he would fly into a rage quite often and that scared us a bit” (T137). After the discovery of the bottle used to smoke Ice, the wife threw the item away and this upset the Offender (T127). During 2014, the Offender lived downstairs in the house and she lived upstairs. At times, the Offender would talk “nonsense” (T139). The Offender’s wife told the Offender that he should see a psychiatrist but he would not do so (T136-137).
	


Events Between 6 and 10 September 2014


	
	The Offender and the victim were friends with Jian Feng Weng who lived in Kennedy Street, Guildford. The victim would occasionally stay with Mr Weng at the Guildford premises.
	
	
	On the evening of 6 September 2014, the Offender and the victim were together at Mr Weng’s house at Guildford. The Offender and the victim drank a number of bottles of beer between them at that house. Mr Weng was home at the time and, before he went to sleep, he heard a number of things happening as between the Offender and the victim.
	
	
	Each of the Offender and the victim smoked Ice that evening at the Guildford house. Judging from the high level of methylamphetamine discovered later in the victim’s body, I accept that both the Offender and the victim consumed a substantial amount of Ice that evening.
	
	
	At a point late on the evening of 6 September or in the early hours of 7 September 2014, Mr Weng heard the Offender and the victim arguing with each other. He overheard the Offender say to the victim “Why did you threaten me?”
	
	
	I accept that the Offender believed that, in the course of this argument, the victim said that he wished to kill the Offender’s family. At the trial, three psychiatrists gave evidence - Dr Yvonne Skinner (for the Crown) and Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Stephen Allnutt (for the Offender). The psychiatrists expressed the opinion that the Offender was experiencing a drug-induced psychosis at the time of the killing. Opinions were expressed that the Offender experienced a delusion at that time that the victim had threatened to kill the Offender’s family.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing, submissions were made as to what facts the Court should find in this respect. The question was whether such a threat was actually made by the victim or whether it was a delusion on the part of the Offender. On the state of the evidence, and noting that the Offender did not give evidence at the trial or on sentence, I am not able to make a finding either way as to whether a threat was actually made by the victim, or whether there was no threat but that the Offender was subject to a delusion that there was a threat.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Offender was under the influence of a substantial quantity of Ice which he had ingested that evening (together with some alcohol), and that he was significantly intoxicated at the time that he killed the victim. I am satisfied as well that the Offender’s longer term use of Ice affected his thought processes at that time, although the primary influence upon him at the time of the killing was the Ice which he had taken that evening whilst in company with the victim. I accept that the Offender was experiencing a drug induced psychosis at the time of the killing. The Offender was not suffering from any other psychiatric condition. There was no family history or personal history of mental illness and the difficulties he was experiencing flowed from his use of drugs and, in particular, Ice.
	
	
	It is possible that a threat was made by the victim (perhaps himself then experiencing a delusion). It is possible that the Offender, in a deluded state, believed that the victim had made a threat which had not, in fact, been made. It is possible that delusions were experienced by each of them and that their thought processes were affected at the time of the killing. Whatever scenario may be correct, I am satisfied that the Offender believed that the victim had threatened him and his family and that this belief played a part in the homicidal attack which followed. I am satisfied that the Offender was significantly under the influence of Ice at the time of the killing, so that his perception of events was distorted.
	
	
	I decline to find that the Offender was provoked by the victim for the purpose of s.21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. For reasons explained (at [18]-[21] above), I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the victim actually threatened the Offender.
	
	
	The Offender inflicted 20 stab wounds to the victim’s head, neck, trunk and upper extremities. The stabbing occurred at the Guildford premises of Mr Weng.
	
	
	After stabbing the victim to death, the Offender wrapped the victim’s body in a distinctive Chanel quilt, which he took from a bedroom at the Guildford house. He then carried the body wrapped in the quilt to the victim’s green Honda sedan which was parked at the front of the Guildford house. The Offender then drove the vehicle some 12 kms from Kennedy Street, Guildford to East Street, Lidcombe where he left the vehicle parked in the street next to Rookwood Cemetery.
	
	
	These acts of the Offender were purposeful and deliberate. They indicate that the Offender was sufficiently in control of his actions and thought processes that he was able to take these steps in an apparent attempt to remove the body from the Guildford house and conceal its location. This suggests that the Offender’s thought processes were not so disordered as to stand in the way of him taking these steps in his own interest.
	
	
	The Offender departed the scene and, at about 7am on 7 September 2014, he drove his wife’s motor vehicle in the Canterbury area, with the movement of the vehicle being detected by a speed camera.
	
	
	The Honda sedan (with the victim’s body in the boot) was not located until 21 September 2014, when a telephone call was received by police reporting that a vehicle had been abandoned in East Street Lidcombe for a number of weeks. It was only then that police attended and opened the vehicle, locating the body of the victim in the boot still wrapped in the Chanel quilt.
	
	
	In the days following 6 September 2014, members of Mr Huang’s family became increasingly concerned that they had not heard from him. Friends and family of the victim travelled to Sydney to help locate him but without success. Mr Huang’s sister accessed his social media accounts for this purpose. At one point, she spoke directly with the Offender but he told her he did not know where the victim was (Exhibit F).
	


The Offender Confesses to the Killing


	
	On the evening of 9 September 2014, the Offender was at his family home in Campsie. The next morning, the Offender told his wife not to go to work. He asked her to accompany him to their Church so that he could speak to the Pastor.
	
	
	On 10 September 2014, the Offender and his wife attended the Padstow Chinese Congregational Church, where they were members of the congregation. The Offender told Pastor Zheng Kui Yao that he had done something to a person, with his words being accompanied by a throat slitting gesture with his hand. The Offender told the Pastor that the person had “wanted to kill [my] whole family”. The Pastor advised the Offender to speak to the police. The Offender told the Pastor that his whole family were Christians and that he was worried that God would not forgive him. The Pastor advised the Offender that “if you concede your sin, God would forgive you for sure, but you have to face everything” (T51).
	
	
	The next day, 11 September 2014, the Offender and his wife attended the Campsie Police Station and spoke to Detective Sergeant Anthony Johnston. An interpreter was arranged and police had a conversation with the Offender.
	
	
	The Offender told police “I’ve killed someone”. When asked where this occurred, the Offender said “I can’t remember where exactly, last place, the man gave me a lot of Ice, drug”. The discussion continued with the Offender saying that he had driven to a place where there was “a lot of graveyards or cemetery”. He told police that he had used a knife to kill the person but was not able to give the name of the victim. When asked “Why have you killed him?”, the Offender said “I think he had threatened to kill the whole of my family. He thinks he is better than me, but I don’t know why”. The Offender said “That night I was so fearful, I had so much Ice, I am not really sure, I am not sure, I am getting punished”. The police officer asked “Do you use a lot of Ice?”. The Offender replied, “In the very first beginning I got a habit of smoking marijuana, he knew I smoked a lot of Ice especially when he gave me a lot of Ice to smoke”. Later in the conversation, Detective Sergeant Johnston asked “How do you know that is not a dream?”. The Offender interrupted and became angry saying “not a dream, that should not be a dream, mustn’t be a dream”. Detective Sergeant Johnson asked “Why?” and the Offender responded “Because I always fear for my wife and kids will be killed now. I don’t have that fear. I have a great fear for my parents that have cancer, but deep inside I know my family is safe”. Later in the conversation, the Offender told police that this occurred “somewhere near some graves”.
	
	
	During the course of the conversation, police became concerned that the Offender may be displaying signs of mental illness and formed the view that he should undertake a mental health assessment. Arrangements were made for the Offender to be taken by ambulance to St George Hospital. Following an assessment at the hospital, the Offender was found not to be suffering from a mental illness or mental disorder and he was released.
	
	
	Drug and alcohol testing was carried out on the Offender at the hospital which returned a negative result. Given that the killing likely occurred on the evening of 6 September or the early hours of 7 September 2014, the evidence of the psychiatrists at trial was that it was unsurprising that a negative result was returned if the Offender had not used further drugs between the time of the killing and the time of the testing. The evidence was that methylamphetamine has a short half-life and does not linger in the human system and would have likely been removed from the body after about 48 hours.
	


Events After the Police Interview


	
	At one point (probably after 11 September 2014), the Offender visited Mr Weng at his Guildford house and told him that he (the Offender) was in trouble. The Offender asked to borrow $5,000 from Mr Weng which the latter could not provide.
	
	
	On 18 September 2014, the Offender flew to China on a return ticket with a scheduled arrival back in Sydney on 29 October 2014.
	
	
	The Honda sedan was located on 21 September 2014 in East Street, Lidcombe with the victim’s body in the boot. Police established a crime scene. On 24 September 2014, police received information that the Honda sedan was connected, in some way, to Mr Weng’s Guildford premises. Police attended the Guildford premises and ascertained that the victim had recently resided there sporadically. Police then spoke to Mr Weng and were provided with additional information concerning the Offender and the victim.
	
	
	Following the discovery of the green Honda sedan and the victim’s body on 21 September 2014, the police investigation turned promptly to the Offender given the statements made by him on his visit to the Campsie Police Station on 11 September 2014. Contact was made with the Offender in China and he agreed to return to Sydney on 4 October 2014. After his aircraft landed that day, the Offender was arrested and cautioned.
	
	
	The Offender was taken to Mascot Police Station where he exercised his right to silence, but provided a DNA sample to investigating police. A conversation between the Offender and his family was covertly recorded by means of a surveillance device installed under warrant at Mascot Police Station. In that conversation the Offender told his family, amongst other things, “there’s a bad man who has threatened to kill our whole family, wants to kill the three of you. … so now daddy now trying hard to co-operate with the police …”.
	
	
	The Offender was charged with murder. Soon after, the Offender requested to participate in an electronic interview with police. The interview commenced but was stopped soon after at the request of the Offender who told police he had a headache.
	
	
	The Offender has been in custody since 4 October 2014.
	


Issues at the Trial


	
	The trial was conducted upon the basis that there was no issue that the Offender had killed the victim. I declined to leave the defence of mental illness to the jury for reasons explained in R v Fang (No. 3) [2017] NSWSC 28. Put shortly, I held that, in the absence of evidence of any other psychiatric condition, the existence of a drug induced psychosis did not constitute a “disease of the mind” for the purpose of the defence of mental illness. This finding was reinforced by evidence that the Offender was substantially intoxicated by his ingestion of Ice before the killing: R v Fang (No. 3) at [109]-[111].
	
	
	The issues at the trial concerned the question whether, because of the Offender’s intoxication, the Crown could prove the relevant mental element for murder to the criminal standard. The partial defence of substantial impairment was also left to the jury although the Offender always had difficulties on this issue given his admitted self-induced intoxication: s.23A(3) Crimes Act 1900. I am satisfied that the jury rejected the partial defence of substantial impairment because of the Offender’s self-induced intoxication, flowing from his ingestion of a significant quantity of Ice before the killing, which was a critical factor bearing upon his state of mind at the time of the killing: R v Fang (No. 3) at [32].
	


Some Unusual Features of the Case


	
	There are some unusual features surrounding this case.
	
	
	The Offender came forward to his pastor on 10 September 2014, and then to the police the next day, to confess that he had killed a person. At that time, the victim’s body had not been located. Aspects of what the Offender told police were clearly correct, including the fact that a knife had been used to kill the victim and that a location near a cemetery was relevant to the case.
	
	
	As it happens, the police did not regard what was being said as being sufficiently reliable to detain the Offender at that time, let alone charge him with any offence. The Offender was released after a medical assessment at St George Hospital had not identified any mental illness or mental disorder.
	
	
	It is the case that the Offender left Australia a week later to travel to China. However, he did so by way of a return airline ticket. Further, the Offender returned to Australia early, at the request of police, arriving on 4 October 2014. I accept that the Offender’s journey to China reflected his desire to visit his sick parents. It is not the case that he was seeking to leave the jurisdiction to evade police investigation of this matter.
	
	
	Upon returning to Australia, the Offender was arrested and has remained in custody since.
	
	
	The Offender’s statements to police concerning his use of Ice, and that of the victim’s use of Ice, should be accepted. The Offender’s former wife gave evidence of his drug use and her concerns with respect to it. In addition, a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine was located in the victim’s body. There is a range of evidence from different sources which supports the Offender’s assertion that he carried out this crime whilst under the influence of Ice.
	
	
	The evidence does not point to any other more sinister motive or explanation for the killing. Indeed, the fact that the Offender came forward to police soon after the killing, and before the body was discovered, tends to support his account as to the circumstances of the offence, even after due allowance is made for his muddled and clouded thinking which I accept was the result of his substantial drug use.
	
	
	I have found that the Offender, after the killing, transported the body of the victim by vehicle to the vicinity of the Rookwood Cemetery. The Offender was sufficiently in control of his actions and thought processes that he was able to take these purposeful steps after the killing, apparently in an attempt to (at least) remove the body from the Guildford premises and to conceal its location. Having done so, however, the Offender provided information to police a few days later which pointed to the location of the vehicle near a cemetery. This is a further unusual feature of the case.
	


The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	I have already mentioned aspects of the Offender’s personal history.
	
	
	The Offender has a prior criminal history. In 2008, offences of resisting a police officer in the execution of duty and failing to leave licenced premises were dismissed under s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In 2010, the Offender was placed on a s 10 Bond and was fined for driving whilst disqualified and fraudulently altering a licence. In November 2010, the Offender was ordered to perform 450 hours community service for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was placed on a two year good behaviour bond for an offence of affray.
	
	
	The Offender has drink driving offences as well in 2010 and 2012 for which he was fined and disqualified.
	
	
	The criminal history suggests that the Offender has had issues in the past related to excessive alcohol use.
	
	
	Evidence was adduced at the sentencing hearing in the form of statements from the Offender’s father in China and from persons who knew the Offender and had been involved with him in church activities in China. I accept that the Offender has been a member of a Christian Church both in China and in Australia, with support for this being demonstrated by his confession on 10 September 2014 to the Pastor of his Church at Padstow. The Offender’s mother died in China in January 2016.
	
	
	The Court was informed that the Offender is no longer married to his wife. Tendered at the sentencing hearing was a poignant handwritten letter from the Offender’s then 15 year old daughter (Exhibit 2). She described her father as being, in the past, “a timid and a caring person” who “always cared for the family”. The daughter stated that “everything was fine until three years ago” when the Offender stopped working and did not come home. She observed a glass bottle under the sofa and showed it to her mother who was concerned by it (see [13] above).
	
	
	The daughter then described, in her own way, how she learned of her father’s drug use:
	


“During that period of time, I realized my dad was very moody just like the weather in Melbourne. Very deep in my mind was that one day when my dad got home he putted [sic] all his anger on me. I felt scard [sic] and my heart was broken because he never did that on me. My mum hugged me and told me he was a drug user. Suddenly I understand why dad’s behaviour has changed.”


	
	The young lady continued explaining that she “was proud of [her father] before” but now she “felt ashamed’. She expressed her strong belief that, without drugs, her father was “a good person”.
	
	
	A report of Dr Nielssen dated 1 February 2017 was tendered at the sentencing hearing which supplemented his earlier report and evidence.
	
	
	I accept that the Offender was a hard working family man before he commenced to use Ice, with that use culminating in his commission of murder. His prospects of rehabilitation appear good, with some support for this finding in the report of Dr Nielssen. His risk of re-offending is not great given his likely future abstinence from prohibited drugs. In making these findings, I have kept in mind the level of uncertainty which operates with respect to a risk assessment made years before any prospect of release given the length of any sentence to be imposed for murder.
	


Victim Impact Statements


	
	A joint victim impact statement was made at the sentencing hearing by the mother and father of Mr Huang, Ai Qin Chen and Zugeng Huang. They recounted the fears and worries which they had when it was reported to them that their son had gone missing in September 2014. The receipt of the devastating news that he was dead had a great impact upon each of them. The consequences of that news, and the great distress which each of them experiences, was apparent at the sentencing hearing. I accept that there are long standing, indeed permanent adverse effects upon Mr Huang’s parents resulting from his death.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing, I expressed the condolences of the Court and the Australian community to Mr Huang’s parents for the loss of their son. It is important that the Court repeat that expression of condolences in the reasons of the Court.
	
	
	It was accepted by the Crown and senior counsel for the Offender that the Court should have regard to the victim impact statement under s.28(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as an aspect of harm done to the community, and I have done so.
	


Contrition, Remorse and Facilitating the Course of Justice


	
	I am satisfied that the Offender manifested contrition and remorse for his crime from a very early stage. Within days of the killing, the Offender presented himself voluntarily first to his pastor and then to the police, to tell them what he had done. This information was provided at a time when the victim’s body had not been located and, as far as the police were concerned, when it was not at all clear that the Offender had committed any crime. After travelling to China, the Offender returned voluntarily to Australia at the request of police, effectively surrendering himself into custody.
	
	
	In these circumstances, senior counsel for the Offender submitted that the Court should take into account, in favour of the Offender, his actions in disclosing the offence in accordance with the principles in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. In the unusual circumstances of this case (see [44]-[51] above), I accept that the Offender is entitled to have this conduct taken into account in his favour on sentence.
	
	
	However, this is not a case where the crime would not have come to light at all except for the Offender’s disclosure. I am satisfied that the discovery of the victim’s body in the vehicle at Lidcombe, and the associated forensic evidence, would have led police ultimately to the Offender. This was especially likely when police learned of Mr Weng and the connection of his Guildford premises to both the Offender and the victim. That said, the Offender’s early confession to the killing, which was corroborated in a number of respects by evidence found in the vehicle at Lidcombe and in the Guildford premises, served the policy of the criminal law to encourage a person to come forward and disclose both the fact of the killing and the Offender’s role as the killer: R v Ellis at 604. At the same time, it should be kept in mind that the Offender did not plead guilty and went to trial on the charge of murder. It was not submitted for the Offender that s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was engaged in this case so that a quantified discount should be extended to the Offender: CMB v Attorney General for NSW [2015] HCA 9; 256 CLR 346. This was understandable given that it was very likely that the Offender would have been detected and prosecuted for murder even if he had not come forward to police as he did.
	
	
	As the Offender went to trial on the charge of murder, he is not entitled to any discount which would have flowed from a plea of guilty.
	
	
	The trial was conducted efficiently on behalf of the Offender. As I have noted earlier (at [42]-[43]), the trial was confined to limited issues with a range of admissions being made by the Offender at the trial. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the Offender should have the benefit of a favourable finding for his pre-trial disclosure and his facilitation of the administration of justice for the purpose of s.21A(3)(e) and s.22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In forming this view, I have kept in mind that s.21A(3)(e) and s.22A are not intended simply to reward the defence where it has complied with a mandated disclosure requirement. However, co-operation encompassed by these provisions extends to admissions, disclosures made before or during the trial or limiting the facts in issue in the trial, thereby reducing the number of witnesses to be called. All of these things occurred in this case.
	


Relevance on Sentence of the Offender’s Intoxication and the Role of Addiction and Drug Induced Psychosis


	
	The Offender had been using Ice for some months prior to the killing. There was some general evidence from the psychiatrists concerning the nature of Ice. Dr Allnutt said that “methylamphetamines are particularly nasty drugs and tend to be more likely to cause a psychosis than many of the other drugs” (T272). Dr Skinner described Ice as being “very addictive” (T213). This evidence accords with the experience of sentencing courts where Ice use features regularly in the commission of serious crimes, particularly of violence: Haddara v R [2016] VSCA 168 at [49]. Concern about Ice in New South Wales is illustrated by the halving of the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, for the purpose of supply offences, by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Amendment (Methylamphetamine) Regulation 2015.
	
	
	Competing submissions were made concerning the relevance of the Offender’s intoxication, addiction and drug induced psychosis on sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the self-induced intoxication of the Offender at the time of the offence was not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence: s.21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Senior Counsel for the Offender referred to the origin of this provision (arising from one punch killings in Kings Cross) and submitted that the section was in reality directed to alcohol induced violence so that the Court should not invoke the provision on sentence in a case such as this.
	
	
	I am satisfied that s.21A(5AA) has application to the present case. The term “self-induced intoxication” is defined in s.21A(6) as having the same meaning as in Part 11A Crimes Act 1900. For that purpose, the term “intoxication” is defined as meaning intoxication because of the influence of alcohol, a drug or any other substance: s.428A Crimes Act 1900. The word “drug” is defined in s.428A as including a drug within the meaning of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Although the statutory origin of s.21A(5AA) may be found in events surrounding one punch attacks in the Kings Cross area in 2012 and 2013, it is clear that the provision itself is intended to cover self-induced intoxication whether by way of alcohol or a prohibited drug such as Ice. It has been said that s.21A(5AA) reflects largely the law as it stood before the enactment of that provision so that self-induced intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs, did not operate to mitigate penalty: R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120; 243 A Crim R 31 at 59 [220].
	
	
	The classification of a “disease of the mind”, for the purpose of the defence of mental illness, involves a legal question with a medical dimension: R v Fang (No. 3) at [62]-[63]. The defence of mental illness operates within relatively narrow parameters: R v Fang (No. 3) at [107]. A broader range of mental conditons may be taken into account on sentence: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]-[178]. Where the relevant mental condition arises, as in this case, from the person’s use of drugs and the person’s intoxication by use of a drug shortly before the commission of the offence, s.21A(5AA) has application together with the principles emerging from a number of cases to which I now turn.
	
	
	Submissions were made on the question whether the Offender had awareness (at the time of the killing) that his use of Ice might lead to an act of violence directed to another person. A number of sentencing decisions (where a serious crime has been committed at the time of a drug induced psychosis) have indicated that an enquiry of that type is relevant on sentence: R v Gagalowicz [2005] NSWCCA 452 at [36]; R v Martin [2007] VSCA 291; 20 VR 14 at 19-20 [20]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Arvanitidis [2008] VSCA 189; 202 A Crim R 300 at 310-314 [30]-[48]; Butler v State of Western Australia [2010] WASCA 104 at [8], [54]ff; Smith v State of Western Australia [2010] WASCA 176 at [69]; R v Gibson [2016] VSC 634 at [94]ff.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the Offender appreciated that his use of Ice might lead to an act of violence, and certainly not homicidal violence. The evidence indicates behavioural changes which had been observed by members of his family, including outbursts of rage by him directed to family members (see [13] and [58] above). There is no sworn account from the Offender before the Court either at the trial or on sentence. If the Offender sought a favourable finding on this issue, it was for him to persuade the Court that he did not know, and could not have anticipated, what the effects of his ingestion of Ice might be: Mune v R [2011] VSCA 231 at [32].
	
	
	Having considered the evidence which bears on this issue, I approach the sentencing of the Offender upon the basis that there is no evidence that he had prior knowledge that his use of Ice would lead to an act of violence on his part towards another person, although he was aware that his use of Ice had given rise to behavioural changes in him, including altered though processes and rage directed to family members. It is necessary to keep in mind as well that the Offender had been using Ice for some months. He was about 35 years old and was not an inexperienced youth. He did not act upon his wife’s sensible advice that he should seek medical assistance. Further, the Offender appears (from his criminal history) to have had past issues with alcohol use. These aspects do not help the Offender on sentence.
	
	
	Although the Offender was aware that his use of Ice could result in adverse behavioural changes (including altered thought processes and rage), there is no evidence that he appreciated at the time of the killing that his Ice use might lead to an act of violence against another person. However, this finding does not mitigate the Offender’s culpability for the killing. If the Offender realised that one of the effects of his Ice use might have been that he would act violently towards another person, this would have been a matter of serious aggravation: R v Gagalowicz at [36]; R v Martin at 22 [28]-[30]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Arvanitidis at 308-311 [24]-[35].
	
	
	The fact that the Offender had developed an addiction to Ice is a relevant factor on sentence but is not, of itself, a mitigating circumstance: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at 381-386 [171]-[208]. The Offender had a choice whether to commence his use of Ice: R v Henry at 395 [257]. His decision to persist with drug use, rather than to seek assistance as advised by his wife, also involved a matter of choice: R v Henry at 385 [201]. The Offender was not a young and immature person with limited experience of life.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Offender’s state of self-induced intoxication does not operate to mitigate the circumstances of the offence itself. However, the fact that the Offender had commenced to use prohibited drugs in circumstances of personal stress provides assistance to the Offender’s subjective case on sentence, in combination with the favourable findings which I have made with respect to his contrition and remorse, his facilitation of the course of justice and his favourable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I am satisfied that general deterrence remains a factor to be taken into account on sentence in this case. The sentence in this case should serve as a warning to the general community, if a further warning was really needed, of the disastrous consequences flowing from the use of Ice and the serious acts of violence which may be undertaken by persons whilst under its influence including, in this case, murder.
	


Determining an Appropriate Sentence


	
	It is necessary to draw together the various objective and subjective factors relevant to sentence, as well as the sentencing principles to be applied in sentencing the Offender.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, for the purpose of consideration of the standard non-parole period, that the objective seriousness of this offence lay at the mid-range of objective seriousness. Bearing in mind the confines of this assessment, I accept the Crown’s submission that this was a mid-range offence. This was a frenzied knife attack (involving the infliction of 20 wounds) carried out upon the victim with a clear intention to kill.
	
	
	I have kept in mind the circumstances in which the offence occurred. The Offender’s thought processes were affected by his use of Ice, although he retained the capacity to perform purposeful acts after the murder, including the transporting of the body some distance by vehicle to a different suburb.
	
	
	The Offender has a limited criminal history for offences of violence and the evidence indicates more generally that, before he commenced to use Ice, he was a hard working family man. The Offender was subject to considerable personal and family pressures which serve to explain how he came to make the fateful decision to use Ice. I have made a number of favourable findings with respect to the Offender’s subjective circumstances, his prospects of rehabilitation and his prospects of avoiding re-offending. I have also taken into account the Offender’s substantial remorse, reflected in his early confessions to having committed the killing and his facilitation of the course of justice.
	
	
	Drawing together these various factors in the required process of instinctive synthesis, I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment for 19 years should be imposed. I make a limited finding of special circumstances so that the non-parole period will be fixed at 14 years. I am satisfied that a non-parole period of 14 years constitutes the minimum term of imprisonment which the Offender should serve having regard to the objective and subjective factors relevant to sentence and all other sentencing principles to be taken into account. The parole period component to be incorporated in the sentence will provide ample opportunity, by way of conditional liberty, in the event that the Offender is released to parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The sentence will date from 4 October 2014, the date upon which the Offender went into custody.
	
	
	As the Offender is convicted of a “serious violence offence”, it is a requirement that he be warned of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006. I ask the Offender’s solicitor to undertake this task on the Court’s behalf.
	
	
	Will the Offender please stand? Zhen Fang, following the verdict of the jury on 23 November 2016, you were convicted by the Court of the crime of murder of Ting Huang. For that crime, I sentence you to imprisonment for 19 years comprising a non-parole period of 14 years commencing on 4 October 2014 and expiring on 3 October 2028, with a balance of term of 5 years commencing on 4 October 2028 and expiring on 3 October 2033.

4276278,Lin v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2017] NSWSC 312,"Judgment


	
	This judgment concerns an application for bail. The Applicant for bail, Xu Lin, presently faces four charges under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) concerning the importation and possession of a commercial quantity of methyl amphetamine. As I will explain, two of those charges are about to be withdrawn by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the “CDPP”). The bail application only concerns the two remaining charges.
	
	
	The remaining charges that Mr Lin faces are “show cause” offences for the purposes of Division 1A of the Bail Act 2013 (s 16B(1)(g)). Accordingly, Mr Lin must show cause as to why his detention pending trial is not justified (s 16A (1)). If he establishes cause, then the Court must assess whether there are any “bail concerns” in relation to the release of Mr Lin (s 17). In Mr Lin’s case the bail concerns raised by the CDPP are that, if he is released from custody, he will fail to appear at any proceedings and will commit a serious crime (s 17(2) (a) and (b)). Subsection 18(1) of the Bail Act specifies the matters this Court is to consider in undertaking an assessment of bail concerns. If the Court determines that there is an unacceptable risk of a bail concern materialising that cannot be mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions, then bail must be refused (s 19(1)).
	
	
	A consideration of whether cause has been shown is to be undertaken separately from a consideration of bail concerns and whether there is an unacceptable risk. The two steps should not be conflated (Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83 at [25]; “Tikomaimaleya”). However “matters that are relevant to the unacceptable risk test will also be relevant to the show cause test and that, if there is nothing else that appears to the bail authority to be relevant to either test, the consideration of the show cause requirement will, if resolved in favour of the accused person, necessarily resolve the unacceptable risk test in his or her favour as well” (Tikomaimaleya at [24]). Nevertheless, there are instances where cause may be shown but bail is nevertheless refused (Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tony Mawad [2015] NSWCCA 227; “Mawad”).
	
	
	Before I address whether Mr Lin has shown cause and, if so, whether his release on bail would present an unacceptable risk of a bail concern materialising, it is first necessary to outline the CDPP’s case against him, the history of the proceedings and the evidence provided in support of this application.
	


Background Facts


	
	The following facts are taken from a detailed statement of facts prepared by the Australian Federal Police (the “AFP facts”). The AFP facts includes extracts from intercepted communications.
	
	
	In early January 2016, three freight containers arrived in Sydney. One of the containers (consignment 1), contained 120 bar stools. Within 110 of those bar stools there was discovered just over 91kgs of methyl amphetamine. The second container contained a further 70 bar stools (consignment 2). Secreted inside those bar stools was just under 56kgs of methyl amphetamine. The third container included 15 boxes containing packets labelled as soup powder. Within each of those packets were clear plastic sachets. In total the sachets contained 323kgs of ephedrine.
	
	
	On or about 13 January 2016, Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) officers removed the drugs from the consignments and substituted rock salt. From that time, the AFP commenced surveillance of a number of persons who were associated with the importation including Ming Ling Li (“Li”) and Evan Wong (“Wong”). Intercepted conversations suggested that the intended recipient of the 70 bar stools from consignment 2 was someone they referred to as “the tall guy”.
	
	
	On about 21 January 2016, both Li and Wong were arrested. After his arrest, Wong agreed to participate in a controlled operation whereby two bar stools from consignment 2 would be delivered to “the tall guy”. According to the AFP facts, at about 3:27pm on 21 January 2016, Wong used an encrypted telecommunication program to communicate with a person the CDPP contends was Mr Lin. He arranged to meet this person at a hotel at 8:00pm that evening. The AFP facts record that this person indicated he would take delivery of the remaining 68 stools from consignment 2 the following day or over the weekend.
	
	
	At around 8:00pm on 21 January 2016, Wong and the two bar stools in boxes were conveyed to the hotel by AFP officers. Mr Lin did not attend at 8:00pm. Instead, after some further telephone calls, he arrived at 9:00pm as a passenger in a white SUV motor vehicle. Mr Lin alighted from the vehicle and met Wong. Their conversation was recorded. According to the AFP facts, Wong, Mr Lin and the person who drove the SUV vehicle, transferred the two cardboard boxes containing the two stools into the SUV.
	
	
	The AFP facts stated that Mr Lin was recorded as stating that “the rest will be fixed on the weekend”. The CDPP contends this is a reference to the collection of the remaining 68 stools. Mr Lin is also said to have stated that “I am thinking of taking all of them out” which the CDPP contends is a reference to cutting the stools and removing the methyl amphetamine. The AFP facts also refer to the following exchange:
	


“WONG:   Did you talk to him about raising the price?

Lin:      Price? yes.

WONG:   Now they are willing to give you over 7 something …

…

WONG:   It is quite okay to earn over six to seven. Isn’t the market price $80,000?


	
	The CDPP contends that this is a reference to the market price of methyl amphetamine (and not stools).
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Lin, Mr Korn, indicated that his client’s case was that he was not “the tall guy” referred to in the various exchanges between Wong, Li and others. He also pointed to part of a recorded conversation between Wong and Li on 19 January 2016 in which Li stated “I think the tall guy is not the boss, just working for the boss” and Wong replied that the “tall guy” is “in the middle” and “not the boss”. Mr Korn submitted that this indicated that, even if it was established beyond reasonable doubt that his client was the “tall guy” and was aware that within the stools there was methyl amphetamine, his role was not that of a principal in the importation or distribution process.
	
	
	Even having regard to the limited material that is available on this application, I accept that there is a reasonably strong evidentiary basis for the CDPP’s assertion that Mr Lin took possession of two stools knowing they contained methyl amphetamine and was intending to make arrangements to collect the remaining 68 stools. At this stage it appears that a substantial part of the Crown case will depend upon the evidence of Wong. However, the extracts from the recorded discussions between Wong and Mr Lin set out in the AFP facts appear to implicate Mr Lin.
	


Bail History and Time to Trial


	
	After he met Wong on 21 January 2016, Mr Lin was arrested. He was charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug that had been unlawfully imported (Criminal Code, s 307.5 and s 11.1). The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment. The substance the subject of that charge was the approximately 1.284kg of methyl amphetamine contained within the two stools that were loaded into the SUV vehicle.
	
	
	Mr Lin applied for and was granted bail. The CDPP did not oppose bail. The bail conditions included a night curfew, a daily reporting condition, and also requirements that he surrender his passport, not approach points of international departure and that two persons provide surety in an amount of $12,000.
	
	
	On this application, the solicitor for Mr Lin, Mr Chan, swore an affidavit saying that, just after Mr Lin was charged, he received a copy of the facts sheet for the offence charged. He said that it included extracts from transcripts of conversations indicating that the “tall guy” was the intended recipient of all 70 stools in consignment 2. Mr Chan stated that he had a conference with Mr Lin on 27 January 2016. He told Mr Lin that he expected Wong would provide a statement to police and allege that Mr Lin was the intended recipient of all 70 stools. He said he made Mr Lin aware of the real likelihood that the existing charges against him would be upgraded to include the methyl amphetamine found within the remaining 68 stools.
	
	
	On 9 June 2016, Mr Chan filed and served a subpoena upon the AFP which sought production of interviews or statements made by Wong. The subpoena was returnable at Central Local Court on 29 June 2016.
	
	
	However, on 28 June 2016, Mr Lin was arrested and charged with two further offences which related to the events prior to his arrest in January 2016. In particular, he was charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug which was reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully imported (Criminal Code, s 307.8(1), s 11.2A and s 11.1). This charge related to the methyl amphetamine contained within all 70 stools. He was also charged with attempting to import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely methyl amphetamine (Criminal Code, s 307.1(1), s 11.2A and s 11.1). This charge also related to all the methyl amphetamine found within the 70 stools. The maximum penalty for both offences is life imprisonment.
	
	
	On 29 June 2016 Mr Lin was refused bail on these charges. He has been in custody since that time. It is not disputed that he complied with all his bail conditions between 21 January 2016 and 28 June 2016. On 29 June 2016, the CDPP withdrew the charge that had been laid on 21 January 2016.
	
	
	On 8 July 2016, Mr Lin made a release application to the Local Court. It was refused. On 24 August 2016, he made a further release application which was also refused.
	
	
	On 22 September 2016, in this Court, Wilson J denied Mr Lin’s application for bail in relation to the two charges that had been laid on 28 June 2016. Her Honour was not satisfied that cause had been shown.
	
	
	On 12 December 2016, two different charges were laid against Mr Lin. The first was the same charge that had been laid on 21 January 2016 and then withdrawn in June 2016, namely, attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug that was unlawfully imported, being the methyl amphetamine contained within the two stools loaded into the SUV on 21 January 2016. The second charge alleged that Mr Lin conspired with Wong and others to possess a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug that was unlawfully imported, namely methyl amphetamine (Criminal Code, s 307.5(1) and s 11.5(1)). Again, the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. This charge related to the entirety of the methyl amphetamine found within the 70 stools.
	
	
	On this application the CDPP advised this Court that the two charges laid on 28 June 2016 would be withdrawn on the next occasion that the matter was before the Local Court. Thus, this bail application only concerns the charges laid on 12 December 2016. A detention application in relation to those charges was heard in the Local Court on 21 March 2017. Bail was refused. The refusal of that application enables this Court to hear this release application (Bail Act, s 66(1)). Further, s 74 of the Bail Act is not engaged by the decision of Wilson J on 22 September 2016 as this application does not concern the “same offence(s)” as those considered by her Honour.
	
	
	Mr Lin’s committal hearing was initially listed for hearing on 5 April 2017. Mr Wong is due to be called to give oral evidence at that hearing (Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 91). However, as events have transpired, Mr Wong is due to be sentenced in the District Court on 5 April 2017. As a consequence, the parties will be applying to vacate the hearing date for the committal proceedings. They expect to obtain another committal hearing within two to three months of 5 April 2017.
	
	
	Mr Korn estimated that the trial would occupy four weeks. The solicitor for the CDPP accepted that as an accurate estimate. Mr Korn submitted that it was not likely that his client would obtain a trial date in the District Court before April or May 2018. I accept that estimate. In the end result the applicant has served some nine months in pre-trial custody. If he is refused bail, he can expect to serve another 12 to 14 months in custody before his trial.
	


Electronic Monitoring and the AFP


	
	One part of Mr Lin’s bail proposal is that he is willing to submit himself to, and pay for, a system of electronic monitoring. To that end, two affidavits were sworn by Mr Philip Schluter, the Business Development Manager of 3 M Australia Pty Ltd (“3M”), an electronic monitoring company.
	
	
	In his first affidavit sworn 28 February 2017, Mr Schluter explained that in 2010 and 2012, 3M acquired an electronic monitoring business previously conducted by two other companies, Elmotech and Abakus. Mr Schluter stated that 3M’s technology is used to monitor, throughout Australia, persons on bail, home detention, work release, parole and extended supervision orders. In relation to bail, Mr Schluter stated that 3M monitors clients charged with both State and Commonwealth offences.
	
	
	Mr Schluter also stated that, if a person is subject to a bail condition that requires electronic monitoring, the monitoring equipment is fitted to the person in the reception area of the relevant prison or remand centre prior to their release. A device is fitted to the monitored person’s ankle or wrist. This device makes radio contact with what is effectively a modified mobile phone carried by the monitored person. That device then transmits data about the person’s location and movements to 3M who in turn provides information to a designated police officer.
	
	
	In his first affidavit, Mr Schluter recorded his understanding that Mr Lin’s bail proposal involved him being subject to a curfew and not approaching international points of departure. Mr Schluter explained that 3M’s system can specify “inclusion zones” being areas that the person monitored must stay within, including by reference to a time period, as well as “exclusion zones” such as zones around airports, sea ports and marine facilities.
	
	
	Mr Schluter explained that, if no violation event has occurred, the unit fitted to the monitored person would report on a predetermined schedule which is currently set at every thirty minutes. He also stated that, if a violation event such as tampering with the monitoring equipment or the movement out of an inclusion zone occurred, then 3M would receive an immediate notification and in turn the nominated police officer would receive an email or an SMS message within twenty seconds. Mr Schluter explained that 3M would provide comprehensive briefings to the nominated responsible officer and that officer would receive a daily report of the person’s movement and compliance with bail conditions.
	
	
	In his second affidavit sworn 21 March 2017, Mr Schluter explained that, if no reception was available, the device would not transmit. He also stated that, if the device remains out of reception for an extended period, currently set at ninety minutes, then an alert will be generated. Mr Schluter stated that two hundred people in Australia were currently being monitored by 3M. Thirteen of these persons are in New South Wales. They are all on bail.
	
	
	In relation to the AFP, Mr Schluter stated as follows:
	


“The AFP works with 3M on many levels and across a great spectrum of products and applications. Specifically for [electronic monitoring] we currently have no direct commercial relationship with the AFP in that we are not contracted by the AFP to supply support or otherwise provide [electronic monitoring] products or services to the AFP. However 3M currently monitors bail clients and sends alerts and daily reports to officers employed by the AFP which would indicate there is a working relationship albeit non-commercial.”


	
	Mr Schluter’s evidence was not challenged on this application.
	
	
	In R v Ebrahimi [2015] NSWSC 335 at [33] (“Ebrahimi”), I rejected a submission that electronic monitoring should not be considered as part of a bail proposal because the Bail Act 2013 did not provide a mechanism for imposing obligations on third parties such as 3M. I noted that the scheme of the Bail Act contemplated that, in some circumstances, the Court would make an assessment as to the willingness and capacity of third parties to provide some form of supervision of persons on parole, the most obvious example of which are residential rehabilitation centres (id). I held that there was nothing in the Bail Act that precluded the Court from finding “that persons providing electronic monitoring systems are both honest and have a capacity to provide some degree of comfort as to the whereabouts of an applicant for bail and their compliance with bail conditions” (at [33]). These aspects of Ebrahimi were accepted by Hamill J in R v Xi [2015] NSWSC 1575 at [41] (“Xi”).
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Zaiter [2016] NSWCCA 247 at [30] to [33] (“Zaiter”), RA Hulme J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Wilson J agreed), noted that decisions of first-instance judges of this Court concerning bail applications published on caselaw have no greater precedent value than any other judgments at first instance. His Honour also stated that discretionary value judgments made in first instance judgments on bail applications do not establish any precedent as the doctrine of precedent is confined to decisions on points of law only (at [32] to [33]). Those observations apply with equal force to bail decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, including the outcome in Zaiter itself. Thus, for example, in Zaiter it was found that the likely period of pre-trial custody in that case was not sufficient to demonstrate that cause had been shown (see [41] to [44] and [55]). Zaiter is not authority for the proposition that the likelihood that an accused person will face an extended period in custody prior to trial could never constitute cause. However, the rejection in Ebrahimi of the proposition that the Bail Act does not contemplate that consideration be given to the willingness and capacity of third persons to monitor bail conditions, was a finding on a matter of law and therefore has precedent value.
	
	
	In considering this application, I will proceed on the basis that 3M is both willing and capable of providing a system of electronic monitoring consistent with what Mr Schluter stated in his affidavits. Nevertheless, I am not proceeding on the basis that any such system is foolproof. There are technological constraints including difficulties in obtaining a signal in tunnels and buildings. Further, as I stated in Ebrahimi (at [34]) “if a person on bail was determined to abscond and had the means to arrange it, then the delay between the notification of any violation event … and action being taken by the relevant members of the police force to apprehend them is such that they might be able to leave the jurisdiction” in the meantime.
	
	
	The CDPP read an affidavit from Michael Sheehan, a commander of the AFP, outlining the AFP’s objection to the use of electronic monitoring. Mr Sheehan stated that should Mr Lin be released on bail and subject to a condition of electronic monitoring, the AFP would have to rely on 3M, a private company, for information concerning Mr Lin’s compliance with his bail conditions. I have already addressed that concern above (at [34] to [36]).
	
	
	Mr Sheehan also asserts that the AFP does not have the “capacity” to nominate AFP members to carry responsibility for monitoring data from electronic monitoring devices and, even if it did, the persons so nominated might be reassigned to other duties, or go on leave. Further, Mr Sheehan stated:
	


“…if Mr Lin was released subject to [electronic monitoring conditions], the AFP would need to redirect members from other tasks for the purpose of monitoring the [3M device] and responding to genuine alleged breaches and temporary malfunctions. If the AFP were to redirect its resources it would have fewer members available to respond to referrals conduct investigations and prepare briefs for trial. If it were not possible to redirect resources and those competing demands the AFP might not be in a position to respond immediately to a notified breach.

The AFP does not have a general duties policing function in New South Wales nor a local area command structure such as the New South Wales Police Force operates. In NSW the AFP’s physical resources are primarily concentrated at its Sydney office headquarters. As the AFP does not have a wide spread physical presence in NSW it cannot guarantee a prompt response to suspected contraventions of bail conditions even when notified. This increases the risk that Mr Lin would have the chance to leave the jurisdiction before the AFP could respond to an apparent violation.”


	
	I do not accept that these assertions should carry any weight on this application.
	
	
	A contention that a different approach should be adopted to bail applications in respect of federal offences compared to state offences because of limitations on the resources available to the AFP is inconsistent with the statutory scheme governing this application. Subsection 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provides, inter alia, that the “laws” of New South Wales “respecting ... the procedure for ... holding accused persons to bail” are applicable to persons charged with federal offences in this State. That provision also confers jurisdiction on the courts of this State to hear and determine bail applications for persons charged with federal offences. In enacting that provision, the Commonwealth Parliament made a deliberate choice to invoke the statutory regime for bail in New South Wales that is in force from time to time when prosecutions are pending in New South Wales courts for a Federal offence. Save where express provision is made by Commonwealth legislation (see for example, Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 15AA(1)), it follows that the CDPP and the AFP stand in no different position to any State prosecuting or investigatory body invoking those provisions. To accept the contention that the AFP does not have the resources to allocate someone to receive information about the electronic monitoring of an offender, in circumstances where the State police can do so, would result in persons charged with Federal offences in this State not receiving equal treatment under the law. In such circumstances a person charged with a State offence that is equivalent to the Federal offence could be released on bail and subject to electronic monitoring whereas a person charged with a comparable Federal offence would not, even though their circumstances were not relevantly different and both bail decisions were being made under the same legislative provisions.
	
	
	Further, the assertion that to impose the burden of receiving data from electronic monitoring would redirect resources from “competing demands” of the AFP fails to appreciate that monitoring compliance with bail conditions is part of the obligations that an investigative body assumes when it causes charges to be laid in this State. Every day, bail conditions are specified that impose costs and burdens on police forces, such as reporting and curfew requirements. Presumably those costs are lower than the marginal cost incurred by the State in incarcerating a person who is refused bail but they are nevertheless resources that could be allocated elsewhere. To state that the imposition of electronic monitoring conditions means that police resources have to be allocated differently than if the person had been detained in custody, only begs the question as to why the contingency of dealing with electronic monitoring was not considered in the first place.
	
	
	The judgment in Ebrahimi was published two years ago and concerned a Federal offence. At least as far back as 2010 bail decisions of this Court included conditions providing for electronic monitoring (see Xi at [35]). Thus for a long period the AFP and the CDPP have been on notice of the possibility that bail conditions could extend to electronic monitoring. The AFP has had more than sufficient time to prepare for such a contingency. The potential cost of dealing with the receipt of such information is, and has been for a long period, a potential “cost” of conducting an investigation and then initiating a prosecution in this State.
	
	
	Otherwise, the fact that the AFP does not have a physical presence outside of Sydney does not take the matter further, at least in this case. Mr Lin resides in Campsie and has not demonstrated any need to access areas outside the greater Sydney area. The task of monitoring Mr Lin’s compliance with his bail conditions will be made easier for the AFP by electronic monitoring, rather than more difficult.
	
	
	Other parts of Mr Sheehan’s affidavits deal with the technical issues and limitations surrounding electronic monitoring, including: the risk of delay between a violation event and notification to the AFP; the potential for delay between the time the AFP is notified and its response; and the risk of various technical errors. These can be accepted and are reflected in the finding noted at [36] above, namely, that electronic monitoring does not eliminate the risk of Mr Lin absconding.
	


Mr Lin’s Personal Circumstances


	
	Mr Lin is 27 years old. He is a Chinese citizen and an Australian permanent resident. He has been living in Australia for almost ten years. No evidence was put forward concerning his work history or occupation although Mr Korn told the Court that he conducted a business of fitting “add ons for luxury cars”. He has one previous conviction which was for driving a motor vehicle with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood.
	
	
	On 31 August 2013, Mr Lin married his wife, Mei Mei Lin, who is an Australian citizen. Ms Lin had two children from a previous relationship, a daughter now aged 7½ and a son aged 6½. The uncontested evidence of Ms Lin and a number of other persons, is that those children consider Mr Lin to be their father, and Mr Lin considers them to be his children.
	
	
	A medical report from a paediatric clinic describes Ms Lin’s daughter as having a “profound intellectual disability” and “autism spectrum disorder”. Her mother states that she requires “constant supervision” as she often tries to place objects in her mouth or to engage in other hazardous behaviour. She is unable to toilet herself and instead uses diapers, which require changing every two to three hours. At present, Ms Lin must undertake all the supervision of her daughter, in addition to looking after her son.
	
	
	In May 2016, Ms Lin’s daughter underwent an operation on her bowel for a perforated stomach. This has caused ongoing difficulties. She was readmitted to hospital in August 2016 with a bowel blockage. In her affidavit, Ms Lin describes the difficulties she is experiencing in looking after her children while receiving only social security payments and no assistance from Mr Lin.
	
	
	I accept Ms Lin’s evidence.
	


Sureties


	
	An affidavit sworn by Qun Qun Zheng was read on behalf of Mr Lin. Mr Zheng is a gyprocker who describes himself as a close friend of Mr Lin. Mr Zheng states that he owns his own house and has $250,000 in equity. He states he is willing to put up the entire amount as surety for Mr Lin. In addition, Mr Lin has nominated five other persons who are willing to put up substantial sureties over their own homes. The total amount proffered as surety is $1,050,000.
	


Criteria for Assessing Bail Concerns


	
	As part of the case that cause has been shown concerns the strength of the bail proposal, I will first address the criteria in s 18(1) of the Bail Act. These criteria are being addressed in the context of the CDPP’s contention that the bail concerns are whether Mr Lin will fail to appear at the hearing of the charges against him (s 17(2)(a)) and commit a serious offence (s 17(2)(b) and that the bail proposal involves the provision of substantial sureties, daily reporting, either a curfew or house arrest and electronic monitoring (s 18(1)(p) and s 20A).
	
	
	The first criteria in s 18(1) is the accused person’s background including criminal history, circumstances and community ties (s 18(1)(a); see also s 18(1)(d)). These have already been addressed. These matters point in favour of a grant of bail.
	
	
	The second and third criteria are the nature and seriousness of the offences charged (s 18(1)(b)) and the strength of the prosecution case (s 18(1)(c)). It follows from [13] that I consider that the CDPP’s case is reasonably strong although it has experienced difficulties in formulating the correct charge. Needless to say the charges are very serious. Subsection 18(1)(i) specifies that the Court must consider the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed if the accused person is convicted. If Mr Lin is convicted of any offence relating to the methyl amphetamine found within the 70 stools then he can expect to receive a very long custodial sentence. Even if he is only convicted of an offence relating to the methyl amphetamine found in the two stools he is likely to receive a substantial custodial sentence.
	
	
	Subsection 18(1)(g) refers to whether a person seeking bail has “criminal associations”. The above conclusion about the strength of the Crown case supports the suggestion that Mr Lin has associations of that kind. On the CDPP case he is likely to have been in contact with the overseas organisers of the importation as well as the persons to whom the methyl amphetamine would eventually be supplied.
	
	
	These factors all combine to provide Mr Lin with a strong incentive to leave the jurisdiction. They also suggest that he may commit further offences.
	
	
	The next relevant criteria is Mr Lin’s history of compliance or non‑compliance with bail conditions (s 18(1)(f)(ii)). In this respect his compliance with his bail conditions during the period January to June 2016 is particularly significant. Throughout that period Mr Lin was on notice of the likelihood that he would be charged with an offence relating to the methyl amphetamine found in the 70 stools. At the time he was subject to bail conditions that are less strict than what is presently proposed. There is a reasonable possibility that he was subject to surveillance by the AFP during that period to ascertain if he would attempt to contact others whom the AFP suspect were involved in distributing the methyl amphetamine. If Mr Lin was determined to abscond then it is likely he would have attempted to do so during that period.
	
	
	Subsection 18(1)(h) directs attention to the length of time that Mr Lin is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused. Subsection 18(1)(l) refers to the need for the accused person to be free to prepare for his attendance in court. Subsection 18(1)(m) refers to the need for the accused person to be free for “any other lawful reason”. The period that Mr Lin is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused has been addressed above. It was not suggested that the preparation of Mr Lin’s defence would be unduly hampered if he is refused bail. However it follows from [46] to [48] that he has strong “other lawful reasons” for being released.
	


Has Cause been Shown?


	
	In submitting that his client had shown cause, Mr Korn relied on the combined effect of three matters, namely, the circumstance of Mr Lin’s family, the likely period of pre-trial custody and the strength of the bail proposal.
	
	
	In relation to the first matter, I have outlined the particular vulnerability of Mr Lin’s family, especially his daughter, above. His wife and daughter have a compelling need for his presence. The existence of such compelling family circumstances can demonstrate cause (Mawad at [44]).
	
	
	In this case, the period that Mr Lin is likely to spend from this point until the time of his trial, namely just over 12 months, is not of itself a matter that would justify a conclusion that cause has been shown especially given the seriousness of the charge that he faces and the strength of the CDPP’s case. However that should be considered in the light of the events from January 2016 to this time. He was first released on bail for a period of 5 months and complied with his bail conditions. Otherwise the CDPP appears to have struggled to have identified the appropriate charge notwithstanding that the laying of more serious charges was the matter that lead to a change in Mr Lin’s bail status.
	
	
	Mr Lin’s compliance with the terms of his bail during the period January to June 2016 is of particular significance to a consideration of the strength of his bail proposal. His actions during this time appreciably reduce what would otherwise be a significant risk of his absconding. When that is considered with the level of oversight provided by the proposed bail conditions it follows that his bail proposal is strong.
	
	
	Of itself, the likely period of pre-trial custody that Mr Lin will serve does not establish cause. However I accept that his family circumstances combined with the strength of the bail proposal, when considered in light of the events of 2016, warrant a conclusion that he has shown cause why his detention for a period likely to exceed 12 months until his trial is not justified.
	


Bail Concerns and Bail Conditions


	
	As cause has been shown it is necessary to address the bail concerns. It follows from the above that, if he is released on bail, there is a concern that Mr Lin will fail to appear and will commit a serious offence. It also follows that I consider that those risks can be reduced below a level that is unacceptable by the imposition of bail conditions.
	
	
	One matter that was debated during the application was the interaction between any curfew or house arrest conditions and the operation of the electronic monitoring. As noted, the electronic monitoring can be configured so as to trigger a violation event alert if Mr Lin leaves a designated area. During specified times this can be reduced to the area around his residence. The difficulty in doing so in this case is that most curfew or house arrest conditions have exceptions allowing an accused person to leave the house to report to police stations, attend court or medical appointments and the like. Electronic monitoring will not be able to distinguish between a journey for these purposes and a breach of the curfew. It would be cumbersome to have violation events triggered simply because the applicant left his home for one of those reasons. This is particularly relevant to this application as a significant part of the case concerns Mr Lin providing assistance to his wife in caring for their children and it can be expected that this will include taking his daughter to numerous medical appointments.
	
	
	The bail conditions will address this by imposing an evening curfew on Mr Lin with an exemption for family medical appointments, placing an overall restriction on Mr Lin travelling outside a 25km radius from his home and precluding him from entering within 1km of any international point of departure. The electronic monitoring can be configured to detect violations of the latter two conditions. The first condition will be subject to a usual enforcement condition which can be carried out by the AFP or local police. The evidence suggests that any medical appointments and Court hearings Mr Lin must attend to are within the 25km radius of his home. The AFP headquarters in Sydney are within that area. As noted, there was no evidence put forward concerning his work commitments.
	
	
	Accordingly, in respect of the charges laid against Mr Lin on 12 December 2016, bail is granted on the following conditions:
	


(1)   The applicant is to be of good behaviour.

(2)   The applicant is to appear at Court as required.

		31 March 2017",2017-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276281,R v Haydar (No.3) [2017] NSWSC 159,"REASONS FOR VERDICT


	
	On 22 February 2017, the Crown presented an Indictment against Haydar Haydar which contained three counts.
	
	
	The accused, Haydar Haydar, entered pleas in respect of each of those counts. The counts and the pleas are as follows:
	



	
	For that he on 30 March 2015 at Bexley in the State of New South Wales, did murder Salwa Haydar.
	


Plea – Not Guilty of Murder but Guilty of Manslaughter.


	
	For that he on 30 March 2015 at Bexley in the State of New South Wales, did wound Ola Haydar with intent to cause Grievous Bodily Harm to Salwa Haydar.
	


Plea – Not Guilty.


	
	For that he on 30 March 2015 at Bexley in the State of New South Wales, did recklessly wound Ola Haydar.
	


Plea – Guilty.


	
	I note that Count 3 is an alternative count to Count 2.
	
	
	The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the first count on the Indictment. The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty to Count 3 in satisfaction of Count 2.
	
	
	The trial is being conducted by a judge alone as a result of an application made by the accused on 21 February 2017. The circumstances surrounding that application, and the reasons for which I made the order, can be found at R v Haydar (No.2) [2017] NSWSC 131.
	
	
	Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for certain requirements of a judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury. That section is in the following form:
	


“133 Verdict of single Judge

(1)   A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.

(2)   A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

(3)   If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.


	
	Accordingly, it is necessary that I set out the principles of law which I have applied, and the findings of fact upon which I rely in reaching my verdict. As well, if there is any warning of a kind given to a jury which would be applicable in this case, then I must set that out.
	
	
	It is convenient to commence these reasons by reference to some general principles of law which would be the subject of directions given by me to a jury in every criminal trial. These are directions which are applicable to me and which I am required to, and which I do, apply.
	


Principles of Law

Overall Duty and Responsibility


	
	It is my duty and responsibility to consider whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the each of the charges, and to return a verdict according to the evidence which I have heard, in accordance with the applicable law.
	


Application of Principles of Law


	
	I am bound to apply the principles of law which are contained in these reasons to the facts of the case as I find them to be.
	


Impartiality


	
	In considering this verdict, I must act impartially and dispassionately. I must not let emotion sway my judgment. Neither prejudice nor sympathy has any role to play in the determination of this case. My task must be undertaken free of prejudice or sympathy in any of its forms.
	


Burden of Proof


	
	This is a criminal trial of a most serious nature. The burden of proof of guilt of the accused is placed on the Crown. That onus rests upon the Crown in respect of every element of each of the offences with which the accused is charged. There is no onus of proof on the accused at all. It is not for the accused to prove his innocence, but for the Crown to prove his guilt and to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It is, and always has been, a critical part of our system of justice that a person tried in this court is presumed to be innocent unless and until he or she is proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This is called the presumption of innocence. The words ""beyond reasonable doubt"" are words of ancient origin in the law and are plain words which do not require elaboration. If I have a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, he is entitled to be acquitted.
	
	
	I remind myself that the Crown does not have to prove every single fact in the case beyond reasonable doubt. The onus which rests on the Crown is to prove the elements of the offences with which the accused is charged, beyond reasonable doubt. This principle of law, namely that the Crown has the job of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt, is so fundamental to the delivery of criminal justice that it is a principle that must be kept in the forefront of my mind in the course of, and throughout, my deliberations.
	


Witness Evidence


	
	It is for me to assess the various witnesses and decide whether they are telling the truth, or are reliable, and whether I accept their evidence. My ultimate decision as to what evidence I accept, and what evidence I reject, may be based on a range of matters, including the context of what the witnesses had to say, the manner in which the witness said it and the general impression which he or she made upon me in giving evidence.
	
	
	In assessing the evidence, I am expected to use my own qualities of reasoning, my experience and common sense, my understanding of people and my understanding of human affairs.
	
	
	In relation to accepting the evidence of witnesses, I am not obliged to accept the whole of the evidence of any one witness. I may, if I think fit, accept part and reject part of the same witness's evidence. In other words, the fact that I do not accept a portion of the evidence of the witness does not mean that I must necessarily reject the whole of the witness's evidence. I can accept part of the evidence of a witness if I think it is worthy of acceptance.
	


Silence of the Accused


	
	In the case for the defence, the accused has not given any explanation himself by giving evidence from the witness box in response to the Crown's case. I remind myself that an accused person may always, by giving evidence, make a response to the case presented by the Crown by way of an explanation for the whole or parts of the Crown's case, but there is no obligation on him so to do. Although an accused may give evidence in relation to the whole or any part of the Crown's case, he may equally elect to give no such explanation. The accused is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove his guilt.
	
	
	I remind myself, as a matter of law, that the silence in court of the accused cannot be used by me against him. The election of the accused not to offer an explanation for the whole or any part of the Crown's case by giving evidence himself does not constitute any form of admission by the accused and no such inference must be drawn. Nor must I use such an election by the accused to fill in gaps in the evidence tendered by the Crown and it must not be used as a makeweight in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. I must not speculate about what might have been said in evidence if the accused had himself given evidence.
	
	
	In this context, I again remind myself that the Crown bears the onus of satisfying me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offences charged. The accused does not bear any onus. The accused is presumed to be innocent until I have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown that he is guilty.
	


Good Character


	
	The accused, in his case, has raised the question of his good character. It is not in doubt that he is a person of previous good character.
	
	
	The law provides that I am entitled to take the fact of an accused’s previous good character into account in his favour on the question of whether the Crown has proved the accused’s guilt of the offences charged beyond reasonable doubt. The fact that the accused is a person of good character is relevant to the likelihood of his having committed the offences alleged. I can take into account the accused’s good character by reasoning that such a person is unlikely to have committed the offences charged by the Crown. Whether I do reason in that way is a matter for me.
	
	
	Further, I can use the fact that the accused is a person of good character to support his credibility. I may reason that a person of good character is less likely to lie or give a false account either in giving a history to the expert psychiatrists or in giving an account of the events to the police. Whether I reason in that way is a matter for me to determine.
	
	
	I direct myself that none of this means that good character provides the accused with some kind of defence. It is only one of the many factors which I am to take into account in determining whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. What weight I give to the fact that the accused is a person of good character is completely a matter for me, but I note that I should take that fact into account in the ways referred to above.
	


Addresses of Counsel


	
	I have heard addresses from the Crown Prosecutor, and from Mr Stratton SC, counsel for the accused. I will consider those submissions that have been made in their addresses and give to the submissions such weight as I think fit. I remind myself that in no sense are those submissions evidence in the case, and that counsels’ arguments provide a way of viewing the evidence from a different perspective, the Crown as the accuser and from the accused.
	


Inferences


	
	I am entitled to draw inferences from the direct evidence. Inferences are conclusions of fact rationally drawn from a combination of proved facts.
	
	
	In the context of a criminal trial, where proof of the offences is required beyond reasonable doubt, I direct myself that I should not draw any inference adverse to the accused from the direct evidence unless I am satisfied that it is the only rational inference in the circumstances.
	


Expert Evidence


	
	I remind myself about the principles relating to expert evidence. In this case I have heard evidence from three expert psychiatric witnesses: Dr Nielssen, Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore. An expert witness is a person who has specialised knowledge based on their training, study or experience. Because they have such knowledge, they may express an opinion on relevant matters that fall within their expertise. Other witnesses only speak of facts.
	
	
	The expert evidence of these psychiatrists is admitted to provide me with psychiatric information and opinion which is within the witness's expertise, but which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a lay person.
	
	
	As well, Dr Istvan Szentmariay, a forensic pathologist, provided an expert report about the post-mortem examination of the deceased, the various wounds which were observed and an expert opinion as to the cause of death of the deceased.
	
	
	I must bear in mind that if, having given the matter careful consideration, I do not accept the evidence of any of the experts, then I do not have to act upon it. Indeed, I do not have to accept even the unchallenged evidence of an expert. However, unless such evidence is simply unbelievable, I note that I would need to have a good reason to reject it.
	
	
	To the extent that there is any conflict within the evidence of an expert, it is for me to decide which part or parts of that evidence I accept and which part or parts I reject. I should remember that the evidence relates only to part of the case and that, whilst it may be of assistance to me in reaching a verdict, I must reach my verdict having considered all of the evidence. To the extent that there is any difference (or differences) between the evidence of the experts, it is for me to decide which evidence of which expert I accept and which I reject.
	


Essential Elements of Each Offence


	
	In considering whether the prosecution has made out its case beyond reasonable doubt, it is appropriate that I set out the essential elements of each offence, each of which must proved by the Crown.
	


Count 1: Murder of Salwa Haydar

Murder – Essential Elements


	
	In order to prove the offence of murder, the Crown must establish, beyond reasonable doubt, each of the following elements:
	



	
	the death of Salwa Haydar;
	
	
	that it was the act of the accused, Haydar Haydar, that caused her death;
	
	
	that his act was deliberate; and
	
	
	that his act was done with either:
	



	
	an intent to kill; or
	
	
	an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm (which means really serious bodily harm).
	



	
	Unless the Crown proves each and every one of these essential elements beyond reasonable doubt, I cannot find the accused, Haydar Haydar, guilty of murder.
	


Substantial Impairment by Abnormality of Mind – Elements of the Partial Defence


	
	If the Crown has proved each of the elements set out in [34] above, beyond reasonable doubt, then before concluding that the accused, Haydar Haydar, is guilty of murder, it is necessary that I consider whether he should be convicted of manslaughter and not murder.
	
	
	This is because in answer to the charge of murder, the accused relies upon the provisions of s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 by way of a defence of substantial impairment caused by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. The effect of this defence is that any verdict of guilty would only be to a charge of manslaughter and not murder.
	
	
	In considering that matter, I must ask whether the accused has established the partial defence of “substantial impairment by abnormality of mind” (“impairment defence”). The accused bears the onus of proving this defence on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Section 23A of the Crimes Act is in the following form:
	


“23A Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind

(1)   A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:

(a)   at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person’s actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and

(b)    the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.

(2)   For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible.

(3)    If a person was intoxicated at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, and the intoxication was self-induced intoxication (within the meaning of section 428A), the effects of that self-induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.

(4)    The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.

(5)    A person who but for this section would be liable, whether as principal or accessory, to be convicted of murder is to be convicted of manslaughter instead.

(6)    The fact that a person is not liable to be convicted of murder in respect of a death by virtue of this section does not affect the question of whether any other person is liable to be convicted of murder in respect of that death.

(7)    If, on the trial of a person for murder, the person contends:

(a)    that the person is entitled to be acquitted on the ground that the person was mentally ill at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, or

(b)    that the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section,

evidence may be offered by the prosecution tending to prove the other of those contentions, and the Court may give directions as to the stage of the proceedings at which that evidence may be offered.”


	
	The impairment defence requires me to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that:
	



	
	at the time he stabbed Salwa Haydar, the capacity of the accused to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition; and
	
	
	the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
	



	
	In considering the impairment defence, I must note the following:
	



	
	As to the first element, the issue is whether Mr Haydar’s capacity to control himself was substantially impaired, not whether he simply chose not to control himself.
	
	
	Substantial impairment includes impairment (or reduction or weakening) that is less than a total impairment but not an impairment that is trivial or minimal.
	
	
	An abnormality of mind occurs if Mr Haydar’s capacity to control himself so differed from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable person would term his behaviour abnormal. In making that judgment, it is necessary to recognise that there is a range of states of mind which, even if not perfect, would be properly described as normal. The expression abnormality of mind covers the mind's activities in all aspects.
	
	
	Underlying condition means a pre-existing mental condition or physiological (i.e. bodily) condition. It does not have to be a permanent condition, but, it is not enough if it is a passing condition or one which only lasts for a short time.
	
	
	As to element (2) above, in determining whether an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter, I make a value judgment applying objective community standards as to whether the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
	
	
	In so doing, I should consider the extent of that impairment, the nature and circumstances of the killing and any other relevant circumstance so as to reach a judgment by reference to objective community standards as to whether the moral blameworthiness or the moral culpability of the accused has been so impaired as to justify a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder.
	


Count 2: Wounding Ola Haydar with Intent to Cause Grievous Bodily Harm to Salwa Haydar.


	
	In order to prove the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, each of the following elements:
	



	
	that the accused wounded Ola Haydar; and
	
	
	that when he wounded Ola Haydar, the accused was acting with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm to Salwa Haydar. Grievous bodily harm means really serious physical injury.
	



	
	Unless the Crown proves each of these essential elements, beyond reasonable doubt, then I must find the accused, Haydar Haydar, not guilty of this count.
	


Count 3: Reckless Wounding


	
	As this count is in the alternative to Count 2, I only consider this count if I have not been satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offence in Count 2.
	
	
	In order to prove the offence of reckless wounding, the Crown must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, each of the following elements:
	



	
	that the accused wounded Ola Haydar; and
	
	
	that when he wounded Ola Haydar, the accused was reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to Ola Haydar.
	



	
	Unless the Crown proves each of these essential elements beyond reasonable doubt, then I must find the accused, Haydar Haydar, not guilty of this count.
	
	
	However, as the accused has entered a plea of guilty to this count when he was arraigned at the start of the trial, I am entitled to accept that plea and, on the basis of it, to be satisfied that the accused admits each of the essential elements of the offence. Accordingly, if it becomes necessary to reach a verdict on this count, I am entitled to find, without further consideration, that the accused is guilty of this offence.
	


Crown Case – In Outline


	
	The Crown case is that the accused, in the context of and against a background of a volatile marital relationship with his wife, Salwa Haydar (“the deceased”), returned home from a two week visit to his family in Lebanon. By that time, he had formed the intention of living apart from his wife in separate residential accommodation.
	
	
	On the day he arrived in Sydney, the accused was present at the deceased’s house (“the Bexley townhouse”) when she returned in the evening, having been at work. Their 18 year old daughter, Ola, was also present because her mother had collected her from university where she was studying.
	
	
	Shortly after the return of the deceased and Ola to their home, the deceased entered the kitchen and started preparing dinner. She asked the accused to fetch some cooking oil from the garage. He declined. Thereafter an argument developed between them about the manner in which the deceased contributed to the domestic life of the family.
	
	
	On the Crown case, the deceased picked up a knife which he had brought to the premises, and entered the kitchen. There the argument between the accused and the deceased continued, and the accused stabbed the deceased. Upon hearing the argument and attack, Ola entered the kitchen and by placing herself between the accused and the deceased, attempted to stop him from attacking her mother. In the course of that interference, and whilst he was wielding the knife at the deceased, the accused stabbed Ola and caused significant injuries to her right hand.
	
	
	The violent scuffle between the deceased and the accused then moved into the lounge room where the accused continued to stab the deceased in a frenzied attack. The accused stabbed deceased over 30 times, to her front, her back, her face and other parts of her body.
	
	
	Ola, who was present in the lounge room and witnessing the attack, called upon the accused to stop attacking the deceased. When he did not, she telephoned 000. The accused attempted to discourage that call whilst he continued attacking the deceased.
	
	
	When the accused could not persuade Ola to cease calling for help, he took the knife and the deceased’s handbag and left the premises in his car. He drove to his brother’s house and left his car there. The police later found the blood-stained knife in the accused’s car. There were blood stains in the car as well.
	
	
	The accused’s brother drove him to Kogarah Police Station where the accused informed the police that he had stabbed his wife.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that it is open to the Court to find that at the time the stabbing occurred, the accused was substantially impaired in his capacity to control himself because he was suffering from an abnormality of mind due to an underlying depressive illness. However, the Crown contended that the Court would find the accused guilty of murder because the accused was motivated to kill the deceased, and carried through that motivation in an attack for which the moral culpability is at a very high level, and the impairment of the accused was not sufficient to justify anything other than a verdict of murder.
	


Case for the Accused – In Outline


	
	The accused accepted that he attacked his wife with a knife and killed her. He accepts that at the time he did so, he had an intention to cause her grievous bodily harm. He does not accept that he intended to kill her. However, the accused says that the Court would be persuaded that he had a long-standing depressive illness which had subsisted for over two years.
	
	
	The accused submitted that it was clear that, at the time of the killing of his wife, he was suffering from a deep depression relating to his marital relationship and family events in Lebanon. He further submits that when confronted in a domestic context with an argument provoked by his perception that his wife was unfaithful, he completely lost his self-control, took a knife which he had found by chance in his wife’s handbag, and in an impromptu reaction to his wife’s comments, attacked her.
	
	
	The accused says that he has no memory of, that is to say he is amnesic of, the events surrounding the actual attack itself. His case is that the Court would find that he was substantially impaired by reason of his depressive illness in controlling himself, and that that substantial impairment caused his inability to control himself such that he killed his wife. He submitted that the impairment was so substantial, and his moral culpability so diminished, that the Court would reduce his offence to one of manslaughter, consistent with his plea.
	
	
	The accused did not advance any case, or make any submission contrary to a finding of guilt on the second count of the Indictment. He accepted, by his plea of guilty to the third count on the Indictment, that he wounded his daughter Ola. He accepted by his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the first count that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. Notwithstanding these facts, he simply does not accept that the Crown has discharged its onus with respect to each of the elements on the second count.
	


Facts


	
	It is necessary for me to record the facts which I find, and upon which I base my verdict. I find each of these facts on the balance of probabilities, unless otherwise expressly stated.
	
	
	The vast bulk of the facts are not in dispute. With respect to the marital relationship between the accused and the deceased there are variations between the evidence of different people, coming no doubt from their different observations at different times. I do not detect in these various accounts any real variation in the underlying picture which they present. That is, that the accused and the deceased had an unhappy marital relationship. In 2013, they had sold their family home and divided the proceeds. Each of the deceased and the accused had purchased their own property. By 2015, it had reached the point where the deceased had concluded that she should live separately and apart from the accused and obtain a divorce from him, and the accused was ambivalent about a clean break in the relationship. He seemed to regard this separation and living apart as inevitable but he was not really willing to give up on the marital relationship and wished to restore it to a state which he regarded as a good one, or else he wished to control the timing and circumstances of the divorce.
	
	
	The deceased was born in 1969 and was about 13 years younger than the accused, who was born in 1956. They both came from the village of Aytaroon in south Lebanon. They both came from large families. Some members of each family came to Australia with the rest remaining in Lebanon.
	
	
	The accused and deceased were married in Lebanon in about 1986 and came to Australia in about 1987. The accused and the deceased had four children – the eldest, Amani, a qualified lawyer, was born in about 1987. By the time of the events in question, Amani was married, the mother of one child and living away from the house where her mother and two sisters lived.
	
	
	The second child of the marriage, Ibrahim, was born in about 1991. Ibrahim was educated to university level. In early 2013, about six weeks before he graduated in the disciplines of business and finance, he was arrested and charged with criminal offences relating to drugs and firearms, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. At the time of the attack by the accused on the deceased, Ibrahim was in custody serving his term of imprisonment.
	
	
	The third child of the marriage was Nour, who was born in 1993. She qualified with a tertiary degree in journalism and was employed as a casual worker in a shop at Sydney Airport at the time of her mother’s death. She lived with her mother and her sister Ola in the Bexley townhouse.
	
	
	The youngest child of the marriage was Ola. Ola was born in about 1997. She was 18 at the time she witnessed her father kill her mother. She was at that time studying architecture and design at the University of Technology in Sydney. She also lived in the Bexley townhouse with her mother and sister.
	
	
	For many years the family lived in a house in Bexley Road, Bexley (“the family home”). Initially, Salwa stayed at home and raised her family. It is not entirely clear what the accused did to provide for his family for many of those years. By the time he was arrested, the accused was earning money by driving a taxi and also teaching English to persons for whom it was a second language. As well, it appears from time to time, he undertook some interpreting from Arabic into English.
	
	
	The deceased, at the time of the events, was working at St Vincent’s Hospital for a service known as the Quit Line. It is not clear when the deceased commenced working at Quit Line, but a fellow worker with whom she became friendly, Helen Francis, said that she first met the deceased in about in 2012. Another worker, Mr Evert Rauwendaal, says that he met the deceased in 2010 when he started working at St Vincent’s Hospital as a drug and alcohol counsellor. The precise date that the deceased commenced working at St Vincent’s Hospital is not material. She worked there full-time in March 2015, and apparently enjoyed it.
	
	
	Between about 1992 and 1996, the accused and the deceased shared the family home with their children and also with Abbas Haidar and Jinane Haidar, who are married. Abbas Haidar is the younger brother of the accused. Jinane Haidar is the younger sister of the deceased.
	
	
	During the time when Jinane and Abbas lived with the accused and the deceased, Jinane observed that they were always arguing. Sometimes the arguments were over little things and sometimes over more serious things. She said that in those arguments the deceased would question their relationship and the accused’s traditional ways. The Haidars did not observe any physical violence between the accused and the deceased.
	
	
	Jinane remained close to her sister. They would speak at least weekly, if not more frequently, and often discussed their private lives. Jinane said that since about 2005, her sister, the deceased, had been talking about separating from the accused because she did not want to continue in the relationship. The deceased told Jinane that in about 2010 she had confronted her husband to inform him that their relationship was not working and that she wanted a separation. According to the deceased, the accused did not take her seriously and laughed at her.
	
	
	Nour recalled growing up in a household where her parents would regularly bicker and argue between themselves.
	
	
	Amani recalled that in 2003 there was a heated argument between her parents relating to divorce. Apparently, according to Amani, the deceased informed the accused that she wanted a divorce. The accused replied with words to this effect:
	


“What you are saying is disgusting. You are disgusting for mentioning divorce. Do you know what kind of women seek divorce?”


	
	Amani also recalled heated arguments on other occasions. She recalls the accused in the course of an argument threatening the deceased by using a phrase in Arabic meaning “I will slaughter you” or “I will choke you”. She also recalled the accused approaching the deceased with an aggressive stance although on only one occasion did she recall the accused pushing the deceased. She recalled on that occasion that the accused pushed the deceased in the neck area forcing her up against a wall.
	
	
	Amani left the family home in 2013 when she got married. She stayed close to the deceased and visited regularly.
	
	
	In the course of 2012, the deceased stopped wearing her hijab. She told Ms Francis, her work colleague, that the accused was not pleased by this decision. This is one example of some of the cultural differences between the accused and the deceased. In a conversation with a neighbour, Ms Amanda Jachowski, in September 2014, the accused described her life with her husband and the difficulties which she faced in this way:
	


“I was in my teens when we married and I came to Australia to have children with him. I believed that if I did the right thing and had his children and stayed home to care for them, he would work and support us. We started to have challenges in our marriage. Because I came here so young, I grew up with an Australian mindset, and Haydar had a Lebanese village mindset. Due to our difference in our mindset and cultural beliefs, it placed a large strain on our marriage. In my culture you don’t get divorced. I did not get on with Haydar’s traditional friends. … Haydar treated our daughters differently [to our son] and disciplined them harshly. This caused further problems in our marriage, because they would question why they were being treated differently to their brother. Haydar and I argue a lot. My aim is to enjoy my life with my daughters.”


	
	I accept that the contents of this conversation accurately described the deceased’s perspective of her relationship. That description is in part supported by a remark made by the accused to his daughter, Nour, probably during 2013 or perhaps late 2012. Nour recalled that the accused responded that he would only agree to a divorce from the deceased once she and her sister had married “… because he knew how society viewed a divorced woman raising single daughters”.
	
	
	In 2012, there was a significant incident which appears, together with subsequent events, to have caused a marked further deterioration in the relationship between the accused and the deceased. It seems that in 2012 the accused and the deceased had difficulties with their son’s behaviour. The deceased in 2014 told Ms Jachowski that her son went off the rails and fell into the company of a gang of youths who were engaged in drug dealing. He was ultimately arrested in April 2013 on drug-related charges.
	
	
	Clearly, Ibrahim’s behaviour caused difficulties. The deceased blamed the accused for failing to adequately parent Ibrahim by setting proper boundaries for his behaviour and punishing any misbehaviour. She gave an example to Ms Jachowski in their 2014 conversation. She said, and I accept that this is an accurate recounting of her perception, this:
	


“I blame and resent my husband. I think it’s his fault my son is in jail. I saw him going off the rails. I was trying everything I could to get him out of the gang. Haydar would never set boundaries for our son and he would not give him any consequences. Whenever I did, Haydar would undermine me, for example, I would set a curfew that he would have to be home at a certain time. If he was not home by the curfew, I would not unlock the door to let him in, but Haydar would let him in. Haydar would yell at me for not letting him in and it would be my fault and not my son’s fault for him being home late. I tried to get him out of the gang, to get him out of the country to the United Kingdom to live with my brother. I felt powerless to stop what I could see was happening to my son.”


	
	It was in that context that she remarked that the accused had treated their daughters differently.
	
	
	In late 2012, there was an argument between the deceased and her son Ibrahim. He threw his mobile phone at the deceased and hit her in the eye. The accused was present in the house at the time but not in the room where the incident took place. The deceased blamed the accused for her son’s behaviour and that incident. This incident also fuelled the deceased’s perception of the accused’s inadequacy as a father, since the deceased believed that the accused’s failure to intervene or to discipline Ibrahim lead to the criminal offending of their son. This was a constant and significant source of conflict. Such was her injury that the deceased spent a short time, one or two days, in hospital. Her eyesight was damaged to some extent, although it is not clear on the evidence what the ultimate extent was.
	
	
	At the time of the mobile phone incident, Nour heard the deceased say to the accused:
	


“Why didn’t you get up and help me? You heard us screaming, you heard us fighting, you just sat there.”


	
	It was Nour’s opinion that her father had done nothing to stop her brother from being aggressive or violent towards the deceased. This made the deceased particularly angry and, according to Nour’s evidence, which I accept, talk about divorce became more and more constant after the mobile phone throwing incident.
	
	
	At the time Ibrahim was arrested, Abbas Haidar observed that his brother’s behaviour changed. He became less social and spoke less. He said that whilst the accused was always a quiet person, he had been previously much more relaxed about his life. This changed when his son was arrested.
	
	
	In September 2013, the accused and deceased decided to sell the family home where they had lived since the early 1990s. The decision to sell was made at the same time as the deceased and the accused were called upon to find money to assist with their son’s legal fees. After a period of indecision as to what they would do, the deceased and accused, apparently quite amicably, divided the proceeds of sale of the family home. The accused bought an apartment which was then rented out. The deceased bought the Bexley townhouse, which is the place in which she was ultimately killed by the accused.
	
	
	The Bexley townhouse comprised three bedrooms essentially on one level. There were stairs up into the townhouse from the street front and there was a garage at street level, next to the townhouse. Inside the townhouse there was a single large living and dining room area with an enclosed kitchen opening into it. The three bedrooms and a bathroom were along a hallway and separate from the combined living room.
	
	
	According to Nour, the initial arrangement between her parents was that they would live separate lives in their own separate residences. Their relationship was not good at that point in time and the deceased had asked the accused for a divorce on more than one occasion. However, it appears that at the last moment the accused and the deceased reached an accommodation which allowed the accused to move into the Bexley townhouse on the proviso that he paid $150 per week in rent.
	
	
	During the period of their occupation, which commenced in about September 2013, from time to time the accused and deceased shared a bedroom. At other times, the accused slept on one of the couches in the living room. Each of their two daughters, Nour and Ola, occupied their own bedroom.
	
	
	According to their daughters, their relationship whilst in the Bexley townhouse continued much as it had before and according to their mother, the accused did not change his behaviour around the house. The bickering and arguing continued – it varied in intensity and over time.
	
	
	In March 2014, the accused, who was at that time driving a taxi, had an episode of confusion and amnesia. He managed to contact his daughter and he was admitted to St George Hospital. His episode was diagnosed as one of transient global amnesia. After spending one night in hospital, he was discharged home to be followed up by his general practitioner. The evidence did not disclose any further incident of this kind. This incident does not play any role in the events relevant to these offences.
	


Events Leading up to 30 March 2015


	
	Sometime in early March 2015, Abbas decided that he would return to Lebanon to visit his mother and his family. He had previously discussed doing so with the accused, who had said that he (the accused) would accompany Abbas on a trip back to Lebanon, if Abbas decided to travel back there.
	
	
	Prior to departing for Lebanon, the relationship between the accused and the deceased continued to deteriorate. The accused had packed up most of his belongings and had stored them in the Bexley townhouse garage. In discussions with the deceased, the accused was asked, and he agreed, to leave his door key to the townhouse when he went to Lebanon. Although he ultimately did not leave his door key behind, I infer, from his agreement to do so, that he recognised the view of the deceased (at least) that she wanted him to move out of the Bexley townhouse. The accused informed the deceased that he would not pay any rent whilst he was away in Lebanon.
	
	
	According to Nour in a conversation with the accused a few days before he departed for Lebanon, she saw that he was packing up his bookshelf, and he told her that the deceased had “told me to pack my stuff, so I’m packing my stuff”.
	
	
	Although the arrangement with his brother was that they would leave for Lebanon on 15 March 2015 and return on 21 April 2015, the accused did not tell his family how long he would be going for. According to Ola, neither she nor her sisters knew exactly when the accused was returning because he had gone without telling them when he would be back. The accused had mentioned to them that he might stay in Lebanon with his mother for a couple of months, but he was not sure and would wait and see what developed. It is not clear why there was a difference between the date fixed for his return to Sydney, and the uncertain date for his return, which the accused gave to his daughter. In my view, the variation is not significant, except that the accused’s version, accepted by his daughter, lead to her surprise on the day of his return to Sydney.
	
	
	The day before he left for Lebanon, the accused took the deceased’s mobile phone from her handbag and accessed the text messages stored on it. He took a photograph on his mobile phone of those messages. They were sent by the deceased to Mr Rauwendaal. They read:
	


“That wasn’t easy, I’ve been asking for this for yrs. But there has been few reasons to lead to this.”

“I plan to get legal advise and start divorce proceedings”;

“This is the first time that I feel he really accept that its over”;

“He was disrespectful, passive/aggressive, emotionally abusive. He also made it very plain he considered all our assets to be his because he'd insisted I not work outside the home”;

“I want nothing more than to be with you tonight. I feel very vulnerable emotionally”.


	
	It became apparent after his return from Lebanon that the accused regarded these text messages as evidence that the deceased was being unfaithful to him, and having some sort of extra-marital affair. However, he did not tell his brother Abbas of this whilst they were in Lebanon. He did however tell Abbas that he (Haydar) was having difficulty being in Lebanon, that his mother’s illness made him very sad and that he could not be away from his son for more than a month. He told Abbas that he wanted to go back to Australia because his son, Ibrahim, was missing him.
	
	
	The accused left for Lebanon with his brother, Abbas, very early on the morning of 15 March 2015.
	
	
	Whilst in Lebanon the accused was in Abbas’ company for the majority of the time. Abbas described their experience in Lebanon as not being a pleasant one. He said that their mother was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and that her condition would vary from recognising them to not knowing who he and the accused were. He said that this upset him, and it apparently upset the accused.
	
	
	Abbas observed that the accused was not enjoying being in Lebanon, that he was not being very sociable and that he seemed to be waiting for calls from his son and when his son did not call he would get upset. Abbas said that he observed that the accused did not sleep very much, no more than two hours a night. He also observed that the accused did not eat very much at all. Besides visiting his mother, the accused and Abbas were also involved in making arrangements for the funeral of an uncle who had recently died from a heart attack. Abbas observed that the accused appeared to be relieved after he made arrangements for a ticket to return home.
	
	
	At the time of his departure from Lebanon, Abbas counselled the accused about his relationship with the deceased, although he was not privy to the text messages between them whilst the accused was in Lebanon. He counselled him to get a divorce from his wife, saying he believed it would be the better solution for them both.
	
	
	There had been an exchange of text messages between the accused and the deceased whilst the accused was in Lebanon. Those text messages included a suggestion by the accused to the deceased that she should join him in Lebanon. The message also seems to me to have included a suggestion that the deceased had not been behaving appropriately. On 21 March 2015, the accused sent the deceased this message:
	


“Think sensibly. I say this with utmost sincerity. You based your thoughts on false foundations. You’ve committed a grave mistake. Do you remember when I lately took an oath on the Quran? I swear by God, I was saying the truth and never committed adultery since I got married. You’re in a state of loss now, and I don’t wish this for the rose that I brought from Aytaroon, and from whom I have four smart children. You’ll turn a grandmother soon and it is a pity that you beg for coffee from this and that, some of whom may take advantage of your weakness while you live in dreams. I say this at the time that my heart is broken. I swear by God that I want nothing for [you] except your complete wellbeing. Think about purchasing a home together and be the real Salwa.”


	
	I take from this message that the accused was accusing his wife of being unfaithful to him, and reminding her that he had remained faithful to her. He was also clearly expressing his wish for a marital reconciliation. There does not appear, in any of the messages extracted by police from both the mobile phone of the deceased and the mobile phone of the accused, to be a direct response to this.
	
	
	However, some days later, on 25 March 2015, at about 4.23pm, there were a series of messages from the deceased to the accused which included the following:
	


“You are not normal, and all the methods in which you dealt with me were incorrect”;

“And who takes advantage? My weakness and my weakness are because of you”;

“Get married and forget about me”;

“If a man who goes out with me, cares for me and treats me like all men, I would … and things would have been different”;

“And after you’ve caused all the losses, you have no right to talk”


	
	It is a little difficult, in the absence of all of the text messages and the oral conversations, to reach a conclusive understanding of the state of the marital relationship from these messages.
	
	
	Various actions by the accused suggested that he recognised that the marriage was finished. In particular, he had packed his personal belongings up and put them in the garage at the Bexley townhouse. He had ceased paying rent there. To that extent, he went along with the fact that the marriage had ended. But, other actions such as the keeping of a key to the Bexley townhouse when it was meant to be returned, inviting his wife to come to Lebanon and entreating her to think about purchasing a home with him and “… be the real Salwa” all suggest that the accused was not willing to accept that the marriage was completely finished.
	
	
	From the deceased’s perspective, it seemed that their relationship was adequately described by her in a conversation with Ms Francis at work on 26 March 2015 at a time when the accused was in Lebanon. Ms Francis gave this account of the conversation. I accept the account and I accept that it showed the way in which the deceased was thinking about her relationship with the accused:
	


“Salwa told me that Haydar kept telling her that he loved her, and that there was nothing wrong with the marriage but that there was an issue with her and how she was viewing the marriage. Salwa told me that if Haydar had come part way to seeing things from her perspective and making an effort to change, then she would have been willing to give it another try (the marriage). She told me that she knew that he (Haydar) wouldn’t change. Salwa told me that she had sent Haydar a text message to have a think about what he wanted out of the relationship and that she would think about what she wanted out of the relationship and that they would talk about it when he got back. It is in this conversation that Salwa told me that Haydar had asked if she had done something, or if she was doing something she shouldn’t. By this Salwa believed that Haydar thought that she was seeing somebody else. Haydar believed Salwa was having an affair. Salwa said ‘He’s going to make it difficult for me’.

By this, Salwa believed that Haydar was not going to change. She wanted the marriage to end, but she knew that Haydar didn’t.”


	
	However, one matter seems to be clear, and that is that the accused was firmly of the view at this time that his wife had been unfaithful to him, and that it was this that was the driving force behind her wanting to end the marriage. He seems to have concluded that it was in his interests to be able to prove to his daughters, and if necessary demonstrate to his family, that the breakdown in the marriage was the deceased’s fault and not his own – hence he took a photograph of the text messages which to him supported his belief.
	
	
	Although the accused decided to leave Lebanon early and return to Australia, he did not inform his daughters or wife that he would be returning early and what date or time he was due back.
	


Events on 30 March 2015


	
	On the morning of 30 March 2015, the deceased left for work. Nour and Ola went to a nearby OfficeWorks complex to get some printing done for one of Ola’s university assignments. They had breakfast at a nearby café. They returned home and heard the accused having a shower. The accused had landed that morning at about 7.30am on a flight from Dubai. Ola was particularly surprised to find the accused at home because when she had spoken to her uncle, he had told her that the accused was going to spend a couple of nights in Dubai and then continue on to Sydney. She was expecting the accused a couple of days after 30 March 2015. Nour sent a text to her sister Amani to tell her that the accused had arrived back home.
	
	
	After the accused completed his shower, dressed and returned to the living room, he sat on a couch and had a conversation with Ola and Nour which lasted for some time. Ola’s observation was that the accused seemed uncomfortable and tense. She had not seen him acting like that before. Ola asked the accused about his time in Lebanon. The accused changed the topic of conversation and asked Ola and Nour whether they thought that their mother would ever be unfaithful to him. This was not a topic which he had previously raised with either of them.
	
	
	Nour observed that the accused was persistent in asking her and her sister about how long they had been in the Bexley townhouse before he noticed them, where they had been that morning and generally requiring them to account for their movements. Nour thought it was odd that the accused would be surprised that they were at home when he was the one who had been overseas, and they lived in the house.
	
	
	According to Nour the accused asked her and Ola whether the deceased would want to marry someone else if the accused and the deceased were divorced. Nour responded to the accused with words to this effect:
	


“We have spoken to her so many times; she just wants to be alone. She wants to get divorced and she wants to be alone.”


	
	At this response, the accused took out a Quran and, in front of both of his daughters, he swore that he had always been faithful to the accused. He also suggested to his daughters that he had had many opportunities where he could have been unfaithful to the deceased if he had wanted to, but that he had not taken those opportunities. This conduct shows that at this time the apparent infidelity of the deceased was a matter which deeply troubled the accused. It also shows to me that the accused was attempting to make plain to his daughters that he was not responsible for the breakdown of the marriage.
	
	
	Both Nour and Ola observed that the accused appeared tired. Nour did not observe that the accused had any problems with his speech or memory. Ola’s observation of the accused during these exchanges was that he appeared tense and stressed.
	
	
	Nour and Ola then left the house. Nour dropped Ola at university and then went to work at Sydney Airport.
	
	
	The deceased had lunch with a work colleague, Ms Kapell. Ms Kapell gave evidence of a conversation over lunch which reflected, I am satisfied, the deceased’s views of the accused. She said that the deceased said to her:
	


“Salwa told me prior to leaving that Haydar had packed his bags and removed his belongings from the villa. Salwa didn’t tell me that the marriage was over, but given what I knew and that they had separated 18 months earlier, I knew that the marriage had ended. I asked her straight up if she was fearful of Haydar and she told me that she wasn’t. I asked this question because she seemed concerned that he had not given the house key back. I asked her if he had ever been physically violent with her and she said ‘no, he was not like that’. She truly saw Haydar as a non-engaging man, a weak person.”


	
	There had been another conversation at an unspecified earlier time between the deceased and Ms Kapell in which the deceased had described the accused’s attitude towards her and which provided the context for the conversation set out in the preceding paragraph. She told Ms Kapell this:
	


“She told me how all he wanted to do was watch television, but not even movies. All he wanted to do was to watch the news in Arabic. And she hated this is how she learned her mother had been killed. She also told me that Haydar resented her studying. Haydar told her that she did not have the ability to finish the course. Salwa was quite convinced that Haydar had a social phobia. She had started to come out of her shell. She told me that Haydar resented this behaviour.”


	
	It appears that the accused slept for a period of time during the afternoon. At about 3.15pm the accused made a cash withdrawal from a bank. The evidence does not directly reveal the amount of that withdrawal. . However, the sum of $8,800 in cash was found in the accused’s black travel bag, after he had been arrested. It is not unreasonable to infer that most if not all of this cash came from this withdrawal. Detective Taylor, the officer in charge of the investigation who had access to the accused’s banking records, gave evidence that the accused had a bank account and that the accused had “access to some thousands of dollars” which was certainly enough to buy an air ticket to somewhere. He also gave evidence, which was a little confusing, that the accused apparently made both a deposit and a withdrawal on 30 March 2015. It does not seem to me to be important as to precisely what the accused did. Certainly he was observed on CCTV going to the bank and undertaking a transaction in an apparently regular and normal way.
	
	
	There was no other evidence as to what else the accused did in the course of the afternoon, other than in the accused’s history to a psychiatrist where he said that he bought some food for the house.
	
	
	At about 6pm, although the evidence suggests that this time is an estimate, the deceased collected Ola from university and drove back to the Bexley townhouse. They arrived home at about 6.30pm and found the accused sitting on a couch in the main living area watching television. Nour was not at home. Ola sat down with the accused on the couch. She thought that the accused was tired.
	
	
	The deceased went into the kitchen and commenced preparing dinner. During the course of those preparations the deceased asked the accused to go to the garage and get some cooking oil. She did so in a sharp voice. The accused responded “No”. The deceased replied “Well, if you aren’t going to help me then why are you here?” or words to that effect. Ola witnessed this exchange.
	
	
	After that, Ola heard, but did not see, the accused speaking in Arabic to the deceased. At that time, the accused had to have been either in the kitchen or at the door to the kitchen. He said:
	


“Do you think I’m spending the night here? I’m not sleeping here tonight, I’m not sleeping here tonight.”


	
	According to Ola, the accused and the deceased began to yell at each other. She thought this was not unusual as often when the accused was angry he would yell. At that stage the deceased was in the kitchen.
	
	
	The next thing that Ola remembers is hearing the deceased scream. She ran into the kitchen and saw the deceased backed into a corner in the kitchen. She saw that the accused was stabbing her in the back. Ola attempted to put herself between the accused and the deceased, and to push the accused away from the deceased. Whilst that was occurring, the accused continued to stab at the deceased.
	
	
	Ola remembers feeling a pain in her hands at a time when the physical struggle between the accused and the deceased moved out of the kitchen and into the living area. Ola continued attempting to push the accused off the deceased. She was unsuccessful. The accused continued to attack the deceased. At some point Ola observed that the accused was holding the deceased up against the door by her hair. By reference to the photos of the scene and particularly the location of blood stains on the wall, the deceased was probably at or near the front door, and adjacent to a lounge which had a lot of blood on it.
	
	
	Ola screamed at the deceased, asking him to stop and asking him what he thought he was doing. Ola screamed for help. She also recalls that at some point during this attack the accused called the deceased a “slut” in Arabic.
	
	
	Ola continued asking the accused to stop. At one point, she recalled saying to the accused “Dad, what’re you doing? Stop”. She said that he responded “No, no, it’s fine, no it’s fine”.
	
	
	At another moment, when Ola was screaming for help, she recalled the accused saying to her “What’re you doing, why are you screaming? Stop screaming” as he continued to attack the deceased. Ola heard the deceased saying to the accused “Haydar, I didn’t do anything, I didn’t do anything”. The accused did not respond. He did not stop his attack.
	
	
	Having unsuccessfully attempted to stop the attack and deter the accused, Ola took hold of the telephone and rang 000. She recounted, and I believe her, that when she did this the accused continued with his stabbing attack and looked at her and said “What’re you doing”.  She gave this account (speaking of the time when she went to the telephone), which I accept:
	


“He kept going, and he looked at me and said ‘what’re you doing?’ and when he saw me, like dialling the phone and he continued and like, he would look back and continue, like I felt like I noticed him pause and then continue and then pause.”


	
	I took from this description that the accused was pausing in the course of the attack to observe Ola making the phone call, and to see or hear if she was connected to the emergency services, and what response was being made to Ola. It appears that the accused ceased the attack and left the house once a connection had been established. Ola’s evidence suggested this, and the contents of the 000 call points to this conclusion.
	
	
	The 000 phone call made by Ola to the police gives some sense of Ola’s reaction to what had occurred. What she had witnessed was obviously very frightening and distressing. She had seen the deceased brutally attacked and there was obviously a great deal of blood on both the deceased and on Ola.
	
	
	Ola is recorded on the 000 phone calls as saying that the accused had stabbed the deceased and that he had also stabbed her (Ola). She said that he had run away. She told the 000 operator that the deceased had a cut (or cuts) to her face and was bleeding profusely. She was given advice to assist the deceased in particular ways. Ola said this to the 000 operator:
	


“My dad came back from Lebanon today, and he just got home, and my mum was in the kitchen, and then he, I don’t know what happened … he got up and he picked up a knife from somewhere, and he started going crazy. I tried to stop them.”


	
	At another point, Ola told the 000 operator that she did not know where all the cuts on her mother were. It was during that exchange that she discovered that she herself had been wounded. She said that there were so many wounds that she could not attend to them all. Ola said at another point that there was a “just blood everywhere”.
	
	
	Police were the first to arrive on the scene and attempted first aid and resuscitation on the deceased. Shortly afterwards ambulance officers arrived and attempted to save the deceased’s life. The police and ambulance officers were unsuccessful and shortly after the ambulance officers arrived the deceased died whilst still in the Bexley townhouse.
	
	
	The accused left the scene in a Mitsubishi Lancer sedan. He drove to his brother’s house, parked the car outside and walked into the house. What occurred there is the subject of evidence from the accused’s brother, Khalil. Khalil is an older brother of the accused who lives with his family nearby in Bexley.
	
	
	Khalil was not a particularly impressive witness to my observation. I had the clear impression that he only gave evidence of what it was that he thought would assist the accused, his brother. I do not regard his evidence as independent or particularly reliable.
	
	
	Khalil said that he was at home that night at about 7pm, sitting with some relatives in the backyard of his house. He saw the accused come out of the backdoor of the house and down some stairs towards where he was sitting. He had not expected to see his brother because there had been no prior arrangement about the visit.
	
	
	Khalil gave this description of the accused:
	


“When I saw him I immediately felt that I did not recognise him. He was in such a disturbed state that I felt immediate shock at the sight of him.

He looked frail and deranged, with a yellow face. He was shaking uncontrollably and his eyes were bulging out of his face. He did not look like a normal person.

…

He had his whole body bent over, he was shaking uncontrollably and his face was shaking and disturbed as he looked up at me.”


	
	No other witness who was present at Khalil’s house gave evidence about the accused’s appearance. Other hearsay evidence of observations did not contain such descriptions – being limited to the fact that the accused was covered in blood.
	
	
	I am satisfied that many of his descriptions of the accused exaggerated the state of the accused.
	
	
	The accused asked to be taken to a hospital. Khalil took him outside to his Toyota Corolla sedan. He helped the accused into the front passenger seat and began driving towards the hospital. Whilst on the way, the accused said to his brother “Take me to the police station”. Khalil asked his brother what was wrong, and the accused responded “I had a fight with my wife”. There was then an angry exchange between Khalil and his brother, which Khalil reported as being most unusual because he had never known his brother to be aggressive.
	
	
	Khalil took the accused to the Kogarah Police Station and dropped him out the front. He asked if the accused wanted him to accompany him into the Station and was told “Watch out for me in case I collapse”.
	
	
	Constable Heydon Spurrier was rostered on duty at Kogarah Police Station. He gave evidence that at 19:07 hours on 30 March 2015, the accused walked into the front foyer of Kogarah Police Station. As soon as he (Constable Spurrier) completed a telephone call, he spoke to the accused at the front counter. The accused said “I’ve just had a fight with my wife”. He was shown into the interview room. Constable Spurrier records that he observed that the accused was covered in blood – both of his hands were red in colour and he could not see one bit of skin on the accused’s hands that was not covered in blood. He observed that the accused was wearing a long sleeved shirt which had bloodstains on both sleeves from the wrist to the elbow. He also observed that the accused had dried blood on his face and a small horizontal cut about 3cm in length above his left eyebrow.
	
	
	Constable Spurrier administered an appropriate caution to the accused, and the accused then volunteered the following: “I just stabbed her. I just stabbed her”. Constable Spurrer asked who he was talking about and the accused responded, “My wife. I just stabbed my wife. I can’t feel anything now. I just got back from Lebanon and we had a fight”.
	
	
	The accused was then searched and taken to the custody area. No weapon was found on the accused.
	
	
	Senior Constable Reagan Burnett was the Custody Manager on that shift. He observed the accused as he was being processed into the custody management system. He established that the accused understood English and did not require the services of an interpreter. As is the ordinary course, Senior Constable Burnett asked the accused a series of questions, and made a visual assessment of the accused. He recorded that the accused did not show any signs of severe agitation or aggressiveness, and that he did not appear to be irrational. He made an assessment of the accused’s vulnerability and concluded that the accused did not have any impaired intellectual or physical function. He specifically asked the accused whether he had a history of, or whether he currently had, any mental illness. The accused responded in the negative.
	
	
	Senior Constable Burnett observed the accused’s clothing. He recorded that there were blood stains on the left hand side of the accused’s shirt near the breast pocket. He recorded that the accused’s trousers had blood stains on the front and back of the lower leg and that the accused had blood on the back of his right hand together with an abrasion, blood on the back of his left hand and also to the cuff area of both arms of the shirt. He observed that the accused was barefoot. There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of his evidence. I accept it as giving accurate observations of the state of the accused.
	
	
	Shortly after 9pm, the accused was searched and his clothing was removed and placed into exhibit bags. He was provided with a substitute forensic suit. The accused was filmed whilst that process took place – the film is an exhibit and I have viewed it. At the time of the film, the accused did not appear to be in any way disturbed or distressed. To my observation he behaved rationally and was entirely compliant with the requests made of him. I did not observe him making any communication of substance at all.
	
	
	Also on that evening whilst in custody at the police station, the accused had a number of discussions with his solicitor. At about 9.20pm, the accused was moved to an interview room in order to undergo a formal recorded interview. Again, the video of that interview has been tendered as an exhibit – I have viewed it. The interview is relatively short. Although the accused agreed with the version of events which he gave to Constable Spurrier on his arrival at Kogarah Police Station, he otherwise declined to answer any questions. In so declining, the accused indicated that he had received and was acting upon legal advice.
	


Other Police Investigations


	
	Further investigations by police assisted in determining what else the accused did after he left the Bexley townhouse where he killed the deceased.
	
	
	As indicated earlier, the accused drove his Mitsubishi Sedan from the scene. When the car was found and examined, police located a knife on the front passenger seat. That knife has been tested. The testing has revealed that the blood on the knife is that of the deceased. The knife has been tendered in evidence, and I have examined it closely. It measures approximately 210mm, the blade is about 110mm and the handle takes up the balance. The handle appears to be of anodised aluminium and is orange in colour. The knife when tendered appeared to have a bend in the blade. It is also very sharp. It is quite light. When found, it was lying to the rear of the front passenger seat and was in full and plain view. As well, on the front passenger seat there was a tissue which had red blood stains on it. Blood stains were found elsewhere in the car including on the driver’s side door and on the steering wheel. It is plain that the accused drove this vehicle from the scene to his brother’s house.
	
	
	On the backseat of the car was a medium-sized travel bag apparently on wheels, with a prominent luggage tag from Emirates Airlines. That is the airline with which the accused flew on his return to Australia on that morning. It appeared to be a bag which was of a size that could be carried on as cabin luggage.
	
	
	Police also examined the boot of the car. In the boot was a larger suitcase which also had an Emirates Airlines baggage tag attached to it. A video was taken during the internal examination of the bag, which I have viewed carefully. The contents of the bag were tidily packed suggesting that some thought and care had been taken, and that the accused had packed it himself. Inside the bag police found a pocket knife with a folding blade. Unfolding the knife required the blade to be released by depressing a spring-loaded button. When the knife was folded it would be capable of being carried conveniently and concealed from public view in a trouser pocket. There is no suggestion that this knife was used in any way by the accused during his attack on the deceased.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Howard went to Khalil’s home on 31 May 2015. She was taken to an upstairs bedroom where Khalil pointed out two bags which, he told police, had been brought to his home on the previous evening by the accused. The first bag was a black coloured ASIC brand small travel bag containing two passports in the name of the accused, one being an Australian passport and the other being a Lebanese passport. It included cash, travel documents in the accused’s name and two Apple iPhones – one was green in colour and the other was white in colour. The police later identified the green iPhone as that normally used by the accused and the white iPhone as that normally used by the deceased. This bag was described by police, perhaps curiously, as a black toiletries bag. Notwithstanding that no toiletries were found in it, both parties used the police description during the trial.
	
	
	The second bag located in the upstairs bedroom was the deceased’s Cellini brand handbag. It contained a variety of items including a wallet with identification, bankcards, cash, personal papers and a number of other individual items. No mobile telephone was found in the handbag. The handbag, which was tendered, has been examined carefully. It appears to be in very good condition. The lining of it is a light satin type of material which does not show any signs of any wear or damage. In particular, there was no sign in the lining or anywhere else, or on the outside of the handbag, of any incisions or cuts being made by a knife.
	


Ms Ola Haydar


	
	Ola was taken by ambulance to the St George Hospital. She was seen by Dr Katie Bluett. Dr Bluett observed that on her left hand there was a 2cm superficial laceration through the skin on the palmar aspect of the thumb. On Ola’s right hand she observed that the injuries were considerably more serious. There was an inverted “V” shaped laceration over the back of the proximal phalanx of the index finger measuring about 1.5cm on each arm of the “V”. This cut exposed the extensor tendons. There was also a 7mm linear laceration over the lateral aspect of the back of the proximal phalanx of the middle finger. Both of the lacerations on the right hand extended through the skin. An x-ray did not show any abnormality. Ola’s wounds were cleaned and dressed. Her right hand was immobilised in a plaster splint. She was given antibiotics and analgesia.
	
	
	Because Ola’s hand needed surgical exploration and repair in an operating theatre, she was referred to the Sydney Hospital Specialist Hand Clinic where that occurred in the following days.
	


Post Mortem Examination


	
	A post mortem examination was undertaken of the deceased’s body by Dr Istvan Szentmariay. Dr Szentmariay is a special forensic pathologist. He was not required for cross-examination. His report was not in any way disputed. I accept entirely what he has said.
	
	
	The pathologist found that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds. The mechanism of that cause of death was noted to be significant blood loss from these stab wounds, and acute respiratory compromise due to defects of the integrity of the chest wall caused by the stab wounds.
	
	
	The pathologist undertook an external examination which showed a “heavily blood soaked upper body” with a number of stab wounds present over the body. In addition, there were a number of defensive-type sharp force injuries on both arms, though more pronounced on the left side. Several small surgical scars were also noted.
	
	
	In the post-mortem report a summary of the wounds was given. The pathologist found three stab wounds (one from the back, two from the front) on the right side of the deceased’s torso which subsequently entered the chest cavity and underlying lung, causing massive haemorrhage and the accumulation of 800mL of blood in the right side of the chest. Two stab wounds which entered the left side of the chest (one from the back and one from the front) and subsequently the lungs were also noted. The lower of these two wounds, which was located on the left hemithorax, went through the diaphragm and the parenchyma of the spleen with 100mL of blood found to be present in the left hemithorax and less than 50mL in the abdomen. The second stab wound, which was in the middle of the front chest, penetrated the chest cavity and injured the superior vena cava, an artery which delivers deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart.
	
	
	The pathologist catalogued the following wounds, in addition to the serious wounds which I later describe:
	



	
	A superficial stab wound on the back of the right thigh measuring 14.3cm.
	
	
	An oblique stab wound to the left clavicular region with a length of 5 cm and a depth of 3.5 cm, which did not enter the chest cavity.
	
	
	An oblique stab wound over the left breast with a length of 5.8 cm. The wound track went through the superior portion of the 7th rib and the intercostal soft tissue between the 6th and 7th ribs, causing a 3 cm defect on the associated lung membrane. It continued into the left pleural cavity and the adjacent left upper lobe, terminating in the left upper lobe. 100mL of blood was present in the left pleural cavity as a result.
	
	
	An inverted “U” shaped cut on the left breast which did not perforate the chest cavity.
	
	
	A stab wound to the upper chest on the midline which entered the chest between the 1st and 2nd ribs, resulting in a 1.3 cm ‘slit-like defect’ on the inner aspect of the sternum and causing a 0.3 cm cut through the superior vena cava with associated haemorrhage of the adjacent soft tissues.
	
	
	A stab wound over the right breast which entered the chest cavity nearly vertically and entered the anterior aspect of the right upper lobe, terminating in the parenchyma of the right lung. 800 mL of blood in the right pleural cavity resulted from this wound.
	
	
	A stab wound on the front of the left lower leg with a length and depth of 2.5 cm.
	
	
	A complex superficial wound on the front aspect of the right thigh with a length of 5.5 cm.
	



	
	As well, the pathologist described a series of wounds which appear to me to have been inflicted as the deceased held her arms up to protect herself from the attack. They are wounds which can be readily and conveniently described as “defensive wounds”. They include:
	



	
	An irregular superficial cut on back of left upper arm with a length of 13.7 cm;
	
	
	A linear superficial cut on back of the left forearm with a length of 7 cm;
	
	
	An oblique cut to the inner left wrist with a length of 5.3cm;
	
	
	Several injuries to the left hand:
	



	
	two cuts to the little finger;
	
	
	three cuts to the middle finder;
	
	
	a cut to the ring finger;
	
	
	two superficial cuts to the index finger;
	



	
	Two sharp force injuries on the inner aspect of the right palm, on the right index finger and the right middle finger;
	
	
	Three wounds forming one complex stab wound on the side of the left forearm of 2.1, 4.2 and 5.6cm, the deepest wound having a depth of 6 cm with damage to underlying muscle;
	
	
	A stab wound on the left forearm;
	
	
	A superficial cut on the left elbow;
	
	
	A superficial cut on the left wrist;
	
	
	A superficial sharp force injury to the back of the left hand;
	
	
	A superficial wound on the right elbow; and
	
	
	A wound on the outer aspect of the right forearm.
	



	
	The pathologist also noted that there were 12 superficial cuts and abrasions present on the body. He noted other injuries as well which were much less serious.
	
	
	The ordinary routine pathology tests were undertaken. Toxicology of blood and urine showed no alcohol, commonly used medications or illicit drugs in the deceased’s system.
	
	
	I accept the finding of the pathologist as to the cause of death, the nature, type and location of the stab wounds, and the other injuries. As counsel for the accused accepted in submissions, when combined with the contemporaneous account of events, the injuries evidence a ferocious, sustained and persistent attack. I also conclude that the wounds evidence the use of force on the part of the accused.
	
	
	It will be necessary to consider some particular wounds in greater detail in due course.
	


Psychiatric Opinions


	
	Expert evidence was also given about the accused by three psychiatrists, Dr Nielssen, Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore. It was accepted by the Crown and the accused that all three were appropriately qualified and suitably experienced to express an opinion about the psychiatric state of the accused at the relevant time, and about the concepts embodied in the impairment defence. I also accept that.
	
	
	Although there was a large measure of agreement between these three experts, it will be necessary to examine their views when they differ and, by reference to all of the evidence including their opinions, to come to a view as to which opinion I accept.
	
	
	It is also necessary to note that each of the psychiatric opinions is largely based on the history given by the accused to each psychiatrist in the course of a consultation between the accused and the psychiatrist.
	
	
	The evidence given by the psychiatrists, either in their reports or orally about the history obtained from the accused, is hearsay evidence. It was evidence of an account given out of court by the accused as to his recollection of events relevant to his impairment and his offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that because the evidence was hearsay, I should give myself a direction of the kind set out in s 165(2) of the Evidence Act 1995, namely, that the evidence may be unreliable because it was not given in the witness box and it was not subject to being tested by cross-examination. The Crown submitted that I should direct myself that there was a need for caution to be exercised in determining whether to accept the evidence, and in the weight to be given to it.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused submitted that such a direction was not warranted in the particular circumstances of this case. Counsel accepted that, even without the direction sought by the Crown, I should remind myself that the reliability of the accused’s history given to the psychiatrists and the weight to be accorded to that history, were matters for me to consider and weigh up in light of all of the other evidence, including the surrounding circumstances and the probability of what in fact occurred.
	
	
	It follows that the reliability of these histories and weight to be given to them remains a live issue which is to be determined by me. In light of that concession by counsel for the accused, and in light of the fact that this is a judge alone trial, I decline to give myself the direction sought by the Crown. In any event, the warning described in s 165(2) of the Evidence Act applies, in its terms, only to a trial before a jury.
	
	
	It is convenient now to review the evidence of the psychiatrists.
	
	
	Dr Olav Nielssen was the first specialist psychiatrist to speak with and perform an examination on the accused. He interviewed the accused at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre (“MRRC”) on 7 April 2015. He followed this up with an audio visual link consultation when the accused was at the Long Bay Correctional Centre on 13 January 2016.
	
	
	Based on those interviews and other documents with which he was provided, Dr Nielssen formed an opinion which he expressed in a report dated 14 January 2016.
	
	
	It is appropriate to record some of the particular features of the history given by the accused to Dr Nielssen. They are these:
	



	
	the accused told Dr Nielssen that about a week before he left for Lebanon he read recent text messages on the deceased’s mobile phone and formed the impression that his wife was not faithful to him. He said:
	


“At this moment I took a picture of one of the messages and made the decision not to live with this lady who pretends to be an angel any more”;


	
	the accused said that he did not want to lose his wife and offered to buy her a ticket to come with him on the trip, but she declined;
	
	
	the accused gave this history to Dr Nielssen about a discussion with his wife about the rent. He said:
	


“… that she then asked him for rent for the period he would be away, and he told her ‘I am not paying because when I come back I will be living somewhere else’ ”;


	
	the accused said that whilst he was in Lebanon he lost 10 or 11kg in weight because he did not feel like eating and had to force himself to eat;
	
	
	the accused told Dr Nielssen that he had had very little sleep and had whole nights with no sleep at all.
	



	
	With respect to the history of the particular events immediately before he stabbed the deceased, the accused gave this version to Dr Nielssen:
	


“He said that he took a taxi from the airport to the family home and said that he was waiting there until his wife arrived home, as he wanted to take her mobile phone and leave. He said:

‘I wanted to show my daughters what their mother was doing … this mum who always gave lectures on how to be good would end up doing these things.’

He said:

“When she arrived we said hello … she had her bag on the table … we started doing something to eat … I did not have my glasses on … I did not find her mobile and found a knife in the bag … I did not have a chance to keep searching … I left the phone in the bag … I was sitting on the couch, she said can you go to the garage to get some oil, and I told her I was tired and I told her where it should be … she said if you don’t want to go and get them, you can get out of here now … I do not want my daughter to hear what I wanted to say … I ask this wife ‘are you following someone’s instructions’ … she said ‘yes, and it has nothing to do with you’ and she hit me with her elbow … I do not know what happened after that … I remember nothing from that time … all I remember is I am puffing … and I knew that the daughter is there … that is all I remember.”


	
	The accused indicated that he had no memory at all of harming his wife or his daughter. I accept that in many cases involving violence of the kind which occurred here, an accused does not have a memory of what occurred that they are capable of articulating. I have not concluded that the accused in fact has a memory of these facts and circumstances which he intentionally withheld from the psychiatrists.
	
	
	The accused’s further history included that he denied to Dr Nielssen contemplating hurting his wife beforehand and said:
	


“Not at all … wholeheartedly I wanted to save her … she was playing the role of someone else”.


	
	The accused denied feeling angry towards his wife and told Dr Nielssen that in the time he spent overseas, he became convinced that he should move elsewhere to live. He said he had made arrangements with his real estate agent to ask the tenants to leave his apartment so he could move into it. He then said this to Dr Nielssen:
	


“‘I wanted to have my daughters with me if I leave … I wanted to have the telephone to show the girls what’s in there.”


	
	This was a reference to the deceased’s mobile telephone and the text messages on it which he had previously read.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed the accused as having a depressive illness. He said that that diagnosis was made on the basis of the history which he received of a syndrome of depression which reportedly first emerged after the altercation between the deceased and her son. Dr Nielssen thought that the depressive illness was exacerbated after the accused formed the view that his wife was being unfaithful to him. Dr Nielssen also found that, whilst the accused was overseas, both his lack of sleep and his interrupted sleep, together with his loss of appetite, his significant weight loss, his constant rumination on negative themes, and his impaired mental performance, were all demonstrative of a significant depressive illness.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen went on to say this:
	


“Mr Haydar would be able to raise the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. He had an underlying condition in the form of a depressive illness that had been apparent to Mr Haydar’s brother from the time of the dispute between his wife and his son, which was also around the time that the marriage began to fail. His state of depression became more severe after it became clear that the marriage was over, shortly before Mr Haydar left for Lebanon. From the information that is available, I believe at the time of the offence Mr Haydar was affected by an abnormality of mind arising from his underlying condition, that affected his perception of the events and his ability to control his actions.

Mr Haydar’s perception of the events was affected by the negative appraisal of his situation and the impairment in intellectual function arising from a state of severe depression. …

From the information that is available, I believe that Mr Haydar’s abnormality of mind at the time of the offence significantly affected his capacity for self-control. There was no history of any previous physical violence, apart from the single pushing episode some years earlier. The nature of the offence itself, including that it was committed on the spur of the moment without premeditation and also resulted in the injury to his daughter who attempted to intervene, is consistent with impairment in Mr Haydar’s ability to control his actions.”


	
	In his evidence, Dr Nielssen was asked whether the provision to him of some additional factual material relating to those details about the relationship between the deceased and the accused caused him to change his mind. He said that it did not.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen confirmed orally that he was of the opinion that the psychiatric condition of the accused, namely depression, substantially impaired his self‑control.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Dr Nielssen agreed that the two factors principally responsible for the exacerbation of the accused’s depression during the time he was in Lebanon prior to his attack on his wife, were the accused’s belief that his wife was being unfaithful and his knowledge that upon his return to Australia he would be moving out of the Bexley townhouse to live apart from her.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen also agreed that, based on the history he was given, and in particular the use by the accused of the Arabic word for “slut” in the course of his attack on the deceased, the attack was based on the accused’s genuine, and not psychotic, belief that his wife was unfaithful. He had earlier agreed that such a belief (in the unfaithfulness of the deceased) could lead to jealousy which might result in behaviour of an unexpected kind.
	
	
	Dr Bruce Westmore, who is also a specialist forensic psychiatrist, saw the accused at the Long Bay Prison Hospital on 21 March 2016. He prepared a report dated 30 March 2016, which was tendered.
	
	
	The history obtained by Dr Westmore was consistent with that obtained by Dr Nielssen. There were some additional features. The accused told Dr Westmore that he arrived back in Australia and left suitcases in his car. He said that he did not have any intention of staying at home that night.
	
	
	The accused then gave this history:
	


“In the evening, my youngest daughter and her mother came back home. My intention was, all I wanted was to take her mobile and leave. I wanted to show my daughters (and tell them) your mother, who pretends to be an angel, look what she is doing and she is about to be a grandmother now.

…

Her (wife’s) bag was on the table in a dark spot. I put my hand into (the bag) to feel if the telephone is there. I found a knife and I took the knife and put it quickly in my pocket. I moved my hand in the bag to feel the mobile. There were some papers. I couldn’t find the phone and I didn’t want to stay there longer.

…

She (wife) asked me, she wanted to do some dinner. She asked me to go to the garage and get some oil. I said, as far as I know there is no oil left there. She said, if you don’t want to get the oil, get out of here, we don’t need you here. I said to her, you (wife) are doing what someone else is asking you to do, and she knew exactly what I meant. When I had told her that, I could tell (she knew what I was saying). She screamed, she hit me with her elbow on my chest. After that I cannot remember anything. “


	
	The accused denied to Dr Westmore that he had been jealous of his wife, telling him (Dr Westmore) that he thought that she used to try and make him feel that she was jealous. However, he did tell Dr Westmore that he was angry about his wife’s infidelity.
	
	
	Dr Westmore expressed this conclusion:
	


“Psychiatric Diagnostic Issues

Based on Mr Haydar’s history and supported to some degree by his clinical presentation, my provisional diagnosis is that Mr Haydar developed a major depressive disorder in the weeks and possibly months leading up to the index offence. I would agree with Dr Nielssen when he reports that Mr Haydar’s mood state appears to have significantly deteriorated just prior to his trip to Lebanon and certainly while away he describes having significant problems not only with his mood but with his sleep patterns, his appetite and weight. There is reported to have been a very significant weight loss over a short period of time. He also describes a loss of energy and an absent libido.”


	
	Dr Westmore also expressed some views about Mr Haydar’s psychiatric state after the incident and whilst in custody.
	
	
	He concluded in this way:
	


“On the balance of probability, Mr Haydar was in my opinion, suffering from a major depressive disorder at the time the offending behaviour occurred. Like Dr Nielssen, … he was, from a psychiatric perspective suffering from an abnormality of mind (a major depressive disorder) which would, on the balance of probability, have impaired his ability to control his actions at the relevant time.”


	
	He went on to express this conclusion:
	


“I do believe that Mr Haydar could raise the defence of substantial impairment on the basis that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind (major depressive disorder) at the time the offending behaviour occurred. I do agree that his ability to control his actions was impaired as a result of his major depressive disorder. It will, I understand, be a matter for the Court to determine whether his capacity to control his behaviour was substantially impaired.”


	
	In oral evidence, Dr Westmore said that he was of the opinion that the accused’s ability to control himself was substantially impaired by his depression. He described the depression as playing a “pivotal” role in the events which occurred.
	
	
	Dr Westmore concluded that the accused’s depression at the time he attacked the deceased would properly be described as moderate to severe. He rejected the description of the accused’s condition as being mild to moderate on the basis of the account the accused gave in his history of the “… disturbance of his biological functions …” – evidence which I took to include the lack of sleep and loss of weight which, according to the accused, occurred whilst he was in Lebanon.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Dr Westmore accepted the following matters, again based on what he had been told:
	



	
	that nothing which the deceased had said to the accused, or had done to him, would be regarded as a significant or aggressive act, but in fact were properly described as very minor;
	
	
	that it was quite possible that the accused, having brought the knife into the kitchen, retaliated with it intending to strike the deceased immediately after he thought that the deceased had pushed him with her elbow; and
	
	
	the conduct of the accused and his general loss of control was also an indication of an angry person, in control, satisfying his anger.
	



	
	In re-examination, Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that the actions of the accused after he left the Bexley townhouse were more consistent with a person whose conduct occurred through a loss of control rather than premeditation or pre-planning.
	
	
	Dr Stephen Allnutt saw the accused a short time after he was seen by Dr Westmore. Dr Allnutt was retained by the prosecution.
	
	
	The accused gave a more detailed history to Dr Allnutt about his time in Lebanon than he gave to the other two psychiatrists. Dr Allnutt recorded this history:
	


“By the time [the accused] left Lebanon he was depressed. He had poor sleep and was sleeping two hours a night, waking up all the time and having difficulty getting back to sleep. He said ‘I hardly slept in Lebanon’. He lost about 10 kg due to reduced appetite. His energy levels were ‘weak’ and he had reduced motivation. He couldn’t concentrate and if he read something he couldn’t recall what he had read. He was unable to focus on conversations and didn’t want to sit and talk to anyone. He had low self-esteem and thought of himself as a ‘complete failure’. He had lost confidence in himself and had thoughts such as ‘This is the life I had for 28 years. My son is in jail. She has time to do these things and I was in a different world’. He was thinking about his son and his two girls who would be devastated by the knowledge that their mother was having an affair. He had lost interest in things and found pleasure in ‘nothing’. ”


	
	The accused told Dr Allnutt that during the course of the day on 30 March 2015, he withdrew money from the bank so as to enable him to rent some accommodation. He gave Dr Allnutt this account of the events leading up to the death of the deceased:
	


“His wife asked him to go out to the garage and there was some discussion about him getting oil. He said he did not think there was oil. In the back of his mind he was thinking the only thing he wanted to do was to get her mobile, then leave, and at an opportune moment show his daughters the proof (on the phone – if she denied the affair).

He said that when she came home she had put her work bag on the table. He went to the bag to check for her phone and instead found a knife. He took the knife and put it in his pocket. He said putting it in his pocket was an automatic reaction and made reference to using the knife to peel fruit. He recalled she asked him to leave because he didn’t want to help her.

Then he came near her and said ‘You are following the instructions of someone’. He said that from the way she looked at him, she knew what he meant. She elbowed him in the chest and he had no recollection of events after that moment.”


	
	Dr Allnutt expressed this opinion about the accused’s mental state at the time of the killing:
	


“The alleged offending occurred in the evening at his home at a time when his daughter was present. It involved the use of a knife and the victim was his wife of 26 years. His description of the offence was that it was not pre-planned but was impulsive. He had retrieved a knife from his wife’s bag just prior to the alleged offence. It was preceded by an argument or discussion in relation to him helping or not helping his wife on a background of a perception he held that his wife was having an affair prior to him going to Lebanon, and was acting on the instructions of someone (presumably her lover) just prior to the index offence. The offending behaviour resulted in the death of his wife and injury to his daughter.”


	
	Dr Allnutt went on to consider the matter further, and concluded that the depressive symptoms active at the material time were consistent with an underlying condition which could cause an abnormality of mind. Dr Allnutt then said this:
	


“Having regard to the information, I do not believe that accused was substantially impaired in his capacity to understand events. (He was capable of understanding what a knife was and had an understanding of what the consequences of using a knife might be. His conclusion that his wife was having an affair was erroneous but there was an understandable basis for him to hold this belief, it was not a delusional belief. However once suspicious he became ruminative about this and this likely aggravated his depression and vulnerability to emotionality).

In my view, he was not substantially impaired to the extent that he did not know right from wrong.

If the Court concludes (based on the evidence) that the alleged offending behaviour was not pre-meditated but constituted a loss of control – then the issue in this case is whether or not he lost capacity to control his actions due to his ‘underlying condition’. …

I believe it is unlikely that his depression and anxiety was of such a severity that he was substantially impaired in his capacity to control his actions in the absence of a trigger but, having regard to all preceding events and his ruminative preoccupation with his wife’s infidelity at the material time of the alleged offence, he was vulnerable to reacting emotionally to triggers such as perceived rejection or evidence of infidelity. His depression would have aggravated his vulnerability to emotional reaction under these sorts of circumstances. While his actions at the material time of the alleged offence could have occurred in the absence of a depression (for example, driven purely by emotions such as jealousy, humiliation or resentment) the presence of a depression cannot be disregarded because depression is prone to aggravate these sorts of emotions. On this basis he has a defence of substantial impairment open to him.”


	
	Dr Allnutt, in oral evidence, said that the accused’s depression was in the mild to moderate range. He reached this conclusion, he said, because although the accused had a relatively moderate to high loading of symptoms, he only had a moderate to low level of impairment of his functioning.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Dr Allnutt agreed with senior counsel for the accused that the conduct of the accused after he left the Bexley townhouse was consistent with his having lost his self-control rather than any premeditation or prior planning, but he agreed that this conclusion depended for its validity upon the length of time available for the pre-planning.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt also made it plain that whilst his opinion was that the accused was suffering, by reason of his depression, from an impairment of his ability to control himself, he was not expressing any opinion as to whether the accused did in fact lose control of himself when he attacked the deceased.
	


Accuracy and Reliability of History


	
	Although, as I have indicated above, a great deal of the factual material was not in dispute in the trial, there were some questions raised about the accuracy of some parts of the history given by the accused to the psychiatrists. As is apparent from the review of their evidence, the psychiatrists relied upon the accuracy of those histories.
	
	
	The first contested question related to whether or not in the two weeks or so the accused was in Lebanon, he lost 10 kg of weight; the second contested question of fact was the provenance of the knife which was the weapon used to kill the deceased; and the third contested question was the time at which the accused accessed, and took possession of, the deceased’s mobile telephone.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal with each of these separately.
	


Loss of 10kg of Weight


	
	The accused gave a history to each of the psychiatrists that whilst he was in Lebanon, he lost about 10 kg in weight.
	
	
	He was accompanied by his brother, Abbas, whilst he was in Lebanon. Abbas gave evidence, which was unchallenged, that he and the accused travelled to Lebanon together, spent 95% of the time there together and that he farewelled the accused as he got onto the bus taking him to the airport to return home. Although Abbas observed that the accused “… was not being social …” he said nothing at all in his statement about observing any weight loss by the accused whilst they were in Lebanon. In evidence he was unable to say whether he had in fact observed that the accused had actually lost weight whilst they were in Lebanon. He did say that the accused did not eat very much whilst they were in Lebanon.
	
	
	Upon the accused’s return to Sydney, his two daughters saw him at the Bexley townhouse. They had both seen him in the days leading up to his departure to Lebanon: that is, a fortnight or so earlier. Ola gave evidence about the accused’s appearance on that morning. She did not describe any apparent or obvious weight loss, although she was in close proximity to her father that morning and, again, in the evening of 30 March 2015.
	
	
	Nour also gave evidence that she saw her father on the morning of his return to Sydney. In their conversation, she said, her father reported to her that he had not slept whilst in Lebanon, but had said nothing about any weight loss during that period. The entire conversation occupied a reasonable length of time. Nour initially gave no evidence of observing her father as having lost any weight. When recalled, she said that she had not observed any difference in her father’s appearance between when he went to Lebanon and when he returned home. Although her evidence was challenged on this aspect, I accept it. It accords with the bulk of the other evidence.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a video recording taken on the evening of 30 March 2015 of a procedure where the accused was required to undress himself and hand his clothes to a police officer so that they could be forensically preserved and examined. Although this is not a particularly scientific observation, to a reasonable observing eye during that process, the trousers of the accused were well-fitted and there was no obvious looseness around the waistband which would have been expected if there had been a sudden loss of weight of 10kg, which I estimate would have been at least 10% of the accused’s body weight.
	
	
	On any view having regard to the accused’s size before going to Lebanon, the loss of 10kg in two weeks would be a significant and substantial weight loss which I would expect to have been obvious to his brother and to his two daughters. None of them initially gave evidence of any such weight loss, and it was not suggested to them in cross-examination that they had observed any such weight loss.
	
	
	I have concluded that I am unable to accept the history that the accused gave of losing 10kg in weight during his time in Lebanon as being reliable. Whilst it is possible that he lost some weight, I do not accept that it was of such significance as to be taken into account as a meaningful symptom of the mental state of the accused at the time of the killing.
	
	
	However, there are other indicia established by the evidence which can be taken into account as part of the constellation of symptoms from which he was suffering which point to the nature and severity of his depressive illness. Accordingly, my rejection of the history of 10kg of weight loss does not stand in the way of a conclusion that the accused was suffering from depression.
	
	
	The effect of my conclusion on this issue is only that this part of the histories is unreliable, and that I must exercise caution when considering the other parts of the histories which are alleged.
	


Provenance of the Knife


	
	The Crown case abundantly proves, and the accused accepted, that the knife found in the accused’s car, which has an orange handle, was used by the accused to stab the deceased.
	
	
	It has the following features of which, from photographs and a careful examination of the actual knife, I am satisfied:
	



	
	it is about 210mm in overall length;
	
	
	the blade measures about 110mm;
	
	
	the width of the blade prior to it narrowing to a point is about 20mm;
	
	
	the handle appears to be of anodised aluminium or some similar composition;
	
	
	overall, the knife is quite light and the blade even now remains sharp, on one of its edges and at its point.
	



	
	The only evidence that the knife was brought to the Bexley townhouse by being carried in the deceased’s handbag was that contained in the history given by the accused to the psychiatrists. The accused told each of the psychiatrists that when he was at the Bexley townhouse on the evening of 30 March 2015, he went to the deceased’s handbag to search for and locate the deceased’s mobile telephone, intending to remove it and keep it himself. He told Dr Nielssen that:
	


“I put my hand into [the bag] to feel if the telephone is there. I found a knife and I took the knife and put it quickly in my pocket.”


	
	He gave Dr Allnutt a very similar history, adding that:
	


“… putting [the knife] in his pocket was an automatic reaction and made reference to using the knife to peel fruit.”


	
	He gave Dr Westmore a similar history to that given to the other two psychiatrists.
	
	
	It is important to assess the reliability of these histories about the knife being carried in the deceased’s handbag because it directly affects his account of the events leading up to the attack on the deceased. In assessing the reliability, I need to take into account the fact of the accused’s good character and how that might support his general credibility. I give it appropriate weight.
	
	
	According to the unchallenged evidence of each of the three daughters of the accused and the deceased, they did not recognise the knife when it was shown to them prior to giving evidence. They said that they had not seen it before. They said that it did not form part of a set of knives used or stored in the kitchen in the Bexley townhouse. They said that it did not come from the townhouse. I accept this evidence. The knife has a distinctive appearance which, I am satisfied, would have been readily observed if it had been kept in the kitchen of the Bexley townhouse.
	
	
	According to Amani’s unchallenged evidence, the only knife that her mother was accustomed, on occasion, to carry with her in her handbag was a small one with the blade covered by a plastic lid “…the kind that comes with a lunch box and you take to work to cut an apple with”. She estimated the blade length of such a knife to be about 5 or 6cm. I accept that evidence. The description which she gave of that small knife is not capable of describing the knife used in the killing by the accused.
	
	
	Nour gave unchallenged evidence to a similar effect: that she was aware that, together with other cutlery, her mother would carry a small knife with a coloured handle and a cap, and that she would take it with her lunchbox to work. She estimated the whole length of that knife to be “fairly small … about … the size of my palm” which she thought was about 7cm or so. I accept that evidence. Again I am well satisfied from her description that the knife used by the accused is not of the kind or type which Nour said her mother carried in her handbag from time to time.
	
	
	Amani also gave this unchallenged evidence, which I accept, talking of the implicated knife:
	


“She (referring to her mother) would never have carried a knife like that in her bag. She kept her things in nice condition. It would be very weird for her to carry a large knife loosely in her bag. She had nice bags, nice items. I can’t imagine that at all.”


	
	This evidence pointed to the unlikelihood that the knife was carried by the deceased in her handbag in an unprotected way, as was suggested by the history that the accused gave to all three psychiatrists.
	
	
	I have examined the handbag used by the deceased on the day she was killed. It was the handbag taken by the accused to the house of his brother, Khalil, and left there until the police recovered it on the following day. The outside of the handbag was not damaged in any way. It was in good condition and accorded with Amani’s description of her mother’s handbags as being nice bags. It was also in good condition. It was obvious from a comparison between the knife and the handbag, that the knife was capable of fitting wholly within the handbag. However, a careful examination of the satin-like lining of the handbag did not reveal any cuts or other damage which may have been caused by the knife. There was no evidence of any scientific examination establishing such facts.
	
	
	Having regard to the sharpness of the knife, and the nature of the lining material, had the knife been carried loosely in the handbag, and not protected in any way, I would have expected that some visible damage to the lining of the handbag would have occurred, or else to other items in the handbag. Particularly, would that be so if the knife was kept in the handbag for the whole of a day, or perhaps over a number of days.
	
	
	As well, I have concluded that it would be potentially very dangerous for the deceased to carry the unprotected and unsecured knife in the handbag as one of a number of other items in the handbag. Photos were tendered which show the items which were carried by the deceased in that handbag. These items included the deceased’s mobile phone, a wallet, medical paperwork, car keys and various documents. If the deceased (or anyone else) had placed their hand in the handbag to find or retrieve any item, there would have been a real risk that they would cut themselves on the unprotected blade of the knife if it were in the handbag. I think it most unlikely that the deceased would have allowed such danger to exist by placing the unprotected knife in her handbag.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any particular reason why the deceased needed to, or wanted to, carry such a knife: for example, for her own protection. It was significantly bigger than, and not of the type and style of, the knife described as being the one that she carried to use with her lunch box.
	
	
	No use for a knife of that size or kind was identified in the evidence except for a suggestion that it appeared to be a knife which could be used to slice or peel fruit. If that was its use, it is unlikely to have been carried in the deceased’s handbag. Investigations undertaken by the police after the killing were unable to establish that the accused had purchased the knife on 30 March 2015 from any shop in the local area including from a large nearby shopping centre. Forensic examination of the knife did not reveal any recoverable fingerprints. DNA tests identified a profile of the blood on the knife as being strongly indicative that it was the deceased’s blood. I am satisfied that it was.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused submitted that I would be persuaded that the history given in this respect by the accused was accurate, and that the evidence supported that conclusion. In particular, he drew attention to:
	



	
	the fact that the police investigations did not establish that the accused had purchased the knife in the local area;
	
	
	the police discovered in the accused’s black travel bag (called by the police a “toiletries” bag) a sum of $8,800 which was the same round sum of cash which had been withdrawn from a bank at 3.15pm that afternoon and there was no debit in the accused’s bank account, or in any credit card account, which represented the purchase of the knife;
	
	
	given the well-known security screening measures in place at international airports around the world, particularly Dubai, it was highly unlikely that the accused carried the knife back to Australia in his cabin luggage;
	
	
	the fact that his large travel suitcase, which was found by police in the boot of his car, appeared not to have been unpacked; and
	
	
	there was no obvious or identifiable reason why the accused would purchase or take the knife into the Bexley townhouse.
	



	
	I do not accept these submissions of senior counsel for the accused. The investigations undertaken by police in the local area to identify shops where the knife was bought were necessarily limited. The accused had a motor car, and therefore there is no reason to geographically limit where he might have gone to purchase the knife to the local area. The proposition also contains the assumption that the accused did not have the knife in his belongings which were packed up in the garage of the Bexley townhouse. I accept that there was no identifiable debit entry on any credit card or in the accused’s bank account. The sum withdrawn from the accused’s bank account was not actually identified in the evidence, so it is not possible to conclude that the sum of cash found ($8,800) was all that was withdrawn from the accused’s bank account.
	
	
	But, even if the cash sum coincided with the withdrawal, this submission was based on the assumption that this cash was the only cash available to the accused on 30 March 2015. But this was not so. The police DVD of a search undertaken by Detective Taylor, the officer in charge of the investigation, of the accused’s car which was tendered in the accused’s case, reveals that the accused had cash ($130) folded up in a soft glasses case in the glove box of the car, next to his taxi driver’s licence. The money was not seized by police nor otherwise recorded. Perhaps that is why senior counsel did not refer to it. I do not accept as a matter of fact that the accused did not have cash to purchase the knife on the day he killed the deceased.
	
	
	The third and fourth matters can be considered together. I accept that it is most improbable that the accused carried the knife with him from Lebanon in his cabin luggage. But he could have done so in his check-in luggage. The police recovered a folding knife from his check-in luggage which the accused’s counsel accepted he had carried from Lebanon. A careful observation of the police search video satisfies me that whilst the clothes in the larger travel suitcase were neatly and tidily packed, the bag was not full to overflowing and there was sufficient space for the knife to be placed in the bag and to be removed easily without disturbing the neatly packed clothing. There were also easily accessible pockets in the lid of the case into which the knife could have been placed and easily accessed. I am not satisfied that the accused could not have brought the knife back from Lebanon with him in his check-in luggage.
	
	
	Finally, the accused submitted that there was no obvious reason why he would have brought the knife into the Bexley townhouse on that particular evening. I accept this submission. However, I do not regard the absence of an identified reason as telling against a finding that the accused did so. Offences are proved without an identifiable motive. The actions of humans cannot always be logically explained. This is no different.
	
	
	Accordingly, I reject the accused’s submissions that the evidence shows that he did not bring the knife into the Bexley townhouse.
	
	
	From this evidence, I have reached the following findings of fact:
	



	
	the knife did not come from inside the Bexley townhouse and was not part of the kitchen cutlery;
	
	
	the knife was not in the deceased’s handbag on the evening of 30 March 2015, nor at any other time;
	
	
	the deceased did not own, carry or use the knife, and did not bring it into the Bexley townhouse;
	
	
	the accused did not recover the knife from the deceased’s handbag and put into it his pocket as the history which he gave to each of the psychiatrists suggests;
	
	
	no suggestion was made that either of the daughters brought the knife into the townhouse;
	
	
	it cannot be established precisely where or when the knife was purchased, but I am satisfied that it was purchased by the accused; and;
	
	
	on balance, I am satisfied that it is likely that the knife was brought into the house by the accused at some time on 30 March 2015, but for what purpose, remains a matter of speculation. I am not satisfied that I should find that the accused brought the knife to the premises with any intention formed to use it to kill or seriously injure the deceased.
	



	
	In rejecting the accused’s account, I am satisfied that it is an untrue account, which cannot be explained by the effects of any amnesic condition after the events. As well, it provides a significant reason to doubt the reliability of the accused’s history unless it is corroborated by other independent evidence.
	


Access to Mobile Phone


	
	According to the history given to the psychiatrists by the accused, he attempted unsuccessfully prior to killing the deceased to find her mobile telephone in, and remove it from, her handbag. He said that he intended to keep it and show the contents of it to his daughters. There is a significant question about the truthfulness and reliability of this aspect of the history given by the accused.
	
	
	The accused also gave a history to Dr Nielssen, but not to the other two psychiatrists, that as he was leaving the Bexley townhouse, he picked up his wife’s handbag which was near the front door and took it with him as he drove to his brother’s house. That was where the police found it. It follows that the accused must have carried it there.
	
	
	At the time the police obtained the deceased’s handbag from Khalil’s house, the mobile telephone was not in it. Rather, it was inside the black travel bag which apparently belonged to the accused and which contained a number of his items, including cash which he had withdrawn on that day, his two passports, various travel documents, a boarding pass and his mobile telephone.
	
	
	It follows that at some point in time the accused must have removed the deceased’s mobile telephone from her handbag and placed it in his black travel bag. The question is when did that transfer take place?
	
	
	According to the history given by the accused, the transfer must have happened after he had killed the deceased, and after he had carried the handbag from the Bexley townhouse, because he says he could not find the phone before the attack, and Ola Haydar did not see the accused carry out the transfer in her presence after the attack. At all times after the attack, and there is abundant evidence which persuades me of this, the accused’s hands were covered in the deceased’s blood. His car contained bloodstains on the steering wheel where he placed his hands when driving the car to his brother’s house. The inside door handle of the driver’s door of the car also contained bloodstains which, I am satisfied, would have come from the accused using his hands to close that door before driving off. Constable Spurrier said that when the accused walked into the Kogarah Police Station, he observed that the accused’s hands were covered in blood and that he “… could not see one bit of skin on the accused’s hands that was not covered in red blood”.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it would be surprising if the accused had transferred the deceased’s mobile telephone from her handbag to his black bag after he left the Bexley townhouse without blood being transferred from his hands onto the deceased’s mobile telephone. Yet, there is no evidence that any blood was discovered on the mobile telephone when it was found. In fact, the forensic tests undertaken by police did not discover any blood on the phone at all.
	
	
	The photograph of the mobile telephone does not disclose the presence of any obvious blood stains.
	
	
	As well, there is no suggestion that the inside of the deceased’s handbag contained any blood stains that would have been likely to happen, in my view, if the accused had placed his bloodstained hands inside the bag in order to remove the mobile telephone. As well, blood would have been transferred onto one or more of the other items in the handbag. There is no evidence that this was so.
	
	
	There is no evidence that anyone else transferred the telephone from the deceased’s handbag to the accused’s bag. It is theoretically possible that one of the occupants, or a visitor to Khalil’s house may have done so, but there is no suggestion that this is so, and since no-one there knew of, or understood the significance of, the phone to the accused and therefore had any reason to move the phone, I regard this possibility as being manifestly unlikely and able to be rejected.
	
	
	I do not accept that the accused removed the deceased’s telephone at any time after he had killed her. I have concluded that he must have done so before he killed the deceased. I do not accept the accused’s history that he looked for the mobile telephone and did not find it, and inferentially that he did not take it into his possession before he killed his wife. This history is incorrect and something which I simply do not believe.
	
	
	This finding does not sit easily with the fact that the accused carried the deceased’s handbag from the townhouse when he left. If he had removed the mobile phone prior to leaving, there seems little if any reason for him to have taken the deceased’s handbag with him. However, that may simply be an irrational action particularly having regard to what had just occurred. This conduct does not dissuade me from the conclusion which I have reached because I regard the evidence in support of the conclusion as outweighing the evidence which stands against it.
	
	
	The consequence of my finding that the accused took the deceased’s phone from her handbag and placed it in his black travel bag is significant, particularly when combined with my conclusion that the accused did not find the knife in his wife’s handbag.
	
	
	First, it leads me to conclude that the accused is an unreliable historian who has given a partly untruthful account of the events leading up to his attack on his wife. His account of these events can only be regarded as truthful if they are corroborated by independent evidence. Secondly, it suggests that the attack by the accused on the deceased was carried out shortly after he had taken possession of the one item which he regarded as being real proof of his wife’s infidelity, namely the messages on her mobile phone. It leads me to conclude that this is what motivated him to get up from his seat on the lounge and walk to the kitchen to confront his wife on that subject and accuse her of “… following the instructions of someone …” (accused history to Dr Allnutt), rather than losing control of himself because the deceased had told him to leave because he would not help around the house.
	


Count 1: Murder – Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt of the Essential Elements


	
	It is necessary now to determine whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt each of the essential elements of each of the offences with which the accused is charged. The first count is murder.
	
	
	I commence this analysis by reminding myself that even if the Crown has made out each of the essential elements of murder beyond reasonable doubt, before a verdict of guilty of Count 1 can be entered, it will be necessary to consider the impairment defence pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The first essential element of the count of murder is that Ms Salwa Haydar has died. There is no dispute about this. The evidence of ambulance officer Craig Ruddiman, which was unchallenged, was that Ms Haydar died shortly after 7pm on 30 March 2015 at the Bexley townhouse. The accused accepts that this is so.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved this essential element of the first count.
	
	
	The second essential element of the count of murder is that it was the act of the accused that caused Salwa Haydar’s death. The unchallenged evidence of Ola was that she saw the accused stabbing Salwa Haydar in a violent and prolonged attack. The evidence of those who attending the scene, as well as Ola, was that the deceased was very seriously wounded by the multiple stab wounds inflicted upon her by the accused. The unchallenged evidence of the forensic pathologist, Istvan Szentmariay, was that the cause of deceased’s death was multiple stab wounds. The accused admitted to Constable Spurrier, when he attended at Kogarah Police Station at 7.07pm on 30 March 2015, that he had stabbed his wife. He was covered in blood, in particular both of his hands were observed to be red in colour. His clothing had significant blood staining on it. Counsel for the accused did not submit that the Court should not find this essential element proved. On the contrary, he accepted that the Court should find that it was the act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established that it was the act of the accused, Haydar Haydar, in stabbing his wife that caused her death.
	
	
	The third essential element to be established by the Crown is that the act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased was deliberate in the sense that it was an intentional and not accidental act. The evidence of Ola persuades me that this is so. She observed the accused deliberately stabbing his wife. She tried to stop him but he continued. As well, having regard to the number of, nature of and distribution of the stab wounds, it is simply not possible to conclude that the stabbing was anything other than deliberate conduct on the part of the accused. This conclusion was not disputed by the accused.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established that the conduct of the accused was deliberate.
	
	
	The fourth essential element is that the accused’s act, or his conduct which caused the death of the Salwa Haydar, was carried out with the requisite intention, namely, an intention to kill Salwa Haydar, or else an intention to cause her grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm means really serious physical injury.
	
	
	The accused did not dispute, and his counsel expressly conceded, that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that his act was done with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The Crown submitted, and the accused disputed, that the accused’s conduct in killing Salwa Haydar was accompanied by an intention to kill her.
	
	
	If a finding in accordance with the Crown case is to be made, then it is necessary for the Court to proceed to a factual conclusion by drawing an inference from the proved facts, namely that the accused acted with the intention to kill his wife. I remind myself that I ought not draw any inference adverse to the accused, unless I am satisfied that it is the only reasonably available inference.
	
	
	Immediately prior to commencing the attack on his wife, the accused was sitting in the lounge room area. The kitchen was a separate enclosed area some metres away. The accused left the lounge on which he was sitting and walked into the kitchen area before he started to physically attack the deceased. He had also taken possession of the deceased’s phone which the accused concluded was clear evidence of her infidelity. He went to the kitchen immediately consequent upon a heated verbal exchange between himself and the deceased. The deceased’s remarks were perceived by the accused against a significant background of disharmony in his marital relationship, as being one which was made by the accused, in effect, at the direction of the deceased’s lover.
	
	
	As the accused walked into the kitchen, he carried with him the knife which he used to stab the deceased. There was no apparent reason for him to have carried that knife. It was not being returned to the kitchen where it might have been normally kept. There is no suggestion that the accused was physically in fear of the deceased, nor that he anticipated, on this particular occasion, that she would be armed in any way, and that he needed the knife for his own protection. Having regard to the size and nature of the knife, particularly its narrow point and the sharpness of the blade, it is not feasible that the accused would have walked with it loose in his pocket as the history which he gave the psychiatrists suggests. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he carried the knife into the kitchen in his hand, and not in his pocket. Given the immediately preceding exchange, it is highly unlikely that he carried the knife into the kitchen absent-mindedly. I reject such a conclusion – it makes no sense to me.
	
	
	The first point at which Ola noticed what was occurring was when the accused was angrily making a comment about his intention not to sleep in the Bexley townhouse that night. She next heard a noise which was her mother screaming. She ran towards the kitchen and observed that her mother was backed up in a corner and that her father had stabbed her in the back. Ola said that she tried to come between them and push the accused away from her mother whilst they were in the kitchen. The accused did not stop stabbing her mother but kept going. At a point in time after the three of them had left the kitchen area and moved into the lounge room area, Ola realised that she had herself been stabbed.
	
	
	Ola gave this description of what then happened:
	


“I was trying to hold his hand back, the one that held the knife, and trying to push him off her, but I couldn’t. At a point I was stuck so I kept trying to push him off her and that’s how he managed to move into the living room, because it was a scuffle.”


	
	Ola was asked what she was saying to the accused whilst trying to get him off her mother. She responded:
	


“ ‘You need to stop’, ‘What are you doing’, ‘Oh my God’, like,

‘You are going to kill her’” – screaming, screaming for help.”


	
	This contemporaneous comment by Ola seems to me to be highly significant. She had a good view of what was happening. She could see the knife which was being wielded. She could see the ferocity of the attack and the speed of it. She could particularly observe the degree of aggressiveness which characterised the accused. Even allowing for the frightening nature of what she was observing, her reaction was to tell the accused that unless he stopped, he would kill the deceased. That remark can be taken to be her perception of what was happening – in other words, it was clear to an independent observer that the accused was deliberately acting in a way which would produce a result, namely the death of his wife. I regard his conduct as a sure indication of his intention.
	
	
	The second reason Ola’s remark is significant, is that the accused, having been told and explicitly warned that, unless he stopped, he would kill his wife, did not stop but rather kept going with his attack. To me, his continuing conduct after that explicit warning is a strong indication that his intention was to kill his wife. If it were not, then I think that he would have stopped. The only inference which common sense suggests ought to be drawn, at least from that time onwards, is that the accused intended to kill the deceased and that is why he persisted with his attack.
	
	
	Ola continued to describe what else she heard. She said:
	


“At a point I remember him calling her the Arabic word for a slut. And whenever I told him ‘Dad, what are you doing, stop’, he was like, ‘No, no it’s fine, no it’s fine’. When I called out for help he would be like, ‘What are you doing? Why are you screaming? Stop screaming’ as he was killing her.”


	
	Ola gave the following further description about what was happening as the accused and the deceased moved into the lounge room area. She said that she was still trying to push the accused off the deceased. She said:
	


“He was holding her up by her hair at a point against the door.”


	
	Ola said that whilst her mother was in this position, her mother was saying to the accused:
	


“‘Haydar, I didn’t do anything, I didn’t do anything.”


	
	Ola said the accused did not respond to that protestation. He continued the attack. Ola then went to the telephone to call 000 for help. It was the landline that she used which was located in the living area. She was asked what observation she made of her father as she was on the telephone. She said:
	


“He kept going and he looked at me and said ‘What’re you doing’ when he saw me, like dialling the phone. And he continued and like, he would look back and continue, like I felt, like I noticed him pause and then continue and then pause. And like look around for a computer, like a briefcase and he left from what I recall.”


	
	The whole of Ola’s account of what she saw and heard was not challenged in any respect. Ola was, to my observation, although obviously upset about having to give evidence of what she saw and heard, an entirely truthful and reliable witness. It has not been suggested that there is any reason why I ought not accept her evidence as being an entirely accurate account of what occurred at the time her father stabbed her mother. I do so. I am well satisfied that I should accept this account in its entirety.
	
	
	Accordingly, based on Ola’s account of what she saw and heard, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s conduct was accompanied by an intention to kill the deceased. But because of the importance of this finding, I will also analyse the evidence which exists apart from the detail of the account given by Ola to see if an inference about the intention of the accused can be properly drawn.
	
	
	It is appropriate to commence this analysis with an examination in some detail of a number of the wounds which were inflicted. I do so because the number and nature of those wounds provides evidence of what was done by the accused to the deceased.
	
	
	From that conduct, an inference can be drawn as to the accused’s intention. An intention connotes purpose. Where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s deliberate act, one is readily able to conclude that the act, if deliberate, was done with the purpose or intention of achieving that specific result.
	
	
	Although the first observation made by Ola was of the accused stabbing her mother in the back, there is no basis for any conclusion from the post-mortem examination as to the order in which the individual stab wounds were inflicted. As is clear from the content of the 000 call, and the evidence of the police officers and paramedics who were first to arrive on the scene, they were all inflicted before the deceased died, and while she was still alive.
	
	
	There were over 30 individual wounds inflicted by the accused on the deceased. As well, there were a number of superficial cuts and areas of contusion and abrasion.
	
	
	The forensic pathologist’s report noted 28 separate wounds identifiable principally on the torso of the deceased, and, additionally, a number of individual wounds involving the deceased’s left hand and right palm. Consistently with post-mortem practice, the wounds were identified both as to location on the body, length of the wound at the skin level and then the depth of wound track. It is to be recalled that the blade of the knife which was used was 11cm in length. The wounds varied in depth and length. The length of some of the wounds was such that one could readily conclude that the wound represented more than one stabbing event. However, it is unnecessary to draw any firm conclusion.
	
	
	For the purpose of identification in these reasons, the numbers used to describe the wounds are those used in the post-mortem report.
	
	
	Wound 1 was an oblique stab wound on the right upper back. The wound track was directed downwards and had an estimated depth of 10.6cms. That is to say, almost the full length of the knife blade was inserted into that part of the deceased’s body.
	
	
	Wound 2 was also an oblique stab wound present on the right upper back. The direction of the wound was right to left, slightly upwards and the estimated depth was 12 – 14cms. This stab wound passed through the space between the 7th and 8th ribs and entered the back of the right lower lobe of the lung. The depth of the wound satisfies me that the accused must have used some measure of force to insert the knife the full length of the blade, and a part of the handle as well.
	
	
	Wound 3 was a stab wound on the left upper back. The direction of the wound track was left to right and slightly upwards. The estimated depth of the wound was 10.5cm. This depth represents an almost fully inserted knife.
	
	
	Wound 5 was a complex stab wound on the left side of the mid-back. The direction of the wound track was left to right and downwards. The estimated length was about 12 – 14cms. This stab wound went through the lower lobe of the left lung, through the diaphragm and subsequently through the superior portion of the spleen. Its depth, 12 – 14cms, indicates that the knife was inserted completely up to and including part of the handle of the knife. It required the use of a degree of force to penetrate the soft tissues and organs of the deceased.
	
	
	Wound 14 was an oblique, slit like wound over the left breast. The direction of the wound track was left to right, downwards and with an estimated depth of 12 – 14cms. This wound passed through the space between the 6th and 7th ribs, and entered the upper lobe of the left lung. Like wound 2, a measure of force was necessary to insert the knife to this depth, which included the whole of the blade and a part of the handle.
	
	
	Wound 16 consisted of two conjoined stab wounds present on the left upper abdomen. The direction of the wound track was upwards, indicating a stab wound travelling upwards in the left abdomen, towards the direction of the left lung and the heart. The estimated depth of that wound track was 8cms, namely, a significant part of the length of the blade (about ¾) had been inserted. Clearly, the knife had been swung from a lower height and inserted so as to travel in an upwards path towards the heart.
	
	
	Wound 17 consisted of two additional conjoined stab wounds, again present in the left upper abdomen. The direction of the wound track was downwards and from left to right. This stab wound entered the abdominal cavity and went through the anterior aspect of the adjacent large bowel at the area of the splenic flexure. The estimated length of the wound track was 13 – 15cms. The wound track went through the opposite side of the bowel and subsequently terminated in the attached mesocolon. Whilst this wound did not cause significant damage to vital organs, the position of it and the depth of it indicate that the accused not only inserted the whole blade of the knife but continued to penetrate the deceased’s skin with a part of the knife handle. This wound, similarly to wound 5, required a degree of force to cause the knife to travel as far as it did.
	
	
	Wound 18 consisted of two conjoined stab wounds present in the right upper chest just to the right, by 10cms, of the mid-line. The direction of the wound was downwards and the estimated depth was 9.5cms, namely almost the entirety of the length of the knife blade.
	
	
	Wound 20 was a transverse slit-like stab wound present in the right upper chest, very close to the mid-line (2.5cms). It entered the anterior aspect of the upper lobe of the right lung. The wound track was measured at 8 - 10cms in depth.
	
	
	Wound 21 was a slit-like stab wound present over the right breast. The direction of the wound track was left to right and downwards. It entered the chest cavity and penetrated the right lung. This wound caused extensive bleeding. The estimated length of the wound track was 10 – 12cms. Again, the depth of the wound would indicate that the whole of the knife blade was inserted or, alternatively, almost all of the knife blade.
	
	
	Finally, it is necessary to note that there was a significant facial wound on the left side of the deceased’s face consisting of a gaping cut measuring 7.3cms in length. The cut consisted of two conjoined cuts with a slight angle, indicating either two separate stab wounds or, alternatively, movement of the knife, or the deceased’s body, at the time the wound was made. Although this was not a particularly deep wound (estimated at 2cms), it was a wound which would have bled profusely and which would have had an obvious and visible effect so far as the accused was concerned. Some of the other wounds were inflicted through the clothing worn by the deceased. Not all of them were, particularly those on the deceased’s arms. However, this wound is in a different category. Once inflicted, it would have been immediately obvious to the accused that he had inflicted serious bodily harm on the deceased.
	
	
	I have described the wounds, which may be regarded as the principal wounds, at some length. The location of them in the left and right chest area, both on the front and back, indicates that the accused was intending to stab the deceased in an area of her body where, as is commonly well known, the vital organs and body structures are contained. By that I mean the heart, the lungs, the complex of major arteries and veins, and the oesophagus.
	
	
	The overall number of wounds, in excess of 30, the fact that many wounds involved the complete length of the blade of the knife being inserted, the spread of the wounds being on the front and back of the deceased, the direction of their insertion, and the places on the body of the deceased where the knife was inserted, when all considered together indicate to me that the accused was not simply intending to cause his wife really serious physical injury. If that was all he intended to do, then he would have stabbed her on only a few occasions, somewhat more superficially, and then stopped.
	
	
	But in particular, the fact that with eight of the stab wounds the accused inserted the full blade length of the knife (or substantially so) and on occasion including a part or parts of the handle, indicates that he was not simply intending to wound the deceased, but rather that he intended by such deep stab wounds to harm the vital internal organs thereby leading to her death.
	
	
	These many stab wounds and the short time during which the attack occurred enable me to infer that, on that basis alone, the accused intended to kill the deceased. There is no other rational inference available.
	
	
	I have no doubt that, based on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances revealed by the evidence, the accused intended to kill the deceased. When Ola asked him to stop, he did not do so. He persistently stabbed the deceased in circumstances where, as the photographs of the lounge room show, she was bleeding profusely. He did so by thrusting the knife upwards from below and downwards from above. The ferocity of the attack, the diverse locations of the knife wounds, the depth of those knife wounds, his failure to cease and desist when requested to do so by Ola, his ignoring of the deceased’s protestations that she had done nothing wrong, his failure to cease and desist when Ola physically put herself between the accused and the deceased, his persistence in the attack in more than one room of the house, his persistence in the attack over a prolonged period, his pausing during the attack to enable him to speak to Ola to dissuade her from seeking help, and then resume the attack, considered together, point convincingly to, and satisfy me, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused’s intention at the time of this conduct was to kill his wife, as he succeeded in doing. It follows that I wholly reject the proposition that the accused’s intention was to merely inflict really serious physical injury on his wife and not to kill her.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused’s intention was to kill the deceased. Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the Crown’s case on the fourth essential element has been made out.
	
	
	The Crown has discharged its onus of satisfying me beyond reasonable doubt of each of the essential elements of the offence in the first count, namely the murder by the accused of the deceased at a time when he had the intention of killing his wife.
	
	
	It is now necessary to consider the impairment defence.
	


The Impairment Defence


	
	This defence, provided by s 23A of the Crimes Act, is one which must be proved by the accused on the balance of probabilities. As discussed earlier, there are three elements to this defence which need to be satisfied in order for a verdict of manslaughter to be entered in lieu of a verdict of murder.
	
	
	The first essential element is that the accused must prove on the balance of probabilities that at the time he committed the act (or acts) causing death, he was subject to an “abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition”. This element requires attention to the definition of “underlying condition” in s 23A(8) of the Crimes Act, which provides that, relevantly, “an underlying conditions means a pre-existing mental condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind”.
	
	
	The second essential element which the accused must establish is that his capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by the abnormality previously identified. Although s 23A of the Crimes Act permits three consequences of an abnormality of mind to be considered, here the accused relied only on an impairment to his capacity to control himself.
	
	
	The third essential element of which I must be persuaded is that the extent of the impairment was so substantial as to warrant the liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter, because the moral culpability of the accused for his actions is appropriately reflected in a verdict for an offence of lesser seriousness.
	
	
	It can be observed that although these three elements are identified separately, they are inter-related.
	
	
	The first question is whether the accused has satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that at the time he stabbed his wife, he was suffering from an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition.
	
	
	Each of the three psychiatrists gave evidence that the accused was suffering from a form of abnormality of mind, namely a form of depression. Dr Nielssen diagnosed it as a “depressive illness”. Dr Westmore diagnosed it as a “major depressive disorder”, and Dr Allnutt described the accused’s state as being either a “depressive disorder” or a “depressive episode”. But these varying descriptions are no different in substance. The accused at the relevant time was suffering from a mental illness diagnosable as a depressive disorder, to which it will be inconvenient to refer simply as depression.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there was such an underlying condition. It had been present for some years, although fluctuating in intensity. The intensity increased during the weeks prior to the deceased’s death, from the time shortly before the accused went to Lebanon – when he checked his wife’s telephone and read messages which suggested to him that she was being unfaithful, and continued during his time in Lebanon where he was confronted by his mother’s dementia, his uncle’s death and being away from his son, all of which ensured that the condition continued.
	
	
	Although he was suffering from an exacerbation of his depression in the context of that combination of events, I am not persuaded that it was severe at the time of his return to Sydney. I am not so satisfied because it seems to me, from all of the evidence, including his entirely rational conversations with his daughters on the morning of 30 March 2015 and his actions during the day, that he was able to make decisions about where he would live in the sense of deciding that it was finally time for him to move out, and take steps to prepare for that, by going to the bank. He was able to get himself to the Bexley townhouse from the airport, and generally undertook ordinary activities of his daily living. He showered, he slept, he loaded one or more bags into his car. He had also loaded into the boot of his car many items of a household kind which he would need to set up a separate household. In a yellow plastic box he packaged foodstuffs and cleaning material, amongst other things. He also had in there a large packet of toilet paper. Whether he purchased these items from a shop of took them from the Bexley townhouse is unknown. Either way, he was entirely capable of making the appropriate decision to obtain and pack the goods in preparation for moving out.
	
	
	This conclusion accords with the oral evidence of Dr Allnutt that his depression fell into the mild to moderate range. I accept that opinion.
	
	
	The accused must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that the depression that he had diagnosed constituted an abnormality of mind which affected the accused’s ability to control his actions. In that respect, Dr Westmore’s opinion differed from that of Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen was of the view that the abnormality of mind was to be found in the fact that the accused’s perception of the events was affected by the negative appraisal of his situation and the impairment in intellectual function arising from his state of depression.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt accepted that the accused was suffering from an abnormality of mind, but expressed it rather by reference to vulnerability on the part of the accused in reacting to triggers such as perceived rejection or evidence of infidelity. He suggested that, because depression is prone to aggravate the sort of emotions to which I have just referred, there was an abnormality of mind present. He identified the depression as being the underlying condition.
	
	
	It does not seem to me to be crucial to determine whether I prefer the views of Dr Nielssen or Dr Allnutt on this question. It is sufficient for me to say that at the time of the stabbing of the deceased by the accused, I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind. That abnormality arose from his underlying condition of depression.
	
	
	The second element of the impairment defence is that the accused has to persuade me on the balance of probabilities that, in this case, his capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by that abnormality of mind.
	
	
	On this issue I do not find Dr Westmore’s report and opinion to be of much assistance. That is because his report contains little reasoning as to how he comes to the conclusion which he does on that question. On this issue, it is unpersuasive.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen reasoned that the nature of the offence, including the injury to the accused’s daughter, Ola, who attempted to intervene and prevent the attack, was consistent with impairment in the accused’s ability to control his actions. He next reasoned that by reference to the accused’s history, particularly of an absence of any previous physical violence of any relevant kind and the presence of depression which affected his perception of the events by a negative appraisal of his situation, the necessary causal link was demonstrated between the events and the impairment of his capacity to control himself. He also said in evidence that he did not regard the impairment as trivial or minimal, with the consequence that he regarded it as a substantial impairment.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt analysed the matter slightly differently. He expressed the view that the presence of the depression meant that the accused was vulnerable to reacting emotionally, that is to say not being able to control himself, when a trigger event, such as a perceived rejection by his wife, occurred. As Dr Allnutt said of the accused:
	


“His depression would have aggravated his vulnerability to emotional reaction under these sorts of circumstances.”


	
	Dr Allnutt made the point that whilst the actions which occurred may have occurred in the absence of the accused’s depression, the presence of the depression could not be disregarded because of its tendency to aggravate the emotions of the kind to which he referred. Dr Allnutt also accepted that the impairment of which he spoke was a substantial one because it was more than trivial or minimal.
	
	
	To the extent that there is any difference of substance between the expert opinion of Dr Nielsen and Dr Allnutt, I prefer the opinion of Dr Allnutt on this issue. I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the accused’s capacity to control himself was impaired by his depression. It made him vulnerable to reacting in a way that demonstrated a loss of control if a trigger event occurred. I am also persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the impairment was substantial, as that term is used for the purpose of s 23A of the Crimes Act, namely, more than trivial or minimal.
	
	
	I am accordingly persuaded of the second essential element of the impairment defence. This means that the accused has satisfied me of the requirements of s 23A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	It is now necessary to consider the third essential element of the impairment defence which is that contained in s 23A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. This requires a determination of whether the impairment was so substantial that it warranted a conviction for manslaughter instead of murder.
	
	
	However, I am conscious that in considering the extent of impairment of the accused’s capacity for self-control, and in the determination of the issue under s 23A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, such a task must be approached by looking at all of the evidence in a broad, common sense way.
	
	
	It cannot be doubted that the accused’s depression, and the impairment of the capacity to control himself which it permitted, was present at the time of the killing. However, I am not persuaded that the impairment of the accused’s capacity for self-control by reason of the depression was the only factor that led to his behaviour. The accused had formed the view prior to going to Lebanon that his wife had been unfaithful. He ruminated on that fact whilst he was away. His text message to his wife accusing her of being unfaithful is evidence of his pre-occupation. Because of his opinion, the accused, in my assessment, became jealous of his wife. At the first opportunity upon his return to Sydney, he protested to his daughters on the morning of 30 March 2015 that he had had the opportunity to be unfaithful, but had resisted any temptation so to do. He told them, perhaps indirectly, that his wife had been unfaithful.
	
	
	As soon as he could do so, the accused took his wife’s mobile phone and put it in his own bag as proof of her infidelity. The exchange between them, which immediately preceded the stabbing of the deceased, was perceived by the accused as being related to her unfaithfulness. His perception was that her words and conduct confirmed his view that she had been unfaithful. The accused was jealous of his wife and her perceived new relationship. He was angry because of that jealousy, and the deceased’s final rejection of him, by telling him to leave the Bexley townhouse. It was this combination of feelings which triggered his loss of control. In the course of his attack, he was clearly motivated by jealousy and anger over the deceased’s infidelity, because he called the deceased “a slut” in Arabic – a direct reference to his perception of her infidelity. So strong was his perception of the deceased’s infidelity, and his view that she had confirmed it, that although the deceased protested during the attack that she had done nothing wrong, the accused persisted in the attack.
	
	
	In my view, his attack, whilst involving a loss of self-control on the part of the accused, was predominantly caused by his jealousy and anger towards the deceased, which had been building up in his mind for some weeks because he perceived that she was unfaithful to him and had been conducting an extramarital affair. His capacity for self-control was impaired at that time by his depression.
	
	
	In considering this element, it is not necessary for me to be persuaded that the impairment was the sole cause of the accused’s loss of self-control. What has to be determined is whether, to the extent that the accused’s capacity for self-control was impaired by his depression, that impairment was not just more than trivial or minimal, but whether it was so substantial to warrant finding a verdict for the lesser offence. There is no scientific measure by which this can be judged – it is a matter of making an evaluation in light of all of the facts and circumstances.
	
	
	It is clear to me that in the few moments when the accused confronted the deceased in the kitchen, the accused swiftly became enraged and commenced violently attacking the deceased, who turned away in an attempt to protect herself. I am satisfied that the accused had lost his self-control when he started the stabbing attack and was quite unable to control his anger. He ceased the attack when he could not dissuade Ola from calling for help from the Emergency Services. The realisation that they would be attending caused him to leave to avoid the immediate consequences of what he had done.
	
	
	I observe, and take full account of, the fact that the evidence was, with one exception which I do not regard as having any real consequence, that the relationship of the deceased and the accused was not a violent one. Previous arguments had not led to violence. The deceased and the accused had negotiated, apparently amicably, the division of their joint property. It was this fact, accepted by the Crown, which senior counsel for the accused emphasised as demonstrating that the Court should conclude that the accused’s depression was the predominant cause of what occurred, and that I should find the impairment was “… so substantial” as required by s 23A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. However, I am not persuaded that the existence of depression was the only factor which explains the behaviour of the accused on that evening.
	
	
	The accused had only persuaded himself just prior to leaving for Lebanon that his wife had been unfaithful. He clearly remained preoccupied with that perception upon his return from Lebanon. He discussed this view with his two daughters when they first met earlier in the morning. He took some preliminary steps to make provisions for alternative accommodation. He took the deceased’s mobile telephone after she returned home from work so that he would have proof of her infidelity and then he lost control and attacked her when he perceived that she was acting in a way that accorded with her lover’s wishes.
	
	
	What this picture suggests is that principally, the causes of the accused’s loss of self-control were his feelings of jealousy and anger. I accept that his depression was present at the same time, although it was not severe. It was mild to moderate, but sufficient to impair his capacity for self-control.
	
	
	It is for the accused to persuade me, on the balance of probabilities, that so substantial was the impairment to his capacity for self-control that he should not be condemned as a murderer but rather should be found guilty of manslaughter, because that crime is a proper reflection of his reduced moral culpability and blameworthiness for his criminal conduct.
	
	
	In answering this question, I will approach the matter in a broad common sense way, and by applying community standards. I am not persuaded that it is appropriate, by application of broad community standards and values, and having regard to the moral culpability of the accused in light of his substantial impairment, to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter. There are many features of the accused’s conduct which stand against any reduction of the offence for which he is to be found guilty.
	
	
	This was an offence of domestic violence taking place in the home. The attack was of great ferocity and persistence. It was the accused’s intention to kill the victim. He succeeded in so doing. The attack was persisted with notwithstanding Ola’s attempts to stop it, and the resistance of the deceased. That resistance led to significant wounds on the deceased’s hands, wrists and arms as she tried to defend herself from the accused’s attack. As I have earlier found, the principal cause of the accused’s conduct was his jealousy and anger arising from his perception that the deceased was unfaithful to him. Assuming, in favour of the accused, that his perception was an entirely reasonable one, his reaction to that perception was completely unreasonable. The community would simply not regard it as acceptable for an older man to physically assault his younger wife, in any way at all, let alone in the violent manner which occurred here, and conclude that the blameworthiness or moral culpability of the accused should be regarded was warranting a conviction for a lesser charge.
	
	
	There is nothing which the deceased did which can be reasonably regarded as having any causal effect on the conduct of the accused. She did not physically threaten the accused, or do anything towards him that may have caused him to fear for his life or his safety. The exchange of words which preceded the accused’s conduct was, if anything, rather banal and certainly not out of their ordinary exchanges over the preceding years. In other words, the deceased had no blameworthiness to be attached to her in the circumstances.
	
	
	To the extent that the accused was suffering from depression, I have concluded that it was not severe on the evening of 30 March 2015, and rather that it was mild to moderate. His depression was not of a severity which had caused him to seek medical or psychiatric help. He had not sought out, nor was he taking, medication to alleviate any of his symptoms. He had managed all of his activities that day including making apparently rational decisions.
	
	
	Whilst I can accept that his impaired self-control by reason of his depression contributed in the way I have earlier described to his embarking upon his ferocious and angry attack, I cannot accept that the impairment to his self‑control existed to the same extent throughout the whole of the attack. I am not persuaded that by the time his wife had protested her innocence, and his daughter was screaming for help, when he paused and spoke to his daughter the words “it’s fine, it’s fine”, and then resumed stabbing the deceased, he was doing anything other than making a choice to continue with his stabbing attack on the deceased. In other words, his impaired capacity for self-control did not persist throughout the whole of the attack.
	
	
	Whilst I accept that the accused’s impairment was substantial, the ferocity of the attack, the intention which accompanied it – namely to kill the deceased, the persistence of the accused in the attack notwithstanding his wife and his daughter’s protestations, together with all of the matters to which I have drawn attention, all combine in my view to positively persuade me that it would not be appropriate to convict the accused of manslaughter. Put differently, the accused has not persuaded me that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
	
	
	It follows that the accused has not satisfied me of each of the essential elements of the impairment defence, and it fails.
	
	
	There will be a finding of guilty of murder on Count 1.
	


Count 2


	
	Given that I earlier expressed a satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had an intention to kill at the time he attacked the deceased (which necessarily means that he had an intention to cause her grievous bodily harm), and given that there is no doubt that he wounded his daughter, Ola, when she intervened to try and stop the attack, it follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of the essential elements of the charge in Count 2 are made out, and that the accused is guilty of that offence.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused did not make any submissions at all contrary to a finding of guilty of this offence. Having regard to the accused’s plea of guilty to manslaughter, and his concession that he had the intention to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased, this approach by senior counsel is entirely appropriate.
	
	
	A finding of guilty on this is inevitable.
	
	
	There is no need to consider the offence in Count 3 which was charged as an alternative to Count 2.
	


Verdict


	
	Count 1: that on 30 March 2015, at Bexley in the State of New South Wales, Haydar Haydar did murder Salwa Haydar.
	


Verdict: Guilty.


	
	Count 2: that on 30 March 2015, at Bexley in the State of New South Wales, Haydar Haydar did wound Ola Haydar with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Salwa Haydar.
	


Verdict: Guilty.


	
	Count 3: in the alternative to Count 2, that on 30 March 2015, at Bexley in the State of New South Wales, Haydar Haydar did recklessly wound Ola Haydar.
	


No verdict required.

Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	I find the accused guilty of the offences in Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment presented on 22 February 2017.
	
	
	I direct that convictions be entered for the offence of murder, and the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	I stand the proceedings over to 2pm on 5 May 2017 for proceedings on sentence.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence 

On 2 October 2015 the applicant entered pleas of guilty in relation to the following offences:

One charge of supply a firearm to a person unauthorised to possess it, contrary to s  51(1)(a) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) (""the firearms offence"") for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 5 years.

Two charges of supply a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity contrary to s  25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (""the supply prohibited drug offences""), for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $385,000 with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.


	
	On 1 February 2016, the applicant appeared before Woodburne SC DCJ for sentence. The applicant asked the Court to take into account a further two offences which were dealt with by the Court pursuant to s  33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). These offences of sell a prohibited weapon to a person without a permit and supply a firearm to a person unauthorised to possess it were placed on a Form 1.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by her Honour were:
	


Supply firearm offence (taking into account the matters on the Form 1) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months, commencing 5 December 2014 and expiring 4 October 2016, and a balance of term of 1 year, expiring 4 October 2017.

Supply of not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (269.17g) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing 5 December 2015 and expiring 4 December 2020, and a balance of term of 2 years and 10 months, expiring 4 October 2023.

For the offence of supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (496.1g) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 2 months, commencing 5 June 2016 and expiring 4 August 2021, and a balance of term of 3 years and 10 months, expiring 4 June 2025.


	
	The overall sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months and a head sentence of 10 years and 6 months. The sentence was to commence on 5 December 2014 with a non-parole period expiring 4 August 2021 and the head sentence expiring 4 June 2025.
	


Factual background


	
	In February 2014 police attached to Blacktown detectives commenced Operation Laudanum, investigating drug supply activities in the Blacktown and surrounding areas. During the course of this investigation, police identified the applicant and associates involved in mid to high level supply of crystalline methylamphetamine in the Blacktown area. Police were able to confirm that an associate of the applicant was regularly supplying significant amounts of illicit drugs to the applicant, who would then on sell the drug in smaller amounts.
	
	
	The applicant resided at Dunsmore Road, Rooty Hill.
	


Supply not less than commercial quantity (269.17g methylamphetamine)


	
	This offence was made up of a number of smaller supplies. No useful function would be served in setting out the detail of each supply. It is sufficient to set out in detail one supply and to indicate the number and type of other supplies which comprised the charge being laid in this form.
	
	
	The drugs were supplied to a police undercover operative (UCO). The applicant was in regular contact with the associate before all the supplies and he would then travel with the UCO to the vicinity of the associate's address. Police intercepted a large number of phone calls in relation to these supplies.
	
	
	At about 2.49pm on 26 May 2014 the applicant and UCOs, Tony and Jessica, travelled in Jessica's car to Valentine Street Blacktown at the direction of the applicant. They parked on the southern kerb facing Valda Street. The applicant then exited the car and walked into Valda Street. At about 2.51pm he returned from Valda Street and handed UCO Jessica a medium sized plastic resealable bag containing 21.6g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $6,800. At about 2.55pm the applicant exited the vehicle and walked back towards Valda Street.
	
	
	The other supplies took place on the following dates and in the following amounts:
	


3 June 2014 – 15.35g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $3,500.

4 June 2014 – 43.2g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $11,000.

16 June 2014 – 27g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $6,800.

7 July 2014 – 27.14g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $6,800.

11 July 2014 – 27.18g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $6,800.

11 July 2014 – 55.4g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $13,600.

17 July 2014 – 25.5g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $6,800.

28 July 2014 – 26.8g of crystalline methylamphetamine in exchange for $6,800.


	
	Over that period, the applicant supplied a total of 269.17g of methylamphetamine for an amount of $68,900.
	


Sell prohibited weapon to person without permit (Form 1)


	
	At about 12.06pm on Monday 7 July 2014 the applicant supplied an Apple iPhone shaped taser device to a police UCO for $500, whilst outside his residential premises.
	


Supply firearm (Glock pistol) to person unauthorised to possess it (Form 1)


	
	On 6 June 2014, a lawfully intercepted telephone conversation between the applicant and another male recorded negotiations for the supply of a Glock pistol for $6,000.
	


Supply firearm (Glock pistol) to person unauthorised to possess it


	
	On 16 June 2014 a listening device lawfully recorded a conversation between the applicant and UCO Jessica negotiating the supply of a Glock pistol for $5,000.
	


Supply not less than commercial quantity (496.1g methylamphetamine)


	
	On the days before 6 August 2014 the applicant negotiated with the UCO to supply one kilogram of crystalline methylamphetamine. As negotiations progressed, the applicant informed the UCO that he was only able to supply 500g of crystalline methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On the morning of 6 August 2014 the applicant supplied 496.1g of crystalline methylamphetamine to the UCO at a location on Lyton Street Blacktown. An agreement was entered into by the applicant to accompany the UCO to a shopping complex in Flushcombe Road Prospect.
	
	
	Two associates of the applicant were also present within the shopping complex acting as ""lookouts"". The agreement was for the exchange of $120,000 for the supply of 496.1g of crystalline methylamphetamine. Shortly after arriving at the shopping complex in Flushcombe Road, the applicant was arrested. At the time of his arrest he was in possession of 496.1 grams of crystalline methylamphetamine concealed in a large protein powder container. He submitted to a search during which a two way radio and electronic device for detecting covert surveillance were located. A sum of $755 was also recovered during the search of the applicant.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	When assessing the objective seriousness of the two drug supply offences, her Honour noted that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years and/or 3,500 penalty units. Her Honour considered that it was necessary to have regard to the maximum penalty because it indicated the seriousness with which parliament regarded the offence and served as a yardstick and a basis of comparison between the case at hand and a worst case.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the additional legislative guidepost being the standard non-parole period of 10 years. Her Honour noted that the standard non-parole period represented the non-parole period for the offence, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence which was in the middle of the range of seriousness. The standard non-parole period for an offence was not determinative, but it was a matter to be taken into account by a court in assessing the appropriate sentence for an applicant without limiting the matters that were otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in assessing the appropriate sentence for that applicant.
	
	
	When assessing the objective seriousness of the offending, her Honour took into account a number of other factors.
	


The nature and extent of the planning involved in the commission of the offence


	
	Her Honour noted that although some planning was an inherent characteristic of drug supply offences, she was still entitled to take into account the extent of the planning involved. Her Honour found that the criminal activity was sustained between 25 May and 6 August 2014. It was a commercial enterprise involving the sale of methylamphetamine to his customer the UCO, who placed orders with him. Her Honour accepted that the planning did exceed the norm, given that on occasions an associate or associates followed the applicant and the UCO in another vehicle. Her Honour found as an aggravating factor that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
	


The role of the applicant


	
	Her Honour rejected the proposition that the applicant was ""a mere conduit"". She found that while he could be described as a conduit between the supplier and the UCO, it was necessary to look more closely at the steps he took to effect the supply.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the system involved the applicant maintaining contact with the supplier, negotiating the supplies to the UCO, having the UCO attend upon him, travelling with the UCO to the vicinity of the supplier's premises, attending upon and collecting the drug from the supplier while the UCO waited nearby, providing the drug to the UCO, and receiving money from the UCO. On a number of occasions associates of the applicant would follow him and the UCO as they travelled together in the UCO's car to the vicinity of the supplier's address. Her Honour concluded that the applicant's role in the enterprise was a central one and an important one.
	


Whether and to what extent the applicant participated for financial gain 


	
	Her Honour noted that financial gain was not an inherent characteristic of the offence of supply prohibited drug, although that aggravating factor did not necessarily arise where an applicant was supplying drugs in order to support his or her drug addiction and not for profit. Her Honour further noted that the exact relationship between the applicant and his associates was not known to the court, except to say that an associate of the applicant was regularly supplying significant amounts of illicit drugs to him, and that he would then on sell the drug in smaller amounts. Her Honour noted that it was not known whether upon receipt of money from the UCO that money, or some lesser portion of it, was given directly to the applicant's associate from whom he had collected the drugs.
	
	
	In view of the organised nature of the supply activity, her Honour concluded that the applicant participated for financial gain even if, on the evidence, the extent of that was not known. Her Honour considered that that conclusion was supported by the account recorded by the psychologist, where the applicant explained that because of his significant ice habit, and following upon the failure of his flatmate to pay rent, he had a $10,000 rent debt and that he engaged in the offending to support his own drug habit and to pay the outstanding debt. Her Honour contrasted the applicant's position with that of a person who was motivated solely to participate out of greed. Her Honour found that while he was likely feeding his own ice addiction, there was also an element of participation for financial gain.
	


The amount of the drug supplied 


	
	Her Honour regarded the amount of drug supplied as important but not as the sole determinant of objective gravity. Her Honour noted that the amount in the first offending was towards the bottom of the range specified for an offence to qualify as involving the supply of a “commercial quantity”.
	


The purity of the drug supplied


	
	Her Honour noted that this ranged from 41.5% to 76.5% and would be regarded as being of a relatively high purity enabling, in the ordinary course, further dissemination into the community. Her Honour accepted that the applicant was dealing in a valuable product, its sale price being $68,900.
	
	
	It was against that background that her Honour concluded that the offence was properly to be regarded as a serious one. Her Honour found that for the purpose of funding his own habit and advancing his own financial position, the applicant played an important role in the organised supply of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. While there was no information to suggest the applicant was particularly enriched by his part in the enterprise – only $755 was found on him when he was searched – the enterprise was a commercial one involving the sale of product for some $68,900. While the drugs supplied to the UCO were not disseminated into the community, that did not reduce the applicant's moral culpability for the offence.    
	
	
	In relation to the second offence, her Honour regarded the following matters as important:
	


The nature and extent of the planning involved in the commission of the offence


	
	Her Honour noted that the offence was committed after some days of negotiations with the UCO. The planning extended to having two associates acting as lookouts and to carrying a two way radio and an electronic device for detecting covert surveillance. Her Honour concluded that this took the matter beyond the ordinary planning inherent in drug supply offences.
	


The role of the applicant in the enterprise


	
	Even if he were not the original source of the drugs, her Honour found that the applicant’s role was a central one – he was the person with whom the UCO negotiated, he obtained the drugs, co-ordinated with his associates and carried the relevant equipment.
	


The amount of the drug in the applicant's possession for the purpose of supply


	
	Her Honour noted that the amount involved was 496.1g. It had a purity of 59.5 percent. The purchase price was $120,000. Her Honour concluded that the amount involved was a clear indicator that the applicant well knew that the drug was being supplied for the purpose of further dissemination into the community.
	


The fact that the offence was engaged in with a view to obtaining financial gain


	
	Her Honour had already made findings in relation to this matter when considering the first drug supply offence.
	
	
	In relation to the supply firearm (Glock pistol) her Honour noted that the relative seriousness of the offence was indicated by the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. Her Honour noted that no attempt was made to suggest that the negotiations in relation to the firearms supply were “mere talk”. It was accepted that the negotiations were genuine and that the applicant had access to a person who could supply the firearm, i.e. an automatic pistol, which could fire up to 30 rounds, depending on the size of the magazine.
	
	
	Her Honour found that in determining the sentence to be imposed for this offence, it was proper to have regard to the fact that the delivery of the firearm was not completed. Nevertheless, her Honour found significant moral culpability inherent in the commission of that offence. The applicant showed himself willing to arrange the supply of a firearm to a person he believed to be associated with the illegal drug trade. He was not, for example, offering it for sale to someone who might have decided to keep it as a curiosity. He was prepared to facilitate the supply of a firearm to a person who might, for all he knew or cared, use it in illicit activity. Her Honour found that engaging in such an activity for financial gain was a poor and unworthy motivation. Her Honour found that engaging in the offence of offering to supply a firearm for sale was a deeply anti-social activity directed to undermining the laws put in place to protect society by controlling the distribution of firearms. Her Honour concluded that the penalty to be imposed must reflect those considerations.
	
	
	When sentencing for the supply firearm offence, her Honour noted that she was required to take into account the two matters on the Form 1.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant was born in April 1964 and was aged 51 at the time of sentence. He had a criminal history. That history included the following:
	



	
	Early contact with the criminal justice system beginning in 1981 when he was aged 16.
	
	
	Regular contact thereafter with offences in 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987 – 1989, 1995 – 2006, 2008 – 2009, 2011 – 2013.
	
	
	Convictions for possess a prohibited drug, receiving, illegal use of a conveyance, assault police, malicious damage, possess housebreaking implement, larceny, possession of knife in a public place, goods in custody, obtain money by deception, break, enter and steal, assault, stalk/intimidate and various driving offences, with the bulk of those matters having been dealt with by way of fine or recognisance in the Local Court.
	
	
	There was some history of imprisonment for short periods in 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996 for fine defaults, and in 1998 for assault, goods in custody, allow self to be carried in stolen conveyance and malicious damage. There were more substantial periods of imprisonment in 1989 for break, enter steal, (3 years, non-parole period 1 year) assault police (12 months), assault (12 months), malicious damage (6 months).
	
	
	In 1999 periods of imprisonment imposed for offences of possess implements, steal motor vehicle, larceny, goods in custody, custody of a knife in a public place were ordered to be served by way of periodic detention which was later cancelled by the State Parole Authority with the consequence that the applicant served about 7 months in custody.
	
	
	In 2003 the applicant served short concurrent sentences for possession of housebreaking implement (4 months); possess means of disguising face with intent to commit indictable offence (4 months); custody of knife in a public place (3 months).
	
	
	In 2006 the applicant was dealt with in the Drug Court for offences of break, enter building and commit serious indictable offence, unlawfully obtain goods, dishonestly obtain money by deception and possess prohibited drug (5 months).
	
	
	In 2009 a 6 month period of imprisonment was imposed and suspended for assault of a police officer in execution of duty.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on the present matters on 6 August 2014 and on 28 August 2014 was ordered to serve concurrent 4 month periods of imprisonment for the offences of custody of knife in a public place and possess/use prohibited weapon without permit. That sentence expired on 27 December 2014.
	



	
	Her Honour noted that the applicant although he had considerable contact with the criminal justice system, had no prior convictions for drug or firearm supply offences and as a result at age 51 faced a more lengthy period of imprisonment than he had ever previously served. Her Honour noted that when these offences were committed, the applicant was on bail and the commission of the offences, involved an abuse of the conditional liberty which had been extended to him on 27 December 2013.
	
	
	Her Honour observed that the criminal history raised questions as to the appropriate commencement date for these sentences in circumstances where after his arrest on 6 August 2014 for these matters, he remained in custody bail refused during which time he served a four month sentence of imprisonment for matters unrelated to the present matters.
	
	
	Although the applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, her Honour noted the following matters which affected his childhood which he reported to Ms Durkin, a psychologist, to whom he was referred because of the sentence proceedings.
	



	
	Disengaged, negligent and abusive parenting.
	
	
	A lack of connection with his siblings.
	
	
	Early alcohol abuse commencing at age 8 or 9, with regular consumption from age 16.
	
	
	A painful bone disease requiring surgery at age 9 and ongoing use of prescribed analgesics.
	
	
	Early drug abuse, cannabis from age 12, amphetamines and cocaine from early adolescence, hallucinogenic drug use from    mid-adolescence and intravenous heroin use from age 14.
	
	
	Being knocked unconsciousness and losing most of his teeth in a serious motor vehicle accident at age 16.
	
	
	Repeated absconding from home to avoid his family physically and verbal abuse upon his return.
	
	
	A disrupted education because of his defiant attitude and aggressiveness towards other students and staff, resulting in him being suspended on three occasions in secondary school and ultimately expelled for assaulting a teacher.
	



	
	Her Honour noted that consistent with the applicant’s poor start in life, his adult life has been marked by continued alcohol and drug abuse, regular contact with the criminal justice system, extensive periods of unemployment and ongoing engagement with a peer group immersed in drug use and crime.
	
	
	In his favour, her Honour noted that he entered the workforce in his adolescence and in the early 1990s (around age 25 or so) he completed courses in landscaping and horticulture and obtained his bobcat licence. He had predominantly worked as a landscaper and gardener, with some work as a factory hand and cabinetmaker. He reported being employed in each job on average for about two years. He also experienced extended periods of unemployment due to substance abuse. Over the last 14 years while he was the primary caregiver for his five children, he has been unemployed and relied on government benefits.
	
	
	The applicant met the mother of his children when aged 19 and remained in the relationship for almost 20 years. The relationship was an unstable one characterised by drug use, infidelity and domestic violence. Ultimately the applicant gained custody of his children 14 years ago after his partner was deemed unfit to care for them. His youngest child is now 19 years old and the applicant is a grandfather.
	
	
	The applicant’s biggest achievement to date, and a significant one in light of his own history, was that he was able to get his children out of care and thereafter keep them together, develop a positive relationship with them and raise them such that they are reportedly doing well. His five, very well groomed and clearly concerned children, attended court to support him.
	
	
	In relation to his present circumstances, her Honour noted that in December 2015 when he was being psychologically assessed by Ms Durkin, he was at the Long Bay Hospital as he had a growth in his eye requiring surgery. He was prescribed Avanza (an anti-depressant). He reported being drug (and presumably alcohol) free since entering custody in August of 2014.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at an early point in time and as a result, she discounted his sentence by 25 percent.    
	
	
	Her Honour assessed the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as guarded. She noted that in the past he had attempted repeatedly to address his drug dependence by attending courses and using methadone but had generally failed in all these attempts, despite some brief periods of success lasting up to eight months.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the applicant did not have mental health problems and that his prospects of rehabilitation would be enhanced by drug and alcohol addiction treatment and regular employment.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest, he reported that he was drinking a significant amount of alcohol daily, and smoking about 5g of ice a day. Her Honour was not prepared to take his self induced intoxication at the time of the offending as a mitigating factor. Her Honour was not prepared to find that this was a case where the offences could be described as impulsive. Her Honour was not prepared to find that the offence was mitigated because the applicant was motivated to commit it to support his drug habit. Her Honour was prepared to take his drug addiction into account as an explanation for his offending.
	
	
	On the basis of what he told her, the psychologist, Ms Durkin, concluded that he had not been given sufficient support to help with his pain management. She also expressed the opinion that lack of appropriate supervision and guidance left him vulnerable to destructive influences.
	
	
	Because the applicant did not give evidence, and all of this material came by way of hearsay from the psychologist, her Honour made the following observation:
	


“This is a case where the account provided by the offender as to his history is unsworn. Further, there is no medical evidence concerning the offender’s bone disease, the pain associated with it and its treatment and status over the years. The offender has not claimed any ongoing problem with pain. The offender’s father (and perhaps also his mother) have passed away. He has little connection with his surviving siblings and they have not attended court in support of him. I am mindful his account is unsworn. I am nevertheless prepared to accept the account given, limited though it is, in some respects.”


	
	Accordingly, her Honour was prepared give consideration to this history given by the applicant of growing up in a dysfunctional household where due to abuse and lack of supervision, and an absence of support to deal effectively with pain management, he sought refuge in anti-social connections and drugs at a very young age. Her Honour found that while it did not excuse his offences, it diminished his level of moral culpability to an extent such that consideration could be given to placing some less emphasis on retribution and general deterrence.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the applicant’s long and entrenched criminal history and anti-social lifestyle meant that personal deterrence and the protection of society remained relevant considerations and must be given appropriate weight when balancing all matters and arriving at an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence upon an offender. They were to ensure that the offender was adequately punished for the offence, to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, to protect the community from the offender, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce the conduct of the offender and to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
	
	
	In this case, her Honour determined that general deterrence remained an important consideration when sentencing for offences of commercial drug supply and supply of a firearm. Her Honour regarded personal deterrence as relevant because of the applicant’s long and entrenched criminal and anti-social activity.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account the following to which she was referred by the Crown: Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 (pre Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120); R v Parkinson [2010] NSWCCA 89 (pre Muldrock); Kemp v R [2014] NSWCCA 153; Sant v R [2014] NSWCCA 261 and Lowe v R [2015] NSWCCA 46. All of these cases involved some drug supply. None of the facts were similar to those associated with the applicant’s offending, although there was a general similarity because of the supply of drugs and firearms in some cases. The range of sentences imposed were: Ryan v R – a total sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years; R v Parkinson – an overall term of 9 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months; Kemp v R – an overall sentence of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years; Sant v R – an overall sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years; Lowe v R – an overall sentence of 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded from her analysis of those cases that the courts take a serious attitude towards offences of supply of a commercial quantity of prohibited drug.
	
	
	Her Honour took into account the principle of totality. This was because the applicant had submitted that the sentences for the two drug supply offences should be served concurrently because they should be viewed as a single course of conduct. By reference to Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] her Honour assessed whether the sentence for one offence could comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other. Her Honour concluded that there was a large degree of commonality in the circumstances of the offending. Each offence involved a supply by the applicant to the UCO of the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine. The last date on which drugs relating to the first supply matter were handed over was 28 July and the date of the second supply was 6 August 2014. Her Honour noted that the second offence was a product of the ongoing relationship between the UCO and the applicant.
	
	
	Her Honour declined, however, to make the drug supply sentences totally concurrent. Her Honour concluded that each of the offences was serious in its own right involving a significant amount of drugs. While the common features in the offences justified a significant degree of concurrency, her Honour was not persuaded that an appropriate sentence for one offence could comprehend the criminality involved in the commission of both offences. As a result, her Honour considered that a degree of accumulation was appropriate so as to properly mark the fact that the applicant committed two very serious offences.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that a degree of accumulation was required for the supply firearm offence, even having regard to the fact that the firearm was not ultimately handed over. Her Honour noted that drug suppliers are often in possession of firearms for a number of well known reasons. Having made those findings, her Honour still kept in mind the principle of totality. Her Honour found that there were special circumstances so that the balance of the term would be more than one-third of the non-parole period. This was because of the applicant’s longstanding drug addiction and his need for an extended period of support on his release.
	
	
	While her Honour remained conscious of the maximum penalties for each of the drug supply offences, and of the standard non-parole period which applied, she declined to impose that standard non-parole period because she considered that a lesser non-parole period was appropriate having regard to all the matters before her, including the level of objective seriousness of the offending, the applicant’s moral culpability, his plea of guilty and the need for rehabilitation which if ultimately successful, would operate to protect the community from his offending.
	
	
	Her Honour then proceeded to pass sentence.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive


	
	The principal complaint of the applicant is that the sentences imposed, by reference to the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) statistics show that the individual sentences were at the very top of sentences imposed for drug supply offences. The applicant submitted that even leaving aside drug supply offences, the sentence imposed on him was in the top 10 percent of sentences imposed generally. In making that submission, the applicant acknowledged that sentencing statistics have considerable limitations and restraint had to be observed when relying upon them. Even so, the applicant submitted that the undeniable fact was that the two drug supply sentences were at the upper end of the spectrum for offences of that kind.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon her Honour’s finding that in part he was acting as a courier and on the acceptance by her Honour of the history recorded by Ms Durkin, the psychologist, that he had a poor start in life and that his early years were characterised by alcohol and drug abuse. The applicant also relied upon her Honour’s finding that despite his drug addiction problems and almost continuous interaction with the criminal justice system, he was able to be the primary carer of his children, all of whom appeared to have embarked upon successful careers. The applicant referred to the fact (recorded by her Honour) that his five children had attended court and were supportive of him.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that when regard was had to those matters, the sentences imposed for the two drug supply offences and the aggregate sentence can be seen as unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	The applicant summarised the bases for that submission as follows:
	



	
	The sentences imposed were at the upper end of the spectrum.
	
	
	His role as a conduit between the police UCO and principal supplier, although important, was an ancillary one.
	
	
	He has had what can be fairly described as a tragic upbringing.
	
	
	He had no prior convictions for drug or firearm supply.
	
	
	He had a long history of drug dependency.
	
	
	Financial gain was only part of his motivation in committing the offences.
	


Consideration


	
	The emphasis by the applicant on his unfortunate upbringing requires further analysis. When one looks at what the psychologist reported, it is a far different picture to that referred to by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600. In those cases, the offenders were brought up in an atmosphere comprising alcohol and drug abuse, domestic and other violence and criminal activity. That was not the applicant’s circumstances. His parents were described as hard and unsympathetic. That is a far cry from the Bugmy and Munda circumstances. His engagement at an early age with alcohol and drug abuse would appear to be essentially a decision of his own and not, as it were, forced upon him by a tragic environment. In any event, her Honour dealt with that issue in considerable detail.
	
	
	What the applicant’s submissions carefully avoid is the seriousness of the offending. While the applicant may have been an ice addict, he was also very active and performed an essential function in a commercial enterprise involving the supply of that substance in Western Sydney. That criminal activity took place over a substantial period of time (May – August 2014) and unless the police had intervened, would have continued. The half kilogram drug supply offence involved a significant escalation in criminality which was appropriately reflected in the longer sentence imposed. The level of planning in this commercial enterprise was significant and has been fully documented in her Honour’s reasons. There is no point in repeating the matters which her Honour took into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. These have been fully set out in respect of both of the supply offences in her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	The criminality involved in the weapon supply offence should also not be ignored. This was not a circumstance where a drug supplier was found to be in possession of a weapon, which it could be inferred he carried for his own defence, given the milieu in which he was operating. The applicant had access to and was in a position to supply at least two very dangerous weapons, i.e. Glock automatic pistols. The prevalence of shooting incidents in Sydney over recent years provides ample evidence of the danger to the public of such weapons being made available to criminals. Given the nature of the proposed transactions, these weapons were not intended by the applicant to be supplied to people who were likely to use them for lawful purposes. The criminality of that offence, taken with the two Form 1 matters, was substantial.
	
	
	The fact that the drug supply and firearm supply transactions did not result in the weapons and drugs being disseminated into the community does not reduce either the objective seriousness of the offending nor the applicant’s moral culpability. In relation to the firearm offence, it is difficult not to conclude that the purpose of that transaction was the financial benefit of the applicant rather than to pay for his drug habit. The applicant’s extensive criminal history disentitled him to any leniency on that basis. The fact that the applicant had not been convicted of offences as serious as these in the past, does not necessarily assist him. There is no evidence that these were his first offences of this kind, only that this was the first time that he had been apprehended and convicted. What the offences do indicate is a significant escalation in his criminal activity by reference to his past history, the reason for which remains unexplained.
	
	
	A further aggravating factor was that these offences were committed while the applicant was on bail. Given his criminal history, he would have been well aware of what a grant of bail entailed and the consequences for breaching conditions. These present offences indicate a complete disregard on his part for his bail undertaking.
	
	
	This Court has on many occasions set out the limitations associated with a reliance upon statistics. While statistics do provide some assistance in indicating in a very general way a range of sentences which have been imposed, they say nothing about the particular circumstances of the offending, nor do they say anything about the strength or otherwise of the subjective cases of the persons involved. What the applicant’s submissions ignore by focusing upon the individual sentences imposed for the drug supply offences is the ultimate sentence imposed. There was a very significant amount of concurrency in the final sentence. Her Honour clearly had in mind and applied the principle of totality when arriving at it.
	
	
	As the review of the sentence proceedings makes clear, her Honour carefully examined every aspect of the Crown case and the defence case, made her findings and gave reasons for those findings. Her judgment was in every way a model example of a proper sentencing judgment. It could not and has not been suggested by the applicant that any aspect of his case was not considered by her Honour.
	
	
	Having made that analysis, her Honour proceeded to balance the competing considerations in order to arrive at her final sentence. No error has been identified in that process. What the applicant says is that the end result is simply too high.
	
	
	I do not agree. Intervention by this Court is not warranted simply because a sentence is stern or on the high side. As was said in Hili v the Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [60]:
	


“… what reveals manifest excess, or inadequacy, of sentence is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence.”


	
	Her Honour clearly carried out that process and the contrary has not been suggested. With respect to the statistics put forward by the applicant, the fact that his sentence lies towards the top of a statistical range is not determinative. In that regard, the observations of RS Hulme J (with whom Ipp JA and Bell J agreed) in R v Nai Poon [2003] NSWCCA 42; 56 NSWLR 284 at [48] – [51] are apposite:
	


“48    … It is unnecessary for me to repeat such an exercise here although it is worth repeating that the infinite variation of facts and degree which fall for consideration in sentencing and the exercise of the discretionary judgment which is involved make comparison with anything but a large number of cases, and commonly even then, generally unprofitable.

49    However it was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the sentence imposed in this case exceeded any other that could be found for an offender similarly situated – a courier of a trafficable quantity who had pleaded guilty. The table prepared by me in R v Schofield supports this contention but the question arises, so what? Once it is accepted that not all sentences are of the same length, one or more offenders in any group must receive the longest sentence.

50    In that regard there are some remarks of Grove J in an ex tempore judgment in R v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 410 at [14-15] that are apposite:-

“… there is a misconception that the upper limit of the range of sentence is that of the statistical publications of sentence information by the Judicial Commission. …

The upper limit of sentence is in fact the maximum set by Parliament. If the upper limit of the statistical range is treated as reserved for the worst case or the worst offender, then persistent selection of sentences for others within that range will inevitably reduce the upper figure.”

51    Howie J agreed with Grove J. In R v Hofer [2001] NSWCCA 544 so did Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J. With the qualification that words along the lines “effective available range” should be substituted for “upper figure”, so do I. The sooner the misconception disappears, the better.”


	
	The sentences imposed by her Honour were neither unfair nor unjust. The sentences were required to comprehend the objective seriousness of two not insignificant supply prohibited drug offences, together with a supply firearm offence, which occurred in the context of the illegal drug trade. In the statutory context of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period specified for the supply prohibited drug offences, the sentences imposed upon the applicant were not manifestly excessive. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	GARLING J: I am grateful to the Chief Judge for his detailed description of all of the facts and circumstances raised by this application.
	
	
	The applicant does not suggest that the sentencing remarks contained any identifiable error. He only seeks to argue that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. As the Chief Judge’s reasons show, this argument is without any merit. I would not grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	But it is important to record that the sentencing Judge’s remarks were a model of thoroughness and clarity. For my part, they cannot be improved upon. In dismissing this application, I am entirely content to adopt as my own the remarks of the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The application for leave to appeal ought to be dismissed.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

	BATHURST CJ: I agree with R A Hulme J. I would only add this; first, the Court could only intervene if there was error by the sentencing judge, or the sentence was manifestly excessive. For the reasons given by R A Hulme J, there does not appear to be error in the approach taken by the sentencing judge, nor in my opinion could the sentence be said to be manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	The offence is a serious one, and even taking into account the fact it was below the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of this nature, and the extremely strong subjective case mounted by the applicant, the sentence could not be said to fall within the category of unreasonable or plainly unjust. In those circumstances, regardless of the sympathy one could have for the applicant, there is no basis on which this Court could intervene.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Faafaletimu Jane Vaiusu (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon her in the Parramatta District Court on 15 August 2016 by his Honour Judge Letherbarrow SC.
	
	
	The applicant had pleaded guilty to an offence of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, an offence contrary to s 33(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years and for which a standard non-parole period of 7 years applies.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 2 months commencing on 15 August 2016. She is due to be released on parole when the non-parole period expires on 14 October 2017.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal:
	


The sentence imposed upon the applicant is manifestly excessive.

Facts


	
	The facts concerning the offence were agreed and were recounted with some additional remarks by the learned sentencing judge as follows:
	


“The victim is married to the offender’s sister, Malaga. On Saturday, 17 October 2015, the offender, the victim’s cousin, and the victim’s nephew were at the victim’s and Malaga’s house in Cabramatta. Whilst it is not in the agreed facts, I am satisfied from the offender’s oral evidence that, during this period of time, alcohol was drunk and she herself said that she shared half a box of mixed spirit drinks between about 5 and 6pm.

Returning to the agreed facts, between about 8 and 8.30pm, the offender, her sister and the others went to a Samoan party at the Serbian Club in Canley Vale. Whilst at that club, the victim consumed a number of alcoholic drinks, as did the offender, although she ceased drinking alcohol after 11pm. Just after midnight on 18 October, the offender, the victim, Malaga and two others, went to the Stardust Hotel at Cabramatta and played some poker machines and the victim continued to drink alcohol.

At 2.51am, the victim was removed by security from the Stardust Hotel. Malaga and two of the others went outside to calm him down. Whilst they were outside, there was a scuffle between security and the victim. Malaga tried to grab the victim and he accidentally punched her on the chin. The scuffle continued with some of the others becoming involved and the victim fell to the ground and scraped his forehead. Everyone then returned inside the club except the victim. A short time later, the offender went outside the club to speak to the victim. She then returned inside the club and Malaga, her sister, told her that the victim had hit her. Whilst the agreed facts record that this was an accident, in her evidence before me, Malaga said that she did not tell her sister that the blow was accidental.

Upon being told this, the offender went to a rubbish bin and grabbed a beer bottle and went to walk outside the hotel with it. She was stopped by one of the other persons in the group and another took the bottle from her. The offender then walked out of the club. She then found a glass beer bottle on the footpath in the laneway near the hotel. She then cracked that bottle on the ground and kept part of the broken glass.

When her sister and one of the others came outside the hotel, the offender asked them where the victim was and she was told that he was across the road at the train station. At 3.24am, the offender commenced to walk up the stairs of the Cabramatta train station with her right hand wrapped around the piece of glass that she had kept. The victim was standing at the top of the stairs on the train station concourse. He remained there when the offender got to the top of the stairs and they had a conversation. At 3.25, the offender stabbed the victim three times to the neck with the piece of glass.

Shortly thereafter, one of the others got to the top of the stairs and tackled the offender to the ground. CCTV from the train station captured the incident and the wounding and, as I said, the DVD thereof is part of the Crown bundle and I watched it. It shows that the wounding was unprovoked, regardless of what had happened earlier, in the sense that without warning and whilst the victim was simply standing next to the offender, she stabbed him quite violently with the glass shard three times to his neck area.

An ambulance was called and the victim was taken to Liverpool Hospital and admitted at about 3.55am. He had a 10 centimetre transverse wound to his neck, left of the mid-line, with active bleeding. There were three additional superficial incised wounds in the same area which were not bleeding. The victim underwent surgery and the 10 centimetre wound was sutured.

On 19 October 2015, the offender attended Cabramatta Police Station and participated in an ERISP. She admitted to having stabbed the victim because she was “pissed off”. The offender said that she was not intoxicated at the time and she said that she had broken the beer bottle because she wanted something “sharp” and that she hid the piece of glass in her hand so the others would not see it.”

The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	The applicant was born of parents of Samoan heritage in 1990. She was raised in New Zealand and came to Australia with her family when she was aged 14. Whilst in New Zealand she was raised by her grandparents due to her mother often being absent because of employment commitments. She described her relationship with her mother as one offering little or no affection or emotional support. She has had no consistent contact with her biological father and did not know his identity until she was aged 14.
	
	
	She described her relationship with her stepfather as tumultuous and there was domestic violence in the home. The sentencing judge was satisfied that there was a degree of social deprivation in the applicant’s early upbringing.
	
	
	The family initially resided with uncles and cousins after they came to Australia. When the applicant was 15 she went to live in Broken Hill with an aunt with whom she had a good relationship. She completed her education in Year 12 and returned to Sydney. She then went back to New Zealand for about a year where she lived with relatives before returning to Australia at the age of 19. She met her future husband during that time.
	
	
	The applicant reunited with her future husband in Australia when she was about 20 and they started living together when she was about 22. She engaged in unskilled employment until the birth of her child in March 2013.
	
	
	Shortly before the birth of her daughter the applicant’s husband was diagnosed with stage four stomach and liver cancer. He had been unwell for about 18 months up to that point. His condition deteriorated quickly after his diagnosis and he passed away in April 2015. The sentencing judge accepted that his death “had a terrible effect upon her emotionally”.
	
	
	The applicant commenced drinking alcohol when she was about 16 and engaged in occasional binge drinking but the judge was satisfied that alcohol was not a problem for her before her husband’s death. However he noted that her grief reaction was such that she started to use alcohol significantly.
	
	
	A report by a clinical psychologist, Ms Danielle Hopkins, was tendered in the sentence proceedings. The judge was satisfied on the basis of the opinion of Ms Hopkins, as well as a report by the applicant’s treating psychologist, Ms Michele Jackson and evidence from the applicant’s sister that after her husband’s death the applicant commenced to suffer from depression significantly to the point where she would have met a diagnosis for a major depressive disorder and that this condition was untreated at the time of the subject offending. The applicant’s sister had given evidence that she was often crying and locking herself in her room. The judge was satisfied that the applicant’s mental condition at the time of the offence was “such that her moral culpability is reduced and that matters such as general deterrence, retribution, and denunciation have less weight”.
	
	
	The judge had regard to the applicant having sought treatment since the offence and had received psychological counselling from two practitioners. His Honour was satisfied that her depression could be adequately managed in custody but accepted nonetheless that it would make any period in custody “somewhat more burdensome for her, as will the possibility that she will be without her daughter in custody”.
	
	
	The judge found that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were “very good”. This finding was made on the basis of the apparent support of family members in attendance at court; the fact that she had been on bail for some time and not reoffended; and that she had been receiving treatment.
	
	
	The judge was satisfied that the applicant was “very remorseful”. His Honour noted that the applicant had apologised to her victim who had forgiven her. His Honour also regarded the plea of guilty as a demonstration of remorse.
	
	
	Special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were found so as to justify the non-parole period being at a lower level than otherwise would be the case. The finding was made on the basis that this would be the applicant’s first time in custody; she was still relatively young; and that she would need a longer period on parole to facilitate her rehabilitation.
	


Finding as to objective seriousness


	
	The judge found that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the middle of the range. It had been submitted on behalf of the applicant that it was “at the lower end of the range” whilst the representative of the Crown had submitted that it was between the middle and the bottom of the range.
	
	
	The finding by his Honour was made after he referred to the considerable violence in the attack which was facilitated by the use of a piece of broken bottle. He regarded the use of a weapon as an aggravating feature. His Honour noted that the victim had recovered without any ongoing disabilities apart from some scarring but found that the attack was “quite a vicious one and without any immediate provocation”. He noted that it occurred after the applicant had attempted to arm herself with a bottle inside the hotel which was taken off her but she then went outside and armed herself again. She had then walked some distance in pursuing the victim with the obvious purpose of committing the assault in question.
	


Submissions for the applicant


	
	The written submissions for the applicant included acceptance of the finding by the sentencing judge that the objective seriousness of the offence was below the middle of the range. It was contended that ""the real issue in this case is the weight to be given to the [applicant’s] subjective circumstances"". These were described as ""exceptional"" such that a sentence of not more than two years should have been imposed, thus making the applicant eligible for consideration of an intensive correction order pursuant to s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant listed the following subjective features as particularly pertinent:
	


The applicant was ""quite young"", aged 25.

There were only driving offences on her record; she was sentenced as a first offender.

There was a plea of guilty at the first opportunity.

The applicant was affected by alcohol at the time of the offence.

She had suffered the recent loss of her husband to cancer.

She had a 3 year old daughter from whom she would likely be separated if sentenced to full-time custody.

She suffered from untreated major depression at the time of the offence.

Her attack on the victim was in response to his [perceived] assault upon her sister.

She had a difficult upbringing in New Zealand, particularly as a result of violence perpetrated by her step-father.

Notwithstanding her disadvantages, she had completed secondary schooling with quite good results.

She had no grief counselling prior to the offence.

She had expressed genuine remorse.

She had been forgiven by both her sister and the victim.

Her prospects of rehabilitation were accepted as being very good.


	
	It was submitted that the judge failed to take sufficient account of the applicant's background as the direct and indirect victim of domestic violence. The judge noted that her step-father had been violent towards her mother but failed to mention that included in the history the applicant provided to Ms Hopkins was that he had also been violent towards her; punching her on several occasions and causing black eyes.
	
	
	It was submitted that the judge had also failed to mention her account of the applicant's late husband having ""verbally gone off at me"" and having punched her on one occasion, chipping her tooth, while she was holding her daughter.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the judge failed to mention that the applicant witnessed domestic violence by her brother-in-law (the victim of the index offence) towards her sister after she had moved to live with them after the death of her husband.
	
	
	It was put in oral submissions today that his Honour made no reference to the applicant’s daughter being left without any parent to care for her in the event the applicant was sentenced to full-time custody.
	
	
	It was submitted that in light of the subjective matters listed above, and the history of domestic violence in the applicant's life, the sentence was manifestly excessive and that this Court should intervene by imposing a sentence of two years or less and consider ordering that it be served by way of an intensive correction order.
	


Principles


	
	When it is contended that a sentence is manifestly excessive it is necessary to have regard to the following principles derived from Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]; Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325 [6]; Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58]; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]; and Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [55].
	



	
	Appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at in the court below is markedly different from sentences imposed in other cases.
	
	
	Intervention is only warranted where the difference is such that it may be concluded that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the reasons of the sentencing judge, or where the sentence imposed is so far outside the range of sentences available that there must have been error.
	
	
	It is not to the point that this Court might have exercised the sentencing discretion differently.
	
	
	There is no single correct sentence and judges at first instance are allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and application of principle.
	
	
	It is for the applicant to establish that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	



	
	To the extent that the applicant complains of insufficient weight having been given to the applicant's subjective case it must be borne in mind that matters of weight are very much in the province of the sentencing judge and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify appellate intervention are narrowly confined: Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49 at [25]. Further, as Button J observed in Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 at [33], ""the only way that one can test whether a factor (to which regard or weight has indeed been given) was considered sufficiently, is by examining the sentence ultimately imposed"".
	


Determination


	
	All of the pertinent features of the applicant's subjective case listed above (at [22]) were the subject of specific reference by the primary judge in his remarks on sentence and so it cannot be said that he overlooked any of them.
	
	
	The specific complaints raised in the applicant's submissions (see above at [23]-[25]) must be assessed in light of the sentencing judge having proceeded directly to delivering an ex tempore judgment at the conclusion of hearing the evidence and submissions. As Spigelman CJ observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 577 [48], ""The conditions under which District Court judges give such reasons are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed"". It has also been said that ""economy of expression in an ex tempore statement of reasons should not too readily be assumed to reveal oversight"": PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 at [46] (McCallum J).
	
	
	The complaint about the failure of the judge to refer to the applicant being a victim of violence at the hands of her step-father cannot be sustained. It was detailed in the report of Ms Hopkins (at [7]; [31]). His Honour commenced his review of the subjective material by saying, ""Her subjective circumstances, all of which I have taken into account, appear in the various reports …"". (ROS 5.1)
	
	
	It is abundantly clear that his Honour was cognisant of the domestic violence to which Ms Hopkins made reference. She introduced the topic by saying that the applicant ""stated that her relationship with her stepfather, who came into her life when she was around six years of age, was tumultuous"". His Honour said, ""She described her relationship with her stepfather as tumultuous"", albeit he then only made reference to domestic violence against the applicant's mother.
	
	
	It is true that the judge made no mention of the applicant's late husband verbally ""going off at her"" and punching her on the occasion of their daughter's first birthday party (Hopkins report at [15]). However, the applicant also told Ms Hopkins that she was not fearful of her husband and that they had ""worked through it"". This aspect was not of sufficient significance to warrant his Honour making specific mention of it.
	
	
	It is also true that the judge made no mention of past domestic violence between the victim and the applicant's sister. Again, this was not something that required specific mention by the judge. The predominant feature of the applicant's case as to her motivation in committing the offence was her mental condition. The judge accepted without question that her moral culpability was reduced on this account and he made consequential findings that were favourable to the applicant.
	
	
	As to the complaint raised about the applicant’s child being left without parental care, the first point is that this was not specifically raised as a relevant issue for his Honour to take into account. Secondly, it should not be readily concluded that he was not unmindful of it. Thirdly, his Honour was given to understand that the child would be cared for by the applicant’s supportive family. His Honour was informed that the applicant intended to make an application to have her child with her in custody if that transpired, but clearly that was only a possibility. In the event that application was not successful, his Honour made a finding in the applicant’s favour (see above at [15]).
	
	
	An important aspect in determining whether the sentence imposed can be characterised as manifestly excessive is the very high maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment provided by Parliament for an offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act. The guidepost of the standard non-parole period of 7 years must also be borne in mind: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27].
	
	
	In this case, the starting point of 3 years adopted by the sentencing judge before reduction on account of the applicant's early plea of guilty to 2 years and 3 months was commensurate with an assessment of below mid-range objective seriousness, reduced moral culpability and a subjective case that warranted substantial mitigation of penalty. The reduction of the non-parole period to 1 year and 2 months, when by the usual statutory proportions it would otherwise have been 6 months longer, was also reflective of a measured approach to the assessment of sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s subjective case called for a considerable degree of sympathy but I cannot perceive that the judge approached it otherwise. He was, of course, bound to sentence in accordance with established sentencing principles. This is what he did.
	
	
	In the end, I am not persuaded that the sentence was beyond the legitimate bounds of the primary judge's sentencing discretion.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	BEECH-JONES J: The background to this application for leave to appeal is set out the judgment of R A Hulme J. At the time of her sentencing, the Applicant undoubtedly presented a strong subjective case. To that end the sentencing judge made a number of findings that were favourable to her. Nevertheless the nature of her attack on the victim was such that no sentence other than one which involved full time custody was warranted. While the imposition of a sentence of lesser duration was open to the sentencing judge, I am not satisfied that the sentence actually imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	At the hearing of this application, Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the effect on the Applicant of the separation from her daughter that would follow if she was incarcerated. However the likelihood of separation was a matter specifically adverted to and considered by the sentencing judge. Counsel for the Applicant also submitted that the sentencing judge did not consider the effect on the Applicant’s daughter of her being separated from her mother in circumstances where her father passed away. The difficulty with that contention is that no submission to that effect was made to the sentencing judge. Further evidence was not sought to be adduced on this application concerning the current circumstances of the Applicant’s daughter and the effect on her of being separated from her mother. In those circumstances the difficult questions concerning how sentencing courts address hardship to third parties such as children of offenders do not arise.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J.

4276311,Cheng v R [2017] NSWCCA 63,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and Crown case

The appellant was charged with the offence of dealing with money intending that it would become an instrument of crime, contrary to s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (the “Code”). The indictment was in the following terms:

“Benny Zhong Cheng between about 27 May 2012 and 17 July 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did deal with money or other property intending that the money or other property will become an instrument of crime, and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or other property was $1,000,000 or more.

Contrary to section 400.3(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code (Cth).”


	
	The appellant’s trial took place before Norrish QC DCJ and a jury between 2 December and 9 December 2015. The appellant was sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months, commencing 18 March 2016 and expiring 17 December 2018, to be released after serving 15 months upon entering into a recognizance on 17 June 2017 pursuant to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 20(1)(b) self in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for 3 years.
	
	
	The appellant has appealed against his conviction on the following ground:
	


The verdict was not open at law in that the jury could never find that:

(a)   At the time of dealing with the subject money the appellant intended that it “will become” an instrument of crime; or

(b)   That the subject money was “used” in the commission of an offence.


	
	The factual basis for the prosecution case at trial was either agreed or uncontested. It was set out in a statement of “Agreed Facts” (Exhibit A), supplemented by some oral evidence from investigators and an employee of a registered money remitter and reporting entity as defined in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML Act).
	
	
	The Crown case was that between 27 May 2012 and 17 July 2012 the appellant conducted 11 transactions which resulted in a total of AU$1,098,066 in cash being converted into Chinese currency and transferred to bank accounts held in China. Each of the 11 transactions was outlined in the Agreed Facts and followed a similar pattern. It is, therefore, sufficient to only recite the first transaction as an example of the [appellant’s] conduct.
	
	
	The facts of that transaction were that on Monday 28 May 2012 the appellant entered Sun Capital Pty Ltd, a registered money remitter and reporting entity as defined in the AML Act. The appellant spoke to a staff member enquiring as to the exchange rate before stating that he wished to remit AU$100,000 cash to an account in China. He was requested to produce identification, at which time he produced a NSW drivers licence in the name of Nick Wang, date of birth 2 September 1965, address 20/108-110 Kiora Road, Miranda NSW, licence number 13230589 and bearing his image. He also supplied a mobile telephone number. The staff member satisfied himself that the appellant was the person in the photograph. The staff member then at the appellant's request, converted the AU$100,000.00 cash into 626,000 Ren Min Bi (RMB) and remitted it into an account which was held in China. The appellant signed an invoice completing the transaction. The name and identity documents were false.
	
	
	The appellant repeated this conduct on 10 further occasions, attending various registered money remitters, and on each occasion using the same false name and producing the same false identity documents.
	
	
	The appellant made an unsuccessful application at the close of the Crown case of no case to answer. The appellant did not give evidence. His counsel in closing did not contest any facts and did not advance any argument as to the appellant's guilt.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	Section 400.3 of the Code relevantly provides:
	


“(1)   A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)   the person deals with money or other property; and

(b)   …

(i) ...

(ii)   the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and

(c)    at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is

   $1,000,000 or more.


	
	""Deals with money or other property"" is defined at s 400.2 and relevantly provides:
	


“(a)   receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property; …”


	
	""Instrument of crime"" is defined at s 400.1 and relevantly provides:
	


“money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence against the a law of the Commonwealth … that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).”


	
	The Code specifies that s 400.2A has application to cases relating to ""possible instruments of crime"" and therefore has application to this matter.
	
	
	Section 400.12 of the Code provides that:
	


“(1)   A single charge of an offence against a provision of this Division may be about 2 or more instances of the defendant engaging in conduct (at the same time or different times) that constitutes an offence against a provision of this Division.

(2)   If:

(a)   a single charge is about 2 or more such instances; and

(b)   the value of the money and other property dealt with is an element of the offence in question;

that value is taken to be the sum of the values of the money and other property dealt with in respect of each of those instances.”


	
	The offence identified in order to satisfy the requirement of s 400.3(1)(b)(ii)) was s 140 of the AML Act. Section 140 relevantly provided:
	


“(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a)   the person commences to receive a designated service; and

(b)   the person does so using a false customer name; and

(c)   at least one provision of Division 2, 3 or 4 of Part 2 applies to the provision of the designated service.”


	
	This is a Commonwealth indictable offence.
	
	
	Section 6 of the AML Act sets out the activities which constitute a “designated service” (as to 1 (a) above) for the purposes of the AML Act. Item 31 of s 6 relevantly provides:
	


“[Provision of a designated service –] in the capacity of a non-financier carrying on a business of giving effect to remittance arrangements, accepting an instruction from a transferor entity for the transfer of money or property under a designated remittance arrangement.

[Customer of designated service –] the transferor entity.”


	
	A “designated remittance arrangement” is defined in s 10(1) of the AML Act. A “remittance arrangement” is defined by s 10(2) of the AML Act. “Transferor entity” is defined by s 10(3)(a) of the AML Act. Section 5 of the AML Act contains the definitions of “commence to provide a designated service” and “receives a designated service”.
	


The appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant does not challenge the correctness of the directions given to the jury as to the elements of the offence (and associated terms) or his Honour's directions as to the application of them to the evidence. Rather, the challenge is solely whether the evidence is capable of satisfying the offence provision.
	
	
	The appellant's argument, rests on two propositions:
	



	
	that there is no temporal separation between the alleged dealing (in this case, the possessing of money) and the intended use of the money (in this case, the remittal of that money overseas using the money remitter) and
	
	
	that there is no instrumental connection between the money and the commission of the s 140 offence.
	



	
	In relation to the first argument, the appellant submitted that the Crown had failed to establish that the money “will become” an instrument of crime in that it failed to establish the required “temporal separation” required under s 400.3(1)(b). In support of that proposition, the appellant relied upon the observation of the court (French CJ, Hayne, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) in Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 252 CLR 149 at [33]:
	


“Instrument of crime – the constructional question

33   For property to become an instrument of crime within the meaning of s 400.3(1) it must be ‘used’. An ordinary meaning of the verb ‘use’ is ‘[t]o make use of (some immaterial thing) as a means or instrument; to employ for a certain end or purpose.’ That is the relevant ordinary meaning for the definition of ‘become an instrument of crime’ which involves the ‘use’ of property to serve a purpose, namely the ‘commission of an offence’ or ‘to facilitate the commission of an offence’. The relevant ordinary meaning of ‘facilitate’ in this case is ‘[t]o render easier the performance of (an action), the attainment of (a result); to afford facilities for, promote, help forward (an action or process)’.

…

37   The definition of ‘instrument of crime’ and the deployment of that term in s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) require a temporal separation between the requisite dealing and the intended use of the property. …”


	
	In relation to the “temporal separation issue”, the appellant also relied upon the decision of Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 205; 83 NSWLR 224. In that case the appellant had been found guilty of an offence under s 400.5(1), being that he “dealt with money that he intended would become an instrument of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $50,000 or more”. The relevant further intended offence was action which was contrary to s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) which section prohibited the conducting of transactions so as to avoid the applicable reporting requirement. The Crown therein asserted that there were 150 money transactions transferring a total of over $1 million overseas, 142 transactions of which involved amounts less than AU$10,000.
	
	
	On this issue, Basten JA held that the money the subject of any particular transaction could not properly be described as proceeds of crime committed in the past. His Honour said:
	


“18   Where the dealing is a single act, that is no doubt so; where there is a series of acts charged as a single offence the temporal dichotomy becomes difficult to identify. For example, in the present case, the first transaction relied upon, being for an amount of less than $10,000, would not have constituted an offence against s 31 of the FTR Act, because it involved only one non-reportable cash transaction. At that stage, it may have been appropriate to say that the applicant intended the money to become an instrument of crime, at some point in the future. However, there would not have been a contravention of s 400.5 of the Code at that stage because the dealing did not involve $50,000 or more. On the other hand, where a single charge is laid in respect of a number of instances of conduct, engaged in at different times, the value of the money is to be calculated, pursuant to s 400.12, at the time of the last transaction: before that, the sum of the values of the money cannot be known. Yet at no time was the money the subject of any particular transaction properly describable as proceeds of a crime committed in the past, because the crime had not been committed until that transaction was complete.

…

20   As the case was opened to the jury (as set out above) it would seem that, had the prosecution been required to particularise the acts constituting the dealing with money for the purposes of s 400.5 and the relevant transactions, for the purposes of s 31 of the FTR Act, the conduct would in each case have been the same. However, s 400.5 does not contemplate that the dealing with money, being the primary physical element of that offence, can itself be the physical element of the ‘second tier of inchoate crime’, to use the language of Simpson J in Ansari (at [24]). Referring to the offence under s 400.3 as a ‘money laundering offence’, she noted that the ‘money laundering offence is, for relevant purposes, committed where a second crime is in contemplation’. That case involved a conspiracy to commit a criminal act, her Honour explaining in that context that:

""... where the criminal act alleged to be the subject of the agreement is money laundering, the Crown must also prove that the person accused has in contemplation a second crime. That is because money laundering is, by definition, committed where another crime is envisaged – and is not committed unless some other crime is in contemplation (or has been committed)"".

21   That analysis cannot apply where the money laundering offence and the second tier inchoate crime are one and the same. Despite s 400.12, it is not possible to read the operative provision, in this case s 400.5, as being engaged where there is only one physical element. The fact that the same physical element may give rise to separate crimes does not overcome the problem that s 400.5 requires contemplation of a future crime involving the same money.

…

23   The consequence of this reading of the section is that, as a matter of law, and accepting as proved all the facts relied upon by the prosecution, no offence was committed under s 400.5 in respect of any future offence, if the latter offence were identified by reference to the operation of s 31 of the FTR Act on the same transactions.”


	
	Observations to similar effect were made by Garling J as follows:
	


“86   The attempt by the Director to use acts which constituted the less serious but completed crime of structuring, to prove the necessary elements of the more serious crime of money laundering failed to grapple with the plain meaning of s 400.5 of the Criminal Code, in particular, the future tense expressed in the words ‘... intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime’.

87   All that the Director proved in this case was that ‘... the money or other property...’ was or had become an instrument of crime, not that it would become an instrument of crime at some time in the future.

88   There was no basis in the structuring offence as it was particularised in the trial here, which was capable of proving the more serious money laundering offence.”


	
	By reference to those authorities, the appellant submitted that in this case it was the very same physical act relied upon for each transaction, i.e. the presentation of money in the appellant’s possession for transfer overseas, which was said to make out both offences. The appellant submitted that in that scenario the possession of money, in the course of the transfer process, notionally constituted the “dealing” and simultaneously constituted the “receiving” of a designated service. The appellant submitted that physical possession of money alone at some earlier point in time without more could not make out the offence under s 400.3(1)(b)(ii). The appellant submitted that even physical possession of the money as at the place of remittal immediately before engagement in the offending pursuant to s 140, without more, could not make out the charge. The appellant submitted that what moneys were possessed by him throughout this period and which of those moneys (or part thereof) were intended to be transferred overseas (in circumstances said to be a breach of s 140) could never be known beyond reasonable doubt, until the time at which such moneys were presented for transfer overseas using the false identification account.
	


Consideration


	
	The appellant’s submission is based on the misconception as to the evidence, the nature of the Crown case as particularised, and the statements of principle in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) and Milne v The Queen.
	
	
	The elements of the offence contrary to s 400.3(1)(b)(ii), applied to the evidence as particularised are:
	



	
	The appellant possesses money – physical element: conduct (the charge says ""deals with"" and the definition of ""deals"" includes possesses); fault element: intending that the money or property will become an instrument of crime (s 400.3(1)(b)(ii));
	
	
	At the time of the dealing (possession) the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more – physical element: circumstance; fault element: absolute liability (s 400.3(4));
	
	
	The money or property could become an instrument of crime in relation to a Commonwealth indictable offence – physical element: circumstance (s 400.2A (3)); fault element: absolute liability (s 400.2A(5)).
	



	
	Because s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) refers to ""intending"", an offence can be committed if a person deals with money or property intending that at some time in the future, the property will become an instrument of crime.
	
	
	Because the Crown alleged an offence contrary to s 403(1)(b)(ii) of the Code it was necessary to nominate an intended offence which it is alleged gave rise to the charge. Section 400.13 of the Code permitted the Crown to identify an indictable offence in the commission of which, or the facilitation of the commission of which, the money was to be an instrument of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown particularised the intended offence in these terms: that the appellant possessed money intending that it would be used in the commission of offences contrary to s 140 of the AML Act, namely the receipt of a designated service (the remitting of money) on a number of occasions using a false customer name or details and that the total amount involved more than $1 million.
	
	
	The appellant’s argument misunderstands the way in which this offence is particularised, as compared to such cases as Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth)  and Milne v The Queen.
	
	
	Contrary to the appellant’s submission, it is sufficient for temporal separation for the Crown to rely upon possession of the money (the first physical element) immediately before the engagement in the offending pursuant to s 140 of the AML Act. Chen does not say otherwise. It follows that the decision of this Court in Chen supports the conclusion that a structuring offence, not dissimilar to that under consideration in this case, can be used as the indictable (future) offence upon which a charge under Division 400 can be based. The question of whether a structuring offence can be a basis for a Division 400 charge and whether there is sufficient temporal separation will depend on the way in which the charge is particularised.
	
	
	In Chen Basten JA (with whom Garling J agreed, Simpson J in dissent) allowed the appeal against a conviction for dealing with money intended to become an instrument of crime contrary to s 400.5 of the Code. The offence there was particularised as being committed by the offender having remitted money overseas on 13 occasions in amounts less than $10,000, contrary to s 31 of the Financial Transactions Act. In other words, the remission of money constituted both the “deal with money” component of the offence, as well as the intention that it be used as an “instrument of crime” component of the offence.
	
	
	The majority considered that s 400.5 required contemplation of a future crime with the relevant money, such that the offence could not be carried out if there were only one physical element. It follows from that approach that the same act cannot establish both dealing with money and that it was an instrument of crime. It also follows from the reasoning of the majority in Chen (and also that of Simpson J on this point) that a structuring offence can be relied upon as an instrument offence, depending on the particularisation of the charge. It is clear from the reasoning of Basten JA and Garling J that the manner in which the offence was particularised was critical to their decision. As it was particularised in Chen, there was no temporal separation between dealing with money and the future crime in contemplation, nor was there any separation of the physical component constituting the dealing with money from the anticipated physical component constituting the future offence.
	
	
	In the present case the charge is particularised in a different way to that in Chen. As particularised in this case, the dealing with money is constituted by the possessing of money, which is temporally separated from the intended use of the money.
	
	
	Milne v The Queen which considered s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) is consistent with the decision in Chen insofar as there is a need for there to be a temporal separation between the dealing with the money (i.e. its possession) and the intended use of the money. The necessary intent (this being a crime of intention) was capable of inference beyond reasonable doubt from the actions ultimately carried out by the appellant, i.e. using a remitting agency to transfer the money, contrary to s 140 of the AML Act.
	
	
	As indicated, the second limb of the appellant’s challenge to the conviction was that there was no relevant “use” of the money in the commission of the further intended offences. In other words, there was no instrumental connection between the use of the money and the commission of the further intended offences.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that because an offence can be committed under s 140 of the AML Act without presentation of the actual money in terms of needing to commence to receive a designated service using a false customer name, it could not be said that the money was in any way “used” as an instrument of crime in the sense required under s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) in the commission of any second tier inchoate crime.
	
	
	On that issue, the appellant relied upon the discussion of “instrumental connection” by the Court in Milne v The Queen where they said:
	


“37   … They also require an instrumental connection between the intended use of property and the commission or facilitation of the commission of an offence. Conduct involving property which is no more than a necessary condition of the commission of a subsequent offence does not on that account amount to the use of the property in or to facilitate the commission of that offence. Nor is the instrumental connection demonstrated merely by an intention to take advantage of circumstances arising after and as a result of the requisite dealing. A fortiori, that is the case where that property has been put beyond the reach of the accused by sale to a third party.”


	
	The appellant submitted that if the s 140 offence was committed without “use” of the money then that scenario fails to make out the requisite elements of s 400.3(1)(b)(ii). On that scenario the money would effectively be uninvolved with the commission of the s 140 offence. The appellant submitted that in those circumstances, the Crown’s counter-argument would be, at its highest, that the money was characterised as having some type of practical “but for” effect which was still a characterisation falling short of being a “necessary condition” and falling well short of the characterisation of “instrumental connection” in the commission of the intended offence.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that evidence of prior possession of the money alone could never make out the requisite intention under s 400.3(1)(b)(ii). And when the transactions in breach of s 140 were said to have commenced, either the money was presented to the remitter, which meant that there was no ""temporal separation"" as required under s 400.3(1)(b)(ii); or, the money was not presented, in which event, it was not ""used' in the Milne sense in that it was not “instrumentally connected” with the commission of any s 140 offence.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that if that reasoning was accepted, the Crown case, as it was left to the jury, involved an offence which was unavailable at law and as such, the conviction should be set aside.
	


Consideration


	
	In Milne v The Queen the offender (Mr Milne) who was the sole director/shareholder of Barat Advisory Pty Ltd (Barat) arranged to dispose of shares owned by Barat in another company, Admerex Ltd, (the Admerex shares), by way of a share swap with another company. In doing so, he intended that Barat would not declare the capital gain derived from the transaction to the Australian Taxation Office (which would amount to an offence against the Code). In November 2006, Mr Milne caused an income tax return to be lodged for Barat that did not declare the capital gain derived from the transaction.
	
	
	As in the present case, Mr Milne was charged with an offence under s  400.3(1) of the Code. The prosecution particularised the case as follows: that Mr Milne ""used"" the Admerex shares by effecting the transaction intending that they be used as an ""instrument of crime"" in that the disposition of the shares would be used to conceal the capital gain arising from the transaction. The Court accepted that argument and the jury convicted Mr Milne.
	
	
	The High Court allowed the appeal on the basis that the Admerex shares were not intended to become an ""instrument of crime"". The High Court found that s 400.3(1) required that there be dealing with the property and intended future use of the property. The Court considered the terms ""use"" and ""facilitate"" in the definition provision should be given their ordinary meaning but, as discussed above, found at paragraph [37] that the definition of ""instrument of crime"" required a temporal separation between the requisite dealing and the intended use of the property and that property be more than merely a necessary condition of the commission of a subsequent offence.
	
	
	On the Crown case as particularised in Milne v The Queen,  the disposal of the Admerex shares could not have been ""used"" with the intention that they become an ""instrument of crime” because the shares were transferred to a third party such that no future use could be made of them by Mr Milne. While the swapping of the shares facilitated the later fraud in a remote sense, they were no more than a necessary component of the fraud (i.e. being required to obtain capital gains) rather than having an “instrumental connection” with the fraud (i.e. the intentional failure to declare the capital gains). The shares themselves had no role to play in the failure to declare the profits resulting from their sale.
	
	
	As can be seen, the facts in Milne v The Queen were quite different from the case as particularised here. In this case there is the necessary temporal separation. There is also the necessary instrumental connection referred to in Milne. The appellant conceded the possession of the money, going to the money remitters and remitting the money with the use of a false name. Further, the temporal separation required by the High Court in Milne v The Queen at [37], was also not challenged at trial.
	
	
	Indeed the trial judge in refusing the no case application concluded:
	


“Given the character of each transaction there is both the ‘temporal separation’ (which has not been seriously challenged) and the ‘instrumental connection’ which are required as a matter of law to constitute the offence.” (AB 285)


	
	Moreover, an analysis of the nature of s 140 of the AML Act shows that money (in the appellant's possession) was instrumental in the commission of the offence, (in other words “had an instrumental connection”) or facilitated the commission of the offence. You cannot receive a “designated service” without seeking to transfer money, or seek a “designated service” for the transfer of the money, without having money available to transfer. The designated service is not complete without the handing over of the money because the purpose of the designated service is to transfer money.
	
	
	It matters not that an offence under s 140 of the AML Act can be committed without the money being transferred. The money was in fact transferred in this case and the appellant’s intention was established, keeping in mind that the offence is one of intention and is complete when the requisite intention is established. Because the offence in s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) focuses on the appellant's intention, it is not necessary to consider (nor satisfy) the elements of the s 140 offence for the purpose of determining whether the money could be said to have been intended to become “an instrument of crime”.
	
	
	As a matter of practicality, the identified businesses were reporting services and registered money remitters. As such they were required to carry out a “customer identification procedure” at the commencement of the provision of the designated service, i.e. the remittance of money, in order for the appellant to commence to receive a relevant designated service in respect of each incident. A reporting entity was not to provide a designated service unless certain criteria were satisfied. The reporting entity needed to be satisfied on each occasion that a designated service was to be provided, that those criteria had been complied with.
	
	
	It follows that on the first occasion that the appellant remitted money, the money remitter could not commence to provide the designated service until the money remitter carried out the applicable customer identification procedure in regard to the appellant. However, on each subsequent occasion that the appellant remitted funds with the same money remitter, the money remitter still had to comply with that procedure. The money remitter could not remit the funds unless all the conditions were satisfied.
	
	
	The offence is about receiving a service. The use of the service is for a particular purpose. It is clear that the use of money or the transfer of money is instrumental for the commission of an offence or it facilitates the commission of an offence under s 140 of the AML Act. The money was integral to the commission of the crime. The purpose of receiving a designated service was to transfer the money in the appellant’s possession. On that basis “money” was an instrument of crime as envisaged by ss 400.1 and 400.2A of the Code.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the appellant intended to receive a “designated service” for the purposes of s 140 of the AML Act each time he conducted a transfer and money was instrumental to that process. He did so on each occasion intentionally using a false name. Not surprisingly, it is not suggested by the appellant that the elements of this offence were not capable of being satisfied.
	
	
	In any event, satisfaction of the elements of the s 140 offence was an unnecessary condition as s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) is directed to the appellant’s intention and establishing that intention is sufficient to deal with his argument. Over a period between 27 May 2012 and 17 July 2012, the appellant conducted 11 transactions which resulted in a total of AU$1,098,066 in cash being converted into Chinese currency and transferred to bank accounts held in China. In each of those transactions, he provided the money remitter with a false customer name. It follows that on each of the 11 occasions that the appellant attended the money remitter, he intended to remit funds overseas in a false name using that money remitter. In other words, he was intending to commit an offence and intending that the money in his possession would become an instrument of the offence so that each time the transaction gave rise to a separate offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act.
	
	
	On the basis of the above analysis, the ground of appeal relied on by the appellant has not been made out and the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	WALTON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL for the reasons given by his Honour.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

4276322,R v Carbone (No. 2) [2017] NSWSC 346,"Judgment


	
	The accused Diego Carbone (the applicant) is charged with murdering Bradley Dillon on 11 August 2014. The Crown case is that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the applicant and Antonio Bagnato at least to inflict grievous bodily harm on Bradley Dillon. Mr Bagnato is currently in Thailand and, according to press reports, has been convicted in Thailand of murder in that jurisdiction. He is not standing trial with the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown case statement discloses that Mr Dillon became aware of a dispute his sister Cassie Dillon was having with her ex-boyfriend Adrian Riccio over an amount of $2000 owed by Riccio to Cassie. Mr Dillon intervened in the dispute in an attempt to retrieve the money owed by Riccio. In the course of that intervention Mr Dillon commenced contact with persons he believed were associated with Riccio through a group known as the St Michael’s Fight Club. Riccio, Bagnato and others were involved in this fight club. Mr Dillon sought to have contact with Bagnato although the Crown case statement does not make clear what the purpose of that contact was.
	
	
	On 11 August 2014 Mr Dillon travelled with a friend, Adam Powell, to Tebbutt Street, Leichardt to collect a vehicle Mr Dillon was interested in purchasing and which was awaiting minor repairs. Mr Dillon purchased a new battery for the vehicle and Mr Powell last saw him drive away in the car onto Parramatta Road. CCTV at the TAB in Flood Street, Leichardt at about 5:25pm on that day captured the victim near the front door of the TAB. He left and headed north onto Flood Street. To the north of the TAB is a set of stairs on Flood Street which leads down into an underground car park below street level. The car park is under a set of shops near the Leichardt Market Town Shopping Centre.
	
	
	Witnesses on Flood Street late in that afternoon reported hearing raised voices and then a number of loud bangs emanating from the car park. Witnesses then saw Mr Dillon walk up the vehicle ramp onto Lords Street and collapse a short distance away. At the same time two men, said to be the applicant and Bagnato, were seen to move briskly up the same ramp, cross Lords Street and run along George Street.
	
	
	Both the applicant and Kale Turner belonged to the St Michael’s Fight Club. Mr Turner normally saw the applicant in the company of a mutual friend called Tom Sayer with whom Mr Turner shared a flat. Mr Turner knew the applicant as “Beaver”.
	
	
	On either the night of the murder (but after it had taken place) or a night or two after the murder, the applicant contacted either Mr Turner or Mr Sayer and went to see them at the flat where they lived. What occurred is set out in a statement of Mr Turner made to the NSW Crime Commission on 25 May 2015. It relevantly reads:
	


37.   I don't remember the exact date but it was either the same night as the murder of Dillon or the night or two after, …

39.   Either Tom or I received another call from Beaver. I can't remember if Beaver spoke to me or Tom but he said, ""It’s Beaver. It's important I'll be at your in 10 mins (sic). Can I come past?"" I agreed. Beaver sounded normal.

…

40.   Not long after within minutes, the door buzzer started ringing. Our unit was on level nine. It was Beaver on the intercom from the front security door.

He said, ""Do youse have money? Come down you have to pay for the cab."" Tom went down. Next thing, I heard both Beaver and Tom getting out of the lift on our level and they walked into the unit.

41.   As soon as Beaver walked in he said, ""Some hectic shit went down. We fucked this guy up. We were in a fight with a guy from school. I was into it with this guy. [Tones] comes in and shot him."" Beaver always referred to Tony [Tony Bangnato] as 'Tones,'

I was shocked and said, ""Where did this happen?""

Beaver said, ""Leichhardt.""

I said, ""Where is Tony?""

He said, ""Tony has left the country.""

I said, ""What the hell are you still doing here?""

He said, ""I'm planning to go overseas as well. Come I'll show ya on the news.""

He picked [up] our Foxtel remote and was trying to show us the news item but he couldn't.

42.   Bever (sic) said, “Tones said I might be able to get money off you guys. He’s gone overseas.” Bever (sic) was sounding erratic. We did not ask him why he wanted cash and we assumed that he needed the cash to get away.


	
	The Crown will also lead evidence that either or both of Mr Turner and Mr Sayer gave the applicant about $1,500 or $1,800 that they had in the house.
	
	
	On 4 March 2016 the applicant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. Justice Johnson fixed the matter for trial commencing on 7 November 2016 with an estimate of four to five weeks.
	
	
	The matter was called up for pre-trial directions before me on 18 October, 25 October and 4 November 2016.
	
	
	At the directions hearing on 18 October 2016 I was informed, in answer to a question I asked, that there were no known pre-trial issues that would have to be dealt with before the jury was empanelled.
	
	
	On 25 October 2016 Mr Terracini SC for the applicant said that there was a potential problem with a witness called Kale Turner who might be unavailable. This was said to have arisen in the previous few days. The solicitor for the DPP informed me that it was believed Mr Turner was in the United Kingdom and attempts had been made to contact him and his family in Australia. She said it was quite likely he would be unavailable. On enquiring whether a notice under s 67 would be served she said that she needed to reserve her position at that point. She would advise Mr Terracini when Mr Herps, the Crown prosecutor, returned from leave.
	
	
	The solicitor for the DPP said that the importance of Mr Turner’s statement was that the applicant was alleged to have attended his premises and made some admissions to some level of involvement or knowledge of the events that occurred. The statement also was to be relied on as evidence of consciousness of guilt because of references to the applicant’s intended flight from the jurisdiction.
	
	
	On 1 November 2016 the DPP served a s 67 notice and annexed the whole of Mr Turner’s statement made to the Crime Commission. The email received by my Associate on that day, copied to the applicant’s solicitor, said that an application would be made under s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for the evidence to be admitted but if that application was not successful the Crown would seek an adjournment.
	
	
	I heard the application to rely on Mr Turner’s evidence on 7 November 2016. The empanelment of the jury was postponed until this issue had been dealt with. By agreement, Mr Turner’s statement was considerably redacted and I then heard further argument on certain remaining portions which were objected to by Mr Terracini.
	
	
	Paragraph 42 of the statement originally read:
	


Bever said, ""Tones said I might be able to get money off you guys. He's gone overseas."" Bever was sounding erratic. We did not ask him why he wanted the cash and we assumed that he needed the cash to get away.

We said, ""Yes.""

Tom went to his room and got about fifteen or eighteen hundred dollars and gave it to beaver.

Beaver said, ""Do you guys have any coke or anything? Do you want to come party? Do you want to come to Misty's for a massage?""

We said, ""No.""

He said, ""Why are you not partying?""

I didn't want him to be our place and we asked him to leave since he was acting like a whirlwind. When beaver first told us about the shooting my immediate thought was that he was exaggerating but when he said Tony has gone overseas, I started believing what he was saying.


	
	During the course of argument about that paragraph the following exchanges occurred:
	


TERRACINI: The problem is, your Honour, that the Crown are not calling Tom, so I can't

HIS HONOUR: Is that right?

TERRACINI: That is so and so I can't test any of that.

HIS HONOUR: I see. Mr Crown, if Tom is not going to be here either, and given what is said in those three lines, which, on one view, doesn't involve Mr Turner, why should you be entitled to have those?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Firstly, your Honour, in the matter of Tom, yes, he was approached and, no he didn't make a statement, but, in respect of the money itself, one of the witnesses who will be called, a gentleman by the name of Joshua Shead will give evidence about seeing the applicant at the domestic terminal having a look in his wallet and, as I understand it, there is a sum of around about that or slightly more in it, so it would simply be a connecting point, your Honour.

…

HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, I think you said in passing before that the person referred to in this statement as Tom is not giving evidence either.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: That seems to me to be a significant matter too.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The circumstances of that are, as I understand it, he was approached and refused to cooperate, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well, that doesn't mean he can't be brought to court.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No.

HIS HONOUR: It is just that if he were here, because he was said to be present when all of this went on, Mr Terracini would have a weaker argument about unfair prejudice.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. I am prepared on that basis to ask the officer in charge to issue a subpoena.


	
	On 8 November 2016 I refused the application under s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to admit the statement of Kale Turner dated 25 May 2015 even in its redacted form: R v Carbone [2016] NSWSC 1591.
	
	
	Thereafter the Crown applied to adjourn the trial so that steps could be taken to have Mr Sayer give evidence and to see what arrangements could be made for Mr Turner to give evidence whether in person or via Audio Visual Link from wherever he was currently residing.
	
	
	The applicant subsequently indicated that a claim would be made for costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment. An application has been made for costs to the DPP. Although it has not been formally agreed by the Director or Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, the Crown Prosecutor’s approach has been to accept that the costs should be confined to the three days actually spent in Court dealing with the applications already referred to. The applicant claims discounted cancellation fees for both solicitor and senior counsel which were payable when the trial was vacated. It is in those circumstances that the applicant now seeks a stay of the proceedings until all of the costs claimed have been paid.
	
	
	On 2 December 2016 Johnson J refixed the matter for trial commencing 14 August 2017 with an estimate of four to five weeks.
	
	
	The evidence relating to attempts to contact Mr Turner are set out in the affidavit of Detective Sergeant Stephen Hunt sworn 17 March 2017. Detective Hunt was the officer in charge of Strike Force Ester which was investigating Mr Dillon’s murder.
	
	
	Detective Hunt said that on 8 September 2016 subpoenas and Police Notices were sent to him by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There were 125 subpoenas. On 19 October 2016 Detective Hunt was notified by another officer that Kale Turner was one of the persons who had not been served with his subpoena. On 21 October Detective Hunt received a draft witness list from the ODPP which included Kale Turner.
	
	
	Thereafter, Detective Senior Constable Allen was tasked to make enquires to locate Mr Turner. In that regard Detective Allen sought the assistance of Queensland police because Mr Turner’s parents lived in Queensland. A Queensland police officer visited Mr Turner’s parents. They said that Kale was overseas but they would not disclose his location. They said that they and Kale were of the belief that because he gave evidence to the Crime Commission he was told he did have to not give any further evidence. They also said that Kale had been contacted by persons involved in the court matter and, although no direct threats had been made, those persons made it clear that they knew where he and his family lived. It was at that point that Mr Turner left the country.
	
	
	The enquiries further disclosed that Mr Turner left Australia on 11 June 2015 and has not returned.
	
	
	Detective Allen sent an email to Mr Turner on 19 October 2016. The email said that he would be required to give evidence at the present trial but arrangements could be made for him to do that via video link from the UK. As I noted in my earlier judgment, Mr Turner replied on 28 October 2016 saying this:
	


Unfortunately I won’t be able to assist on this. I’ve been trying for quite some time now to break all ties with everyone from that gym and my involvement now would only cause my family and I significant stress and concern. Because of this I will not be of any value to the case. I really hope you can please understand.


	
	Subsequent to the visit to Mr Turner’s parents, Detective Hunt sent an email to Mr Turner on 30 October 2016 with regard to the allegation that there had been some sort of threat made to him. Detective Hunt asked Mr Turner to reply so that the Crown prosecutor and the Court could be advised. There has been no reply to that email.
	
	
	Detective Hunt sent a further email on 22 January 2017 asking Mr Turner to contact him and disclose his intentions in relation to the matter. He has had no reply to that email.
	
	
	Detective Hunt said that Mr Turner was only a witness in the present matter and could not be restrained from travelling to wherever he chose. There are no alerts or warnings that can lawfully be placed on his movements. Detective Hunt said that there could be a fair expectation, given Mr Turner left Australia on 11 June 2015, that he would return prior to the hearing of 5 November 2016 because most people do not travel and work overseas for lengthy periods of time.
	
	
	An affidavit from a solicitor at the ODPP, who has the care, control and management of this matter, said that after being notified by Detective Hunt about Mr Turner’s being overseas, defence counsel was notified of the matter.
	


Submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that it was the conduct of the Crown that caused the trial to be vacated. This was because the Crown knew well in advance of the trial date that they were having difficulties securing Mr Turner’s attendance and that they had no way of enforcing a subpoena outside the jurisdiction. The applicant submitted that it was the timing of the applications for reliance on the statement and the subsequent adjournment that caused the cost to the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was no happening or occurrence in the proceedings that placed the Crown ""at fault"" in the sense discussed in the various cases such as R v Fisher [2003] NSWCCA 41 and R v Michael John Issakidis [2015] NSWCCA 834.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that neither the Court nor the Defence was misled about the state of readiness of the trial. The Crown says that the Defence was on notice of the situation with Mr Turner on 24 October 2016 and that the email on 1 November 2016 from the DPP to my Associate, copied to the Defence made clear that if the application under s 65 of the Evidence Act was not successful the Crown would be seeking an adjournment.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the failure to serve a subpoena on Mr Turner does not amount to fault on the part of the Crown. The Crown submitted that it did not “misuse the court’s processes” or act with “gross unfairness” given that it had disclosed the position in relation to Mr Turner and foreshadowed an adjournment.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that if it should have to pay some of the costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment those costs should be confined to three days of the actual hearing but not any preparation. The Crown submitted that the costs should be in accordance with the Attorney General's rates for legal representation.
	


Legal principles


	
	As was made clear by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735, the general rule is that costs are not awarded in criminal proceedings. However, the Court made clear in that case that the judge at first instance could have told the Crown that he would not grant an adjournment unless the Crown agreed to compensate the respondent for the costs wasted. The power in that case was said to derive from s 6 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW) and, in this court, by s 21 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).
	
	
	The Court went on to say this (at 741):
	


However, there is no reason why this Court cannot, in the exercise of its own discretion, modify the order made by Herron DCJ in such a way as to give practical effect to a view that, in the special and unusual circumstances of this case, and in the light of the events that have occurred, the trial of the respondent should not proceed until the Crown compensates him for the costs thrown away by the original adjournment.


	
	In R v Fisher Simpson J (with whom Santow JA and Smart AJ agreed) clarified, if clarification was necessary, that it was open to a court to grant a stay of the proceedings until such time as the Crown pays reasonable costs.
	
	
	In Fisher what was described as the “fault” was the non-production by ASIC of a file maintained by a co-applicant which was then in the possession of ASIC. Justice Simpson took the view that it did not matter whether the fault was that of ASIC or the DPP. She said at [19]:
	


… The fact is that such fault as there was was on the part of the prosecuting authorities. The CDPP, as the party to the proceedings, has to live with that fact.


	
	As far as the appropriate test for whether a stay should be granted on the condition that costs are paid, Santow JA said in Fisher:
	


[4]   Thus a third trial is not, per se, unfair, though it involves two previous re-trials, each aborted. What is unfair is for the defendant to be forced by the Crown to proceed to that third trial, when the community’s sense of fair play is already stretched, without first paying the defendant’s wasted costs of the aborted second trial, when it was aborted entirely as a result of the Crown’s own fault. Contrary to what was concluded by the trial judge, this is not to conclude that a third trial, with the defendant now represented through legal aid, is intrinsically unfair; compare Attorney-General for New South Wales v Milat (1995) 37 NSWLR 370. Rather it is unfair to force it on in these exceptional circumstances, until such time as the defendant’s wasted costs of the second trial are paid by the Crown.

…

[7]   But the Crown is under no duty to conduct the prosecutions in a grossly unfair fashion. The power of granting a stay against the Crown until wasted costs are paid is to be used only for the rare and extreme case of gross unfairness on the part of the Crown. That is to say, unfairness which, exceptionally, can override the public interest in pursuing a criminal prosecution, though to be weighed against what is the urgency of bringing the case to trial. It is nonetheless certainly not against the public interest that the Crown, as a model litigant, pursue its criminal prosecutions with proper fairness. But to abort a second re-trial in the circumstances of the present prosecution by reason of the Crown’s own failure to produce a document, even accepting inadvertence, and then ignore the consequence for the defendant in further wasted costs in so proceeding to a third trial, is unjust and unfair, meriting the description of exceptional circumstances.


	
	In Lee v Attorney-General for NSW [2017] NSWCCA 27 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Latham and Price JJ agreed) said:
	


[120]   There is no longer an issue that the Court has power in an appropriate case to order a stay of criminal proceedings until the prosecutor pays the legal costs of the accused. In R v Curtis [2014] NSWSC 1582 at [24] - [27] Davies J summarised the applicable principles:

[24]   Subject to limited statutory exceptions, the general rule is that, in criminal proceedings, orders for costs are not made: Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59; 170 CLR 534 at 557; R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735 at 738. Section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) may be taken to reflect the general rule: R v Mosely at 739.

[25]   Nevertheless, there are procedural ways around the problem. An adjournment might be granted if a party agrees to pay the costs or undertakes to do so with the result that any remedy would be in contract: R v Mosely at 738. A similar way of achieving the same result is for the criminal proceedings to be stayed until a costs order is paid. It would be appropriate to do this where there is fundamental unfairness in permitting the Crown to proceed to trial where the costs have been incurred by the Crown's fault of a relatively serious kind: Regina v Fisher [2003] NSWCCA 41; 56 NSWLR 625 at 2 and [46]-[47].

[26]   It is necessary, however, to point to some fault on the part of the prosecution. Unfairness cannot be established without proof of fault: Petroulias v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 154; 176 A Crim R 302 at [25]; R v Selim [2007] NSWSC 154. The power to stay proceedings in circumstances such as for the payment of costs is only to be exercised in the most exceptional of circumstances: Petroulias at [17].

[27]   It seems to me, therefore, that if some delinquency, unconscionability or unfairness on the Crown's part can be demonstrated the Court in the control over its own processes would have the power to stay the trial until such time as the costs are paid.""

[121]   In Regina v Fisher [2003] NSWCCA 41; 56 NSWLR 625 at [7] Santow JA (with whom Smart AJ agreed) said:

[7]   ...The power of granting a stay against the Crown until wasted costs are paid is to be used only for the rare and extreme case of gross unfairness on the part of the Crown. That is to say, unfairness which, exceptionally, can override the public interest in pursuing a criminal prosecution, though to be weighed against what is the urgency of bringing the case to trial.""

…

[150]   On my reading of the authorities, more than simple fault on the part of the prosecution is required before a court should make an order of the kind under consideration. On the other hand, the authorities do not unequivocally say that the fault has to be flagrant or egregious. It would be sufficient in my opinion if the fault were of a serious kind.


	
	In Issakidis Beech-Jones J when speaking of orders that may be made in criminal proceedings to prevent injustice, said:
	


[71]   A specific example of such an order is demonstrated by a line of authority in this State which is to the effect that a Court exercising criminal jurisdiction with no relevant power to award costs against the prosecution can nevertheless order a temporary stay of proceedings “effective until the Crown has paid the reasonable costs an accused has thrown away in previous proceedings, in circumstances where it has been demonstrated that an injustice or unfairness would result from the Court’s processes being used to put an accused on trial a second or third time without some redress” (R v Selim [2007] NSWSC 154 at [51] per Fullerton J; “Selim”). In Petroulias v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 154 at [23] Ipp JA held that “practically speaking, unfairness [of this kind] cannot be established without proof or fault on the part of the prosecution”. Proof of fault on the part of the prosecution is not necessary to obtain a stay in accordance with Dietrich.

…

[81]   While the existence of fault is a necessary condition to the granting of a temporary stay in these circumstances it is not necessarily sufficient. The test is ultimately one of unfairness. …

Consideration

Was there unfairness to the applicant?


	
	In my opinion, two matters considered together demonstrate fault on the part of the Crown which has led to unfairness in the circumstances of this matter. The first is the late attention given by the prosecuting authorities to ensuring that Mr Turner was available to give evidence at the trial. The second was the failure to have taken timely steps to ensure that Mr Sayer was available to give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	The first of these matters was considered in a different context by me in R v Carbone [2016] NSWSC 1591. The issue there was whether in accordance with s 65 of the Evidence Act and cl 4 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act “all reasonable steps [had] been taken by the party seeking to prove the person [was] not available to find the person or secure his or her attendance”. I there made reference to a similar situation in R v Kazzi; R v Williams; R v Murchie [2003] NSWCCA 241; (2003) 140 A Crim R 545. The Court of Criminal Appeal there took the view in the circumstances of that witness’s whereabouts that the delay on the part of the police in making inquiries did not constitute a failure to take reasonable steps within the meaning of cl 4(1).
	
	
	However, the enquiry here is a different one. The enquiry here is whether there was fault on the part of the prosecuting authorities that has created unfairness for the applicant. In that regard, it is worth noting what Ipp JA (Grove and Dowd JJ agreeing) said in Kazzi:
	


[10]   On behalf of the respondents, it was forcefully submitted that the police had been neglectful in only commencing their inquiries on 26 July 2003. The trial commenced on 5 August 2003 and, as I have pointed out, Mr Gujral had left Australia nearly two years before that date.

[11]   I accept the submission that the police should have commenced making their inquiries at a far earlier date, particularly having regard to the fact that the case was listed for trial last year. …


	
	It is not without significance that the statement Mr Turner gave to the Crime Commission was an induced statement because, as Detective Hunt said, Mr Turner identified criminality that he, himself, was involved in through the statement. The prosecuting authorities ought to have been alert to the reasonable possibility that Mr Turner would be a reluctant witness.
	
	
	Like Ipp JA in Kazzi, I consider that the police in the present case should have started making their enquiries at an earlier time. Had they done so Mr Turner’s unavailability would have become clear at an earlier time. If the applications under s 65 and for an adjournment had been dealt with at a reasonable time in advance of the trial there would have been little to justify the applicant’s lawyers charging cancellation fees. Dealing with those applications on the first three days set aside for the trial made it inevitable that those fees would be charged in the event the trial was adjourned. In that way costs were thrown away by the adjournment.
	
	
	However, even if that criticism for failing to make enquiries earlier is not justified, no satisfactory explanation has been provided for not having taken steps to have Mr Sayer appear at the trial at least from the time it was known there were difficulties in securing Mr Turner’s attendance. From the point of view of establishing the matters contained in paragraphs 37 – 42 of Mr Turner’s statement, Mr Sayer was in the same position to give evidence of those matters. Indeed, paragraphs 40 and 42 disclose that it was Mr Sayer who was alone in the applicant’s company twice on that night including when he went to his room to get the money which was given to the applicant.
	
	
	The explanation for not having secured Mr Sayer’s attendance was wholly inadequate. The fact that a witness is unco-operative provides no basis for the Crown not to require him to attend by subpoena, not the least reason for which is the Crown’s obligation to ensure that relevant witnesses are called to give evidence (see for example rules 87 and 89 of the Legal Profession Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015).
	
	
	In my earlier judgment when I came to consider the question of unfair prejudice to the applicant under s 137 of the Evidence Act when the Crown sought to lead Mr Turner’s evidence by reading his statement , I said this:
	


[32]   In any event two matters in particular satisfy me that unfair prejudice would be caused to the Accused by the admission of the statement. First, Mr Turner's credit would be a significant issue, given his background and involvement with drug dealers, his behaviour after the post offence contact with the Accused, his criminal record and his knowledge asserted by the defence of the deceased's involvement with drugs.

[33]   Secondly, and significantly, the Crown has said it is not calling Tom Sayer who was Mr Turner's flatmate and who, according to Mr Turner's statement, was present at the time of the crucial event and conversation recorded in paragraphs 41 and 42. The absence of Tom Sayer adds further unfairness to the Accused's position if this statement is admitted.


	
	Even if Mr Sayer had refused to co-operate in the sense that he would not disclose what evidence he would give about the night recorded in paragraphs 37 to 42 of Mr Turner’s statement the Crown may well have been in a position to seek leave to cross-examine Mr Sayer pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	There is a very real possibility that if Mr Sayer had been scheduled to give evidence at the trial, the trial would have gone ahead even without Mr Turner or by the tender of Mr Turner’s statement under s 65. With no explanation for Mr Sayer’s absence apart from his being unco-operative, I consider that the failure of the Crown to have him scheduled to give evidence amounts to fault on the Crown’s part.
	
	
	When this failure is seen together with the other identified failure to make enquiries at an earlier time for Mr Turner I consider that the fault on the part of the prosecuting authorities is a serious one. Considered together, they caused the trial to be adjourned at the last minute with resultant cost and expense to the applicant. In the circumstances where the trial was being privately funded by the applicant I consider that this fault has produced unfairness to him if he is obliged to fund a further trial without some recompense for the costs of the aborted trial: Fisher at [41] and [42].
	
	
	I do not think that giving notice of a potential adjournment application a little under a week before the trial was due to begin makes any difference in the circumstances. Until the s 65 application was determined no decision about seeking an adjournment could have been made. The applicant could not have assumed (1) that the s 65 application would fail and (2) that an adjournment would be granted.
	


What costs are payable?


	
	In Issakidis Beech-Jones J reviewed the authorities on the question of what costs should be payable. His Honour said:
	


[88]   Second, the Crown submits that the relevant order should only allow Mr Issakidis a proportion of his costs thrown away because, apparently, “[n]o-one obtains 100 cents in the dollar on costs”. The Crown referred to a passage from Selim at [59] in which Fullerton J observed that the “granting of a temporary stay until costs of the previous proceedings, or some part of them, are paid is not designed to punish the Crown for inadequacies [the] pre-trial or trial process”. This reference to “some part” in Selim does not assist the Crown’s contention. The appropriate measure of costs to include in an order on an application such as this was not explained in Selim which is understandable given that in Selim the application was refused. In Mosely the relevant order was framed by reference to the costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment with such costs to be agreed or failing agreement assessed by the District Court (Mosely at p 741). In Fisher the temporary stay operated until the prosecution paid the “reasonable costs” incurred by or on behalf of the applicant but for the entire trial. In Bucksath at [28] Stein JA considered that the conduct of the Crown in seeking an adjournment of a trial did not warrant indemnity costs. Instead Stein JA suggested an order that referred to “reasonable” costs. His Honour implicitly recognised that indemnity costs could be awarded.

[89]   I do not consider that the conduct of the Crown warrants an order framed by reference to an amount of costs assessed on an indemnity basis. Instead, consistent with Mosely, Fisher and Bucksath, the amount of the costs to be included in the order should be conditioned by the need for them to be “reasonable”. It was not suggested that the Court could not make that assessment.


	
	The evidence on behalf of the applicant as to the amount claimed was a little unclear. The applicant’s father, in his affidavit, said that he was made aware prior to the trial that there would be a two week cancellation fee for each of the solicitor and Mr Terracini SC. Those fees were, respectively, $30,000 and $80,000. He said further that he was told he was liable for the three days spent in Court arguing the Crown’s applications together with two days fees for preparation of this stay application and for matters connected with the bail application and the conditions of bail. The fees for solicitor and counsel in that regard are respectively $15,000 and $40,000. Finally, the applicant’s father said that he is liable for one week’s preparation for the trial to be heard in August, noting that both solicitors and senior counsel had agreed to discount their fees for the new trial by one week’s costs.   
	
	
	On the other hand, Mr Terracini tendered an email chain which was to the effect that he and the solicitors had discounted their fees by 10% with the result that what was claimed was $144,000 for counsel’s fees and $81,000 for the solicitors’ fees. That discount in relation to counsel took into account other matters for which he had been retained during the original trial period. The undiscounted amounts were $160,000 and $90,000 respectively. As best I can determine, that appears to be the total of (a) a two week cancellation fee, (b) the cost of the week of 7 November, and (c) the further week’s preparation for the new trial.
	
	
	The Crown submission that the costs should be confined to the three days that were spent in Court in November should not be accepted. The submission was said to be based upon what was ordered in Mosely, R v Jonathan Seebag (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 February 1993, unrep) and Petroulias v R [2007] NSWCCA 154.
	
	
	A reading of those cases does not support that submission. Mosely merely said that “costs thrown away as a result of the adjournment” should be paid. What they were was not identified. In Petroulias the application was refused. In Seebag only one day’s costs was sought and ordered. In Fisher, although it was clear that a considerable amount of costs had been incurred and wasted by the adjournment, the Court did not specify any amount beyond saying that the applicant should have “the reasonable costs incurred” in the adjourned trial.
	
	
	In R v Bucksath [2000] NSWCCA 135 the position was somewhat confusing. It was not said how long the trial was fixed for but it was due to start on 19 July. The accused first wanted costs for 19, 20 and 21 July (at [9]). Later he wanted them for 19 and 20 July (at [14]). The primary judge stayed the proceedings “conditional only on the Crown paying the costs thrown away by the trial not proceeding on Monday [19 July]” but that was said to include the costs of 21 July (at [17]). Ultimately the Court of Criminal Appeal said the Crown should pay the costs of 19 and 21 July with the Court saying that “two days costs seems, in all of the circumstances, to be reasonable” but the costs should not be indemnity costs (at [28]).
	
	
	What precise order was made in each of those cases does not really assist the ascertainment in the present case of what costs should be paid. The general principle from Mosley, Seebag and Fisher is that the costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment should be paid. The enquiry should be to ascertain the costs thrown away, that is, the costs unnecessarily incurred by reason of the adjournment. In most of the cases mentioned the costs were for days of the trial that had been held and would have to be heard again. That is not the case here. The trial did not start.
	
	
	However, in the present case, I have evidence that the applicant was liable for a two week cancellation fee for both his solicitor and counsel. If such cancellation fees were not unreasonable they would ordinarily represent the costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment of the trial. The adjournment triggered the obligation to pay those costs. By analogy, they represent two weeks of the trial which would have to be repeated in the new trial. The issue is whether they were reasonable both in their nature and their amount.
	
	
	The trial was fixed for four to five weeks. It is a reasonably common and accepted practice for counsel privately briefed in the criminal area (and in some parts of the civil area for that matter) to stipulate for a cancellation fee for part of the time set aside to conduct a lengthy trial. I do not consider that a two week cancellation fee is unreasonable in the circumstances. Counsel has also identified three occasions during the period when he obtained other work. Those other briefs were allowed for in the discount of 10% put forward.
	
	
	The fault on the part of the prosecuting authorities I have identified was serious but not egregious. Like Stein JA in Bucksath I do not consider that the fault warrants indemnity costs. Bearing that in mind and noting the other work obtained by counsel I consider that the appropriate figure for the cancellation fee for counsel should be $60,000.
	
	
	I do not accept the Crown’s submission that counsel’s fees should be confined to the Attorney-General’s rates for legal representation. The applicant has engaged a very experienced Senior Counsel whose fees are within the range of appropriate fees given his seniority. It would be unfair to the applicant for him only to recover at a rate for counsel he has chosen not to engage.
	
	
	The solicitor also claims a cancellation fee. That appears to be on the basis of a costs agreement which provides for a lump sum payment of $90,000 for the trial and preparation exclusive of counsel’s fees. The agreement does not in terms stipulate that a cancellation fee was payable or, indeed, what should happen from the point of view of fees payable if the trial did not proceed.
	
	
	In his affidavit the applicant’s father said that he had signed a document making him liable for a two week cancellation fee of $30,000 for his solicitor. Subsequent to reserving my judgment, I sought a copy of that document. I was provided with a document dated 21 February 2017 which said:
	


I John Carbone agrees (sic) that this agreement forms part of our Cost Agreement and that you (sic) agree to pay Tsambas & Co Solicitors a two week cancellation fee of $30,000 dollars (inclusive of GST).

It is clear that this is concerned with the forthcoming trial and not with the trial fixed for November 2016 with which this judgment is concerned.


	
	I do not consider that it is reasonable or usual for a solicitor to charge a cancellation fee. There is a good deal of criticism of barristers charging cancellation fees but the practice seems to be reluctantly accepted in certain areas (as I have said) including for criminal trials. A solicitor’s practice operates in an entirely different way from a barrister’s practice. It is not expected that if a trial does not eventuate a solicitor will be left stranded with no work for a period of time even if he or she had expected to be present in court for all or most of the trial.
	
	
	It is a matter of contract between the applicant’s father and the solicitor if the latter demands, and the former agrees to pay, a cancellation fee. I do not, however, consider that it is reasonable that a third party liable for costs should be obliged to pay the costs represented by such a cancellation fee.
	
	
	Nor do I consider that the costs of the three days incurred in relation to the s 65 application and the subsequent application to adjourn are costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment. Had the Crown acted in a prompt fashion to endeavour to secure Mr Turner’s attendance it would have been faced with the same situation, namely, that he was overseas and was unwilling to assist. If the Crown had acted earlier the s 65 application would still have needed to be determined and the adjournment application would probably have had to be determined but the result would have been that the applicant’s lawyers would not have been able to invoke, justifiably, the cancellation fees for the trial at that early stage. If the cancellation fees had nevertheless been charged, it is likely that it would not have been reasonable for those fees to have been met by the Crown.
	
	
	Further, I do not consider that it is appropriate that the Crown should have to pay costs incurred in the applicant making a bail application notwithstanding that the granting of bail was occasioned by the adjournment. Since bail was granted because of the extra delays occasioned by the adjournment, it seems likely that bail would have been applied for if the Crown had moved in a timely fashion to vacate the hearing.
	
	
	I note that the applicant’s father says in his affidavit that he is liable for one weeks’ preparation for the new trial but that both the solicitor and counsel had agreed to discount their fees in the order of one week of costs for the retrial. In those circumstances, I do not consider that it would be reasonable to order the Crown to pay the costs of that one week’s preparation.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my opinion it would be reasonable for the Crown to pay the applicant costs in the sum of $60,000 being a discounted cancellation fee payable to counsel.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	


(1)   There be a stay of proceedings against the applicant until the applicant’s costs of $60,000 are paid by the Crown.

(2)   Nothing in order (1) prevents:


	
	the fixing or alteration of the trial date;
	
	
	compliance by the parties with the statutory requirements of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW);
	
	
	the making of any directions by the judge dealing with the Arraignments List.

4276325,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sako [2017] NSWSC 366,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff seeks a restraining order under section 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) pending the making of orders under sections 22 and 28A of that act.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) of the Act says the Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person's interest in the property sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime related activity, stating the ground on which the suspicion therein is based, and that there is a reasonable ground for the suspicion. The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 5 April 2017.
	
	
	Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the defendant is engaged in serious crime related activity or activities, being the commission of the offences of supplying a prohibited drug not less than the commercial quantity and supplying a drug not less than a large commercial quantity, both contrary to section 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 (NSW), and the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to section 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) being an offence involving money laundering. These offences all fall within the definition of “serious criminal offence” under section 2B of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.
	
	
	Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading the fact sheet prepared by the police after the arrest of the defendant, to e-mail communication between her and the police officer whom she believed prepared the fact sheet, and her search of the COPS data base showing that the defendant was charged with the offences concerned.
	
	
	In relation to the e-mail correspondence, Ms Bourne sought from the police officer a confirmation that he had prepared the fact sheet, that the facts sheet was true to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief and that it was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation. The officer provided confirmation of those matters and provided additional information suggesting that the offence of supplying a commercial quantity might be an alternative to the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity.
	
	
	I have read the fact sheets and I am satisfied that Ms Bourne's suspicion that those offences have been committed is reasonably held. The fact sheet discloses that the defendant resides in Victoria and the information in the affidavit identifies the defendant's ownership of land in Victoria. However, section 10A(3) of the Act does not apply because the interests in the property are derived from serious crime related activity within New South Wales and not from external serious crime related activity.
	
	
	The plaintiff seeks that the order be made without prior notice to the defendant. It does so based on what Ms Bourne says in paragraph 9 of her affidavit concerning the ability to dispose of motor vehicles or backdate transfer forms and to enter into unregistered mortgages of real property very quickly in an attempt to defeat the operation of the Act. I am satisfied that orders should be made without prior notice to the defendant. The defendant has rights under section 10C of the Act to seek a review of these orders.
	
	
	The plaintiff also seeks an order that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian take control of the interests in the property specified in schedule 1 of the summons which consists of cash and a motor vehicle. I have read the reasons given for the seeking of that order in Ms Bourne's affidavit and I am satisfied that such an order should be made.

THE FACTS


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered by the Prosecutor (“the Agreed Facts”) in the following terms:
	


Introduction

1.1. Infinity Cable Co. Pty Ltd ACN 135 069 402 (“the Company”) was registered with ASIC (date of registration 23 January 2009). The Company went into voluntary liquidation on 26 September 2013.

1.2. The Company was in the business of importing electrical cable, not manufacturing electrical cable. In particular, the Company imported and supplied thermoplastic insulated and thermoplastic sheathed flat cable commonly known as “TPS” and round orange thermoplastic and thermoplastic sheathed cables commonly known as “orange round” (“the Orange Round cable”).

1.3. These products are not ‘declared’ electrical articles. The Act does not prescribe testing as a mandatory legislative requirement prior to them being offered for sale or supply in Australia. However the products must be known to meet the applicable standards prior to their being offered for sale or supply in Australia.

1.4. During the time of the Company’s registration the defendant was the sole director and sole secretary of the Company and had been since its registration.

1.5. The defendant was also the managing director of the Company and was responsible for the day-to-day running of the business including ensuring its cables met compliance and safety standards.

Electrical cabling

2.1. On or about 7 February 2012, the defendant, on behalf of the Company, signed a supplier form with Masters Home Improvement Pty Ltd (“Masters”) to sell electrical cable to Masters. At all relevant times, Masters was a national retail hardware chain.

2.2. During the period 1 May 2012 to 30 June 2013 the Company sold TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable (“the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable”) to Masters who made it available for sale to the general public in 4 Masters stores in NSW, 7 Masters stores in Queensland, 1 Masters store in South Australia, 9 Masters stores in Victoria and 1 Masters store in Western Australia.

2.3. In particular to the offence, on or about 25 January 2013 the Company sold the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable to a Masters store in Gregory Hills (630 Camden Valley Way, Gregory Hills, NSW). The manufacture of the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable was originally commissioned by the Company in December 2010. It was manufactured by an entity in China, namely China Feizhou Group Co Ltd (“China Feizhou”). Prior to commissioning of the manufacture, the defendant provided the relevant Australian Standards and the specifications used by another manufacturer, Olex, to China Feizhou with instructions to manufacture the cable to those standards. The usual supplier of cables to the Company did not manufacture that type of cable. At the time of ordering the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable from China Feizhou, the defendant was informed by China Feizhou that while it had not previously manufactured cabling to that specification, it could supply the specified TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable to the Company. China Feizhou had not previously supplied any product to the Company or any other entity associated with the defendant.

2.4. In or around the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012 the Company, via its Chinese import/export company, Hangzhou H & F Import & Export Co Ltd (Hangzhou Company), began to import into but had not yet supplied in Australia the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable manufactured by China Feizhou.

2.5. From about 1 May 2012 Infinity supplied the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable to Masters. Prior to this supply, the Company had not arranged for testing of the cable for compliance with the applicable standards.

2.6. On or about 16 May 2013 the Australian Cablemakers Association Ltd (“Cablemakers”) lodged a complaint with NSW Fair Trading alleging that the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable supplied by the Company to Masters was non-compliant with the applicable safety standard.

2.7. As a result of the complaint, NSW Fair Trading commenced an investigation into the matter.

2.8. Prior to this time, in the period 1 October 2012 to 31 December 2012, Senior Investigator Toole from NSW Fair Trading had engaged in discussions with the defendant regarding a technical non-compliance issue regarding the cable conductor size of the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable not meeting the value in an applicable standard entitled AS/NZS 1125. This was a separate issue from than the allegation the subject of the offending (that is the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable failing to meet AS/NZS 3820:2009).

2.9. In that correspondence, on 24 October 2012, Mr Toole requested the defendant to explain the likely cause of that discrepancy and to provide test reports / certificates to demonstrate the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable complied with current Australian standards. On 7 November 2012 the defendant provided an explanation to NSW Fair Trading for the technical under-sizing of the cable and stated “we are checking samples of newly manufactured cables and expecting results shortly for you to reference.”

2.10. As a result of this correspondence with NSW Fair Trading, the defendant attempted to get the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable tested for compliance with current Australian standards. The defendant first approached the laboratory at Chatswood called “Testing and Certification Australia.” However this laboratory had closed down at that time. The defendant then approached TUV Rheinland Australia Pty Ltd (“TUV”) which is a facility accredited by the National Association Testing Authorities (“NATA”) for testing electrical cables, including the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable. At that time TUV advised the defendant that it was moving its laboratory and place of business from Adelaide to Melbourne and was temporarily unable to provide the testing service.

2.11. Consequently, the defendant organised for the testing to be undertaken by Guangdong Testing Institute of Product Quality Supervision in Guangdong China (“the Guangdong Institute”) which is a CNAS (China National Accreditation Service for Conformity) accredited testing facility, accredited to undertake cable testing under Australian Standards. The defendant did not directly supply samples of the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable that had already been supplied to Masters or samples of the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable that the Company had already imported into Australia for future supply to Masters to the Guangdong Institute. Instead the defendant arranged for a sample of what was said to be the same TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable manufactured by China Feizhou to be taken directly from her exporter in China, namely Hangzhou Company, to the Guangdong Institute.

2.12. The sample tested by the Guangdong Institute was not from the same batch of TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable that the Company had already imported into Australia and supplied to Masters. The defendant assumed the cable supplied to the Guandong Institute for testing would have been made to the same specifications as the cable previously or since supplied to the Company by the Hangzhou Company manufactured by China Feizhou.

2.13. Prior to 12 December 2012 Guangdong Institute notified the defendant of the results of that test. The Guangdong Institute certified the sample of TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable it tested was compliant with the applicable safety standard AS/NZS 5000.2. A copy of the test report dated 28 November 2012 was sent to Glenn Toole on 12 December 2012. Mr Toole considered that report in the context of the separate and unrelated technical matter regarding the cable conductor being undersized. The report indicated that that matter had been addressed and Mr Toole notified his acceptance of the report. At that time Mr Toole replied that “Fair Trading will monitor compliance in the future.”

2.14. In order to test for compliance with AS/NZS 5000.2 ageing tests requiring the ageing of a sample of cable in an oven for 504 hours (21 days) are required. Because the issue raised by Senior Investigator Toole from NSW Fair Trading was to do with an issue to do with cable conductor size, ageing tests were not required to address this issue. In order to deal with the issue that had been raised, the defendant commissioned testing without the ageing test. This testing resulted in the test report dated 28 November 2012.

2.15. At the same time as commissioning the testing which resulted in the test report dated 28 November 2012 the defendant commissioned a full report (which included the ageing test) to test for compliance with AS/NZS 5000.2. These tests resulted in a report dated on or about 17 December 2012 (“the second report”). The second report showed the samples tested met the requirements of AS/NZS 5000.2. The samples tested for the second report were sent at the same time and in the same manner as the samples tested for the test report dated 28 November 2012. The defendant relied on the second report. The defendant assumed the cable supplied to the Guandong Institute for testing would have been made to the same specifications as the cable previously or since supplied to the Company by the Hangzhou Company manufactured by China Feizhou.

2.16. On or about 25 January 2013 the defendant supplied further TPS cable to Masters from fresh batches manufactured by China Feizhou and supplied by Hangzhou Company. These batches were not tested for compliance with Australian safety standards. The Defendant assumed that the batches would have been manufactured to the original specifications.

2.17. The defendant held an honest belief at that relevant time that the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable was compliant with the applicable safety standard. The defendant relied on the results of the test from the Guangdong Institute reported in the second report.

2.18. However the defendant accepts that, in the circumstances of the case, that belief was not reasonable and that the defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of the offence. Such steps included taking samples for testing from batches of cable actually supplied to the Company by Hangzhou Company, and undertaking a regular testing regime until such time as a history of compliance with Australian safety standards had been established.

Between June and September 2012 the defendant had another cable, namely the XLPE cable (0.6K/1KV), imported from Hangzhou Company, and tested by TUV Australia for compliance with the standard AS/NZS5000.1:2005 (to see if it met AS.NZS 3820:2009). That cable failed the mechanical aging test suggesting its insulation and oversheath failed to meet requisite standards. The defendant was placed on notice at this time that there were heat issues with the PVC sheathing of XLPE cable from the manufacturer, China Feizhou.

The defendant did not test a sample of the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable that was in fact supplied to Masters. The Defendant honestly held a belief that there would have been no difference in batches given that she had provided the Olex sample and the specifications to China Feizhou.

The defendant did not conduct routine, collective, or ongoing testing on different batches of TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable imported and intended for supply to Masters. The defendant did not ensure each batch of cable it supplied consistently met the requisite standards before selling its cable. Even though it is not a legislative requirement to do so, the cable must be known to meet the applicable standards prior to their being offered for sale or supply.

The relevant cable purchase

2.19. On or about 18 June 2013, Senior Investigator Glen Toole travelled to the Masters Home Improvement store in Gregory Hills. He observed several rolls of flat white TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable labelled “FT3025” and marked “Infinity” available for sale.

2.20. On that day, Senior Investigator Toole purchased one roll of that TPS cable marked “Infinity” for $93. This is “the TPS Cable” relevant to the offence.

2.21. On 19 June 2013 the TPS Cable was provided to TUV for testing to see if it complied with relevant standards, in particular AS/NZS 3820 (and AS/NZS 5000.2).

2.22. On 23 July 2013 a report was compiled and signed by TUV Australia stating that the TPS Cable “failed at mechanical properties after ageing and sheath thickness requirements.” The insulation and oversheath aspects of the cable failed to comply with AS/NZS 3820; in particular, clause 4.2(d) of the AS/NZS 3820 which is a specification prescribed by clause 23(1) of the Regulations.

2.23. Subsequently, between 14 and 16 August 2013 Senior Investigator Toole seized numerous samples of electrical cable manufactured by various companies from stores throughout NSW, including TPS cable supplied by the Company to AGM Electrical Croydon, Masters Chullora and Masters Gregory Hills. The samples were taken to Chemson Pacific Pty Ltd (accredited by the International Standards Organisation) for thermal stability testing of the PVC. This test is more commonly known as a “Congo Red Test”. Among the samples were Infinity and Olsent branded TPS and Orange Circular.

2.24. These tests were ‘blind’ tests where all identification of branding was physically removed from the outer sheathing before the samples were passed to the tester. Of the 63 obtained, 16 samples were tested.

2.25. The TPS and Orange Circular Cable samples that failed the Congo Red Test were all Infinity and Olsent branded cables. Other brands of cables passed this indicative testing regime.

2.26. Failing the Congo Red Test demonstrates a lack of thermal stability of PVC for the cable. This is most likely the reason why the cable failed the “mechanical tests after ageing in air oven” as required by Australia and New Zealand National Standards

.

2.27. The risk posed by the TPS cable was that when the TPS cable was installed including in high risk areas such as roof cavities, underfloors or other concealed areas of building construction, and particularly in areas of prolonged or fluctuating high temperature exposure, the insulation sheath would breakdown. This would cause live wires to be exposed resulting in a major risk of fire. This risk was made greater by the fact that the TPS cable was likely to be installed in concealed areas of buildings.

2.28. A further risk that could be created if the insulating sheath was to break down would be if any person or animal came into contact with the TPS cable.

2.29. On the 12 June 2013, the Defendant was contacted by NSW Fair Trading regarding the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable failure to meet the applicable standards and calling her to a meeting.

2.30. Subsequently, the Defendant commissioned a test to occur with TUV which had by now re-established its testing laboratories. The Defendant forwarded a sample of the TPS 2.5mm² Twin and Earth cable directly from the Company’s warehouse to the laboratory for testing.

2.31. On 9 August 2013 the Defendant received a Test report of the TPS cable from TUV which indicated that the product did comply with the Australian Standard.

2.32. On 14 August 2013 the Defendant (through her legal representative) received a Test report from TUV dated 28 February 2013 commissioned by NSW Fair Trading indicating that the cables had failed to comply with the Australian Standard.

2.33. On or about 16 August 2013 NSW Fair Trading requested that Ms Luo attend to a recall of all Infinity TPS cables and Orange Round cables. The defendant agreed to a voluntary recall of 3 batches of TPS cable product (limited to those that were subject to the testing at that stage).

2.34. On 13 September 2013 the defendant met with NSW Fair Trading to discuss results of the Red Congo test and Fair Trading’s request to expand the recall into all TPS and Orange Round cables.

2.35. The defendant requested time to decide as this was the first time that the defendant was notified that the orange round product was to be included in a recall.

2.36. On 16 September 2013 the defendant requested a further extension of time to consider all matters now being put to her and the implications on the affairs of the Company. There was no further contact until 26 September 2013 when NSW Fair Trading was notified by ASIC that the Company had been placed into voluntary liquidation and liquidators appointed that day. As at 27 September 2013 the appointed liquidator was of the opinion that the Company was insolvent.

2.37. From 18 to 23 September 2013 the defendant was an inpatient at Psychiatric Emergency Care Centre which is co-located in the Emergency Department of Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital.  On discharge, she was certified as being unfit for usual activities until 11 October 2013.

2.38. On 2 October 2013 NSW Fair Trading served prohibition and recall notices on all Infinity TPS and Orange Round cables and a public warning was issued.

2.39. There has subsequently been a national recall of all Infinity supplied TPS and Orange Round cables.

Subsequent action, remediation and harm

3.1. On 2 October 2013 NSW Fair Trading served prohibition and recall notices on all Infinity TPS and Orange Round cables and a public warning was issued.

3.2. There has subsequently been a national recall of all Infinity supplied TPS and Orange Round cables.

3.3. Infinity supplied approximately 1,154km of TPS and Orange Round cable in the NSW market during the relevant period. As at 31 July 2016, 75km of Infinity-supplied TPS and Orange Round cable had been recovered from warehouses, and 43km of TPS and Orange Round cable had been remediated in NSW premises. As at that date, 99km of TPS and Orange Round cable that had been supplied by Infinity in NSW was scheduled for future remediation, and 338 properties had been made safe as a result of remediation.

3.4. The prosecutor is unable to prove what proportions of the amounts specified in paragraph 3.3 above are of TPS cable. The defendant has no records which allow her to provide a breakdown of supply of each of TPS and Orange Round cable. The parties agree that a substantial quantity of TPS cable was supplied by Infinity in the NSW market.

3.5. The envisaged problems with TPS cable supplied by Infinity are estimated to commence after 6 years as it is estimated that the cable sheath of the TPS cable supplied by Infinity, for those batches affected by the subject of the recall, will start to break down around that time.

Antecedents

4.1. The defendant has no prior convictions.

THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION


	
	Section 16 of the Electricity (Consumer Safety) Act 2004 (“the Act”) is in the following terms:

AS/NZS 3820:1998 means the Australian and New Zealand Standard entitled AS/NZS 3820:1998, Essential safety requirements for electrical equipment, as in force from time to time, published jointly by Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand.”

AS/NZS 3820:1998 was superseded by AS/NZS 3820:2009 on 11 December 2009. On 28 August 2015 the Electrical (Consumer Safety) Regulations 2015 commenced implementing the same clause 23(1) with reference to the superseding AS/NZS 3820:2009.

Clause 4.2(d) of AS/NZS 3820:2009 (or 3820:1998) provides that insulation shall be suitable for foreseeable conditions.

Clause 5 of the AS/NZS 3820:2009 (or 3820:1998) provides that compliance with clause 4 (including 4.2(d)) is demonstrated by compliance with the relevant standards.

A relevant standard at the material time is AS/NZS 5000.2:2006 (published on 19 July 2006) entitled “Electric Cables – Polymeric insulated Part 2: For working voltages up to and including 450 / 750V”

THE DEFENDANT’S CASE


	
	The defendant, who did not give evidence, relied upon a report of Anita Duffy, Psychologist, who interviewed and assessed her on 24 October 2016. That report contains the following matters of background which, as I understand it, are not in dispute.
	
	
	The defendant was born in South East China on 12 October 1983 and is now 33 years of age. She grew up with her parents with whom she had a close relationship, although it seems that she perceived that they were too strict in their expectations of her. The defendant’s father apparently loaned her money to help her establish the business that she was operating at the time of the offending. The defendant perceives that she will never be able to recoup that money and repay her father.
	
	
	The defendant matriculated to the Zhe Jiang University of Technology in China where she completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree, majoring in English and studying international business and Japanese. She arrived in Australia in 2006 and was thereafter accepted into Macquarie University where she completed a Master of Arts majoring in Linguistics in 2008. She met her husband after her arrival in Australia. They married in 2009 and have two young children.
	
	
	The company which the defendant and her husband formed to carry on the business which led to the offending was placed in voluntary administration on 26 September 2013. The defendant has not worked in any paid capacity since that time.
	
	
	Ms Duffy took a history from the defendant regarding her mental health. In light of the competing positions of the parties in respect of the issue of the defendant’s mental health, and the impact of that issue on sentence, that history as recorded by Ms Duffy, along with her findings on testing and her conclusions, should be set out in full:
	


In August 2013 she was rushed to hospital to give birth to her son at 38 weeks by Caesarean section. The baby remained in hospital for several weeks and was later cared for by her mother, after Ms Luo suffered a “breakdown” and was unable to deal with her child.

She was unable to breast feed as she was not producing milk due to the stress, she had to bottle feed and was not able to look after him such that her mother became her baby’s main carer taking him overseas for five months and bringing him back to Australia when he was 8 months of age.

She described symptoms of insomnia, racing thoughts, tearfulness, indecisiveness, culminating in a suicide attempt by overdose on 18 September when her father found her unconscious on the floor of her home. She was taken to Hornsby Hospital Psychiatric Unit and remained there for several days until her discharge on 23 September.

She was unable to use the phone and was sheltered from the contact with Fair trading officers who were demanding she recall the products. She consulted the psychiatrist and was prescribed anti-depressant medication Zoloft, which she took for several months. After her discharge she had visits from the Community Health nurse to monitor her mental state.

She was thought to have suffered Post Natal Depression augmented by the ongoing stress and anxiety caused by the Fair Trading investigation and their demands that she recall all the cables from sale. She was reliant on her mother to care for her son as it proved to be too difficult for her to cope with the pressures of the business as well as dealing with a newborn baby. She could not even hold her child and her mother also assisted with the care of her daughter.

She had never experienced such problems with her daughter after her birth and attributed her difficulties with her son to the additional stressors in her life.

Even after the business was placed into liquidation her symptoms of depression have persisted as she experiences the guilt of having lost all funds including a considerable amount of money invested by her father. It has caused some friction and her parents and she was upset when her father blamed her inexperience as well as the manufacturers.

She noticed that she has become more short tempered, is easily aroused to anger and anxiety and still has sleeping problems. She is more likely to snap at her children and at her husband and described a deterioration in her relationship with him, and they have many arguments. She expressed fears that their relationship had been irrevocably damaged by the events of the past few years which have caused financial as well as emotional problems.


	
	Ms Duffy then administered clinical psychological testing, the defendant’s response to which she described as follows:
	


“Her response style indicated that she was consistent, and was not attempting to portray herself in an overly positive light. She showed a tendency to over endorse psychological problems, which is often seen as a reflection of the level of psychological distress and as a ‘cry for help’. Adjustments were made to her final results which can be regarded as a valid reflection of her personality functioning.

Across the basic personality scale she revealed significant elevation on measures of Avoidant and Dependent characteristics. On measures of more serious personality pathology indicative of personality disorders, her result was significant on the Borderline scale.

Ms Luo’s profile reflects an individual who may not feel capable and confident to function independently and therefore creates strong bonds with people whom she perceives as being able to lead and care for her. She may not feel capable of making decisions, feels inadequate and insecure and has low self-esteem. She identifies with stronger people and defines herself in terms of these people. She is very sensitive to rejection and to maintain friendships, will be submissive and cooperative, covering up unpleasant emotions out of fear of alienating others. She will be passive, timid and docile in her interaction with others. Internally she may have a limited range of competencies in reducing tension and dealing with stressors. She may suffer symptoms of an anxiety disorder which can include panic attacks and phobias often related to and triggered by the fear of separation.

On the measures of clinical symptoms that suggest the need for treatment, her highest score was on the Anxiety scale which was well into significance. She also had elevations on Dysthymia and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder scales. On measures of more severe clinical symptoms she attained a highly significant score on the scale of Major Depression.

Ms Luo is currently experiencing symptoms associated with the emotional and physiological concomitants of anxiety. She is very tense, has difficulty relaxing, is apprehensive and fearful. She may have a highly sensitive startle response, and somatic symptoms can include insomnia, palpitations, appetite disturbances, upset stomach and nausea. The PTSD elevation highlights her hypervigilance to threat or harm, hyperarousal, irritability and difficulty in regulating her emotions.

The Major Depression and Dysthymia elevations reflect severe depression which has affected her daily living. She may have psychological symptoms including feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, ruminating and fear of the future. Somatic symptoms might include insomnia, weight loss, poor concentration, psychomotor slowing or agitation and loss of sexual desire”.


	
	Ms Duffy expressed (inter alia) the following conclusions:
	


Vida Luo’s presentation at our session, the history she provided and the results of an objective personality assessment reveal a person with pronounced symptoms consistent with Anxiety and Major Depression in response to her current circumstances. She is facing sentencing for importing and supplying cables that have been found to fail compliance tests in accordance with safety standards in Australia.

…

In response to your specific questions:

1.   Ms Luo does have a history of anxiety especially in the realm of achievement and living up to the expectations of her family in particular. She noted periods of “nervousness and tension” if she failed to meet her parents’ approval and was consequently admonished or punished during her childhood and adolescence if she did not perform well enough in her studies.

2.   Ms Luo was understandably nervous about taking on the role as company director in a field where she had no knowledge of the product. She described herself as “naïve and brave” to take on this responsibility and perhaps was overly reliant on the advice of her associate Jimmy, who was an electrician, but also is not experienced in importation of cables and the requirements involved. Her levels of anxiety were thus elevated when she was conducted by the Fair Trading in 2012 and required to take further tests and maintain compliant standards. She did have the product tested in China but was so stressed and anxious when she had to attend the meeting with them that she could not go.

3.    The way in which the Fair Trading officers conducted their investigation and their communications with her by terse email also induced anxiety in Ms Luo as she felt overwhelmed by their demands and was unable to respond adequately. Her lack of familiarity of this technical field and her unassertive, submissive personality characteristics and feelings of inadequacy enhanced by this investigation process all contributed to escalate her feelings of helplessness and anxiety, such that she became emotionally unstable and depressed, culminating in a suicide attempt and admission to a psychiatric ward.

4.    It is considered that Ms Luo continues to suffer anxiety and major depression and had developed some post trauma symptoms following the period of investigation and perceived bullying and harassment by the Fair Trading Officers. She has strong feelings of failure, sleeps badly and has difficulty in managing her emotions such that she has temper outbursts consistent with increased irritability and arousal. Her relationship with her husband and children have deteriorated and she has continuous guilt over her parents’ loss of money due to their investment in the business. Her self-esteem is affected and she has lost confidence.

5.   Ms Luo requires professional intervention to deal with the anxiety, depression, and post trauma symptoms that occurred during the process of negotiations with Fair Trading and the subsequent demise of her business. She will need at least ten sessions with a clinical psychologist to work on the sequelae of her business failure and the depression, guilt and anxiety that it engendered. Underlying issues involving the quality of her interactions and relationships with her family, particularly her parents need to be addressed, as she retains considerable guilt over the problems she has caused them. Therapy would include improving her communications to become assertive rather than aggressive or submissive, dealing with negative emotions, self soothing and regulation of anxiety and stress, improving health and sleep, and planning positive goals in terms of family and career. Financial difficulties are also a continual source of stress and she may need a financial counsellor to help with debt management. It is envisaged that the process of her recovery will be lengthy but after her sentence she will be in a better position to evaluate her future and plan more effectively.

Submissions of the Prosecutor 


	
	It was submitted on behalf of the Prosecutor that the defendant’s offending had created a major safety hazard and that in these circumstances, two of the critical considerations on sentence were general and specific deterrence. In this regard, and in light of the submissions made on behalf of the defendant, counsel for the Prosecutor addressed the Court at some length in relation to the use which he submitted could properly be made of Ms Duffy’s report. He pointed, in particular, to the fact that the defendant had not given any evidence on oath, and he placed particular reliance on the observations of Smart AJ in R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353 where his Honour said (at [58] – [59]):
	


[58] There is one further general observation. In this case reliance appears to have been placed on statements made by the prisoner to psychiatrists and the psychologist. While those statements are admissible in evidence, very considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon them when there is no evidence given by the prisoner. In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements.

[59] There has been a noticeable and disturbing tendency of more recent years for prisoners on a sentence hearing not to give evidence and to rely on statements made to experts. Prisoners should realise that if this course is taken great caution will be exercised in respect of the weight, if any, given to those statements.


	
	The effect of counsel’s submission was that little or no weight should be given to the contents of Ms Duffy’s report.
	
	
	It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the defendant’s offending was high, and was aggravated by the fact that there had been a cost to the community in identifying and remedying the safety hazard created by the installation of the cable in those premises in which it was known to have been installed. It was submitted that the offending was further aggravated by the fact that there remained an ongoing risk in those premises where cable may have been installed, but where such premises remained unidentified. Counsel further submitted that in all of the circumstances the defendant should have waited until proper testing had been completed before distributing the cables.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, it was submitted on behalf of the Prosecutor that the defendant’s criminality was “at the high end of the spectrum of objective seriousness”.
	
	
	In advancing these submissions, counsel for the Prosecutor submitted that the objective seriousness of the present offending was substantially greater than that which I had cause to consider in Commissioner for Fair Trading, Office of Finance and Service v Hua Yang Australia International Trading and Investment Pty Limited and Huadi Bi [2016] NSWSC 1380 (“Hua Yang”). I will return to that submission in due course.
	
	
	Counsel for the Prosecutor also submitted that the offence was committed without regard for public safety, and for financial gain, and that both of these factors were matters of aggravation.
	
	
	In terms of mitigating factors, Counsel for the Prosecutor submitted that there was no evidence of any remorse by the defendant, other than such remorse as was demonstrated by her plea of guilty. In that regard, counsel pointed out that the plea was entered on 15 September 2016, in circumstances where the matter had been listed for a three day hearing commencing on 26 September 2016. Although counsel for the Prosecutor did not suggest that the defendant’s plea was of no utilitarian value at all, he pointed to the timing of the plea as a factor which would operate to significantly reduce the level of any discount which might be applied. It was conceded that the defendant had no prior convictions, and that her supply of the electrical cabling was not ongoing.
	


Submissions of the defendant 


	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that the objective seriousness of the offending was not as high as that which had been asserted by counsel for the Prosecutor. In particular, he pointed out that the offending did not involve actual knowledge on the part of the defendant of the fact that the cabling did not comply with relevant Australian standards, and that this was therefore not a case in which the defendant had exhibited a total disregard for her obligation, nor a case in which she had wilfully “shut her eyes” to any relevant factor(s).
	
	
	In this regard counsel made specific reference to the following aspects of the Agreed Facts which, he submitted, established that prior to the time of the supply of the cabling the defendant had:
	



	
	caused the company to provide all relevant Australian standards and specifications to the manufacturer of the cabling (Agreed Facts at para 2.3);
	
	
	provided instructions to manufacture the cabling according to those standards (Agreed Facts at para 2.3);
	
	
	sought (unsuccessfully) to have relevant testing done in Australia, at the testing facility which had been used by the Prosecutor (Agreed Facts at para 2.7-2.10);
	
	
	resorted to an accredited testing facility in China (Agreed Facts at para 2.11 – 2.14); and
	
	
	obtained a report from that accredited testing facility in China which asserted that the samples tested met the requirements of the safety standards which had been provided (Agreed Facts at para 2.15).
	



	
	Counsel accepted that although the protection of the public was not strictly an element of the offence, it was clear that the legislation was directed towards achieving that end. However he submitted that in these circumstances it was necessary to take care to ensure that public safety considerations were not “double counted” in the sentencing exercise. It was further submitted that in circumstances where the Prosecutor had accepted that the belief of the defendant as to the compliance of the cabling with relevant safety standards was honest, this was not a case in which I would find that the offending was committed for financial gain.
	
	
	In terms of mitigating factors, counsel for the defendant pointed to the fact that the defendant has no prior convictions and had, at the time of the offending, been involved in the importation and sale of electrical cabling for a period of a little less than 4 years.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should conclude that the defendant was unlikely to reoffend, and that she had not attempted at any time to minimise her conduct. However counsel expressly accepted that there was no evidence of any expression of remorse by the defendant.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant did not take issue with the principles applicable to quantifying the discount to reflect a plea of guilty. However, he submitted that the plea entered by the defendant had “high utilitarian value” because (inter alia) it had saved the time and expense of having witnesses (including expert witnesses) appear over an estimated three day hearing. It was submitted that the entering of the plea needed to be viewed in the context of a case in which there may well have been some considerable complexity attaching to the proof of relevant facts. In all of the circumstances, it was submitted that a discount in the range of 15% to 20% was appropriate.
	
	
	Finally, counsel for the defendant submitted that even though the defendant had chosen not to give evidence, the opinions of Ms Duffy, and her diagnoses, ought to be accepted. Counsel submitted that although Ms Duffy did not express a view that there was any causal link between those diagnosed conditions and the offending, the defendant’s mental state nevertheless remained a relevant factor, particularly in terms of determining whether or not she was a suitable vehicle for general deterrence. Counsel submitted that, accepting the opinions of Ms Duffy, the defendant was clearly suffering a mental illness which, even though it was not causally connected to the offending, meant that general deterrence was of limited significance in the sentencing exercise.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	The maximum penalties set for this offence are indicative of the gravity with which it is viewed by the legislature. Viewed objectively, the defendant’s offending was obviously serious. The cabling in question did not meet the relevant safety standards prescribed in this country. Such standards are prescribed in an endeavour to ensure the safety of the public at large. The failure of the cabling to meet those standards posed a significant risk that the insulative sheath in the cabling would break down. That, in turn, created a risk of a major fire. As a consequence, the life of any person who might find himself or herself present in premises where the cabling had been laid would be placed in danger.
	
	
	Those who sell (or who supply for sale) to the public items of this nature have an obligation to be vigilant in observing their responsibilities. One of the principal responsibilities of a person in the defendant’s position is to ensure that such items comply with relevant Australian standards. In Hua Yang I observed (at [92] – [93]):
	


[92] Those who sell electrical items to members of the public for commercial gain have a responsibility to ensure such items have the requisite statutory approval, and are therefore safe to use. The nature of that responsibility was expressed by Einfeld J in McInnes v Global Imports Pty Limited [1992] FCA 590 in the following terms (at [25]):

‘There is an important public interest at stake and although the standards are arbitrary, the existence of such standards is widespread around the western world if not virtually universal. Business people must be conscious of their responsibilities in this regard, even if it means factoring into their price structures the cost consequences of having to ensure that their products are safe and rejecting those that are not’.

[93] Those observations were made in the context of a case involving the sale of unsafe children’s toys. They assume even greater significance in the present case, for the simple reason that electrical articles are able to be used by a far broader section of the community. All of these factors mean that general deterrence is an important consideration in determining penalty. The commercial community must be deterred from the philosophy of selling at all costs: Global Imports (supra) at [22].


	
	Those observations are equally apposite in the present case.
	
	
	Clearly, the defendant fell short of maintaining the level of vigilance which was required. As the owner of a business engaged in the commercial supply of electrical cabling, she had a responsibility to ensure that all aspects of the conduct of her business complied with the law: (Hua Yang at [68]).
	
	
	However I am unable to accept the submission advanced on behalf of the Prosecutor that the criminality of this defendant is greater than that of the defendants in Hua Yang. The offending in Hua Yang involved the sale of electrical chargers and adapters which did not have the requisite regulatory approval, and which had been constructed in such a way as to pose a significant safety risk to any member of the public who used them. I found (at [69]) that the second defendant in that case (who was the director of the first defendant) had abandoned her responsibilities as a supplier of such goods. I also found that such abandonment included a failure to make any enquires of her supplier as to whether or not the items which she was obtaining, and later offering for sale to members of the public, were relevantly approved. I concluded in the circumstances that neither defendant had paid any regard to important issues of public safety.
	
	
	That could hardly be said to be the case here, particularly bearing in mind the Agreed Facts. Far from completely abandoning her responsibility, the defendant in the present case in fact took some - albeit inadequate – steps, in an effort to ensure that the cabling was compliant. Indeed, counsel for the Prosecutor conceded (in light of the Agreed Facts) that the defendant held an honest belief that this was so. There was no suggestion of any similar belief being held by the defendants in Hua Yang. 
	
	
	Further, and again unlike the defendants in Hua Yang who offered the items for sale in circumstances where there was no system whatsoever in place towards ensuring that they had the necessary regulatory approval, the present defendant did have some system in place, albeit one which was imperfect. It is also significant that there is no suggestion in the present case that the defendant has sought, at any time, to minimise her culpability. A finding to the contrary was made in respect of the second defendant in Hua Yang (at [81]).
	
	
	None of these observations are intended to convey the suggestion that the offending of this defendant was not serious. Clearly it was. However the factors to which I have pointed demonstrate that the submission made by counsel for the Prosecutor that the present offending is of greater gravity than that of the defendants in Hua Yang is untenable.
	
	
	I turn to consider, to the extent that they are applicable, the various aggravating and mitigating factors contained in s. 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”).
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the offence was committed for financial gain in the sense contemplated by s. 21A(2)(o). Although the extent to which it did so cannot be established by the evidence, it is clear that the defendant’s company did gain financially from the sale of the cabling. However there is no evidence which establishes that the offence was committed for that purpose. Once again in that respect, a useful contrast may be drawn between the position of the present defendant, and that of the defendants in in Hua Yang (at [49]; [73]).
	
	
	The parties were at odds as to whether the fact that the offending was committed without regard to public safety was an aggravating factor under s. 21A(2)(i). Public safety is the “gist” of this offence, in the sense that the offence is premised on the fact that to engage in the conduct which constitutes it is to act without regard for public safety. To treat that as an aggravating factor under s. 21A(2)(i) would involve impermissible double counting: R v McMillan [2005] NSWCCA 28 at [38] Howie J (Santow JA and Bell J agreeing). Accordingly, whilst the fact that the offending was committed without regard to public safety is clearly a relevant factor on sentence, it is not an aggravating factor under s. 21A(2)(i).
	
	
	In terms of mitigating factors, the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity and the defendant has no record of previous convictions. These are mitigating factors under ss. 21A(3)(b) and (e) respectively.
	
	
	On the evidence before me, the company which had been incorporated to facilitate the supply of the cabling has been placed in administration. Moreover, for the reasons that I have already set out, the defendant had some, albeit not a full, appreciation of her responsibilities. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the defendant is unlikely to re-offend and that she has good prospects of rehabilitation. These are mitigating factors under ss. 21A(3)(g) and s. 21A(3)(h) respectively.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any remorse shown by the defendant of the kind contemplated by s. 21A(3)(i). Accordingly, that is not a mitigating factor.
	
	
	The defendant’s plea of guilty is a mitigating factor under s. 21A(3)(k). That plea was entered at a late stage, and indeed at a time which might be described as being at, or at least approaching, the eve of the hearing. I accept that the entering of the plea had some utilitarian benefit. However, one of the circumstances relevant to the assessment of the discount to be applied on account of a plea of guilty is the time at which the plea is entered. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for a late plea unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial: R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 at [153]–[156] per Spigelman CJ. In these circumstances, bearing in mind that the appropriate range for a discount is between 10% and 25%, the discount in the present case to reflect the defendant’s plea should be assessed at 10%.
	
	
	I turn to consider the issue of general deterrence. I have previously set out the findings reached by Ms Duffy. As I have said, the essence of the submission made by counsel for the Prosecutor was that in the absence of evidence on oath from the defendant, Ms Duffy’s findings were deserving of little or no weight.
	
	
	Ms Duffy made reference to the fact that in August 2013 the defendant was rushed to hospital to give birth to her son. There is no dispute that on 18 September 2013 the defendant was admitted to the Psychiatric Unit of Hornsby Hospital where she remained for a period of 5 days (Agreed Facts at 2.37). The catalyst for that admission is not established by the evidence. No clinical or treatment notes in respect of it were tendered as part of the defendant's case. I am therefore unable to determine whether the cause of that admission arose from investigation into the offending, post natal complications or a combination of those (and perhaps other undisclosed) factors. Further, in the absence of clinical notes or related material, I am unable to determine what, if any, diagnosis was made following the defendant's admission to hospital, just as I am unable to determine what course of treatment (if any) was recommended.
	
	
	Ms Duffy diagnosed the defendant as suffering from anxiety and major depression ""in response to her current circumstances"". It might be inferred that the ""current circumstances"" to which Ms Duffy referred encompass these proceedings. What else they might encompass is not something that I can determine. In any event, Ms Duffy stopped short of expressing the view that there was any causal connection between the defendant's anxiety and depression condition and her offending.
	
	
	The opinion of Ms Duffy was obviously based, at least in part, upon the history provided by the defendant at the time of her examination. The fact that a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis is made wholly or partly on the basis of a subjective history is not unusual. In the present case however, it is apparent that Ms Duffy's diagnosis was also based upon the defendant's presentation at the time of examination, and her results following the completion of the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory - III, described by Ms Duffy as ""a comprehensive personality questionnaire comprising the measure of basic personality characteristics, more severe personality pathology as well as a number of clinical symptoms more transient and reactive to current circumstances"". I have previously set out Ms Duffy’s account of the results of that testing.
	
	
	I am conscious of the statements of Smart AJ in Qutami regarding the caution with which reports of this nature must be approached. However, his Honour did not go so far as to say that in each and every case, a report such as that of Ms Duffy is deserving of no weight. What weight might be attached to such a report will necessarily depend upon the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The defendant bears the onus of establishing any mitigating factor on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 64. In the present case Ms Duffy’s report was tendered without objection, and in the absence of any request that she be available for cross-examination on its contents. In all of these circumstances, and particularly bearing in mind that Ms Duffy’s opinion was based on factors other than the subjective history provided to her, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant is suffering from the conditions she diagnosed.
	
	
	The diagnoses of Ms Duffy are important, and of particular relevance to the issue of general deterrence. In Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114 Simpson J (as her Honour then was) made reference (at [33]) to the principles governing the effect of an offender’s mental illness on sentence:
	


[33] This Court has frequently had to grapple with the effect on sentencing (especially with respect to serious or violent crimes) of mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental or emotional impairment or disability. The compassion and sympathy that such a condition engenders collide with the need for sentences to reflect the objective gravity of the offence in question, the community's interest in general deterrence, and that criminal conduct must be met with appropriate denunciation and retribution. Over the years, the applicable principles have evolved. They were most recently re-stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. They are as follows:

‘[Principle 1] Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence ...

[Principle 2] It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed ...

[Principle 3] It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced ...

[Principle 4] It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence ...

[Principle 5] Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public ...’ (internal citations omitted, italics added)


	
	Her Honour then went on to say (commencing at [34]):
	


[34] It will be observed that none of these principles is stated as absolute. What is recognised is the potential effect, in any given case, of a mental disability. It does not follow that, because an offender suffers from some mental impairment or disability, his or her moral culpability is reduced (principle 1); nor that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (principle 2); nor that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him or her (principle 3); nor that the significance of specific deterrence is reduced or eliminated (principle 4). Nor, on the other hand, does it follow that a person with mental impairment is a danger to the community, indicating a need for community protection (principle 5). Too often, the mere fact of mental illness is advanced to this Court as necessarily calling for a more lenient sentence. What the principles spelled out by McClellan CJ at CL do is direct attention to considerations that experience has shown commonly arise in such cases. There is, however, no presumption. It remains necessary for the sentencing court to examine the relevant facts in order to determine whether, in the specific case, the mental condition has the consequence contended for.

[35] A central question (but not the only question) is whether the mental illness or other condition had a causative role to play in the commission of the offence or offences for which the offender is to be sentenced. Counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that this was the principal issue in this case. If it is concluded that there was a causal connection, then the offender's moral culpability may be reduced (see principle 1). That connection may also warrant lesser attention being paid to the need for the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence (principle 2).


	
	As I have already observed, the report of Ms Duffy does not establish any causal connection between the defendant’s offending and her mental state. However that does not mean that an offender’s mental illness is irrelevant to the issue of general deterrence: Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 235 at [30] per the Court (Beazley P, R A Hulme and Bellew JJ) citing Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 per McClellan CJ at CL [42] and R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 (per Gleeson CJ) and at 72 (per Allen J). In Engert, Gleeson CJ emphasised that the issue must not be approached on the basis that once it is established that an offender suffers from a mental illness, it automatically follows that general deterrence will assume less importance in determining the appropriate sentence. Whether that is the case will necessarily depend on the entirety of the circumstances.
	
	
	In the present case, it is clear, having regard to the opinion of Ms Duffy that the defendant is suffering from a number of significant mental health issues. The extent of those issues is such that in Ms Duffy’s opinion they require professional intervention. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the defendant presents as an unsuitable vehicle for general deterrence. For the same reasons, personal deterrence has little part to play in the sentencing of the defendant.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	The defendant is fined the sum of $18,000.00.
	
	
	The fine in Order (1) is to be paid within 28 days.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the Prosecutor’s costs as agreed in the sum of $15,000.00

		12 April 2017",2017-04-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276343,DL v R [2017] NSWCCA 57,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: DL stood trial before a judge and jury of 12 for the murder of Tania, a girl aged 15, on 19 July 2005 at Forresters Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He pleaded not guilty, but was convicted on 27 March 2008 and sentenced, on 14 November 2008, to a term of imprisonment of 22 years. The sentence commenced on 19 July 2005; a non-parole period of 17 years, expiring on 18 July 2022, was fixed: R v DL [2008] NSWSC 1199. DL has been in custody since the day of the victim’s murder. He seeks leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence. Both appeals were heard together, but this is our judgment on the appeal against conviction. The Court’s judgment on the appeal against sentence is DL v R (No 2) [2017] NSWCCA 58.
	
	
	At the time of the murder, DL had just turned 16. Murder is a serious children’s indictable offence and accordingly DL was dealt with at law, and tried in the Supreme Court. By reason of s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), his name, and the names of other children involved at the trial, are not to be published, subject to the exceptions in ss 15B-15F. It does not appear on the material available to this Court that any of those exceptions are made out, and thus the deceased child cannot be named. However, we share the concern expressed by R A Hulme J in R v Maybir (No 8) [2016] NSWSC 166 at [2] that it would be disrespectful to the memory of Tania to anonymise her name completely.
	
	
	By way of overview, most of the grounds of appeal against conviction relate, more or less directly, to the blood pattern analysis evidence adduced at trial from Detective Sergeant Gregory Moon. Matters raised include the way in which the evidence came to be adduced at trial, and more recent expert opinion evidence from Det Sgt Moon and from an expert retained by DL, Dr Mark Reynolds, led for the first time as fresh evidence on appeal. Both were cross-examined at some length in this Court. Speaking generally, DL alleges that a great deal of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence at trial was incorrect, and in this Court, Det Sgt Moon has accepted that there were errors. DL also alleges that in any event Det Sgt Moon’s evidence at trial was inadmissible and, that in the circumstances in which it came to be admitted, there was irremediable procedural unfairness to DL. The other aspects of the appeal against conviction are relatively confined, and relate to the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	The Crown denies that there was procedural unfairness, and that Det Sgt Moon’s evidence was inadmissible. In light however of the acceptance by Det Sgt Moon of the deficiencies in some aspects of his evidence, the Crown points to the length of time which has elapsed, the operation of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, and relies very substantially on the proviso.
	
	
	These reasons address the following issues:
	



	
	The delay since 2008;
	
	
	Overview of the facts;
	
	
	The way in which Det Sgt Moon’s evidence came to be adduced;
	
	
	The content of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence and its deficiencies;
	
	
	Fresh evidence on appeal;
	
	
	The other proposed grounds of appeal;
	
	
	The proviso.
	


The delay since 2008


	
	DL’s applications seeking leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence were heard some eight years after sentence was imposed, and after DL had been imprisoned for more than 11 years. There was a lengthy, but not wholly satisfactory, explanation for the extreme delay.
	
	
	DL was represented at trial by the Legal Aid Commission, which caused to be filed a notice of intention to appeal. Following the receipt of an advice on the merits of the appeal from senior counsel, and a further advice from junior counsel, legal aid to fund an appeal against conviction was refused on 22 October 2010. The Legal Aid Review Committee confirmed the refusal of aid on 16 March 2011.
	
	
	DL’s current solicitors, Matouk Joyner Lawyers, received instructions in May 2011 and briefed senior and junior counsel to prepare a merit advice on conviction and sentence appeal. It is not precisely clear when those counsel were briefed, although by letter dated 11 July 2011 to the Registrar of this Court, Mr Joyner advised that that had occurred. However, by letter dated 13 July 2011, the Deputy Registrar refused the application to file a notice of intention to appeal, stating as follows:
	


“As you are aware, the NIA in this matter expired on 28 August 2009.

Furthermore, I advise that on 21 September 2010 Registrar Drennan refused a subsequent late extension application, which had been submitted by the Legal Aid Commission on 17 September 2010.

In light of the above, I advise that the current application, which is approximately 22 months out of time, is refused.

As you are aware my decision does not prevent your client filing an appeal out of time with the court, supported by an application for such an extension.”


	
	A merit advice, said to have been “affirmative as to the prospects of success on appeal” was received on 20 February 2012 (at least seven months after counsel had been retained). Although its conclusion was disclosed, the content of the advice was not provided to this Court. However, it was said that “the contents of the merit advice and the proposed grounds of appeal were disputed by [DL] and his parents”. Draft submissions on conviction and sentence from Queen’s Counsel and junior counsel retained were only received on 20 November 2012, but it was said again that DL and his parents continued to dispute the proposed grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The firm received instructions to brief alternative counsel and, on 21 November 2012, Ms Bashir SC was sent some documents in the matter. She advised that she would not be in a position to consider the matter until about March 2013. She provided a draft advice as to further steps to be taken prior to the determination of merit on 21 August 2013, during which time the solicitors appear to have been taking steps to recover exhibits, and making contact with blood pattern analysis experts. Not until 9 September 2013 was a decision taken that a blood pattern analysis expert should be engaged. Dr Reynolds was retained and he ultimately reviewed the exhibits and provided a report on 8 October 2014.
	
	
	In the meantime, the High Court had delivered Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39, and subsequently a large number of cases were reviewed by the Legal Aid Commission for “Muldrock error”. In October 2013, Ms Bashir was briefed by the Legal Aid Commission in relation to DL’s application for leave to appeal against sentence. A provisional hearing date of 12 March 2014 was allocated. The appeal against sentence was delayed because of DL’s wish for the conviction and sentence appeals to be heard together, and also while awaiting the later High Court decision in Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37, governing the way in which applications for an extension of time were to be determined. The grounds of appeal and submissions in support were filed on 14 April 2016. The delay in the seven months thereafter was substantially attributable to the further exchange of fresh forensic evidence relating to bloodstains, and the need to find the lengthy period of time for the hearing (originally listed for five days) in this Court.
	
	
	Thus, the first 2½ years of delay occurred while there was a dispute as to Legal Aid, which was refused. After private counsel were retained, part of the delay is attributable to DL’s decision thereafter to retain different counsel, who herself had limited availability. Part of the delay of the appeal against sentence is attributable to the decision to seek to have the appeals against conviction and sentence heard concurrently. Finally, part of the delay (slightly more than a year) is attributable to the time between retaining Dr Reynolds and his preparation of a first report on two items of bloodstained clothing.
	
	
	It is not possible to assess the ongoing distress to the victim’s family and friends by the undue prolongation of proceedings in this Court, other than that it is undoubtedly real. Further, were the result to be that this Court quash DL’s conviction and order a retrial, the prejudice occasioned by reference to the unavailability of witnesses and the fading of memories more than a decade after the events would be important matters, especially in relation to points not taken at the first trial and the force of r 4.
	
	
	It was not suggested that the Deputy Registrar was wrong to state, in 2011, that this Court had power to extend the time within which to apply for leave to appeal, notwithstanding the earlier refusals by the Registrar. Such power was exercised (once again, without opposition) in Tongahai v R [2014] NSWCCA 81; (2014) 241 A Crim R 217 (see at [18]-[19]). The question of an extension of time cannot, however, be divorced from an assessment of the strength of the case sought to be advanced in this Court. The appropriate course in the circumstances of this case, where most of the proposed grounds of appeal relate to fresh evidence, is for the question of delay to be addressed when dealing with the various grounds of appeal.
	


Overview of the facts


	
	In order to apprehend the nature of the proposed grounds of appeal against conviction, it is convenient to provide at the outset an overview of the nature of the Crown case. None of what follows in this section is controversial.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 19 July 2005, Tania alighted from a bus which had carried her part of the way home from school. It had been the first day of the third school term. She walked through the car park of the Forresters Beach Resort with a view to walking to her home a little distance beyond. On the way, she was attacked, and stabbed with what appears to have been a short bladed knife. The knife was never found.
	
	
	The forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy confirmed that the deceased had suffered multiple stab wounds to the head, neck, arms, legs, chest and back. There were some 48 sharp force injuries. His evidence was that the injuries were widely spread and indicated “significant relative movement between the victim and assailant for at least part of the assault”. One wound penetrated the wall of the right ventricle and passed into the ventricular septum. The pathologist gave evidence that, although it was quite difficult to assess how long those injuries would take to lead to cardiac standstill, he expected “a total survival time of 17 to 20 or maybe 30 minutes” because, despite their large number, all of the injuries were in fact relatively shallow, with no major blood vessels or major deep structures involved, apart from the heart. In cross-examination, he said:
	


“I would expect her at least to remain certainly conscious, because there was no evidence of any significant head injury; scalp lacerations and incisions certainly, but no brain injury. So I’d expect her to remain conscious right until the time that there was sufficient blood loss and sufficient embarrassment of the heart’s action because of its failing nature, because of the heart problem, that she would then develop some clouding of consciousness and then gradually become unconscious.”


	
	DL was arrested, at his home, because, as she lay dying, witnesses had reported the victim to have said “[D], Year 10, Erina High” (indicating DL’s – relatively uncommon – given name). When the police arrived at DL’s house, DL was seen opening the rear sliding door of the house reasonably quickly and running out towards the side gate. He was arrested as he sought to leave. DL’s left hand was bandaged in a clean dressing and had been stitched. Police seized a hooded jumper and some blue shorts from the floor of one of the bedrooms, and noticed red coloured smears on the door of the bathroom and on the white coloured vanity. An officer took photographs of the clothes in the bedroom, and the red coloured smears on the floor of the bathroom.
	
	
	Blood from the hooded jumper was subjected to DNA analysis and identified as being consistent with originating from both DL and the deceased.
	
	
	One of the witnesses, Ms Audley, heard a noise from her holiday accommodation and saw a person stabbing the deceased. She said that the deceased was “lying on her back with her head near the stairs, and he was sitting on top of her stomach. So he had a leg on each side and he was stabbing her with his right hand.” That witness said that the boy she saw was probably around 15 or 16, in a white polo shirt with grey board shorts and a blue baseball hat. That description did not match the deceased, and the witness failed to identify his photograph from amongst twenty photographs of young males nine days later. Other witnesses joined Ms Audley at the scene, waiting for an ambulance to arrive, and heard Tania’s dying declarations.
	
	
	Three witnesses gave evidence of seeing DL soon after the murder and before he was arrested. Ms Butcher, who lived nearby, gave him a tea towel to wrap around his bleeding hand. He told her that he fell over a rock and fell on something. DL’s mother said that he told her that he cut his hand on some rose bushes. She and her son went to a doctor. The doctor said that DL told him that he had cut his hand on some barbed wire. At no time did the jury hear evidence of any account by DL that he sought to prevent some other assailant from striking the victim. DL did not give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	None of those matters was specifically subject to any of the grounds of appeal. In addition to the foregoing, the Crown had also relied at trial upon expert evidence from Det Sgt Moon as to the nature of the blood spatters on DL’s clothes. This was one of seven aspects of the Crown case summarised by the trial judge when summing up. Much of the appeal was directed to blood spatter evidence, both its content, and the way in which it came to be adduced.
	


The way in which Det Sgt Moon’s evidence came to be adduced


	
	Ground 1(a) was that:
	


“The very late service of Det Sgt Moon’s report and documents concerning experiments conducted by him and the trial judge’s rulings pertaining to these matters caused irremediable procedural unfairness in the applicant’s trial.”


	
	Within that ground is a complex procedural history, which was not always precisely delineated during the course of submissions.
	


(a) The late service of Det Sgt Moon’s report


	
	In order to assess the significance of the times at which Det Sgt Moon’s report was served and experiments performed, it is necessary to summarise the course of the trial. DL’s trial commenced on 4 March 2008 with a lengthy voir dire. The jury was empanelled on Monday 10 March 2008 and the trial ran for the balance of that week. On 17 March 2008, expert DNA evidence was given, including evidence that drops of blood behind the right shoulder of DL’s sweatshirt were found to match the profile of the deceased.
	
	
	There followed a further voir dire in relation to Det Sgt Moon’s evidence lasting until Thursday 20 March. Good Friday was 21 March, and the trial resumed on Tuesday 25 March. The Crown addressed on 26 March, the defence on that afternoon and the following day, the judge summed up and the jury returned with a guilty verdict on the afternoon of 27 March.
	
	
	At all times it had been clear that the Crown would rely upon, and the defence would have to deal with, expert evidence as to the blood stains on DL’s sloppy joe and pants. Originally, it was planned to adduce evidence from another officer, Sgt Gibbs. Det Sgt Moon gave evidence on a voir dire that in early March 2008 he had received a brief, following Sgt Gibbs being taken ill. At that stage he was on holidays and did not return to work until the third week of March. He said that “from Friday through to the weekend, I had completed the report that’s now [been provided]”. There was a dispute at trial as to the extent to which Det Sgt Moon’s report went beyond Sgt Gibbs’ report. The report from Sgt Gibbs was not in evidence in proceedings before this Court.
	
	
	During the voir dire, on 17 March 2008, Det Sgt Moon was invited to consider what was advanced as the “defence scenario”, which was that DL confronted the assailant, while the latter was covered in blood and holding a knife that was dripping with blood, whereupon the assailant turned and attacked DL, slashing at him on more than one occasion, and inflicting a fairly deep cut to his hand. Det Sgt Moon gave a deal of evidence to the effect that much of what he observed was inconsistent with that scenario. During the course of that explanation, Det Sgt Moon was asked to assume that the blood on the shorts was “predominantly the accused’s blood”. Det Sgt Moon made it clear that he had not seen the analyst’s report, and it seems clear that he had proceeded in preparing his report on the basis that all of the blood was that of the victim.
	
	
	The difference between the reports prepared by Sgt Gibbs and Det Sgt Moon is a matter of speculation. Although the latter was tendered on the voir dire and therefore in the materials before this Court, the former was not. However, it was clear that the defence had, at some stage prior to the trial, engaged an expert of its own, Professor Hilton, to address the blood pattern evidence.
	
	
	On Tuesday 18 March 2008, the primary judge put to counsel for DL:
	


“It doesn’t seem to me that the nature of the Crown case has changed or the nature of this aspect of it. Rather, you are being presented with a bit more evidence, on the same area, than you had expected.”


	
	The primary judge addressed the possibility that the defence would be unable to respond to the new evidence after indicating that an adjournment until the following Tuesday would be accommodated before Det Sgt Moon was called. His Honour said:
	


“I think also that if you are going to mount a claim that an adjournment until next Tuesday is not sufficient, for whatever reason, you ought to make that claim supported by evidence. If Professor Hilton says, no, it’s all beyond me, I think there ought to be evidence to that effect from Professor Hilton and perhaps evidence of what other steps you are taking.”


	
	His Honour then addressed the possibilities with the Crown:
	


“Madam Crown, I think you have to accept the possibility still that I may take the view that Mr Moon’s evidence should be excluded. If the defence, for argument’s sake, can’t find an expert in Australia to deal with it then you’ve got problems. Clearly if the evidence was only that of Mr Gibbs the defence has had time to prepare for it. The problem has arisen because Moon has gone appreciably further than Gibbs.”


	
	The Crown maintained that Det Sgt Moon had not gone much further than Sgt Gibbs. As noted above, it is not possible to express a view whether that was or was not so. The trial was adjourned until the following day.
	
	
	On the following day, counsel for DL advised the court in the absence of the jury as follows:
	


“The situation is that having had the opportunity to more fully consider Sgt Moon’s statement and in light of the evidence that he has previously given Professor Hilton feels confident that he can answer that evidence, and indeed he anticipates that his answer to that evidence will not differ from the opinion he previously expressed to us.”


	
	Counsel went on to say that he expected that a further report would be able to be prepared by the following Tuesday.
	
	
	Those matters refute the submission that there was any – let alone any irremediable – procedural unfairness in relation to reliance upon the 17 March 2008 report of itself. It is also plain that the trial judge was acutely aware of the potential prejudice which the late service of expert evidence could cause to the applicant, and was conscious of the need to ensure that the applicant could meet it.
	
	
	Following the voir dire, the primary judge held that Det Sgt Moon was qualified to give most of the evidence in his 17 March 2008 report, with some exceptions. Immediately before indicating that view, his Honour said that “I will hear Mr Hogan on that if he wants to”. After dealing with the various paragraphs which his Honour rejected (and after hearing further argument from the Crown in support of those paragraphs, which his Honour rejected), the primary judge returned to the defence:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Mr Hogan, do you want to quibble, or I shouldn’t use that term, do you want to challenge any of the rulings or indications I have made in favour of the Crown this afternoon?

HOGAN: No. I think that the objective observations he is entitled to give evidence of. The conclusions as to proximity to an impact site with a surface covered in blood, he’s entitled to give that evidence and I suppose it might be of assistance before he gives his evidence for an agreed version of that concluding paragraph to be prepared because as it stands I don’t know that I am even inclined to cross-examine him.”


	
	Defence counsel confirmed that he did not need to address any further. That occurred at the conclusion of the hearing on 20 March 2008.
	


(b) Det Sgt Moon’s experiments over Easter


	
	However, after the voir dire, there were further developments which were central to the balance of this proposed ground of appeal.
	
	
	First, after being confronted with the “defence scenario” during the voir dire, Det Sgt Moon performed a series of experiments on Easter Sunday, 23 March 2008, resulting in 34 photographs accompanied by a brief description. These were given a great deal of attention during the hearing of the appeal, notwithstanding that at no stage did they ever go before the jury. It is not necessary to summarise them in any detail. Essentially, using a plastic dummy and an inflatable ball, some clothes and some pig skin, a deal of blood was placed on the dummy which was repeatedly struck, with a view to determining how much blood was transferred onto the assailant’s hand. Further experiments were done mimicking a stabbing motion to determine whether blood from the hand and forearm could be transferred to a nearby vertical surface. There was a deal of criticism in this Court as to the methodology adopted by Det Sgt Moon, much of which he accepted, although noting the impossibility of conducting any experiment which could truly replicate the effect of knife blows into a living human body.
	
	
	The significance of the evidence was not that it went before the jury, but because it was disclosed to the defence and affected the decisions made by the defence in relation to Det Sgt Moon.
	


(c) The Crown discloses Det Sgt Moon’s experiments


	
	When the trial resumed after Easter on 25 March 2008, the Crown advised (in the absence of the jury) that Det Sgt Moon had performed those additional experiments over the Easter break. The Crown’s stance was as follows:
	


“The Crown would submit that it’s entitled to call evidence about that defence-suggested scenario if the defence wish to persist with calling evidence to that effect. Of course it’s not something that the Crown could have prepared before the trial because it was never put by the accused or by his representatives that that was what was going to be the suggested explanation for the evidence.”


	
	The Crown confirmed that if Professor Hilton gave evidence that the spatter pattern was as consistent with the defence hypothesis as the Crown’s hypothesis, then it would seek to call that evidence in reply. And the prosecutor added “of course I’m putting the defence on notice that if Detective Sergeant Moon is asked whether he has performed the experiments relative to the defence hypothesis, he will now answer it in the affirmative, and that evidence will be there.”
	
	
	Defence counsel’s immediate response was that the proposition did not give rise to any problem:
	


“HOGAN: If my friend doesn’t propose to lead any evidence about that experimentation in chief and is simply doing a courtesy of putting me on notice that that has occurred over the weekend, I’ll take that into account in determining what cross-examination I have of Officer Moon and whether or not I call any evidence to that in my own case. That’s not problematic.”


	
	However, presumably as the consequences of what had occurred were appreciated, defence counsel went on to say that if the Crown proposed to lead evidence about the recent experiments in chief, then it would be necessary to supply a report setting out the details of the experimentation, how it was undertaken and exactly what had been undertaken.
	
	
	It appears, however, shortly thereafter, that defence counsel appreciated the difficulty in which he was placed. He said – and there is force in this – that:
	


“It makes it impossible for me, I suppose, to make an informed decision whether or not I call evidence in my case and whether or not I cross-examine the witness about an alternative hypothesis, without me having any of the details of the experimentation that was undertaken”.


	
	At this stage, a further difficulty arose. It was that Professor Hilton’s train had been cancelled and he was not able to attend court until 11:30 that morning. The court adjourned.
	


(d) The trial judge’s ruling on Det Sgt Moon’s further evidence


	
	After the mid-morning adjournment, defence counsel advised that Professor Hilton had arrived “in the last ten minutes or so” and they had had an opportunity to look at the photographs and the four page description of what they depict. Counsel applied for a further voir dire, because it was his application that the evidence ought to be excluded. The primary judge was sympathetic to that application. His Honour said “I don’t see a problem with excluding the evidence-in-chief because I think the Crown should have had this prepared at an earlier stage.”
	
	
	For that reason, no voir dire was necessary. His Honour then added the following:
	


“HIS HONOUR: … How you cross-examine is a matter for you. You’re on fair notice of some answers you would like to get if you raise a particular topic.

If you don’t cross-examine on the topic along the lines you did on the voir dire, I would see a difficulty in your calling Professor Hilton to give evidence along lines which you have not put to the Crown’s expert.

Although I’m not making a final decision, I see considerable difficulties in saying: Well, if you choose not to do it in chief to the Crown’s witness but call evidence yourself, then the Crown ought to be allowed a case in reply. But of course that question only arises after (A) your cross-examination of Sergeant Moon in the Crown’s case in chief and (B) your own case if there is one.

Now, I can quite understand that you may wish, before you make a decision concerning your cross-examination, to have Professor Hilton look at this material but I’m not sure that you need a voir dire hearing at this stage.

HOGAN: If the Crown doesn’t seek to lead evidence-in-chief then with respect I agree with your Honour, that I have to just make the decision – a forensic decision based on the consequences of pursuing one course of action or another. It’s a difficult position to be put in at this very late stage of the trial, to be constantly met with fresh evidence, whether or not the Crown seeks to lead it in chief.

If the position is that the Crown is not going to seek any evidence from Detective Moon in relation to these experiments, then there’s no need, as your Honour says, to conduct a voir dire about it.”


	
	A further short adjournment was granted. It was plain that at the forefront of the considerations being balanced by the primary judge was the fact that it was clear that both prosecutor and defence ought to have known at an early stage that the accused’s clothing had a deal of blood on it, including the blood of the deceased.
	
	
	The primary judge confirmed that, subject to the rulings already made excluding part of Det Sgt Moon’s statement, his evidence in chief was to be limited to the subject of the contents of his statement.
	
	
	At 12:05pm, Det Sgt Moon was called and gave oral evidence in chief which, for the most part, adhered precisely to the paragraphs of his report dated 14 March 2008 which had not been excluded by the primary judge. His evidence seems to have lasted for around 60 minutes. There was no cross-examination by defence counsel. Not only was the “defence scenario” not put to the expert, but also there was no challenge to call into question the assumptions or methodology or conclusions which he had expressed.
	


The content of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence and its deficiencies


	
	The most efficient approach is to summarise aspects of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence in some detail and at the same time to indicate the criticisms advanced of it, eight years later, on behalf of DL and with the benefit of Dr Reynolds’ report, and advances in forensic science in the intervening period.
	
	
	First, when giving his qualifications, which included being a member of the New South Wales Police Service for 21 years and performing duties in the Crime Scene section for 14 years, Det Sgt Moon said “I have completed an advanced course in bloodstain pattern interpretation delivered by the National Institute of Forensic Science in 2004”. DL was critical of his use of the word “advanced”.
	
	
	Secondly, DL was critical of the failure by Det Sgt Moon to identify the assumptions on which his opinions were based, and the qualifications to which they were subject.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown tendered the hooded jacket and blue shorts taken from DL after his arrest. Det Sgt Moon said that:
	


“The jacket was manufactured from a polyester/cotton mix and involved a tight weave. Due to the type of fabric used a small amount of distortion of bloodstain patterns on the garment could occur.

Q. Thank you. You say that because there’s some literature to that effect that you have consulted, is that right?

A. Yes, that’s correct.”


	
	DL was critical of his description of the jacket involving a “tight weave” and that only a “small amount” of distortion could occur. Dr Reynolds and Det Sgt Moon agreed in this Court that it was a “knit” rather than a “tight weave” and that “unless the specific composition of a garment is known then no estimation of bloodstain distortion is possible”. (Exhibit D, par 23.)
	
	
	Fourthly, Det Sgt Moon made it clear in his report that the literature was a paper by Joseph Slemko, “Bloodstains on fabric: the effects of droplet velocity and fabric composition”, a presentation to the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, Houston, Texas, November 9, 1999. DL was critical of Det Sgt Moon’s reliance on that publication. Dr Reynolds said that in 2003, the IABPA newsletter was not a recognised peer review scientific journal, that the actual research from 1999 was dated, that the article contained a number of factual inaccuracies and errors, and that the research lacked scientific robustness due to poor experimental design. Dr Reynolds further said that Dr Slemko had himself recommended against the use of bloodstain directionality indicators on fabrics and had also cautioned against using bloodstain size as an indicator of distance from source.
	
	
	Fifthly, after testifying that he was examining the items and giving evidence because Sgt Gibbs had gone on sick leave and was unable to attend court, Det Sgt Moon expressed a series of opinions based on the size, distribution and shape of bloodstains, as follows:
	



	
	The opinions distinguished “projected blood”, “cast-off blood” and “transferred blood”.
	
	
	Projected blood was described as relating to “an impact with force into a bloodstained item causing blood to dispel from that blood source”. There was then the following exchange:
	


“Q. So, blood moves from the blood source onto the garment?

A. As a result of force being applied to the blood source or impact site.

HIS HONOUR: Basically the splash?

A. Basically the splash, yes, that’s correct.”

There was criticism of the affirmative response being given to the trial judge’s question.


	
	Cast-off blood was described as “where blood is on an item, the item could be a weapon, could be any item, and as the item is moved blood is expelled from that item which caused cast-off.”
	
	
	Det Sgt Moon gave evidence that some of the bloodstains on the clothing were consistent with being projected blood or cast-off, but that evidence was premised on his assumption that all of the bloodstains were blood of the deceased, rather than blood of DL.
	
	
	Det Sgt Moon also gave evidence about “directionality”, being a reference to expressions of opinion about the direction from which blood leaving a stain on the clothing had come from. He gave the following evidence by way of explanation:
	


“If we have a circular bloodstain we can say that that has been projected off at 90 degrees from the source. As that moves away, the angle changes, the blood becomes more elongated so the longer axis shows directionality of the bloodstain.”

Det Sgt Moon agreed in this Court that, taking into account the fact that there were two sources of blood, the analysis of directionality needed to be reconsidered. Det Sgt Moon gave evidence as to directionality, all of which he accepted required to be reconsidered in relation to bloodstains on the right cuff of the jacket (photographs 8 and 10), photographs 13-17 on the outer and inner cuff area of the left sleeve, photographs 3-5 on the front left leg of the shorts, photograph 8 on the front right leg of the shorts and photographs 15 and 16 of the left leg of the shorts.


	
	In relation to photographs 13 and 14 on the bottom of the left sleeve, Det Sgt Moon said:
	


“These stains were consistent with the garment coming into contact with a bloodstained item causing a transfer pattern. Some of these stains showed characteristics of smearing.”

Det Sgt Moon said in this Court that “the terminology ‘smearing’ is now referred to as either a ‘swipe pattern’ or a ‘wipe pattern’”.


	
	At the conclusion of his evidence, Det Sgt Moon gave some opinions derived from the entirety of his examination of the clothing. The opinions included that:
	



	
	it could be concluded that multiple events had occurred;
	
	
	multiple areas on both clothing items had come into contact with bloodstained items causing numerous transfer patterns;
	
	
	the large amount of fine projected blood spatters on the inner portion of the left sleeve indicated that this portion of the garment was in close proximity to the event, and the distribution and directionality of the spatter indicated that the blood deposit involved multiple contacts;
	
	
	the large amount of transferred blood in and around the cuffs and in the right pocket of the shorts indicated that both hands of the person wearing the garments were heavily bloodstained; and
	
	
	the position of blood spatter on the rear right side of the jacket was located and distributed in a linear corridor indicating that the source of the blood was cast-off blood as a result of blood being released or thrown from a moving bloodstained object.
	



	
	It is convenient to note that, in relation to the rear portion of the jacket, located behind the right shoulder, where blood with a profile consistent with that of the deceased was found, Det Sgt Moon gave the following evidence:
	


“There were numerous bloodstains located on the rear portion of the jacket. There was a combination of different types of bloodstain patterns. There were a number of blood spatters located on the rear portion of the right shoulder as indicated by photographs 20 of 22 and 21 of 22. Two further blood spatters were located further down the lower right side of the jacket. These marks were highlighted with red marker pen, marked by the DNA biologist. The position of these stains and the distribution in a linear corridor indicated the source of the blood is consistent with cast-off blood.”

This evidence was accepted by Dr Reynolds in 2016, who said:

“These small bloodstains are of a size, shape, distribution and location such that they are likely a result of deposition by cast-off mechanism. [Tania] is the likely contributor of these bloodstains. In the limited instructions provided to this author regarding the appellant’s versions of events it is difficult to reconcile the presence of these bloodstains with that version.”


	
	The Crown case closed shortly thereafter. There followed some short character evidence in the defence case that afternoon, and on the following day, 26 March 2008, the defence case closed. There was no case in reply.
	
	
	Counsel addressed for the whole of that day. No objection was taken at the time to a number of aspects of the Crown’s address, of which complaint was made on appeal. The defence address had not completed by the end of the day. On the following day, in the absence of the jury, the Crown pointed out that there had been an inaccurate summary of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence, which counsel for the defence corrected at the outset, as follows:
	


“Ladies and gentlemen, before I continue, there are two matters that I want to correct from what I put to you yesterday. … I put it to you that the stain on the right shoulder was something that [Det Sgt Moon] had described as a contact stain. In fact I’ll read you what his evidence was in relation to that particular part of the sweatshirt. Your Honour, this is on page 607 at about line 12:

‘There were a number of blood spatters located on the rear portion of the right shoulder as indicated by photographs 20 of 22 and 21 of 22. Two further blood spatters were located further down the right side of the jacket. These marks were highlighted with red marker pen, marked by the DNA biologist. The position of these stains and the distribution in a linear corridor indicate that the source of the blood is consistent with cast-off blood.’

So to the extent that I suggested his analysis of that particular stain was that it was a transfer pattern, it’s part of a group of stains apparently, which indicates are consistent with cast-off blood.

However, the more general propositions that I’ve put to you still apply. Of those number of stains, however many it is, there’s only one on which there’s been any DNA analysis undertaken. And I think I also put to you in passing that as a common sense proposition, cast-off in the way the Crown indicated, is something going over the shoulder, you might think is equally explicable by motion downwards from behind the person wearing the jacket.

So I correct what I put to you yesterday, but can I make this submission to you, that really it doesn’t make any great difference. That’s of course a matter for you.”


	
	The force of the deficiencies in Det Sgt Moon’s evidence is best addressed in light of the fresh evidence adduced in this Court in support of ground 3.
	


Fresh evidence on appeal

Ground 3


	
	Proposed ground 3 is:
	


“There has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the applicant on account of evidence that is now available to the applicant and which is fresh evidence and/or evidence undisclosed at the trial.”


	
	There was a significant dispute in this Court as to the admissibility of parts of the evidence of Det Sgt Moon, and on the question of the extent to which DL was seeking to rely on evidence which was fresh. The lines of that dispute were drawn prior to Det Sgt Moon and Dr Reynolds reaching agreement following the expert conclave between the men on the first day of the hearing of the appeal. Because it is possible to resolve this ground favourably to DL without addressing that dispute, it may be passed over.
	
	
	At the commencement of the hearing, Det Sgt Moon and Dr Reynolds were directed to participate in an expert conclave. The result was Exhibit D, which conveniently recorded a large number of deficiencies in Det Sgt Moon’s evidence at trial. The extent of the concessions made by Det Sgt Moon may be seen from the following extracts:
	


“1. Do the witnesses agree that the entirety of G Moon's evidence before the jury was on the basis that there was only one source of blood for the BPA on the clothing, namely the deceased? Agreed.

…

3.   Do the witnesses agree that the evidence that G Moon gave before the jury on directionality, angle of impact and perpendicularity needs to be withdrawn as the evidence was misleading? Yes already conceded except for the spatter pattern on the inside of the Sloppy Joe left sleeve.

…

7.   Do the witnesses agree that both cast off and discrete transfer can produce small stains on a worn (3D) clothing surface that is in motion at the time of deposit? Yes and in some instances you may not be able to distinguish between them.

8.   Was the only experience that G Moon had in relation to BPA on worn (3D) clothing in motion the experiments that he conducted over the Easter long weekend during the trial? It was the first set of experiments conducted in relation to 3D clothing examination however Moon was unable to recall to what extent clothing worn on people was addressed in training that he had previously undertaken.

…

10. Since the time of the trial in 2008 have there been significant developments in the area of Blood Pattern Analysis ('BPA') as it relates to the analysis of bloodstains on clothing? Agreed and also refer previous responses given by both witnesses dated 7th November 2016.

11.   Do these developments encompass a greater understanding of the difficulty in drawing conclusions from bloodstains on clothing that were being worn by a person or persons who at the relevant time were moving? Agreed.

12.   Is it now understood that blood stain directionality theory cannot be undertaken for curved surfaces or surfaces in motion at the time of blood deposition. It has only been validated for smooth, static, non-porous surfaces? In instances where there are individual or few bloodstains present then directionality features should not be relied upon however where complete patterns are present then directionality indicators can in some instance be relied upon.

13.   Is a consequence of these developments that the evidence given by Det Sgt Moon at the trial regarding: directionality, angle of impact and perpendicularity of various blood stains is retracted? Yes already conceded except for the spatter pattern on the inside of the Sloppy Joe left sleeve.

…

15.   In light of the further testing done on the blue Mango brand board shorts, was the evidence given in relation to the “holistic” BPA analysis given by Det Sgt Moon before the jury now unable to be maintained? Agreed.

16.   Can blood stain size stand alone criteria to separate spattered blood from cast off or from transferred blood? Was Det Sgt Moon's evidence at trial on this issue incorrect? Agreed with caveat: In instances where stains are few and no overall and obvious pattern features exist it may be impossible to distinguish between the three using size alone. Moon's evidence was not strictly incorrect it is better described as being incomplete.

17.   Is size of the blood stain alone enough to categorise a blood stain as ‘projected blood’ as that term was used in 2008? Projected blood in 2008 now refers to spatter and as such the answer is NO.

…

22. The blue mango shorts were adsorbent not absorbent? Agreed

23. The fabric of the sloppy joe is a ‘knit’ and not a ‘tight weave’? The composition may result in significant distortions to the blood stain on the sloppy joe? Agreed re Knit v Weave component. Unless the specific composition of a garment is known then no estimation of bloodstain distortion is possible.”


	
	The consequence of that agreement means that there were highly material errors in the evidence of the last Crown witness, given without challenge, on the day before the case closed. There is no occasion for any lengthy analysis of the materiality of the evidence before the jury. This is a very clear case. The whole of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence insofar as it was based on directionality, angle of impact, perpendicularity, or the assumption that there was a single source of blood, was not soundly based.
	


Conclusions on grounds 1(a) and 3


	
	It is plain that to the extent that the conviction was in part based upon the evidence of Det Sgt Moon, it cannot safely be maintained, in light of what this Court now knows of the deficiencies in that evidence. There should be the requisite extension of time and grant of leave in respect of ground 3. Ground 3 is made out.
	
	
	There is also force in part of the complaint that the defence was unable fully to cross-examine Det Sgt Moon by reason of the experiments he had done over Easter. That said, ultimately the issue which arises on a ground such as this was framed by Gleeson CJ:
	


“Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice”: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1; [2003] HCA 6 at [37].


	
	In this respect, there were significant deficiencies in the case advanced by DL in this Court. What was the evidence which Professor Hilton could have given? Why was he not called? Why was there no cross-examination at all of Det Sgt Moon? Was there a forensic decision to take that course so as to minimise the impact of his evidence before the jury?
	
	
	Given the extraordinary efforts which have been directed to obtaining fresh evidence on these issues, and the length of time that has elapsed, it is curious that none of those matters were established by evidence.
	
	
	This is also a ground where r 4 is of importance. As already noted, the trial judge made it quite plain that if there were evidence that the defence could not respond to in Det Sgt Moon’s initial report, he would not permit the Crown to rely upon it. Defence counsel unequivocally advised the Court that he was able to deal with the evidence. The question then becomes quite a fine one: was there sufficient procedural unfairness flowing from the further experiments undertaken by Det Sgt Moon such as to give rise to an unfair trial.
	
	
	However, notwithstanding those matters, we have concluded that the significance of the concessions made in this Court by Det Sgt Moon is such as to warrant an extension of time and the grant of leave in respect of ground 1(a). We cannot exclude the reasonable possibility, which was indeed raised by counsel in 2008, that he was placed in an unfair position in relation to Det Sgt Moon’s experiments over Easter which materially affected the decision not to cross-examine or adduce evidence. This ground is made out.
	


The other proposed grounds of appeal

Grounds 1(b) and (c)


	
	Grounds 1(b) and (c) are that:
	


“(b) Det Sgt Moon’s evidence should have been excluded under s 76(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), Det Sgt Moon’s evidence not falling within the exception in s 79(1) of the Evidence Act.

(c) The admission of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence caused the applicant’s trial to miscarry by reason of the limited (if any) basis for assumptions made by Det Sgt Moon, the failure to adhere to or express the limitations of his evidence and the consequent misleading nature of the evidence.”


	
	In light of the conclusions on grounds 1(a) and 3, nothing turns on these proposed grounds. It is appropriate therefore to address them concisely.
	
	
	Paragraphs 121-158 of DL’s written submissions in chief contend that the entirety of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence should have been excluded. It is now said that (a) at the time of trial, “there was no validated science for the interpretation of blood staining on fabric worn by a person where two (or more) people were moving relative to each other and both bleeding at the time that blood stains were deposited”, and (b) that even if there were, Det Sgt Moon did not have the relevant expertise. The submissions develop the latter point at length substantially by reference to the evidence given by Det Sgt Moon on the voir dire.
	
	
	Ground 1(b) is not made out. Coincidentally, Det Sgt Moon had been lectured by Dr Reynolds on blood spatter analysis. It is true that there have been developments in three dimensional modelling of blood spattering in recent years. However, it is going too far to say that it was inadmissible to express opinions on the subject in 2008. This is not a case where opinion evidence which was inadmissible in 2008 has become admissible in 2016. It is a case no different from many others where it has been demonstrated in 2016 that the opinions given in 2008 were incorrect and required qualification. There is greater force in the challenge to the opinions of Det Sgt Moon in relation to his experiments over Easter, but nothing relevantly turns on this, because those opinions were not before the jury.
	
	
	Ground 1(c) in very large measure covers some of the same ground as ground 3. The evidence in this Court confirms that much of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence was misleading or incorrect. It is not necessary to say anything more.
	
	
	Leave to appeal on these grounds should be refused.
	


Ground 2 – the Crown’s closing address


	
	This ground is in a different category from the remainder. In very large measure, it is independent of the blood spatter evidence.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor addressed on 26 March 2008, finishing before the luncheon adjournment. No complaint was made about any aspect of her address at the time. Ground 2 of the appeal was that the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address caused the applicant’s trial to miscarry. It was common ground that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules did not apply in terms to complaints about the address which had not been raised before the primary judge, but that the rule did apply insofar as there was a failure to seek curative directions from the trial judge at the time.
	
	
	Paragraphs 183-196 of DL’s written submissions developed this proposed ground of appeal. Complaint was made of the following aspects of the address.
	
	
	First, it was said that by asking rhetorical questions in closing address, the prosecutor reversed the onus of proof by calling for an explanation from DL, in accordance with what had been said in Wood v R (2012) 84 NSWLR 581; [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [605]-[606]. By way of illustration, DL relied upon:
	


“If the accused was not the killer why didn’t he get help? If he had the motivation to step in and be the good samaritan he expects you to believe he was why didn’t he get help at reception? At the shops? From passing cars from Entrance Road? Anywhere? Bianca Butcher, his mother?”

and:

“Ladies and gentlemen, if the accused was not the killer … why wasn’t he motivated to go and get help, to scream out, to knock on doors?”


	
	Secondly, DL pointed to the words “what a coincidence then that the real killer, if it’s not the accused, is also the same age as the accused”, saying that this was designed to bolster this part of the evidence of Ms Audley, notwithstanding that on the prosecution case, her identification of him was unreliable.
	
	
	Thirdly, it was said that emphasising the fact that Ms Audley’s identification as to age and hair accorded with DL, although what she had said in other respects (such as his white shirt and his bicycle which were, on the Crown case, incorrect) was said to be contrary to the prosecutor’s obligation of fairness.
	
	
	Fourthly, the prosecutor relied upon the evidence of the bloodstains on the clothing, the DNA of the deceased from those bloodstains, and the dying declarations as being “without more” sufficient to find guilt beyond reasonable doubt; it was said by the prosecutor that these were “simple, undeniable facts”. DL complained that those submissions were not fairly made, given the necessary assumptions in the Crown case about the pattern of the bloodstains and the weaknesses in Det Sgt Moon’s evidence.
	
	
	Fifthly, DL complained about two “demonstrations” given by the prosecutor before the jury, labelled in the written submissions as “demonstration 1” and “demonstration 2” which were said not to permit the fact that the deceased was moving, despite that being the Crown case. It was also said that the demonstrations were “likely to arouse prejudice and emotion in the jury by their graphic nature”. It was said that the nature of the demonstrations was to be inferred by a demonstration which Det Sgt Moon had given on the voir dire.
	
	
	Sixthly, it was said that the prosecutor wrongly invited speculation by the jury as to the deceased’s DNA being present in more bloodstains than had been tested (“who knows how many more locations you might think?”). Further, it was said that the prosecutor had misstated the evidence as to the DNA on a fence post at the commencement of the address when stating that only the profiles of the deceased and DL were present, contrary to the fact. Although the prosecutor subsequently and correctly referred the jury to the forensic evidence that could not exclude the possibility of a third profile, complaint was made of the fact that the prosecutor did not in terms correct what she had said earlier in the morning.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that to the extent that grounds 1(a), (b) or (c) are upheld, then the foundations for the prosecutor’s address insofar as it was based upon the evidence of Det Sgt Moon were taken away.
	
	
	Nothing is added by the submission that the Crown accurately addressed the jury on blood spatter evidence which has subsequently been shown to be misleading or incorrect. That final aspect of the submission may be put to one side immediately.
	
	
	All other aspects of this proposed ground are matters which are independent of the fresh expert evidence which has delayed the hearing and determination of this appeal by years. In addition to requiring a substantial extension of time, rule 4 applies.
	
	
	Even so, we address each aspect of the ground on its merits in turn.
	
	
	As to the first, DL’s written submissions selectively quote the rhetorical questions of which complaint was made. The passages need to be evaluated in their context. The entirety of this aspect of the Crown prosecutor’s submission was as follows:
	


“If the accused was not the killer why didn’t he get help? If he had the motivation to step in and be the good samaritan that he expects you to believe he was why didn’t get help at reception? At the shops? From passing cars from Entrance Road? Anywhere? Bianca Butcher, his mother? The only person that he cared to get help for was himself. He [went] and got a band aid from Bianca Butcher. What did he say to her? That he fell over a rock and fell on something.

Ladies and gentlemen, if the accused was not the killer but a good samaritan motivated enough to get in close enough to be stabbed by the real killer, the same knife that killed Tania, why wasn’t he motivated to go and get help, to scream out, to knock on doors? It wasn’t as though he was so traumatised that he fell in a heap or he couldn’t speak. He hotfooted it to Bianca Butcher’s and he was able to make an account of himself to her but it was a false account you might ready, very readily conclude ladies and gentlemen.”


	
	Viewed in its context, it is clear that rather than reversing the onus of proof, the prosecutor was in that portion of her address highlighting the implausibility of a defence case consistent with innocence by exposing its inconsistency with what the Crown had demonstrated DL had in fact done later that afternoon. This is quite different from the circumstance in Wood v R, where the Crown Prosecutor gave the jury a series of 50 questions which were directed to the ultimate issue, whether the deceased in that case had committed suicide or had been thrown from a cliff.
	
	
	The difficulty with the second and third aspects of complaint on appeal, which turned on the reference to Ms Audley’s evidence, is of a similar nature. Once again, the written submissions have been selective in the passages extracted. Immediately after the Crown Prosecutor had pointed to Ms Audley’s recollection being consistent with DL’s age and hair, the Crown prosecutor – entirely fairly – added “she was reasonably certain of some clothing which was a white polo shirt and grey board shorts and blue baseball hat.” Further, the prosecutor then added that Ms Audley had made an incorrect identification at the time.
	
	
	As to the fourth, the proposition that the DNA of the deceased obtained from bloodstains on the clothing, and the dying declarations, were a sufficient proof of guilt, was not subsequently elaborated upon by DL at the hearing of the appeal. That, it may be inferred, is for good reason. There was and is no dispute that the deceased’s blood was found on DL’s clothing. There was and is no dispute that, as she died, the deceased identified “[D], Year 10, Erina High” (although there is, of course, a dispute as to the meaning to be attributed to those words).
	
	
	The thrust of the submissions was directed to Det Sgt Moon’s evidence of multiple blood events. It is far from clear that there was any material unfairness here, but in any event, there is nothing that goes beyond the matters addressed in grounds 1 and 3.
	
	
	In relation to the complaints about the “demonstrations”, it is clear from the transcript that, whatever gestures were made by the Crown Prosecutor during her closing address, they were brief. What precisely the Crown Prosecutor did is unknown. DL chose to adduce no testimonial evidence from any person who saw what the Crown Prosecutor did some eight and a half years ago, and no complaint describing what she did was made at the time. Perhaps the best indication of the limited weight to be given to this aspect of the address was the response by defence counsel that afternoon:
	


“You might also wonder how on the Crown’s version that he is stabbing with his right hand and holding Tania Burgess down with his left that he manages to cut his palm because it is his left hand that has the wound (indicated). The Crown did a demonstration. Obviously from where I was sitting I couldn’t see it but it just seems to be contrary to common sense that if that is what the Crown says was happening (indicated), that you can therefore sustain a cut across the inside of your palm (indicated).”


	
	There is simply no basis in the evidence in this Court to make any meaningful assessment of whether any prejudice or emotion was engendered by what the Crown Prosecutor did. Since defence counsel at trial raised no complaint about it, this Court is entitled to infer that he saw no difficulty with what was done.
	
	
	The submission that the prosecutor had replicated a demonstration given on the voir dire by Det Sgt Moon, which the judge had ruled against, on the basis that it was not a matter of expertise, is entirely speculative.
	
	
	To the extent that there was invited speculation about the deceased’s DNA being in more bloodstains than had been tested, there is some force in the criticism. What matters however is not the amount of blood, but that there was some blood unequivocally identified from the deceased’s DNA found on the clothing of DL.
	
	
	Likewise, it is difficult to accept that anything material could turn upon the difference between a mistake being made as to one aspect of the DNA evidence toward the beginning of the Crown address, which was subsequently correctly quoted, but without expressly stating that the earlier statement was an error, and the case where the error had been expressly acknowledged.
	
	
	It will be clear from the foregoing that this proposed ground seeks to advance quite minor criticisms of limited aspects of the Crown Prosecutor’s address. Some have been taken out of context. Some are not founded in the evidence, and amount to speculation in this Court. Some are minor in the extreme. No complaint was made at all at the time.
	
	
	It is trite that “the requirements of r 4 [of the Criminal Appeal Rules] do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside”: R v Germakian (2007) 70 NSWLR 467; [2007] NSWCCA 373 at [10]. The Court added at [13]:
	


“[L]eave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings: R v Tripodina (at 195) or as Mahoney JA said in R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported), at 7, followed in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360: ‘...unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level’.”


	
	We consider that except insofar as this ground overlaps with the complaints as to Det Sgt Moon’s evidence as to the bloodstains, in which case the submissions are addressed under those grounds, leave should be refused. No possibility of real injustice has been demonstrated in respect of the other matters of which complaint is made.
	


The proviso


	
	The fresh evidence and agreed position in this Court between Dr Reynolds and Det Sgt Moon means that the unchallenged evidence of the latter at trial was materially flawed. It would be a large step to say that it did not influence the jury: cf Castle v The Queen; Bucca v The Queen [2016] HCA 46; (2016) 91 ALJR 93 at [65]. Indeed, as one of the seven matters identified by the judge when summing up to the jury, it is necessary to proceed on the basis that it was material to the guilty verdict obtained. That was how, after all, it was advanced by the Crown and regarded by the trial judge.
	
	
	Further, as already noted, this Court should proceed, notwithstanding the gaps in the evidence presented in support, on the basis that there was material procedural unfairness in the way in which Det Sgt Moon’s evidence came to be presented. To be clear, by this is meant not the late service of the original report, but instead the experiments conducted over the Easter weekend leading to the threat of opinions unsupported by any expert report which would be exposed in the event of cross-examination or a Crown case in reply.
	
	
	Recognising those matters, at the forefront of the Crown submissions in this Court was reliance upon the proviso. This was not a case where, as sometimes occurs, the Crown had, as an unelaborated fall-back position, relied upon the proviso (contrast for example Mortada v R [2014] NSWCCA 36 at [156]). The approach adopted in this Court by the Crown was appropriate, and permitted a full exchange of submissions as to the applicability of the proviso.
	


(a) Applicable legal principles


	
	First, although expressed in permissive terms, “if the condition (the conclusion that no substantial injustice has actually occurred) is satisfied” the proviso must be applied: Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen (2012) 246 CLR 92; [2012] HCA 14 at [25]; Lindsay v The Queen (2015) 155 CLR 272; [2015] HCA 16 at [43]; Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at [15].
	
	
	Secondly, the task of this Court is to establish whether a “substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”: Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300; [2005] HCA 81 at [35]. In Filippou v The Queen at [15], French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ said that a substantial miscarriage of justice meant that the possibility could not be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him or her or that there was some other departure from a trial according to law that warrants that description.
	
	
	Thirdly, there are three limbs in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in relation to which the proviso may operate: (a) where the verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, (b) where there is a wrong decision on any question of law, and (c) where “on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. It is not suggested that this is a case in the first category, nor could it be having regard to the nature and strength of the Crown case. The grounds of appeal relate to the second and third limbs. In Filippou at [15], French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ said that:
	


“[E]ven where error of the kind identified in any of the three limbs is established and amounts to a miscarriage of justice, the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the error has not been productive of a substantial miscarriage of justice. ... [W]here the second limb applies, the circumstances in some cases may be such that, despite the judge making ‘the wrong decision of [a] question of law’, the Court of Criminal Appeal is persuaded that the error could not have deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her. In that case the proviso will operate. Where the third limb is engaged, if the Court of Criminal Appeal has concluded that the appellant has not received a fair trial it will follow that it has concluded that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. But where, despite some other identified irregularity, the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has received a fair trial according to law and not otherwise been deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her, once again the proviso will operate.”


	
	Fourthly, there is the “negative proposition” identified in Weiss at [44]:
	


“It cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused’s guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.”


	
	Fifthly, even where the properly admitted evidence proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt, there remain cases where the proviso is inapplicable. This was what was emphasised in Baiada Poultry at [29] and in Castle at [64] (the position is different elsewhere: see Lundy v The Queen (New Zealand) [2013] UKPC 28 at [160]-[161] and Stafford v The State [1999] 1 WLR 2026 at 2029). Hence Bathurst CJ, with the agreement of Hidden and Button JJ, said in Giourtalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 216 at [84] that:
	


“it is a necessary but not always a sufficient pre-condition for the operation of the proviso that the appellate court be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the accused.”


	
	In Weiss at [45] the Court identified cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness as possibly providing examples. In Cesan v The Queen (2008) 236 CLR 358; [2008] HCA 52 at [89], French CJ identified a trial process which was “flawed in a fundamental respect” as falling into that category. In Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614, Gleeson CJ explained that there may be some instances where a defect in process was of such nature that its effect could not be overcome by pointing to the strength of the prosecution case. His Honour gave as an example a case where the failure of process deprived the appellate court of the capacity justly to assess the strength of the case against the appellant.
	
	
	There has been some debate as to the extent to which Filippou marked a change in construction of the proviso: see notably Petersen v State of Western Australia (2016) 50 WAR 45; [2016] WASCA 66 at [18]-[20] and note Castle at [80] (Gageler J). It is unnecessary to outline, let alone evaluate, that debate in this judgment. That is because on any view of the proviso, it is applicable to this conviction for murder.
	


(b) The strength of the Crown case


	
	The Crown maintained that this was a very strong Crown case.
	
	
	Much of the strength of the Crown case came about from the combined force of the following matters, which are wholly independent of the blood pattern evidence:
	



	
	Four witnesses attended the scene after the victim had been stabbed and, in response to questions about who the attacker was, heard her say “[D], Year 10, Erina High”.
	
	
	All had clear recollections of Tania identifying the appellant’s first name, his year at school, and the high school. The deceased had sufficient clarity of mind to reject a proposition put to her in which another boy was nominated as the attacker, and specifically named the applicant. Of course, for all four witnesses, the event was highly traumatic but it is inherently plausible that all four would have clear recollections of the dying words of the deceased. The probative value of those recollections is, in our view, substantial, and unaffected by other errors in their recollection (notably, Ms Audley’s misidentification of the killer).
	
	
	A short time thereafter, police enquiries of the principal at the particular school confirmed there was a “[D]” in year 10 and, having identified the applicant, police seized bloodstained clothing at his home. Some of the bloodstains were those of the deceased.
	
	
	DL gave three different versions of how he cut his hand to three witnesses: that he had fallen on a rock, that he had cut his hand on a rose bush, and on barbed wire.
	
	
	The appellant attempted to flee when police attended at his home.
	



	
	None of that evidence was controversial. Nor does that evidence exhaust the Crown case against DL. There were other aspects which were more equivocal, including:
	



	
	Blood with DNA profiles of DL and the deceased was found on a fence post on the road at the front of the resort.
	
	
	The lacerations to the inside of DL’s left hand were consistent with having been inflicted by a short-bladed knife such as that used to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Ms Audley saw a single boy stabbing the deceased. She did not observe any other person in the vicinity.
	
	
	Ms Butcher when she saw DL and gave him a tea towel, said that there was a great deal of blood on him: “It was just like everywhere, like down his arms, on his shirt”.
	
	
	DL’s mother gave evidence that he had a waterproof watch with a velcro band at the time of Tania’s death. A watch with the brand “Pipeline” and a velcro band was located at the scene. The watch had blood stains on it. The deceased’s mother gave evidence that all of Tania’s property had been recovered. Necessarily, it did not belong to her.
	
	
	A fellow inmate at the juvenile detention centre gave evidence that DL had told him three (inconsistent) accounts. One was that “he stabbed the girl but jumped over a putt putt golf fence and that’s how he got the slice in his hand”. Another was that “he was waiting behind the bushes and she got off the bus and he stabbed her. The only reason why he stopped stabbing her was because the knife cut his hand”. The significance of that testimony is that it contains details (the putt putt golf fence, the deceased getting off the bus) which suggest that they must have been derived from what DL had said. We note that the third account was that DL had tried to stop an assailant and had been injured with the knife in his attempt to do so.
	



	
	Against the force of that case, there is the consideration that if what Ms Audley had seen were correct, not nearly enough blood had been found on his clothes. There were other inconsistencies in the evidence of Ms Audley (in relation to her evidence that he was riding a bike and wearing a white shirt, together with the fact that she failed to identify him). It will also be noted that the cut to DL’s left hand was to the inside of the hand. There was of course no real evidence of any motive, and DL was a person of good character.
	
	
	However, the key limitation in the doubts sought to be raised by the defence summarised above is that they tend to detract only from the less equivocal aspects of the Crown case. None undermines the force of the dying declarations, the arrest of DL at his home as he sought to flee, and the recovery of his clothes stained with the blood of the deceased.
	
	
	To that end, and for good reason, DL made quite elaborate submissions directed to creating doubt in what flowed from the dying declarations.
	
	
	First, the defence pointed to the evidence that shortly before the deceased became unconscious, she would “develop some clouding of consciousness”. However, the evidence at trial undermines the force of this submission. The repeated triple-0 calls to the Ambulance Service, which were played to the jury, and transcripts of which were tendered, constitute a contemporaneous and reliable record of the timing. The first triple-0 call was made at 3:56pm and the victim was described as conscious, breathing and (significantly) “completely awake”. The caller was told to call back if the victim’s injury changed. The Crown called an officer from the NSW Ambulance Service who had prepared a report dealing with the incident. His report was not tendered, but in cross-examination he was able to identify the last call taking place at 4:06pm. The response notification gave that time and referred to “CB”, meaning call back, and recorded “patient now unconscious”. That corresponds with the final transcript where the caller stated, “She’s lost consciousness” repeatedly and, when asked whether the victim was still breathing, said, “Yeah, she’s breathing, she’s just lost consciousness.” At the conclusion of that call, the caller said, “I can hear sirens”, and the evidence established that the ambulance officers arrived at the scene at 4:11pm. When they arrived, the deceased had no pulse and was not breathing.
	
	
	The consequence is that the contemporaneous evidence of the triple-0 calls demonstrates beyond all doubt that there were at least 10 minutes during which the victim was in the presence of the four witnesses before she lost consciousness. The idea underlying this aspect of DL’s case, that what all four witnesses heard came at the very end of the time which elapsed as the deceased died, is implausible in the extreme. And it is squarely inconsistent with the evidence of one of the four witnesses (Ms Sneesby) who recalled hearing the deceased speaking approximately three times, each time saying “[D], Year 10, Erina High”. It is also inconsistent with the capacity of Tania to reject a proposition put to her that her attacker was a different named individual, nominating instead the applicant.
	
	
	Secondly, accepting that DL was identified by the deceased as she died, DL stressed that it does not follow that she was identifying her assailant. However, the clear recollection of at least two of the witnesses was that the deceased was answering questions as to who had attacked her.
	



	
	Ms Audley said that the deceased was asked, “Do you know who did this to you? Do you know who attacked you?”, at which stage LC interjected and asked, “Was it [Troy or some other boy’s name]?” and Ms Audley said, “It wasn’t until after then that the victim went, no – she didn’t actually say ‘No’ she shook her head and said, ‘it was [D], Year 10, Erina High”. Ms Lawrence said that she asked, “Do you know who did this?”, and that the answer was, “Yes, his name is [D] and he is in Year 10 at Erina High”.
	
	
	The evidence of one of the school children, LC, was slightly different. He recalled that he said “Who did this to you? Was it the same person who attacked your mother?” to which she replied “I don’t know, but it was [D] from Year 10 at Erina High”. In order to understand that evidence, it is necessary to say that the deceased’s mother gave evidence that on 17 June 2005 a young boy dressed in school uniform walked into her house saying that he was looking for somebody. She told her daughter about the incident the following day, but did not say (because she did not know) who it was.
	



	
	That is powerful evidence, from people with no motive to lie, who were understandably traumatised by the horrific scene confronting them, but who nevertheless might be expected to have the clear recollection which they professed to have of the deceased’s repeated nomination of “[D], Year 10, Erina High” as her attacker.
	
	
	In our view, although the dying declarations could not be tested, they were in the circumstances of this trial very powerful evidence identifying DL as the assailant. Their force is not undercut by the submissions advanced by DL on appeal.
	
	
	No attempt was made to undermine the DNA analysis of some of the blood stains on DL’s clothing which demonstrated beyond all doubt that DL had been in close contact with the deceased at the time she was attacked.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the position is analogous to, if not even stronger than, the “compelling inference” to which the High Court referred in The Queen v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35; (2016) 90 ALJR 1013 at [50]-[51]:
	


“the compelling inference is that he was the last person to see his wife alive and was the only person who knew the circumstances of her death. That inference did not, of course, diminish the overall burden on the prosecution of proving beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the offence of murder with which the respondent was charged. In the case of circumstantial evidence, the prosecution's burden requires it to exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence. However, where an accused person with knowledge of the facts is silent, then as was said in Weissensteiner v The Queen:

‘In a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused.’

That passage was quoted with approval in RPS v The Queen. The significance to be attached to what was said in Weissensteiner must be understood in its context, as explained in Azzopardi v The Queen. Weissensteiner was not simply a case in which the accused failed to contradict direct evidence of other witnesses. It was a case in which, if there were facts which explained or contradicted the evidence against the accused, they were facts which were within the knowledge only of the accused and thus could not be the subject of evidence from any other person or source”. [Citations omitted.]


	
	So too here. If there were facts which explained the victim’s repeated identification of DL as she died and her blood on his clothes, they were facts which were within the knowledge of DL.
	
	
	The aspects of the evidence referred to are sufficient of themselves to establish DL’s guilt to the criminal standard.
	
	
	To all of the foregoing must now be added the agreed position of Dr Reynolds and Det Sgt Moon. True it is that there were significant and material errors by Det Sgt Moon in his evidence in 2008. However, Dr Reynolds confirmed the correctness of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence in 2008 concerning the small drops of blood found behind the right shoulder of DL’s sweatshirt (coincidentally, the evidence which was inaccurately summarised by the defence counsel in closing address and was corrected the following morning). As earlier noted, Dr Reynolds confirmed that:
	


“These small bloodstains are of a size, shape, distribution and location such that they are likely a result of deposition by cast-off mechanism. [Tania] is the likely contributor of these bloodstains. In the limited instructions provided to this author regarding the appellant’s versions of events it is difficult to reconcile the presence of these bloodstains with that version.”


	
	Once again, if there were facts that explained the presence of the deceased’s blood behind his right shoulder otherwise than by their having been cast off as a knife in his right hand was used repeatedly to stab her, those facts were within the knowledge of DL.
	
	
	The response advanced by Ms Bashir to the strength of this evidence was that it was not “conclusive”. She referred to “the agreement between the parties that the upshot of the blood pattern analysis evidence is that it’s inconclusive”. Of course, that is correct; both blood spatter experts agreed that their opinions could never be conclusive. Such evidence cannot of itself demonstrate beyond all doubt any person’s guilt.
	
	
	Dr Reynolds suggested that more experiments could be done to test whether there might be other hypotheses consistent with innocence for those blood stains. It is not possible meaningfully to assess whether there is any realistic possibility of such experiments being performed, let alone what they might show.
	
	
	However, the fact that, 11 years later, and despite the considerable efforts which have been directed to fresh evidence in this case, DL is presently unable even to advance a scenario consistent with innocence whereby the victim’s blood has been spattered behind his right shoulder, tellingly confirms the force of this evidence.
	
	
	We understood Ms Bashir to advance a submission that because the blood spatter evidence was material in 2008, and because (so it was said) the defence would be quite different in light of what is now known of its deficiencies and limitations, there should be a new trial. Her submissions included:
	


“[T]he force of the defence case, it must have changed, altered immeasurably would change immeasurably if the blood pattern analysis evidence that’s been before this Court was before that Court, and so applying the Gallagher test which has that lower threshold in our submission, looking at the fresh evidence that's before this Court, looking at all of the evidence together, this Court would order a new trial.

…

As the question here and the sole question in the trial was a question of identity, the blood pattern analysis evidence was presented as powerful evidence of identity. That’s what it was relied on to identify the wearer of the jumper as the assailant, and it was used in that context where Ms Audley had not identified the applicant, so in our submission, to say that the blood pattern analysis evidence could be put to one side when this Court looks to the proviso, is wrong.”


	
	To the extent that DL submitted that for such reasons the proviso was inapplicable, we do not agree. The fact that there was material evidence before the jury from Det Sgt Moon which was unreliable is merely the premise to the operation of the proviso. Where as here DL’s guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt by the balance of the evidence excluding the blood spatter evidence, and if the blood spatter evidence now available to this Court merely strengthens the Crown case, the proviso is available. Those matters lead us to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that DL murdered the deceased.
	


Was there a fair trial?


	
	We are conscious of the fact that it is not sufficient for this Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that DL murdered the deceased, in order to apply the proviso. We acknowledge that there is at least a risk that there was a denial of procedural fairness in the way Det Sgt Moon’s experiments over the Easter weekend were prepared and communicated to the defence.
	
	
	However, the evidence now available demonstrates that the most critical aspect of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence was correct. Although much of his opinion, including that based upon directionality and amount of blood, cannot safely be relied upon, he and Dr Reynolds agree that the bloodstains consistent with the profile of the deceased behind the right shoulder of the jacket are “difficult to reconcile” with any defence scenario. With all of the advantages of hindsight, there would have been no cross-examination on that aspect of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence irrespective of any denial of procedural fairness. That is to say, even if the defence had had access to Dr Reynolds at trial in 2008, there would still have been no basis for cross-examination of this aspect of Det Sgt Moon’s evidence. Nor would there have been a defence case.
	
	
	Accordingly, this is not a case where the trial miscarried in such a way that it is not possible to assess the strength of the Crown case. To the extent the jury was exposed to evidence to which it should not have been exposed, the strength of that evidence has now been exhaustively assessed on appeal. Although material parts were inaccurate or misleading, the common position of the experts was that “it is difficult to reconcile” the presence of the linear cast off bloodstains on the right shoulder of the jacket with any scenario advanced on behalf of DL. This is not a case, such as Evans v The Queen (2007) 235 CLR 521; [2007] HCA 59, where no opportunity has been provided to answer the inferences which flow from the DNA evidence relating to those bloodstains. It follows that to the extent that there was a denial of procedural fairness to DL in 2008, it is not a denial that precludes the application of the proviso.
	


Conclusion on appeal against conviction


	
	For those reasons, there should be an extension of time and grant of leave in relation to proposed grounds 1(a), 1(c) and 3. Leave should otherwise be refused. The appeal against conviction must be dismissed.

4276345,Linggo v R [2017] NSWCCA 67,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 30 June 2015, the Australian Federal Police entered a room at the Novotel Sydney Central Hotel and found Mr Leonard Linggo counting a quantity of Australian $50 note bundles using a counting machine. They also saw three mobile phones, two bags containing further bundles and a laptop computer. The total amount of Australian currency located in the hotel room was $1,055,920.

Mr Linggo was arrested and charged with offences contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) and s 142(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). Mr Linggo pleaded guilty on 2 September 2015 and was convicted on March 2016. For the first offence, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, commencing on 30 June 2015 and expiring on 29 December 2016. For the second offence, he was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 30 March 2016 and expiring on 29 September 2016.

Together, Mr Linggo was sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of three years and three months. The sentencing judge also directed that, pursuant to s 19AC(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), Mr Linggo be released upon entering into a recognizance after the expiration of two years in custody, calculated to commence on 30 June 2015 and expire on 29 June 2017.

Mr Linggo sought leave to appeal against sentence. He relied upon the following grounds of appeal:

Ground 1:   The learned sentencing judge erred by giving the applicant an inadequate discount for his guilty pleas.

Ground 2:   The learned sentencing judge erred by increasing the sentence imposed on the applicant for the offence contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) on the basis of circumstances which would have warranted conviction for more serious offences under the Criminal Code.

Ground 3:   The learned sentencing judge erred by taking into account uncharged offences to increase the seriousness of the offences.

Ground 4:   The learned sentencing judge erred by passing a total sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months when his Honour’s stated intention was to impose “an overall sentence of three years”.

During the course of the hearing, counsel for Mr Linggo indicated that he would not pursue grounds 2 and 3, if the appeal were to be allowed on grounds 1 and 4.

The Court:

The Court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. The Court imposed an aggregate sentence of 2 years and 9 months. It held:

In relation to ground 1:

(1)   Given the presence of an apparent conflict in the authorities, it was not appropriate for the three judge bench sitting in this case to determine the question whether the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty should be taken into account when calculating a discount on sentence for federal offences. [29]-[39]

Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339; [2002] HCA 6; Tyler v The Queen; R v Chalmers (2007) 173 A Crim R 458; [2007] NSWCCA 247; Lee v R [2012] NSWCCA 123; Isaac v R [2012] NSWCCA 195; C v R (2013) 229 A Crim R 233; [2013] NSWCCA 81; R v Saleh [2015] NSWCCA 299; Gow v DPP (Cth) (2015) 298 FLR 397; [2015] NSWCCA 208; DPP (Cth) v Thomas [2016] VSCA 237; R v Harrington (2016) 11 ACTLR 215; [2016] ACTCA 10

(2)   There is a potential inconsistency in the authorities regarding whether the strength of the Crown case is relevant only to contrition and remorse or whether it also impacted on the degree of mitigation accorded to an early plea. It was not necessary for the Court to resolve this issue. [42]-[44]

R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309; Tyler v The Queen; R v Chalmers (2007) 173 A Crim R 458; [2007] NSWCCA 247

(3)   A discount to sentence under s 16A(2)(g) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) is not condition upon an offender providing assistance to authorities. This is an independent consideration. [46].

(4)   It is advisable for a sentencing judge to avoid using a range of percentages when determining the discount given for a plea of guilty as this may introduce an unsatisfactory degree of uncertainty into the sentencing process. [51

(5)   In allowing a reduction in sentence between 4 per cent and 10 per cent, the sentencing judge failed to pay appropriate regard to the extent to which the early guilty plea facilitated the course of justice. [48]

In relation to ground 4:

(6)   The sentencing judge made a mathematical error in imposing a total sentence of imprisonment of 3 years and 3 months, in circumstances where he intended to impose an aggregate sentence of 3 years. [15]-[20]

(7)   It was not necessary for the Court to resolve whether the Court should correct the error on the part of the sentencing judge but not otherwise resentence the applicant afresh, as required where other than a mathematical error is made. [19]-[20]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 7 March 2016, the applicant, Mr Leonard Linggo, was convicted, after pleading guilty, to the following two offences:
	


Count 1:   That between 29 June 2015 and 30 June 2015, he did possess money reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime, worth in excess of $100,000 contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). An offence under s 400.9(1) carries a maximum penalty of 3 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 180 penalty units ($30,600).

Count 2:   That between 25 June 2015 and 30 June 2015, he did cause another to conduct transactions to avoid threshold reporting requirements contrary to s 142(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). An offence contrary to s 142(1) carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 300 penalty units ($51,000).


	
	The sentencing judge, Hanley SC DCJ, sentenced the applicant as follows:
	


Count 1:   18 months imprisonment to commence on 30 June 2015 and to expire on 29 December 2016;

Count 2:   2 years 6 months imprisonment to commence on 30 March 2016 and to expire on 29 September 2018.


	
	His Honour directed, pursuant to s 19AC(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), that the applicant be released upon entering into a recognizance after the expiration of 2 years in custody, calculated to commence on 30 June 2015, being the date that the applicant first went into custody and to expire on 29 June 2017. His Honour stated that the effect of his sentence was that he had imposed “an overall sentence of three years”.
	
	
	On 31 March 2017, this Court, after hearing the applicant’s application for leave to appeal, made the following orders and otherwise reserved its reasons for decision:
	


“1   Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal;

2   Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 7 March 2016 and in lieu impose the following:

Count 1   Imprisonment for 18 months commencing 30 June 2015 and expiring 29 December 2016;

Count 2   Imprisonment for 2 years and 2 months commencing 30 December 2015 and expiring 28 February 2018;

3   Direct the appellant be released on 3 April 2017 upon giving security without surety in the sum of $1,000 and entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for the period 3 April 2017 until 28 February 2018;

4   Judgment otherwise reserved.”


	
	The Court’s reasons are as follows.
	
	
	The applicant had been arrested at the Novotel Sydney Central Hotel on 30 June 2015. He pleaded guilty to the offences at the Local Court on 2 September 2015. The matter proceeded by way of a sentencing hearing in the District Court before his Honour on a statement of agreed facts as follows.
	
	
	On 30 June 2015, officers of the Australian Federal Police entered the hotel room into which the applicant had booked earlier that day and observed the applicant seated at a desk, counting a quantity of Australian $50 note bundles using a counting machine. They also saw bundles of Australian currency, three mobile phones, a black Adidas bag containing $50 notes and a further black bag containing bundles of Australian $50 notes, a black Acer laptop computer with an external hard drive, as well as the applicant’s Indonesian passport and the stub of a Jetstar airline ticket in his name.
	
	
	During the course of the search, the applicant stated to the officers that the money in the bags had been given to him by a person who had introduced himself to the applicant as “Shaun”. The applicant had met Shaun at the Mantra Hotel at Chatswood and again at the Royal Pacific Hotel in Lane Cove. On each occasion, Shaun had told him that there was $500,000 in cash in the bag and that he was to count the money and await further instructions by phone. The applicant told the police that he was paid to undertake this task.
	
	
	The total amount of Australian currency located in the applicant’s hotel room and seized by the Australian Federal Police was $1,055,920.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested and participated in a record of interview. During the course of the record of interview, he stated that he was in contact with a male person in Malaysia, who arranged money exchanges and paid the applicant a 0.5 per cent commission for collecting and remitting the money.
	
	
	The method used for the collection of money involved the applicant sending to the Malaysian contact a serial number from a $5 banknote. This serial number would then be forwarded to an Australian money contact and, at the time of collecting the money, the applicant provided the $5 banknote with the corresponding serial number to the Australian contact, who exchanged it for the money. The applicant separated the money into $20,000 and $30,000 lots and deposited it into approximately 20 different bank accounts. The details of the bank accounts into which he deposited the money were provided to him by a male person whom he knew as “Awai”.
	
	
	The applicant stated that he had engaged in the same activity on two prior occasions in which he had collected a total of $1 million from an unknown person and deposited the money into bank accounts. He had a friend from Hong Kong named “Mike”, later identified as Mike Cheung, to whom he paid 0.3 per cent of the commission to deposit cash into the bank accounts.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1:   The learned sentencing judge erred by giving the applicant an inadequate discount for his guilty pleas.

Ground 2:   The learned sentencing judge erred by increasing the sentence imposed on the applicant for the offence contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) on the basis of circumstances which would have warranted conviction for more serious offences under the Criminal Code.

Ground 3:   The learned sentencing judge erred by taking into account uncharged offences to increase the seriousness of the offences.

Ground 4:   The learned sentencing judge erred by passing a total sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months when his Honour’s stated intention was to impose “an overall sentence of three years”.

Consideration


	
	The Court was of the opinion that leave to appeal should be granted and that grounds 1 and 4 should be allowed. The applicant indicated to the Court that if the appeal was allowed on those grounds, he would not pursue grounds 2 and 3. It is convenient first to consider ground 4.
	


Ground 4: mathematical error in the term of the sentence imposed


	
	The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge made a mathematical error in imposing a total sentence of imprisonment of 3 years and 3 months.
	
	
	His Honour, after imposing the sentence for each offence, as set out at [2] above, and directing that the applicant be released after the expiration of 2 years in custody, stated “[t]hat is an overall sentence of three years”. The applicant submitted that it was apparent from this comment that his Honour had erred in setting the commencement date for the sentence imposed in respect of count 2.
	
	
	The Crown conceded that his Honour intended to impose an aggregate sentence of 3 years imprisonment and incorrectly stated the dates for the commencement and expiration of the sentence imposed for count 2, resulting in an actual aggregate sentence of 3 years and 3 months. The Crown accepted that this was apparent not only from his Honour’s express statement that he had imposed “an overall sentence of three years”, but also from his further discussion with the legal representatives in which his Honour referred to the making of a recognizance release order.
	
	
	In that regard, the Crimes Act, s 19AC(1) provides that where an offender is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 3 years or less in respect of a federal offence, the court must order the offender’s release on recognizance, as his Honour did in this case. By contrast, s 19AB(1) of the Crimes Act provides that where a federal offender is sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of greater than 3 years, the court must fix a single non-parole period and not make a recognizance release order.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this Court should correct the accumulation error brought about by the sentencing judge’s inaccurate statement as to the commencement and expiration dates for count 2: see Lehn v R (2016) 78 MVR 353; [2016] NSWCCA 255 at [72], but not otherwise resentence the applicant afresh as is required where other than a mathematical error is made during the course of the sentencing process: see Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37. The applicant queried whether the error was encompassed by the principle stated in Lehn v R as it would be necessary for the Court to consider the degree of accumulation.
	
	
	For the reasons submitted by both the applicant and the Crown, it is apparent that his Honour made the mathematical error to which we have referred. Accordingly, ground 4 of the notice of appeal is allowed. As the Court also considers that ground 1 of the appeal should be allowed, it is not necessary to resolve the question regarding the application of the principle stated in Lehn, as it is necessary in any event to resentence the applicant in accordance with the principles in Kentwell.
	


Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred by giving the applicant an inadequate discount for his guilty pleas


	
	The sentencing judge, by reference to s 16A(2)(g) of the Crimes Act, correctly stated that he was required to take into account the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty. That section provides:
	


“16A   Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc – federal offences

…

(2)   In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:

…

(g)   if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence – that fact …”


	
	The applicant had entered pleas of guilty to both charges on the second occasion that the matter was before the Court, the first occasion having been a mention at which directions were made for the service of the prosecution’s brief of evidence. The Crown accepted that the pleas were entered at the first reasonable opportunity to do so.
	
	
	On the sentence hearing, the applicant had argued for a reduction of 25 per cent for the pleas, being a usual reduction made for an early plea, at least in respect of State offences, a matter to which we make further reference below. However, his Honour stated that he proposed to allow a reduction of between 4 per cent and 10 per cent from an otherwise appropriate sentence. His Honour identified the following reasons for allowing the discount in the range to which he had referred.
	
	
	First, his Honour noted that the utilitarian benefits to the community as a result of the plea were not to be taken into account. Secondly, his Honour was satisfied that the applicant’s guilty plea demonstrated “some genuine remorse and acceptance of responsibility”. His Honour noted, however, that the applicant had not identified any members of the money-laundering hierarchy engaged in recruiting or otherwise requesting him to come to Australia to commit the offences. Thirdly, the plea of guilty, which was entered on 2 September 2015, the offender having been arrested and charged on 30 June 2015, was entered at the first reasonable opportunity and this had been conceded by the Crown. Finally, his Honour was satisfied, in making an assessment of the appropriate discount, that the pleas of guilty were principally as a result of the “recognition of the inevitable” in circumstances where the applicant was “caught ‘red-handed’”.
	
	
	On the argument advanced on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground, two important matters of principle were raised for consideration. The first was whether, contrary to the sentencing judge’s observation, the utilitarian value of the plea could be taken into account in circumstances where the offences involved were federal offences. The second was whether the strength of the Crown case was a matter relevant only to contrition and remorse or whether it also impacted upon the degree of mitigation which was to be accorded to an early plea.
	
	
	It is accepted that in sentencing for a New South Wales offence, the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is a relevant factor in mitigation of sentence and that ordinarily, the discount given for the utilitarian value of the plea should be quantified: see this Court’s guideline judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309.
	
	
	In Thomson; Houlton, Spigelman CJ stated at [160], that “sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence in so far as they believe it appropriate to do so”. In particular, Spigelman CJ (Foster AJA, Wood CJ at CL, Grove and James JJ agreeing) observed that:
	


“The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea.”


	
	Depending of course on all the circumstances, a plea entered at the earliest opportunity usually attracts a discount of 25 per cent for its utilitarian value.
	
	
	In Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339; [2002] HCA 6 the majority, at [11]-[15], explained the relevance of a plea of guilty and the underlying rationale for allowing a plea to be taken into account in mitigation. The charge in that case was laid under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA). The offence was committed at Perth International Airport, which was a “Commonwealth place”. Pursuant to the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 (Cth), certain state laws, including the Misuse of Drugs Act were picked up and applied with respect in Commonwealth places and state courts were invested with federal jurisdiction to hear charges for offences contrary to such laws.
	
	
	The majority (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) accepted, at [11], that a plea of guilty may reflect remorse and may also indicate “acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice”. Their Honours explained, at [13], that it was not part of the rationale of allowing a plea of guilty to be taken into account in mitigation of the sentence imposed that “the plea has saved the community the expense of a trial”. Their Honours considered that if that were the rationale, it would be to discriminate against those who exercise their right to a trial.
	
	
	Their Honours reiterated that insofar as the rationale for the rule depends on factors other than remorse and acceptance of responsibility, it was to be expressed in terms of “the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice”. Their Honours added, at [22], that “a significant consideration” in assessing the extent to which a plea of guilty indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, was “whether the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity”.
	
	
	Cameron has subsequently been understood and applied as establishing that the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is not to be taken into account when sentencing for federal offences: see Tyler v The Queen; R v Chalmers (2007) 173 A Crim R 458; [2007] NSWCCA 247;  Lee v R [2012] NSWCCA 123;  Isaac v R [2012] NSWCCA 195 at [24] to [27]; C v R (2013) 229 A Crim R 233; [2013] NSWCCA 81; at [33]; R v Saleh [2015] NSWCCA 299 per Beech-Jones J at [55].
	
	
	There is other authority, however, which has doubted that Cameron stands for any such proposition: see Gow v DPP (Cth) (2015) 298 FLR 397; [2015] NSWCCA 208 per Basten JA at [28] (Hamill J expressing limited agreement at [72]); DPP (Cth) v Thomas [2016] VSCA 237.
	
	
	In Thomas, the Victorian Court of Appeal gave consideration at [7], to what was meant by facilitating the course of justice, observing that:
	


“… A willingness to facilitate, or co-operate in, the course of justice is manifested by an offender’s plea of guilty. The plea, by its very nature, constitutes an acknowledgement that the charge has been rightly laid and evidences a preparedness by the offender to relinquish his or her right to contest the charges and to submit to punishment.”


	
	We consider this to be an apt description of what is meant by the term “facilitate the course of justice”. There is a real question, however, as to whether there are other factors which are comprehended within that description and whether those factors are co-extensive with what is encompassed within the utilitarian value of the plea or whether that is a separate concept altogether. The Court in Thomas also considered that question. For example, it added, at [7]:
	


“… The offender’s willingness to follow that course [ie, to plead guilty] often described in the authorities as ‘co-operation’, vindicates the course of justice, saves the community the expense of a trial and releases witnesses from the ordeal of a trial. These considerations provide the primary basis for the discount for a plea of guilty.”


	
	However, it also considered, as we understand the judgment, that the utilitarian value of the plea is a separate concept, observing that:
	


“… Ordinarily there will be no material difference between the discount to be allowed for a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and the objective utilitarian value of that plea. However, the subjective circumstances of the offender, including his or her willingness to facilitate the course of justice, will not always have the same mitigating weight as the utilitarian benefit of avoiding a contested trial.”


	
	The question whether the utilitarian value of the plea is relevant to sentencing in respect of federal offences was also raised in R v Harrington (2016) 11 ACTLR 215; [2016] ACTCA 10. That case was decided prior to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Thomas and only shortly after the decision in Gow.  Murrell CJ considered, at [33], that Basten JA’s observations in Gow regarding the issue of a ‘utilitarian discount’ were obiter, but did not come to a final view on the question whether a discount for the utilitarian value of a plea should be allowed for a federal offence in circumstances where the Court had not had the benefit of full argument.  In the case before this Court, counsel for the applicant, in his careful and helpful argument, submitted that Basten JA’s decision on this point was part of the ratio decidendi of his Honour’s decision.
	
	
	In their reasons in Harrington, Refshauge ACJ and Gilmour J, considered, at [130], that “the majority’s conclusion in Gow was reached although no submissions had been put by the parties as to Cameron during the hearing of that appeal”. Their Honours concluded, at [131], that “the majority decision in Gow on this point is clearly wrong.”
	
	
	Given the jurisprudential conflict that is apparent on the authorities, the Court raised with counsel in this matter the appropriateness of another three judge bench expressing its view, not only on the proper understanding and application of Cameron and, in particular, whether it is authority that the utilitarian value of the plea is not relevant for the purposes of sentencing for federal offences, but also on the question of whether any or all of the intermediate appellate decisions to which we have referred, were “plainly wrong” or were distinguishable, and/or whether the observations of Basten JA in Gow were, or were not, obiter.
	
	
	The Crown explained that the question of a five judge bench being constituted had been the subject of communication between the parties. That course was not acted upon, it would seem, because of the limited period that would be available between a hearing date and any release of the applicant on recognizance, should the appeal be successful.
	
	
	As the Court found that ground 1 of the appeal could be determined in favour of the applicant on other bases without finding it necessary to resolve the question whether the utilitarian value of the plea was to be taken into account, the Court proceeded to resentence the applicant and impose the sentences set out at [4] above. However, as the question whether the utilitarian value of a plea is relevant to sentencing for federal offences generally is an important one, we wish to stress that it is essential that, in future, parties apply at an early point for a five judge bench to sit and determine the question, unless, of course, it has been earlier determined by the High Court or a five judge bench of another intermediate court of appeal.
	
	
	Before giving our reasons for imposing the sentences ordered at the conclusion of the hearing on 31 March 2015, we also draw attention to the second matter of concern to which we have referred, namely, whether the strength of the Crown case was relevant only to contrition and remorse, or whether it also impacted on the degree of mitigation accorded to an early plea. In Thomson; Houlton, the Court was also asked to consider this issue. Spigelman CJ concluded, at [137], that the strength of the Crown case was relevant to contrition or remorse in that “a ‘recognition of the inevitable’ may qualify the extent of genuine contrition”.
	
	
	However, in Tyler, which involved, relevantly, offences under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), Simpson J (as her Honour then was) stated, at [110]-[114], that although in Cameron the High Court specifically excluded reference to the utilitarian value of the plea, a relevant consideration in assessing an offender’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice, was, nonetheless, at least in some cases, the strength of the Crown case. We note that Spigelman CJ agreed with her Honour’s reasons. Simpson J added, at [114]:
	


“… this may cast some light upon the question whether the plea of guilty was truly motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or, more pragmatically, for example, by recognition of the inevitable.”


	
	It is also not necessary for the Court to resolve that potential inconsistency or to express a view upon it. However, we raise it so as to alert other parties to the issue, as it is undoubtedly a matter that needs to be resolved and will most likely be an aspect of any resolution of the issue relating to the relevance of the utilitarian value of the plea in sentencing for federal offences.
	


Error in this case


	
	In our opinion, the sentencing judge, in allowing a reduction in sentence of between 4 per cent and 10 per cent, erred in two principal respects.
	
	
	First, his Honour erred in having regard to the fact that the applicant had not disclosed the names of those involved in the enterprise. That consideration is irrelevant to the determination of the extent to which a sentence should be mitigated for a plea of guilty. Section 16A(2)(g) is not conditioned upon an offender providing assistance. The provision of assistance to authorities is an independent consideration which falls for consideration under s 16A(2)(h).
	
	
	But in any event, it has been recognised by this Court that “there are good and valid reasons for … offenders facing terms of imprisonment to be reluctant to identify their co-offenders”: see Ellis v R [2015] NSWCCA 262, at [68], citing Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208 at [27]; R v Baleisuva [2004] NSWCCA 344 at [29]. Although the Court’s observations in those cases related to drug offenders, we are of the opinion that that they equally apply to offences such as have been charged here, where, by the very terms of the offences charged, serious underlying and presumably dangerous criminality is involved.
	
	
	Secondly, the very small discount allowed by his Honour failed to pay appropriate, if any, regard to the extent to which the early plea facilitated the course of justice, such as to be indicative of error. We have reached this conclusion notwithstanding that in the ordinary course, the question of the weight to be given to a plea of guilty is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour had, in fact, had regard to the facilitation of the course of justice inasmuch as he had taken the early plea of guilty into account. However, we have a real doubt that he did so. His Honour made no mention of the fact that the early plea facilitated the course of justice. His Honour’s reference to the plea was made without any explanation of the relevance of it being an early plea or the extent to which he took it into account.
	
	
	Further, as the Court stated in Thomas, a guilty plea, of its nature, is an acknowledgement of the proper application of the processes of the criminal law. Significant weight needs to be given to that factor alone. It is also relevant that in Cameron, at [25], the majority stated that the Court of Appeal “was in error in stating that there had been ‘no saving in the Magistrates Court’ for the appellant’s plea of guilty rendered a preliminary hearing unnecessary”. A discount of between 4 per cent and 10 per cent understates the importance of these factors in a significant way such as to constitute error.
	
	
	We would also add that it is difficult to know, from his Honour’s reasons or from the sentence imposed, how the discount of between 4 per cent and 10 per cent was actually applied to the sentence that his Honour would otherwise have imposed. This is unfortunate, as it did not enable the offender or the Court to know what sentence would have been imposed but for the plea and whether the discount that was imposed was 4 per cent or 10 per cent or closer to one or other of those figures. In short, it introduced an unsatisfactory degree of uncertainty into the sentencing process. For that reason, we would strongly caution, in any sentencing process, against using a range of percentages when determining the discount given for a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Given the errors to which we have referred, it was necessary for this Court to resentence the offender: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). Section 6(3) was considered by this Court in Lehn, where Bathurst CJ stated, at [68], that it:
	


“… requires a court to form an opinion as to whether some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law. The section, as a matter of language, does not provide that if a discrete error is found, the sentence can be adjusted to take account of that error. It seems to me that if there is an error which affects the exercise of the sentencing discretion, the section requires the court to form its own view of the appropriate sentence, although, as pointed out in Kentwell at [43], not necessarily to resentence.”


	
	In Kentwell, the plurality explained the process in which the Court was required to engage, at [43], as follows:
	


“After having identified specific error of the kind described in House, the Court of Criminal Appeal may conclude, taking into account all relevant matters, including evidence of events that have occurred since the sentence hearing, that a lesser sentence is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is a conclusion that that lesser sentence is warranted in law. The result of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s independent exercise of discretion may be the conclusion that the same sentence or a greater sentence is the appropriate sentence. In neither case is the Court required to re-sentence. Nor is the Court required to re-sentence in a case in which it concludes that a lesser sentence is appropriate for one or more offences, but that a greater sentence is appropriate for another or other offences, with the result that the aggregate sentence that it considers warranted in law exceeds the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal. The occasions calling for the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave, allow an offender’s appeal and substitute a more severe sentence are likely to be rare. Were the Court to grant leave in such a case, convention would require that it inform the appellant of its intended course so that he or she might abandon the appeal.” (citations omitted)


	
	We were of the opinion that no lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour, or indeed no greater sentence, ought to be imposed for count 1. The offence was serious, involving an amount of $1 million, some 10 times greater than the minimum amount specified in s 400.9 of the Criminal Code. We otherwise determined that an appropriate discount for the plea of guilty was 20 per cent. In allowing a discount of 20 per cent, there was a discrepancy of a few days in ordering the applicant’s release on 3 April 2017. However, we took that slight discrepancy into account in determining the sentence we considered was appropriate to impose.

4276346,R v Jason Mark Grogan [2017] NSWSC 378,"SENTENCE


	
	HIDDEN AJ: The offender, Jason Mark Grogan, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Alan Henry at Gloucester on 19 April 2012. I received an agreed statement of facts, which I shall summarise.
	


Facts


	
	The deceased, Mr Henry, was a 72 year old widower who lived alone in a house in Gregson Street, Gloucester. In early 2011 he became acquainted with Ms Natasha Slacke, who became his part time carer. The offender was her boyfriend, and they lived at Port Stephens. Initially the three of them socialised from time to time, but later there was a falling out between Mr Henry and the offender. What caused this is unclear. Ms Slacke continued to visit Mr Henry but the offender was not welcome.
	
	
	On 10 January 2012, the offender and Ms Slacke travelled to Gloucester for her to visit Mr Henry. In the late afternoon they were at a service station close to Mr Henry’s home, and were seen to be engaged in a very heated argument. The offender’s state of mind was one of agitation, anger and aggression. The altercation was such that bystanders were prompted to intervene out of concern that he might harm Ms Slacke. The situation was brought under control and Ms Slacke telephoned Mr Henry. A police officer had been flagged down by a motorist, and Ms Slacke passed the phone to him. He asked Mr Henry whether he had any problem with Ms Slacke coming to his home to stay. Mr Henry said that that was fine, provided that the offender was not with her. He said of the offender that he was “an absolute arsehole and isn’t welcome here.”
	
	
	During this phone conversation the offender left the scene and went to Mr Henry’s home. He climbed over the back fence from a rear lane. He was seen by a neighbour and appeared to be a bit nervous. He entered the home from the rear door. There is no direct evidence of what occurred inside the home. What can be said is that he punched Mr Henry, causing him to fall to the kitchen floor. He then took Mr Henry’s laptop computer and left via the back door. He was seen in the laneway by a police officer patrolling the area in a car. He jumped over the back fence of another property, dropped the laptop, and ran off.
	
	
	Ms Slacke arrived at Mr Henry’s home a short time later. She called 000. A neighbour saw her and the offender on a patio at the rear of the home. The two of them were arguing and Ms Slacke appeared distressed and agitated. The offender was heard to say, “It’s too late now, you can’t just back out now, you know, it’s gone too far.”
	
	
	An ambulance arrived, and paramedics found Mr Henry lying face down on the kitchen floor. He was unconscious and there was a large pool of blood around his head. He was taken to the local hospital, where he was stabilized before being conveyed by air ambulance to Westmead Hospital. There he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Towards the end of March 2012, he was transferred to a nursing home at Erina. He died there on 19 April 2012 from a complication of his incapacitation as a result of the severe brain injury he had sustained.
	
	
	A forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy explained that the most probable mechanism of Mr Henry’s injuries was his having received a punch or blow to the right side of his forehead, causing a contusion. This caused him to fall, and he hit the left side of his head either on some object as he was falling or when he hit the floor. The pathologist acknowledged the possibility that he did not become unconscious until he hit the floor, but thought it more likely that he was rendered unconscious by the initial blow.
	
	
	By his plea the offender acknowledges his unlawful and dangerous act of striking Mr Henry to the right side of the head with his fist, causing him to lose consciousness, fall and hit his head, and ultimately causing his death.
	


Subjective case


	
	The offender was 41 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 46. He has a criminal history in this State, in Queensland and in South Australia. It comprises mainly offences of dishonesty and of violence, together with the use or possession of drugs. The New South Wales record, over a period from 1987 to 2011, begins in the Children’s Court and continues with a number of entries in the Local Court. The entries for violence, mainly assaults, are between 1988 and 1997, all being dealt with by non-custodial orders.
	
	
	Offences for violence in Queensland comprise assaults dealt with 1995 and 1998, but also attempted armed robbery with actual violence, for which he received a significant sentence in the District Court in 2006. In South Australia there were two convictions for violence, both in 1997, of common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for both of which he received prison terms.
	
	
	In New South Wales and Queensland he also received prison sentences for other offences, most of them short. On a number of occasions he had abused conditional liberty, being in breach of bonds or bail orders. Importantly, at the time of the present offence he was on bonds for several offences which had been dealt with in the Local Court in 2010.
	
	
	The offender is the youngest of four children. He was brought up in the Coffs Harbour region and was educated to year 10 standard. He has had employment in the building and fishing industries. He has three teenage children from relationships prior to his relationship with Ms Slacke.
	
	
	His criminal history should be understood in the light of his long standing pattern of drug abuse. A psychiatric report of Dr Olav Nielssen records that he began using cannabis at the age of 15 and amphetamine from the age of 24. Soon after he was introduced to heroin, which he continued to use over the years and which he described to Dr Nielssen as his drug of choice. He attempted drug rehabilitation programs on two occasions and underwent drug courses and counselling frequently while serving prison terms, but these did not resolve his abuse. There had been a two year period of abstinence from drugs and alcohol until the year prior to the offence, when he had resumed using cannabis and amphetamine.
	
	
	To Dr Nielssen he described some psychotic episodes of an hallucinatory nature, which he attributed to his drug abuse and which led to a number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals in Adelaide, Brisbane and Coffs Harbour. Dr Nielssen diagnosed substance dependence and abuse disorder and a recurrent drug induced psychosis, currently in remission. He also considered the possibility of an underlying schizophrenic illness. However, the offender told him that he had not taken any illegal drug or alcohol on the day of the offence and that, as far as he was aware, his mental state was normal at that time.
	
	
	His parents were present at the sentence proceedings and remain supportive of him. In a brief letter from them which I received in evidence, they noted his use of drugs and association with the “wrong company” since his teenage years, saying that they had supported him since that time and would continue to do so. They added that he was an honest and hard worker. They expressed the view that since being taken into custody for the current offence he had changed his attitude to life, appeared more settled than ever before, and gave the impression that he is “ready to settle and lead a trouble free life.”
	
	
	I shall refer shortly to the history of these proceedings. The offender has been in continuous custody for almost 5 years, during which time he has been dealt with for only one breach of prison discipline. On 20 May 2016, a urine test detected his ingestion of the drug buprenorphine, which I understand to be similar to methadone. He admitted the breach, explaining that he had just been transferred to a unit at Goulburn where he was not coping. He asserted that he had not used any illicit drug for the previous four and a half years, embracing the period he had then been in custody.
	
	
	Otherwise his period in custody appears to have been without incident. Moreover, I received in evidence a number of certificates attesting to his having undertaken religious instruction and having attended Smart Recovery Meetings, together with his participation in a TAFE course in Access to Work and Training. I also received an extract from Justice Health records disclosing that at an early stage of his period in custody he had experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, seeing the victim of his offence in the faces of other inmates and finding their voices to resemble that of the victim. To this matter I shall return.
	


Plea of guilty


	
	The offender was arrested on 17 January 2012 and has been in custody since. At that stage he was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm but on 4 May 2012, following the death of Mr Henry, he was charged with his murder. In interviews with the police he admitted having taken Mr Henry’s laptop but denied having assaulted him.
	
	
	In 2013 he was tried for murder before RA Hulme J and convicted. His Honour sentenced him for that offence in November of that year: R v Grogan [2013] NSWSC 1643. He appealed against that conviction and, on 19 August 2016, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed that conviction and ordered his retrial for manslaughter: Grogan v R [2016] NSWCCA 168. It is unnecessary for present purposes to examine the Court’s reasons. It is sufficient to say that a ground that the verdict of guilty of murder was unreasonable was successful. The offender had offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on his arraignment for murder but the Crown had rejected that offer. As noted, he maintained that plea after the disposition of the matter by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	I received a victim impact statement by Mr Henry’s daughter, Susan Henry, which had also been before RA Hulme J when he sentenced the offender. Ms Henry read the statement to the Court. It was no easy task for her. She was visibly distressed, but completed the reading with courage and dignity.
	
	
	The statement is an eloquent expression of the impact upon her of her father’s death, including the significant period through which he had survived before he passed away. It expresses not only her grief but also her outrage at the senseless violence which led to his death, and the serious and enduring effects this crime has had upon her life. At the sentence proceedings I expressed my deepest sympathy to her and to all those affected by this tragedy, and I do so again now.
	
	
	In the light of the current legislation, I have regard to that statement in the manner articulated by McCallum J in R v Halloun [2014] NSWSC 1705 at [46], that is, as giving “texture to the undoubted proposition that every unlawful taking of a human life harms the community in some way.”
	


Sentencing issues


	
	Assessment of the objective gravity of this offence is not an easy task. Clearly, there had been animosity between the offender and Mr Henry and it would appear that the offender was in an angry and aggressive mood when he went to Mr Henry’s home. However, I have no evidence of what it was that precipitated the violent incident. All that can be said is that the act causing death was a single punch to Mr Henry’s head. In evidence at the murder trial the pathologist found it difficult to gauge the amount of force required to produce the injury which Mr Henry sustained to his forehead. His age, and the possible influence of medication he might have been taking, meant that less force than might be expected would have been required to cause that injury. Nevertheless, the pathologist’s opinion was that the injury involved “moderate force” or “a decent sort of punch.”
	
	
	Of course, the offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he did not intend to kill Mr Henry or to cause him serious injury. Otherwise, however, there is no evidence of any mitigating factors such as often attend killings which amount to manslaughter. Aggravating factors are Mr Henry’s advanced age and the fact that the offence was committed in his home. It is also appropriate to take into account the offender’s theft of his laptop, although the Crown accepts this to have been opportunistic. I accept the assessment of counsel for the offender, Mr McGrath SC, that the offence falls somewhat below the mid range of gravity of manslaughter in this category.
	
	
	The offender is a mature man with an unfavourable criminal history. As I have noted, it includes convictions for violence and a number of breaches of conditional of liberty. That said, the entries for violence are old and for the most part were dealt with by non-custodial orders or short prison sentences. Generally, as I have also noted, his criminal history falls to be viewed against the background of his drug addiction. Of course, the fact that this offence was committed while he was on bonds for other offences is a significant aggravating factor.
	
	
	The offender is entitled to a reduction of the sentence which would otherwise be appropriate because of his plea of guilty to manslaughter on this occasion and his offer to do so when he was originally arraigned for murder. I shall recognise the utilitarian value of this by a 20% reduction. In addition, I accept that his stance can be seen as some evidence of remorse for his crime and the acceptance of responsibility for it. He has not expressed remorse, but I also accept the submission of Mr McGrath that his post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms point, albeit to a limited extent, to a measure of remorse.
	
	
	The sentence I pass must reflect the need for general deterrence. As matters stand, however, specific deterrence is of less significance. The offender’s criminal history and background of drug abuse are of concern, as is his recent lapse using an illicit substance while in custody. However, I understand that the period he has had in custody is the longest he has ever experienced and, generally, his behaviour has been satisfactory, he has for the most part been drug free and he has taken some positive steps towards his rehabilitation. I also have regard to the letter from his parents and the continuing support they offer him.
	
	
	I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and, if those prospects can be fostered during a period of conditional liberty, I have some confidence that he would not reoffend in this way. For this reason I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. It would be in the community’s interest that his criminal past and drug addiction be properly addressed upon his release, so that an extended period under supervision and the sanction of parole is appropriate.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor referred me to a number of sentencing decisions by judges of this Court, and decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, dealing with manslaughter caused by punching. He acknowledged that each case turned on its own facts and that they could be of limited assistance only. I shall record what they were without analysing them: R v Dyer [2014] NSWSC 1809, R v Matthews [2015] NSWSC 49, R v McNeil (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 198, R v Wood [2014] NSWCCA 184, R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120, 243 ACrimR 31, and Lambadadis v R [2016] NSWCCA 117. I note that McNeil, Loveridge and Lambadadis involved random violence meted out to strangers by offenders affected by alcohol, cases in which general deterrence loomed particularly large. While the circumstances of the present matter are obscure, it is not a case of that kind.
	
	
	I should record that Ms Slacke pleaded guilty to hindering the investigation into this offence, and was placed on a bond. Of course, no question of parity between her sentence and that to be passed upon the offender arises.
	


Sentence


	
	Taking all these matters into account, I consider that the appropriate starting point of sentence is imprisonment for 12 years. Having regard to the plea of guilty, I would reduce that by 20% which would lead to a term, slightly rounded down, of 9 ½ years. I shall fix a non-parole period of 6 ½ years. While in custody, the offender was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment for an outstanding offence of taking and driving a conveyance without the owner’s consent. When RA Hulme J sentenced him for the murder he directed that the sentence commence on 17 May 2012, mid-way through the non-parole period for that earlier offence. The Crown prosecutor and Mr McGrath agreed that I should take the same course.
	
	
	Jason Mark Grogan, for the manslaughter of Alan Henry you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 ½ years, commencing on 17 May 2012 and expiring on 16 November 2018, and a balance of term of 3 years, commencing on 17 November 2018 and expiring on 16 November 2021. You will be eligible for release on parole on 17 November 2018.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The appellant was convicted after a trial before Townsden DCJ and a jury in the District Court at Parramatta. He was found guilty of the following offences:

Count 1 –  Aggravated sexual assault without consent (person under 16), contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

Count 2 – Aggravated indecent assault (person under 16), contrary to s 61M(2) Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 8 years.

Counts 3 and 4 – Attempt aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (person under 16), contrary to s 61P/s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.


	
	The appellant was sentenced on 21 August 2015 to an aggregate sentence with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 27 September 2014 and concluding 26 September 2021, and a balance of term of 2 years and 4 months concluding 26 January 2024.
	
	
	The indicative sentences were:
	


Count 1 – 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.

Count 2 – 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months.

Counts 3 and 4 – 4 years imprisonment.


	
	The appellant appealed against his conviction on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in admitting as Tendency Evidence against the appellant, evidence of an event, allegedly witnessed by the complainant's mother, in a garden shed at the rear of the residence occupied by the complainant, her mother and from time to time the appellant.

Ground 2: His Honour erred in refusing an application by counsel for the appellant to discharge the jury subsequent to the introduction of inadmissible evidence by an expert witness.

Ground 3: His Honour, in summing up to the jury, misdirected the jury as to what constituted tendency evidence and how the jury was to approach the evidence led by the Crown as tendency evidence.

Ground 3A: His Honour, in summing up to the jury, misdirected the jury by erroneously equating and describing one of the matters, the subject of the Tendency argument, as being a “crime” when it was neither the subject of a conviction nor a criminal charge.

Ground 4:  His Honour failed to instruct the jury that in a case involving “word on word” between the complainant and accused, the jury had to look closely at each individual count and in the event that they were not satisfied as to the complainant’s veracity in respect of one or more of the counts, they could use that in assessing her overall veracity – R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82.

Ground 5: His Honour, in summing up to the jury, misdirected the jury as to what constituted “knowledge” within the context of the elements of Counts 1, 3 and 4 of “… knowing she was not consenting …”.


	
	When the appeal came on for hearing, counsel for the appellant advised the Court that he was no longer relying upon Grounds 3, 3A and 5.
	


The Crown case


	
	The complainant was born in 1997 and was aged 14 at the time of Count 1, and 15 at the time of Counts 2, 3 and 4. At the time of the offences, the appellant was in a relationship with the complainant's mother, (the mother). That relationship began in April/May 2008 and in August 2008 the appellant moved in with the complainant's family at Merrylands. The appellant and the mother were married in September 2008. The appellant lived with the family until March 2012 at which time he left the marital home. Despite having moved out, the appellant continued to visit the mother and used to enter the house using his own key.
	
	
	The four Counts on the Indictment reflected the first and last sexual incidents between the appellant and the complainant. The complainant's evidence was that between October 2011 and late February 2012, incidents occurred approximately two to three times per week, during which the appellant would force her to expose her vagina or her bottom to him while he masturbated, or he would attempt, usually successfully, to insert his penis into her anus. Because there were so many incidents, the complainant was unable to provide details of further individual occasions. She stated that it had happened so many times that there may be incidents that she was confusing with other incidents. She was unable to specify times and dates for these events.
	
	
	When, at times, the complainant refused to co-operate with the appellant's advances or demands, he would be physically violent towards her. During this period, the appellant asked the complainant to send him photographs of her naked. In order to appease him, the complainant on a number of occasions copied images of female genitalia and buttocks that she had found on the internet and sent them to the appellant from her mobile phone.
	
	
	The offence in the first Count took place in mid to late October 2011 and involved forced penile/anal intercourse in the appellant's car on the way home from the pharmacy.
	
	
	The offences in Counts 2, 3 and 4 took place on 13 July 2012 in the lounge room of the Merrylands home and involved the appellant touching the complainant on her naked breast (Count 2); attempted penile/vaginal intercourse (Count 3); and attempted penile/anal intercourse (Count 4).
	
	
	In early April 2012 the complainant made a complaint to her older sister, E, who immediately notified the police. At that stage, the complainant did not wish to be interviewed, and did not make any further disclosures.
	
	
	On Friday, 13 July 2012 after the last incident, the complainant rang her older sister and told her what had happened. On Sunday evening 15 July 2012 the complainant told her mother what had happened. Her mother subsequently contacted the police.
	
	
	On 18 July 2012, the complainant was interviewed at the Parramatta Joint Investigation Response Team (JIRT) offices. The appellant was arrested that same day at his residence in Cabramatta and was conveyed to the Cabramatta Police Station. The complainant was again interviewed by JIRT on 9 January 2013.
	
	
	After the appellant's arrest, several mobile phones belonging to him were examined by police and found to contain text messages to and from the complainant, as well as a number of indecent images that she had sent to him at his request.
	
	
	The video recordings of the complainant’s two interviews with police, were played to the jury and the transcripts were marked MFI1 and MFI3 respectively. She was aged 15 at the time of the interviews. The effect of the interviews was that the complainant was being sexually and physically abused by the appellant, who was her mother’s partner. The appellant would hurt her, punch and kick her at home, in the car, and at the park. The sexual assaults took place in the car, in the house, in the shed and behind the shed in the backyard. There were fewer occasions in the car than in the other places. The complainant said the appellant would verbally force her to go to the shed or the backyard. The sexual assaults mainly occurred at night, but not always.
	
	
	The complainant said that the appellant would sexually assault her two or three times a week. He would touch her inappropriately (front and back – genitals and breasts) and say inappropriate things. He would ask her to show him her “body parts” – back, front or both. He would then masturbate while she did this. She tried her best to avoid doing so but the appellant would get angry and they would have an argument, and their shouting would wake her mother. She said that the appellant put his penis in her anus on many occasions and it was hard to differentiate each occasion. On three or four occasions he ejaculated inside her.
	
	
	In order to better understand the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to provide some more detail about the offences which made up the Counts charged against the appellant.
	
	
	The first time something happened was on a day in mid to late October 2011. The complainant and the appellant had been to a chemist in Parramatta and were driving home in the appellant’s car. The appellant stopped the car in an unknown street. The appellant told the complainant to get into the back seat. She thought that he might have asked her to show him a part of her body. The complainant did as she was told. The appellant also got into the back seat, entering by the same door as the complainant. The complainant did not know or understand what was going to happen. She went into the back seat because the appellant verbally forced her to.
	
	
	The appellant pushed her and she was “kind of” lying down and he then removed her pants and underpants. The appellant put his penis into her anus and had penile/anal intercourse with her. While this was occurring, the complainant tried to get away from the appellant and told him to stop and to get off her. She tried to cover herself and the appellant became angry. The complainant was unable to escape due to the awkward position in which the appellant had placed her. After a period of time the appellant got off the complainant. He told her to get into the front seat and opened the door and pushed her with his hands. They then drove home (Count 1).
	
	
	On Friday, 13 July 2012 between 3pm and 5pm the complainant was at home. She had just had a shower and left the bathroom with a towel around her body. She went into the lounge room to iron her clothes before going out for the evening. The appellant had arrived at the house while the complainant was in the shower. He had moved out of the house in March 2012 but had a key that he used to let himself in. His relationship with the complainant's mother was continuing and he would go to the house every day or two.
	
	
	The appellant entered the lounge room and asked the complainant to show him her bottom. The complainant lifted up her towel and showed the appellant her bottom. The appellant undid his pants and began to masturbate. The appellant then asked the complainant to bend over more, which she refused to do. The appellant asked the complainant to show him her vagina, and again she refused.
	
	
	The appellant became aggressive, and the complainant began to walk out of the lounge room. The complainant was very scared. The appellant grabbed the complainant and pushed her onto a lounge, causing her to fall backwards. The appellant then lay on top of the complainant. The complainant screamed, “Get off me” and “I can't breathe”. The appellant pressed his body weight onto the complainant and was “grinding” his body against hers, and touching her everywhere. The towel slipped off the complainant at some point, leaving her naked.
	
	
	The appellant removed his jeans and underwear at some point. The complainant said that she remembered that when he was lying on top of her she could not feel his jeans on her and he felt bare against her. She said that at one point the appellant covered her mouth with his hand and told her to be quiet because he could see out the window that someone was walking past the house.
	
	
	The appellant put his hand on the complainant's bare breast and felt it aggressively (Count 2).
	
	
	The appellant was “going crazy” grabbing hold of the complainant's legs and trying to spread them apart. The complainant tried to cover her vagina and anus with her hands. The appellant continued to “hump” the complainant, and tried to insert his penis into the complainant's vagina (Count 3) and her anus (Count 4). At this time the complainant was attempting to move away from the appellant and she was also putting her hands in the way to prevent him from putting his penis into her vagina or anus.
	
	
	At one point while trying to get away, the complainant fell onto the floor. The appellant however got her back onto the couch and continued his assault.
	
	
	The complainant managed to get up off the lounge and ran to the bathroom. She locked the bathroom door and got into the shower to clean herself. The appellant yelled to her from outside the bathroom “Open the door, open the door”. The complainant did not respond and remained in the shower for about half an hour. After about ten minutes, she heard the door slam as the appellant left the house. The incident lasted for about two to two and a half minutes from the time she was pushed onto the lounge to when she broke free and ran to the bathroom.
	


The case for the defence


	
	The appellant was born in 1961 in Georgia and arrived in Australia in June 1998. Initially, he worked on a farm in Victoria and later moved to Sydney and worked as a bricklayer. He and the mother married in September 2008. When he moved into the family home E was living there with her boyfriend, as was the mother and the complainant. E and her boyfriend moved out about two months after the appellant moved in.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence at trial and denied the allegations by the complainant. The effect of his evidence was as follows. E and the complainant did not accept him and his relationship with them was poor and difficult. They would not speak to him, except through their mother. However, after about six months his relationship with the complainant improved, and they became friends.
	
	
	It was a family decision for E to move out because she behaved inappropriately – she drank alcohol in her room and she and her boyfriend could be heard having sexual intercourse in her room. The appellant regarded E as a bad influence on the complainant.
	
	
	When his relationship with the complainant improved, the appellant “looked after” her. He drove her around and gave her the things she never had when growing up. He would take her out to dinner but only if her mother was present. The complainant had an issue with acne and he would buy her medication for it.
	
	
	In early 2010, the appellant’s relationship with the complainant was still good. However, in mid 2010 E moved back into the home and soon after the complainant’s behaviour deteriorated. As a result, he and the mother decided that E should move out because she was a bad influence on the complainant. E used to drink and go out at night without saying where she was going. After she moved out, she would take the complainant back to her place. The complainant’s behaviour changed in that she would not do anything at home, would be disobedient and would make demands for money from him.
	
	
	E and her boyfriend moved back into the family home in March 2012 because they had nowhere else to live. The appellant’s relationship with E was not very good. He said she continued to drink and would come home drunk and would sometimes take the complainant out at night. This time, despite his requests, E did not move out of the family home.
	
	
	The mother agreed that he should discipline the complainant. The appellant believed that if he ceased helping the complainant financially and providing her with transportation, she would be better behaved at home and would start studying. The complainant would deceive him by asking for money and saying that the money was for school or for functions. In 2011 he confronted the complainant when he discovered that she was not going where she said she was going and that she wanted to have a boyfriend.
	
	
	By 2012 the complainant’s demands for money were more frequent. She threatened to report him to the Department of Immigration for deportation because he was not an Australian citizen. She would demand money for her dance lessons, which took place three times per week. The lessons started at 5.30pm and lasted for four or five hours. The appellant would wait there until they finished and drive her home. He often used to drive the complainant to school, although she would come home by herself.
	
	
	On a day in 2012 the complainant came home from school upset and distressed. The complainant asked him what would happen if she took a lot of tablets to which he replied that she would die. Sometime later she came out of her room and asked him how long it would take to die. Shortly thereafter, the complainant asked the appellant to take her to hospital because she had swallowed a lot of tablets. She remained in hospital for about a week.
	
	
	While she was in hospital, he told hospital staff about the complainant’s behaviour at home and the hospital gave him contact details for the Youth Mental Health Team. He could not remember if he was told that she was depressed. When he was doing housework and cleaning the complainant’s room while she was in hospital, he came across a box beneath her bed which contained, amongst other things, a vibrator. He told the mother about it and she told him to put it away and that it was none of his business.
	
	
	In 2012 the appellant became aware that the complainant had not been attending school. He spoke to the complainant about it and told her that if she was going to miss school, he would no longer provide her with help. A heated argument took place between the mother and the complainant about her truancy.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that police had come to the Merrylands home on a number of occasions in 2012 and that he had called them on about four of those occasions. He had sought their help on one occasion to look for the complainant who would disappear from home at 1 or 2am. The first time he called police was in April 2012.
	
	
	In May 2012 the complainant trashed the house. He and the mother were at church at the time and a neighbour telephoned police after hearing noise from the house. When the appellant arrived home, he found that the police were already there. He saw that the house had been turned upside down especially the bedroom he shared with the mother. While he was at church that morning before he returned home, he had received 16 messages from the complainant asking for money.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence about a number of other occasions of bad behaviour on the part of the complainant. He gave examples of the complainant having a boyfriend named “George” and of spending considerable amounts of time at his home in Fairfield, both during the day and at night. For a brief period the complainant worked at Kentucky Fried Chicken on the evening shift, but was dismissed from that employment. The appellant stated that the complainant’s behaviour in 2012 was “like a war”. She demanded money and on occasions physically attacked him. On one occasion she attacked him in the car causing him to lose control and have an accident.
	
	
	The appellant denied punching the complainant to the head and kicking her to the legs. He did admit to slapping her once on the cheek because she was pushing her mother. One night at about 10pm the complainant was screaming. When he went to her room, she was throwing clothes on the floor and saying that they did not love her and did not want to help her. When the mother went to remonstrate with the complainant, the complainant pushed her causing the appellant to become upset and slap the complainant’s face.
	
	
	The appellant denied assaulting the complainant in the back seat of his car and denied sexually assaulting her two or three times a week. He denied the incident in the shed. His wife could not have seen what she claimed because he had turned the lights off at that stage because he and the complainant were about to leave the shed. He kept his work clothes in the shed and sometimes had friends in there. He denied sexual intercourse with the complainant at the back of the shed.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence, with regard to the final incident on 13 July 2012, was that he was returning home from work when he got a call from the mother, who was at the shopping centre. She asked him to go home first and give the complainant some money and then come back to pick her up, which is what he did. When he got home, the complainant was in the shower. When he gave the complainant $50, as the mother had requested, she demanded that he give her more money. As he was about to leave, the complainant said that she “urgently needed $300”. The complainant was ironing her shirt at the time.
	
	
	His evidence on this issue is at T.643.32-T.644.10 as follows:
	


“A. … She said, “I urgently need $300.00.” I said, “I don't have it. When I have the money I will give it to you but now I don't have it.” “""You want this hot iron to be on face?” I said, “You think about what you are saying.” “You understand perfectly that if you don't give me money you will upset me.” I said, “Do what you want.” At that point I was standing about in the middle of the home; I was planning to leave; I said, “I'll leave, I'll bring back your mum and then you can say to her what you like.” She began to shout from there, “Don't say anything to mother; she has no money anyway; I want you to bring me money.” I said, “I have no money” and I began to move out. She left everything on the ironing board and she stood in my way shouting. “Promise me that you will find me money.” And she began to push me, “Promise, promise, promise.” I said, “Leave me alone; your mother is waiting.” But she didn't stop pushing me and shouting. I got upset - very upset, not just ordinary, but I never shouted at her. I took her by the shoulders and I pushed her; I said, “Get away from me.” At that point she fell onto the couch but unfortunately the towel in which she was dressed, if you like, fell off. She started screaming wildly. I picked up the towel and covered her. She continued to scream. I said, “Look, there are people out there; what are you screaming about?” And screaming she ran back to her room. I also didn't quite know what to do but I went; picked up the wife at the shopping centre, and I said to her, “I had an argument with [the complainant]; we had a very bad argument.” But I didn't describe the situation to her; didn't consider it necessary because I was embarrassed to tell the story.”


	
	The appellant denied ever asking the complainant to send him rude photographs of herself. The complainant did send him rude photographs of herself in an attempt to extort money from him. He forbade her from sending him such photos, but she continued to do so. He kept the photos on his phones which he surrendered to his lawyers following his arrest and said to them “This is evidence of what [the complainant] has done to me and you know what to do with it”. His lawyers told him that they would be giving the phones to the police. The appellant said that he kept the pictures and messages received from the complainant as “evidence” of the complainant’s behaviour and her mental condition.
	
	
	There was evidence in the appellant’s case from Professor Hilton, an Associate Professor of Forensic Science at the University of Western Sydney. This evidence was to counter that of Dr Christine Norrie, who gave evidence in the Crown case. Dr Norrie was from the Child Protection Unit at Westmead Children’s Hospital. Her experience included the physical examination of patients, including their genital and anal areas. She had seen thousands of patients and as of 2004 she had seen the most children of anyone in Australia.
	
	
	Dr Norrie had conducted an anal and perianal examination of the complainant and reported the presence of “a 0.5cm healed recessed laceration (tear) at [the] 6 o’clock position (if lying on her back) just above the perianal verge with a 1cm surrounding raised scar tissue extending around the perianal margin”. Dr Norrie regarded the perianal examination results as abnormal in that they showed a recessed 0.5cm fissure or laceration with surrounding raised scar tissue. She said that such a laceration occurred when blunt force trauma exceeded the stretching properties of the tissue causing it to tear. Such a result could be caused by anal penetration by an object such as a penis, fingers or other objects.
	
	
	Professor Hilton did not examine the complainant. His evidence was based on photographs, which had been shown to him. He opined that there were a number of causes of an anal fissure, and trauma was only one possibility. He stated that it would not take much force to cause a fissure. Professor Hilton said that there was no fissure present in the photos which he observed. There was something that had healed but no actual fissure. He identified a number of other possible causes of a fissure of that kind.
	


CONVICTION APPEAL

Ground 1: His Honour erred in admitting as Tendency Evidence against the appellant, evidence of an event, allegedly witnessed by the complainant's mother, in a garden shed at the rear of the residence occupied by the complainant, her mother and from time to time the appellant.


	
	In support of that ground, the appellant noted that on the first day of trial the Crown sought leave to call evidence from the mother of what she said she saw in a shed at the back of the property which was occupied by the complainant and the appellant. The evidence was to be led as tendency evidence to support a direction sought by the Crown that the appellant had a sexual interest in the complainant and a tendency to act towards her in a certain manner.
	
	
	The Crown’s application was opposed. The trial judge granted the application. In doing so, his Honour summarised the evidence as follows:
	


“Secondly, the Crown also seek to lead tendency evidence of incidents said to have occurred in what is described as the shed in the backyard of the complainant’s house. The complainant, in her record of interview, recalled on one occasion her mother walked into the shed when the complainant was pulling up her shorts after an incident with the accused. The Crown seek to lead evidence from the complainant’s mother which is said to corroborate this incident. According to her statement, she recalled going into what she described as the converted garage and recalls seeing both the accused and the complainant close together. She describes seeing “the lower part of his body as being open, then he let go of the string and his shorts went back to his body”. She recalled asking what was going on at the time.

Although I would accept the evidence of the mother as somewhat different to that of the complainant, both the complainant and the mother do not recall any other time the complainant’s mother came into the shed or garage in similar circumstances. I would accept this evidence, which tends to corroborate the complainant’s version of events.

…

The evidence in respect of what is said to have occurred in the shed of the complainant’s house is similarly highly probative of both the accused’s state of mind and also whether the accused did in fact have sexual intercourse with the complainant as charged with respect to count 1, and whether the accused indecently assaulted the complaint with respect to count 2, and whether the accused attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant as charged with respect to counts 3 and 4. The allegation is said to have occurred at the complainant’s residence and during a period between the first and remaining counts. The alleged conduct in this instance is in fact similar in nature to the allegations contained in the counts. Pursuant to the considerations as set out in 101 of the Evidence Act, I am satisfied the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. The application to adduce tendency evidence as set out in the amended notice is granted.” (R v Kapanadze (District Court, Townsden DCJ, 1 December 2014, unrep) at 1-2, 5-6)


	
	It is against that background that the appellant relied upon the evidence of the mother on day 11 of the trial, and which is set out at T.482.40 – 483.20, and refers to an occasion when an argument took place between the appellant and the complainant which involved the complainant shouting and the appellant kicking her in the stomach and in the legs. The confrontation was so violent that eventually the mother poured a jug of water over both of the participants, in order to bring the confrontation to an end.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that this evidence was unrelated to any tendency issue and was irrelevant to any issue in the trial. He submitted that it was only capable of being evidence of bad character and that it should have been objected to and rejected and a discharge of the jury sought. The appellant submitted that the only reason that evidence was admitted was because it was part of the “tendency evidence” which was to be given by this witness.
	


Consideration


	
	Apart from the general objection to tendency evidence on which his Honour ruled, no objection was taken at trial to this evidence. Accordingly r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) apply and it is necessary for the appellant to have leave to make this submission.
	
	
	In any event, the submission is misconceived. The evidence directly corroborated the testimony of the complainant to the effect that on occasions the appellant resorted to violence to coerce her into behaving in a certain way. This was evidence of a resort to violence, although the motivation for the violence was not identified. In that regard, the evidence was relevant and went far beyond evidence of “bad character”.
	
	
	Had an objection been made pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) it would also have been admitted. Its probative value substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Its capacity to rationally affect an issue in the proceedings was clear and there was nothing unfair to the appellant in it being led.
	
	
	The absence of an objection to the evidence at trial causes another difficulty for the appellant if the objection was based on s 137. Although there is a decision to the contrary (Steve v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 231; 189 A Crim R 68) the better view, in my opinion, is that subject to the overriding obligation to ensure a fair trial according to law, there is no obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence of his or her own motion when no objection is taken and the accused is legally represented (R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 at [16] ff; Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; 227 A Crim R 217 at [66]; Penza and Di Maria v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 21 at [194] – [199]; Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100; Perish, Anthony v R; Perish, Andrew v R; Lawton, Matthew v R [2016] NSWCCA 89 at [261] – [263]). The qualifications to that approach in Tieu v R [2016] NSWCCA 111 at [41] – [42] and in Perish  at [272] have no application to the facts of this case.
	
	
	It follows that this part of appeal ground 1 has not been made out.
	
	
	The balance of ground 1 is directed at the evidence of the mother at T.493.40 and following. The particular evidence was:
	


“Q. Had you ever witnessed a sexual assault upon [the complainant] by [the appellant]?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. When was that?

A. INTERPRETER: That was in July 2012. My daughter was trying to talk to me and I was trying to postpone that conversation to get another day. In ­­- on Saturday, we still hadn't had that conversation, [the complainant] was still in bed and I went on the bus to Merrylands. And on Sunday [the appellant] brought me back from the church where we had gone together according to his wishes and [the complainant] told me “Mother, are you ready to talk to me?”.


	
	The appellant submitted that the balance of that answer which occupied over a page of transcript was unresponsive to the question and related to what the mother had been told by the complainant about another issue and did not relate to what she had witnessed. The appellant submitted that it was not until T.496.18 that any evidence as to what the mother saw in the shed was forthcoming. That evidence, which the appellant relied on, was:
	


“Q. When you saw them did you see them do anything?

A. INTERPRETER: I saw that [the appellant’s] shorts were pulled away from his body. He had fingers inside pulling away and there was cable to pull away the shorts from his body so everything that he had inside the shorts would be visible.

Q. Did you see what he did next if anything?

A. INTERPRETER: Yeah, those shorts. When they became aware that I came in both of them, he turned his head and [the complainant] was looking straight because she could see my face. When that happened he removed the fingers and the string of his shorts collapsed against his body and that was very loud noise.

Q. Was the noise of the band of the shorts?

A. INTERPRETER: It was the short.

Q. So if I understand your evidence correctly he was wearing shorts but he pulled them away from his waist, is that correct?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes, but quite a long way, about the same distance that I have here.

Q. When you saw this, did you see [the complainant] doing anything?

A. INTERPRETER: No.

Q. Was there a conversation at this point?

A. INTERPRETER: I asked “What's going on here?”. (T.497.30 – 498.4)


	
	The appellant submitted that this evidence could not constitute “tendency evidence”. He submitted that the non-responsive material at its highest was “complaint evidence” and as such did not warrant a tendency direction as was given by his Honour in the summing up. The appellant submitted that this misdirection encouraged the jury to use the complaint evidence in an impermissible manner, i.e. as tendency evidence.
	
	
	As part of this ground of appeal, the appellant also relied upon the following evidence:
	


“Q. You spoke to [the complainant] about what happened in the garage on the Sunday when you had the talk in your bedroom?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. After you had that talk with [the complainant] in your bedroom did you continue your relationship with [the appellant]?

A. INTERPRETER: No, I was beside myself and I didn't know how to save my child; I was …

Q. I'll stop you there - you didn't continue?

A. INTERPRETER: No, we didn't sleep together. That kind of relationship had been interrupted long ago.

A. WITNESS: Before Christmas.” (T.498.13)


	
	By reference to that evidence, the appellant submitted that the unsolicited evidence of the breakdown of the sexual relationship between him and the mother was unfairly prejudicial to him as it had the potential to create in the mind of the jury a motive for him to have formed a sexual interest in the complainant.
	


Consideration


	
	It needs to be kept in mind that the evidence of what happened in the shed was evidence in relation to an uncharged act and was part of the evidence of the factual context which gave rise to the offending in the counts relied upon against the appellant. Apart from the mother, the complainant had given evidence of what happened in the shed in her first police interview on 18 July 2012 at Q. and A.291. That evidence was to the effect that the appellant had verbally pressured her into entering the shed where anal intercourse took place. At the end of the incident, the complainant’s mother had entered the shed.
	
	
	In those circumstances, for the reasons given by his Honour in his ruling as to the admissibility of the tendency evidence, the evidence of what the mother saw the appellant doing with his shorts and the fact that the complainant and the appellant were standing close together at the time, was capable of providing a basis for the identified tendency, i.e. that the appellant had a sexual interest in the complainant. That is sufficient to deal with this aspect of the ground of appeal.
	
	
	There are, however, other bases which made the evidence admissible. The incident in the shed was important to the Crown case because it alone of all the uncharged incidents was corroborated by the mother. The mother’s evidence strengthened the complainant’s evidence about this incident. Although the evidence was largely circumstantial in nature, and although the mother’s evidence of this incident standing alone could not prove indecency, it did not have to, in order to corroborate the complainant’s evidence (Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 211; IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 257 CLR 300).
	
	
	The mother’s evidence, which was described by the appellant as non-responsive, was in fact evidence of what she had been told by the complainant concerning Counts 2 – 4. It was evidence of complaint by the complainant to her. As such it was not hearsay (s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)) and was relevant to establishing the impugned conduct of the appellant. Accordingly, although it was unresponsive to the particular question which was asked, it was relevant evidence. Importantly, the appellant’s counsel did not object to the evidence, nor did he seek a redirection at the time of the summing up.
	
	
	The evidence from the mother concerning the breakdown of her relationship with the appellant was not led as tendency evidence and was not the subject of the tendency direction given by his Honour. The evidence was clearly relevant and had substantial probative value. The only basis for any objection to its admissibility would be reliance upon s 137 of the Evidence Act, i.e. that its unfair prejudicial value outweighed its probative value.
	
	
	If that is the basis of the appellant’s submission, it fails on two bases. Firstly, the probative value of the evidence clearly outweighs any prejudicial effect and certainly does not give rise to any unfair prejudice. Moreover, the fact that no objection was taken by counsel for the appellant when the evidence was given has the consequences already referred to. Leave to rely on the issue is required by rule 4 and is probably precluded by the failure to object in any event.
	
	
	It follows from the above that this ground of appeal has not been made out. Since the matters raised in the ground of appeal were not raised at trial and rule 4 applies, I would refuse leave under rule 4 for the appellant to rely upon this ground.
	


Ground 2: His Honour erred in refusing an application by counsel for the appellant to discharge the jury subsequent to the introduction of inadmissible evidence by an expert witness.


	
	The appellant noted that the Crown called Dr Christine Norrie as an expert witness to give evidence of the likely cause of an injury to the complainant’s anus which was found on physical examination. During cross-examination of Dr Norrie, during the course of the trial, the following evidence was given:
	


“Q. The reality is that there are some females who do engage in anal sex; isn't that right?

A. Some females?

Q. Yes.

A. There are also some males to whom it's the preferred method.

Q. That's right, but I'm asking you please concentrate on females.

A. It's about 8% of women.

Q. When you say it's about 8%, what is about 8%?

A. That prefer anal intercourse.

Q. Whereabouts did you get that statistic from?

A. Margaret Stark, forensic medicine handbook.

Q. There is then, a percentage of the population, female population who do engage in that kind of sex; isn't that right?

A. I believe that it was a case of - from what I gather, [the complainant’s] mother did.

Q. I'm not asking you about her mother, I'm asking you as a broad proposition, there is a percentage of the female population who engages in that kind of sex; isn't that right?

A. I've answered that, Yes.” (T.418.9 – .32)


	
	When this evidence was given, counsel for the appellant sought a discharge of the jury. This application was refused by his Honour.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that his Honour was in error in failing to discharge the jury. The appellant submitted that the prejudice created by that answer was such that it could not be remedied by a direction from the trial judge. This was because Dr Norrie’s evidence left it open to the jury to draw an inference that the appellant had a predilection to engage in “anal sex with women”. This was never the subject of any tendency application by the Crown and would normally have been an impermissible course of reasoning. The appellant submitted that there was a further difficulty in allowing the trial to proceed. The introduction of the hearsay opinion as to the sexual practices, not of the complainant but of the mother, would excite speculation by the jury that anal sex with a female was the appellant’s preferred form of intercourse. This could be wrongly used by the jury to conclude that the allegations by the complainant of anal sex and attempted anal sex were more likely than not to be true, bearing in mind that the appellant engaged in sexual practices of this kind with his regular sexual partner, the mother.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the direction which his Honour gave to the jury in relation to this evidence was inadequate. The appellant submitted that with prejudicial evidence of this kind before the jury, the only fair thing the trial judge could do was to discharge the jury. His failure to do so meant that a miscarriage of justice occurred in that he did not have a trial according to law.
	


Consideration


	
	In rejecting the application for the discharge of the jury, his Honour said:
	


“Dr Norrie, during the course of cross-examination, was asked a question concerning the percentage of female population who engage in anal sex and replied that from what she understood the complainant's mother did also. Counsel for the accused submits that the evidence is prejudicial and cannot be cured by any direction of the Court. By inference, the jury could well conclude that the accused, who was the partner of the complainant's mother, engaged in penile/anal intercourse. Given the evidence that only a relatively small percentage of females engage in this type of sexual intercourse the jury may well use such evidence that is consistent with the complainant's account. The Crown submit however that the evidence could be cured by a redirection and note that there is no suggestion of lack of consent when compared with the present allegations. The evidence was hearsay and was in no way relevant to the witness's evidence.

Although, I would accept the evidence as prejudicial, I am of the view that it can be cured by an appropriate direction informing the jury that no such evidence is produced by the Crown nor is it intended to be produced by the Crown. The evidence was hearsay and was not relevant to the witness's testimony. The evidence will be struck from the record and I would ask the jury to disregard it. In those circumstances I am not persuaded that the jury, properly instructed, would not discharge its duties properly.

The application is refused.” ((R v Kapanadze (District Court, Townsden DCJ, 10 December 2014, unrep at 1-2)


	
	The direction given by his Honour to the jury was as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury thank you again for your patience. There was an issue that needed to be resolved – that now has in fact been resolved. Members of the jury there is an important direction that I need to give you at this stage. You may recall the evidence of Dr Norrie. At one stage during the course of cross-examination she was asked the question concerning the percentage of the population or female population engaged in the kind of sex that was referred to as “penile anal intercourse”. And she gave the response “I believe that it was a case from what I gather [the complainant’s] mother did”. Now, members of the jury no such evidence is produced by the Crown, nor is it intended to be produced by the Crown. The evidence was in fact hearsay and was not relevant to the witness’ testimony at all. The evidence will therefore be struck from the record and I will direct you as members of the jury to disregard that evidence totally. Thank you.” (T.471.3)


	
	His Honour did not refer to that evidence of Dr Norrie again, nor did counsel.
	
	
	The jury had been empanelled on Tuesday 2 December. Opening addresses were made and the complainant commenced giving her evidence on that day. She continued to give evidence until Friday 5 December after which her sister and a police officer gave evidence. Dr Norrie commenced giving evidence on Monday 8 December. It was during Dr Norrie’s cross-examination that the response under consideration was made. The application to discharge the jury was made on 10 December.
	
	
	An important consideration in that brief review of the progress of the trial is that the complainant had given her evidence over a considerable period of time and that substantial parts of that evidence involved matters of considerable sensitivity. Had the jury been discharged, as requested by counsel for the appellant, it may have been necessary for the complainant to give that evidence again in a subsequent trial. That was likely to have presented considerable difficulties for her.
	
	
	The question raised by this ground of appeal is whether the result of the refusal to discharge the jury has occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice (Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427 at 441; TO v R [2017] NSWCCA 12 (Price J with whom Button and Fagan JJ agreed) at [152]).
	
	
	In Qing An v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 53 Beazley P (with whom Hislop J agreed) identified the following factors as relevant to a consideration of whether there was a substantial miscarriage of justice arising from an irregularity in a trial:
	


“25   … the nature of the irregularity; the relevance of the irregularity to the issues before the jury; whether the material was prejudicial; and the extent of the prejudice. Given those considerations, the question was what was called for in the proper exercise of the discretion; namely, a discharge of the jury, or appropriate directions to the jury. That last matter in turn raised the question whether the directions given were adequate.”


	
	The impugned evidence from Dr Norrie was clearly prejudicial. It was, however, adduced not as part of the Crown case but as an unresponsive answer in cross-examination. There was no basis in the evidence available to the jury for Dr Norrie’s “belief”. It is quite properly to be described as “unattributed hearsay”. The trial judge gave an unqualified direction to the jury to ignore what Dr Norrie had said on that issue. The direction was not inadequate. It was clear and the reasons for it were explained to the jury. Once the direction was given, there was no need to return to the irregularity in the summing up. To have done so would have only exacerbated the potential problem created by the evidence.
	
	
	It is trite to observe that in the administration of the criminal law it must be accepted until the contrary is demonstrated that the jury accept and faithfully apply the judge’s directions. This has been stated on many occasions by the High Court. There is no indication that the jury in this case did not fully comply with his Honour’s directions.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 4:  His Honour failed to instruct the jury that in a case involving “word on word” between complainant and accused, the jury had to look closely at each individual count and in the event that they were not satisfied as to the complainant’s veracity in respect of one or more of the counts, they could use that in assessing her overall veracity – R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290.


	
	The appellant submitted that while his Honour did give a “Murray” type direction, because of the nature of this trial and the multiple allegations made, a direction in the nature of that set out in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 would have been appropriate and ought to have been given.
	


Consideration


	
	His Honour in fact did give a R v Markuleski direction in the following terms:
	


“I will now turn to the direction in relation to multiple counts and how they should be considered. Giving separate consideration to individual counts means that you are entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on other counts if there is a logical reason for that outcome. If you were to find the accused not guilty of any count, particularly if that was because you had doubts about the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, you would have to consider how that conclusion affected your consideration of the remaining counts.”


	
	No application for a redirection or modification to that direction was sought at the conclusion of the summing up. In those circumstances, no error has been identified. In any event, this was not a case where a R v Markuleski problem arose in that the jury found the appellant guilty of all counts.
	
	
	This ground has not been made out.
	


APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE


	
	Originally the applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal in relation to sentence:
	


Ground 6: The sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Townsden of the District Court on 21 August 2015 was manifestly excessive.

Ground 6A: His Honour erred when sentencing the offender in failing to find “special circumstances” due to the fact that it was his first time in custody and his prior good character.


	
	At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant abandoned Ground 6 and proceeded only in relation to Ground 6A.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that his age at the time of sentencing (51), absence of prior convictions and the fact that he had not been in custody before, required that a finding of special circumstances be made in his favour and that the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of sentence be adjusted accordingly. No further submissions were made.
	


Consideration


	
	The concept of “special circumstances” was considered by a five judge bench in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704. There, Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ agreed) said:
	


“59   The words “special circumstances” appear in numerous statutory provisions. They are words of indeterminate reference and will always take their colour from their surroundings. The sentencing context in which they appear in the present legislation must be understood against the background of a long-standing line of decisions in the High Court, commencing with Power, which emphasises that the non-parole period is to be determined by what the sentencing judge concludes that all of the circumstances of the case, including the need for rehabilitation, indicate ought be the minimum period of actual incarceration. The proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely, or primarily, by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has long since been rejected.

60   Statutory words of such generality usually lead courts to refuse to identify in advance a list of matters capable of satisfying the statutory formulation. While certain considerations might not often be sufficiently “special”, so that an exceptional justification is required for them to attain the requisite statutory quality, nevertheless there may always be circumstances in which such a factor is of sufficient strength, either alone or in combination with other factors, to justify a conclusion that “special circumstances” are made out on the facts of a particular case. It will be comparatively rare for an issue to arise in terms of a proposition that a particular circumstance is incapable, as a matter of law, of ever constituting a “special circumstance”.

61   The statutory proportion constitutes a ‘fetter’ or ‘constraint’ (to use the words of the Court in GDR, quoted above) on the exercise of what would otherwise be an unfettered and unconstrained discretion. It does not, however, alter the discretionary nature of the judgment for which the statute provides in s44(1)(b) of the 1999 Act, requiring the Court to fix a non-parole period, subject to s45 of the Act.

62    The issues of law that may arise are the same as those which arise on appeal from other discretionary decisions, including whether or not, on the facts of a particular case, a specific fact, matter or circumstance is, either alone or in combination with other facts, matters and circumstances, capable of constituting “special circumstances” of the requisite character, i.e. that it is capable of justifying a variation in the statutory proportion which the legislature has enacted.

63    More significantly, there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.”


	
	At [73] the Chief Justice said:
	


“73    One practical effect of the statutory proportion has been to create a field of disputation which enables matters of fact and judgment to be expressed as if they constituted propositions of law. This arises only because the fetter is expressed in words which suggest a legal standard. It will be a very rare case in which there is no fact capable as a matter of law, of constituting a “special circumstance”. The decision is first one of fact – to identify the circumstances - and, secondly, one of judgment – to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.”


	
	The three matters identified by the appellant could, with some qualifications, have been taken into account by the sentencing judge as “special circumstances”. His Honour was not obliged to do so. It was a matter fully within his sentencing discretion as to whether his Honour would so find. In the exercise of that discretion, his Honour declined to make any such finding.
	
	
	In order to challenge his Honour’s decision on that issue, it is necessary to identify error of the kind in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The appellant has made no attempt to identify such error.
	
	
	In Regina v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 Spigelman CJ (with whom RS Hulme and Adams JJ agreed) said at [22]:
	


“   … Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a “special circumstance” does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. To repeat what was said in Simpson at [68], it is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special to justify a variation.”


	
	In this case there is an added difficulty for the appellant. One of the matters relied upon by him for justifying a finding of special circumstances is his otherwise “good character”. It has been said by this Court on many occasions that less weight is to be given to good character in sexual offences against a minor since it is that very good character which has often enabled an offender to get access to the victim. Given the repeated nature of the appellant’s offending in this case, his character was not of such a kind as to warrant a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	In relation to the other two factors identified, the fact that this is his first time in custody does not necessarily amount to special circumstances (Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [36] per McClellan CJ at CL (R A Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing).
	
	
	Similarly, the appellant’s age was not of particular significance. The appellant has not shown that imprisonment would be more onerous for him on account of his age, nor that his health or life expectancy had any bearing on the assessment of the sentence.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	In relation to the conviction appeal, I would refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules for the appellant to rely upon Ground 1 and I would dismiss the appeal in relation to Grounds 2 and 4.
	
	
	In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	WALTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I am in general agreement with Hoeben CJ at CL that none of the grounds of appeal against conviction or sentence can succeed. The appeal against conviction should be dismissed and leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.
	


Ground 1 (admissibility of evidence of the complainant's mother as tendency evidence)


	
	The complaint in relation to this ground is confined to the evidence of the complainant's mother. The Crown relied upon the evidence of the complainant (her interview of 18.7.12 at Q 283-291) of being sexually assaulted by the appellant in the shed in the backyard of the home on multiple occasions and upon the corroborative evidence of the complainant's mother in relation to one such incident. The trial judge ruled that such evidence by both the complainant and her mother was admissible as tendency evidence (see the passage of the judgment quoted by Hoeben CJ at CL at [51]).
	
	
	Four issues were raised by counsel for the appellant in relation to this ground.
	
	
	First, there was a complaint about evidence of the mother witnessing what counsel described as a ""violent confrontation"" between the appellant and the complainant on some other occasion (T482.40 – 483.20). This was not part of the tendency evidence led by the Crown and, accordingly, was not relevant to this ground of appeal. It was admissible nevertheless for the reasons given by Hoeben CJ at CL at [54]-[57].)
	
	
	Secondly, reference was made to evidence by the complainant's mother (at T493.40 – 496.15) of a complaint made by the complainant about the incident with which Counts 2 to 4 were concerned. This has nothing to do with the correctness or otherwise of the ruling on the admissibility of tendency evidence. The mother's evidence on this topic was admissible evidence of complaint (per s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and see Hoeben CJ at CL at [67].) The fact that the passage of evidence commenced with an unresponsive answer to the prosecutor's question (""Have you ever witnessed a sexual assault upon [the complainant] by Mr Kapanadze?"") is irrelevant.
	
	
	Thirdly, reference was made to the evidence by the complainant's mother about witnessing her daughter and the appellant together in the shed (see the extract in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [60]). Counsel for the appellant submitted that this evidence was not admissible as tendency evidence because it was what the mother had been told, not what she had seen (AWS p. 4.9). The proposition must be rejected; the evidence was quite clearly an account of what the mother had seen for herself.
	
	
	A related complaint was that this evidence ""did not warrant a tendency direction as was given by his Honour at SU 28"" and the judge thereby misdirected the jury and encouraged them to use the evidence in an impermissible manner (AWS p. 4.9). This proposition must also be rejected. The judge gave a standard tendency direction concerning the evidence of both the complainant and her mother about the shed incident. In the course of this, he briefly reminded the jury (in a single sentence) that the complainant had later made a complaint to her mother about the incident (SU 28-29).
	
	
	In oral submissions, counsel contended that the shed incident amounted to ""context evidence"" but it was not ""tendency evidence"" because ""it doesn't show a tendency to do anything"". The point was not developed beyond that bare assertion. The tendency asserted by the Crown was that the appellant ""had a sexual interest in the complainant and was willing to act upon it in the way that the complainant alleges"" (SU 28.4). The evidence of what occurred in the shed was capable of supporting a finding of such a tendency. Having regard to the fact that its source was not simply the complainant (cf IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 257 CLR 300) it had significant probative value (for the purposes of s 97(1)(b) of the Evidence Act) having regard to the issues in the trial (the defence case being that no sexual improprieties occurred at all).
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant accepted that the mother's evidence was corroborative of her daughter's evidence concerning this incident and submitted that if the mother's evidence had been put to the jury as such there would be no complaint (29.3.17 at T3.24 – 4.2). It is difficult to understand this point in circumstances where the shed incident went to the jury as tendency evidence and the jury was reminded that the complainant had given evidence of it, as had her mother (SU 28). There is no merit in this aspect of the appellant’s argument.
	
	
	The final issue concerned evidence given by the complainant's mother about the cessation of her relationship with the appellant and the two no longer sleeping together. As with the first two issues, this has nothing to do with the admissibility of tendency evidence. Moreover, despite what was said in written submissions, counsel conceded at the hearing that this evidence ""was always going to be admissible"" (29.3.17 at T5.16)
	
	
	As part of the third issue was the subject of the objection raised at trial, I would not refuse the appellant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Nevertheless, this ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 2 (refusal to discharge jury)


	
	I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the trial judge's determination to deal with this issue by way of striking out the evidence, directing the jury to disregard it and refusing to discharge the jury did not occasion a miscarriage of justice.
	


Ground 4 (failure to give Markuleski direction)


	
	I would refuse leave for the appellant to rely upon this ground pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules for the simple reason that it is completely baseless. The direction was in fact given. Moreover, having regard to the fact that the verdicts were all guilty, the jury cannot have doubted the complainant's credibility in respect of any of the counts in the indictment.
	


Ground 6A (failure to find special circumstances)


	
	It was contended in written submissions that age, prior good character and no prior imprisonment entitled the appellant to a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant acknowledged at the hearing that this was a discretionary matter but argued that the primary judge was ""bound"" to make such a finding. No authority was cited for this contention, which is unsurprising; it is simply untenable.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against conviction on Ground 4 refused.

2. Appeal against conviction on Grounds 1 and 2 dismissed.

3. Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The applicant was convicted after a trial by a jury before Judge Norton SC in the District Court of New South Wales of one count of sexual intercourse with a child aged under 10, contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).


	
	On 2 June 2016 the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a Crown appeal and re-sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing 6 November 2015 and expiring 5 November 2019, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 5 November 2021 (R v ND [2016] NSWCCA 103).
	
	
	The applicant appeals against his conviction pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), upon the following ground:
	


Ground 1: The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence


	
	As this ground of appeal does not involve a question of law, the applicant requires leave to appeal against conviction (Rasic v R; Johnny Lee Vella v R; Damien Charles Vella v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]).
	


Summary of Crown and defence cases

Crown case


	
	At the time of the offence, the complainant was aged 5 years and 10 months and the applicant was aged 28 years. The applicant's wife (SD) was the sister of the complainant's mother (JH). The two families lived nearby and often visited one another.
	
	
	On Tuesday 14 September 2004, the complainant went on a school excursion to a wildlife park. The complainant's mother later took the complainant and her sister (C) to the applicant's home. The applicant was at home with his wife and two sons. The complainant's mother and C went out with the applicant's wife, leaving the complainant at the applicant’s home.
	
	
	The applicant was drinking beer and watching TV in his lounge room. He indicated for the complainant to sit on his lap. The applicant rubbed her leg and then put his hand up her school uniform skirt and beneath her underwear. He put a finger into her vagina and moved it around for about two minutes, which hurt. The applicant withdrew his finger when he heard the car return with his wife and the complainant's mother. The complainant went to play with her cousins, the applicant’s two sons.
	
	
	In the first half of either 2010 or 2012 (the date is disputed), the complainant and her cousin, TS, were at their grandmother's house. The complainant told TS what the applicant had done. TS told the complainant to tell her mother but she said she did not want to get into trouble.
	
	
	On 6 September 2012, the complainant's mother found the complainant was missing. She retrieved the complainant's diary from her car. An entry in the diary stated that the complainant had been raped at 6 years of age. The complainant's mother phoned police, who found the complainant at her grandmother's house.
	
	
	The following week, the complainant's mother spoke to the complainant about the diary entry. The complainant said that it related to an incident with the applicant at his house when the mother went out. The mother reported the matter to police. The complainant participated in a recorded interview with police on 2 October 2012.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 21 November 2013. The applicant participated in a recorded interview with police.
	


The defence case


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at trial. The defence case relied upon the applicant's account in the recorded interview with police, in which he denied the offence. The applicant also denied in the interview any recollection of an occasion when the complainant visited his home in her school uniform, or when his wife and the complainant's mother went out leaving the complainant with him.
	
	
	The defence case advanced evidence of an alibi. The applicant's wife gave evidence that the applicant attended baseball practice with his son every Tuesday evening in 2004. Other evidence confirmed that baseball practice took place every Tuesday evening in 2004.
	


Summary of evidence at trial


	
	In her recorded interview with police (MFI 3), the complainant said that she was 6 years of age at the time of the incident. Her family used to visit the applicant's home in Bidwell all the time. On the day of the incident, her mother, sister and aunt went out, leaving her at home with the applicant and his sons. Her mother and aunt were both pregnant with their youngest children, D and K, at the time.
	
	
	The complainant said that the applicant was drinking, was drunk and that he could not stand up or walk. It was just after school, and she had her school uniform on, which consisted of a skirt, shirt, singlet and joggers. The applicant asked her to sit on his lap and started to ""finger"" her. The applicant started to rub her leg, then put his hands up her skirt and into her undies. It did not feel very nice and it hurt. It went on for a few minutes, she tried to get off the applicant but he grabbed her arm.
	
	
	The complainant said that the applicant stopped when he heard SD and her mother return in the car. They were only gone a few minutes. She thought they went in her mother's car. She thought it was early in the week. It would have been a Tuesday because she went on a school excursion to a farm that day. Her teacher at the time was Mr Pearce. The applicant’s sons were in their rooms playing and it was getting dark outside. She was watching TV and thought the program was called “Dragon Ball Z”. She did not tell anyone until she told TS, about two years before, when they were in TS's room watching TV. The complainant was aged 13 when she made her statement to police.
	
	
	The complainant was aged 16 at trial. The complainant said that she wrote in her diary that she had been raped at age 6. She did not recall when she wrote it, but it was about a month before her mother found it and they spoke about it. She was having nightmares and thought writing it down might help her forget. She told TS about it before she wrote the diary entry. Her memory was worse at the time she gave evidence at trial than when she was interviewed.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the complainant said that she regularly went to the applicant's house. She went there most weekends for barbecues. After the incident, the family still went there, but she did not go by herself. She had sleepovers but not straight after the incident. She made sure that she was never alone with the applicant. She agreed that there was an occasion when she asked SD to pick her up from high school and asked if she could stay at the applicant's house. On the same day that her mother got married, there was a naming ceremony. SD was present. She did not recall who nominated SD as her guardian.
	
	
	The complainant believed the incident occurred on a Tuesday because she had been on a school excursion. Tuesday was her favourite day of the week, although she did not say so in her interview. This was because on Tuesdays she always got ice cream from her grandmother after school. She agreed that she had not said that to the police and said it for the first time in court. They drove to the applicant's house in her mother's car. She stayed in the lounge room until the incident. The applicant's sons were in the next room. When she watched her recorded interview, she recalled that she said that her mother and aunt were only gone a few minutes but now believed it was an hour or two.
	
	
	The complainant said that the incident occurred in the late afternoon. The sun was going down. She agreed “night time” was wrong. She agreed that she wrote in her diary “I will never forget that night” and meant to convey that it happened at night. She said that it was late afternoon, the sun was setting and it was getting dark. She agreed the diary entry was wrong. She agreed that in the interview she said that both her mother and aunt were pregnant and her aunt was more advanced but her recollection was wrong because her brother was born first. On school nights, she went to bed at 8.00pm. She had doubts about whether “Dragon Ball Z” was on TV at the time of the incident. She would not have been watching TV at the applicant's home at 9.00pm on a school night. This was because on school nights she went to bed at 8pm.
	
	
	She used the term ""raped"" in her diary because that was the only way she could describe it. She agreed that, when she spoke to police the same year, she said that the applicant ""fingered"" her. She had no doubt she was at TS's house in TS’s room when she complained to her.
	
	
	JH, the complainant’s mother, gave evidence that she had three children; the complainant who was the oldest, born in 1998, C born in 2001 and D born in 2004. At the time of the alleged offence, D was aged seven months and she was not pregnant. Their home was not far from that of the applicant. The complainant’s grandmother (JH’s mother) lived across the road from the applicant’s house. The complainant’s family saw the applicant's family regularly during 2004 and they went to his house for barbecues. The grandmother commonly picked the complainant up from school and JH would then collect the complainant from the grandmother’s house. It was unusual for either her or the complainant to go to the applicant’s house during the week.
	
	
	JH married on 13 November 2004. A naming ceremony for the children was held the same day. The applicant and SD were there. SD was nominated as the complainant's guardian. She was quite close to SD at the time. A certificate confirmed the date of the naming day. SD was in photos from the ceremony. Photos showed the applicant and his family attending the complainant's birthday party in November 2004. The families continued to have contact until about May 2005 when JH went to hospital for surgery. At that time, the complainant stayed with the applicant's family on at least one night. JH did not drive during 2004.
	
	
	She and SD would at times go out in the car together leaving the complainant at the applicant's home. The complainant would have been at the applicant's house in her school uniform at times. The two families stopped seeing each other after JH had surgery in May 2005.
	
	
	On 6 September 2012, the complainant went missing from their home. JH called the police, because her clothing and other things were missing. She found the complainant's diary, which contained a note stating, ""At age six I was raped"". Police later found the complainant at her grandmother's home. JH collected the complainant but did not speak with her about the diary entry until about a week later. The complainant said she was raped on an occasion when she was at the applicant's house wearing her school uniform. While telling JH this, the complainant was very upset and in tears.
	
	
	In cross-examination, JH denied that there had been a falling out between the families over money following a relative's death. She agreed that she had issues with gambling and drug addiction, but this was after 2004. The families were still close in 2004. She remembered only two specific occasions when she and SD left the complainant with the applicant. This was when she was pregnant with her son.
	
	
	In re-examination JH said that she had a learner’s driving permit in 2004 which she had to renew twice because it had expired. She did not obtain her provisional licence until 2005.
	
	
	Detective Bedford was the initial officer in charge of the investigation. Information from Bidwill Public School confirmed that the complainant was enrolled in kindergarten in 2004 and her teacher was Mr Pearce. The class went on an excursion to Featherdale Farm in September 2004. Birth certificates confirmed that the complainant would have been aged 5 years and 10 months in September 2004. Photocopies were made of the complainant’s diary but it was subsequently lost.
	
	
	Detective Parker later became the officer in charge. The applicant attended Mt Druitt Police Station at her request on 21 November 2013. He was arrested and participated in a recorded interview. A calendar confirmed 14 September 2004 was a Tuesday. Detective Parker went through the applicant’s service record to confirm when he was out of the country. Immigration records confirmed that the applicant departed Australia on 20 July 2003 and returned 11 November 2003.
	
	
	TS and the complainant were cousins. They would see each other occasionally. TS recalled a conversation which she had with the complainant in 2012. She said that she remembered it was 2012 because she was working at Pizza Hut, having commenced there in July 2012. She and the complainant were sitting alone on the back step of her grandmother’s house when the complainant told her that when she went to the applicant’s house, he used to touch her. She said “I think it happened a couple of times … the main thing that she mentioned was [that the applicant] fingered her”. The complainant did not say when it had happened. She just said it was years before. The complainant told her that when she went there, the applicant “had put his hands down her pants”. TS told the complainant that she should tell her mother. The complainant said that she was scared that she was going to get into trouble and was scared to say anything.
	


Evidence called in the defence case


	
	The applicant said in his recorded interview with police on 21 November 2013 that he believed he was not in the country at the time of the offence. He was in the military and had been deployed to the Middle East, although he was not sure when. When police advised that service records confirmed that he returned in 2003, the applicant accepted that those records were correct.
	
	
	The families had disagreements and did not see much of each other at times. The complainant and her family came to his home for a few barbecues. He would only have seen the complainant and her siblings in school uniform if he visited their home. He did not recall any time when he was left to care for the complainant and his two sons. He had a few beers after work but not too much. He might have had about six beers, as he was a heavy drinker at the time. He might have had the complainant sit on his lap and put his hand there but would not have touched her. He denied that he put his finger in the complainant's vagina and moved his finger about. It did not sound like him.
	
	
	SD was the wife of the applicant. She had known the applicant and had been in a relationship with him since 1994. They were married in 2003 and had four sons. Her relationship with her youngest sister, JH, was not good. She stopped socialising with her after a dispute about money in late 2003 or early 2004. SD said that she and JH stopped talking to each other at the end of 2003 and they did not have any family visits after that. She said that JH had a gambling problem. The families did not visit each other when she was pregnant although they visited her mother across the road.
	
	
	SD said that in 2004 her oldest son had baseball training on Tuesday night. During that time, there were no occasions when they were visited by JH with her children. There were no occasions when she might have left the house to go somewhere (either for a few minutes or an hour or two) with her sister and her sister’s daughter C. She had her son to care for and he was with her all the time. She did not remember any occasions in 2004 when the complainant was left at her home with her two sons.
	
	
	In relation to baseball training on Tuesday nights, as a matter of routine they would leave home at 4.30pm, arriving at training at 5.00pm. It took about half an hour to drive there. The applicant attended training every single week. He used to stop there on his way home from work so that SD could take the other children home. The applicant and his son would later return home at about 6.30pm.
	
	
	In cross-examination SD said that she when she found out about the allegation, following her husband’s arrest, she was hurt and upset. She denied discussing the allegation with her husband. She denied ever talking to him about what was in the police brief. She learned of the specific date of the alleged offence through Detective Parker who took a statement from her.
	
	
	It was suggested that she would not have any specific reason to remember 14 September 2004 and what she did that day. She agreed that she had no independent memory of that day. She agreed that she was trying to reconstruct her memory. When she learned of the allegation she started to think about it and to piece the bits back together. This was from the time of the applicant’s interview. It was a few months later, towards the end of 2013 near Christmas, that she remembered where her husband was on 14 September 2004 and she informed his lawyers. 14 September 2004 was a Tuesday and SD said that in 2004 at that time of year, every single Tuesday her son had baseball training.
	
	
	It was suggested that SD was reconstructing her memory in order to meet the allegation against the applicant and that any memory she had was just a reconstruction based on her routine and normal practice and not a specific independent recollection of each day. She denied this and said that she knew that the applicant was there on that day.
	
	
	SD was taken to her statement to Detective Parker on 20 August 2015 in which she said that she had nothing to do with JH’s children in 2004. Various photographs of the wedding and the naming ceremony which she had attended were shown to her. She agreed that she had wanted to make sure in the statement that she paint as strong a picture as possible that the allegation could never have happened in 2004 because she had nothing to do with JH’s children in that year. She admitted that what she said or that subject was untrue and a lie.
	
	
	SD gave evidence that what she had said in her statement with regard to the complainant never being inside her house at Bidwell was true. She said that between 2002 and 2015 the complainant was never inside her house. She denied that the complainant had sleep overs at her house. She denied that the complainant’s family came around to her house for barbeques. SD said that she did not have a good relationship with her sister. She denied that JH had ever provided help to her by looking after her newborn baby son, K, a couple of times (he needed a high degree of care, having been born prematurely) just so that she could have some time to herself and a shower.
	
	
	SD said that she did not socialise with her sister in 2004, despite photographs showing her present at the wedding. She did not speak to her sister at either the naming ceremony or the wedding ceremony. She attended the naming ceremony only. Both events were at the same place and on the same day and she was present for both of them. She did not get an invitation to the wedding, but attended the naming ceremony which was straight after the wedding.
	
	
	SD disagreed that her sister did not have drug or gambling problems in 2004, or that they arose at some time after 2004. SD informed her husband’s lawyer about her sister’s drug use, gambling and money problems. SD denied that she was trying to tarnish her sister’s reputation by giving evidence that these problems occurred in 2004.
	
	
	SD denied that there were any occasions when she might have left the applicant with her two older sons after he had come home from work. She followed a set routine and after picking up the children from school, would remain home and not go out after 5pm on a work night, except for their sporting days which was the only time that she would go out after that time. SD did agree that sometimes routines could change. SD denied that in 2004 there was such an occasion when she went out with her sister and left the complainant at her house.
	


Crown case in reply


	
	Rodney Woolard was called in reply by the Crown. He was a teacher and started coaching children's sport at the Rooty Hill Baseball Club in 1997. He was coaching there in 2004. The Club would hold training at Peter Van Hassal Park in Wilmot. He was unsure of how many teams he was coaching in 2004. Training took place on Tuesday or Thursday nights starting at around 4.30pm and finishing about 5.30pm. The training could be shorter or longer, it depended on what they were doing. Normally it was for about an hour. He did not keep any records of the children who showed up for training. The name of the applicant’s oldest son was familiar, but he was not sure if that was because of baseball training or his association with him as a teacher. He did not remember the child and had no recollection of the parents.
	
	
	In cross-examination he agreed that sometimes training could start later than 4.30pm and that sometimes he would speak to the teams at the end of training. In re-examination he said that most pre-season training was done in August but that training would have been the same as during the season. The season itself usually commenced in September.
	
	
	A Foxtel program guide admitted in evidence stated that the program “Dragon Ball Z” was not broadcast on 14 September 2004 and that the program “Dragon Ball GT” was broadcast at 9pm on that date.
	


The appeal


	
	The applicant submitted that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence on the basis that central features of the complainant’s account of the circumstances in which the offence was said to have occurred, could not be reconciled with other facts established by the evidence.
	
	
	The applicant summarised the central features of the complainant’s account as follows. When she was aged six and attending kindergarten at Bidwell Public School, after a school excursion to a farm, she went with her mother and sister to the applicant’s home. Her mother and sister went out with her aunt. Her mother and aunt were pregnant at the time. The complainant was left alone with the applicant and it is in those circumstances that it is alleged the offence occurred.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that other evidence established that the excursion to the farm must have occurred on 14 September 2004. If it is assumed, as it was at trial, that this was the date of the offence a number of what were submitted to be central features of the complainant’s account were irreconcilable with facts established by other evidence.
	
	
	Firstly, the complainant was not 6 years of age at that time but 5 years and 10 months. Secondly, neither her mother nor her aunt were pregnant. These were matters about which the complainant was quite unequivocal in her account in the record of interview to police which comprised her evidence in chief. The applicant gave evidence that her mother had driven to the premises where the offence occurred. The evidence of her mother confirmed that she was not driving at that time.
	
	
	Not only was the complainant’s aunt not pregnant but she had recently given birth to a child, KD, in July 2004. That child was said to be a high needs baby because he had been born prematurely and was barely two months old at the time. There was an absence of support in the evidence of the complainant’s mother in that she could only remember two occasions when the complainant was left at the applicant’s home when she went out with her sister. Both of those occasions were when she was pregnant and those were both likely to be on a weekend rather than on a school day.
	
	
	In addition to the difficulty of reconciling the central features of the complainant’s account with other facts established by the evidence, there were internal inconsistencies in the complainant’s account. In her interview with police, which was conducted in 2012, eight years after the events, she said that her mother, aunt and sister were only out for a few minutes. In evidence at trial, which was in 2015, she said that that was wrong and that the complainant’s mother, aunt and sister were out for an hour or two. There was a degree of inconsistency regarding her account of the time of day that the incident occurred. In her interview and in evidence she said that it was late afternoon or that it was getting dark. The diary entry recorded that the incident happened “at night”. The complainant conceded in cross-examination that in that entry she had sought to convey that the incident occurred at night, i.e. when it was dark.
	
	
	In her interview, the complainant said that when she was left alone with the applicant, he was watching television and that she thought the program they were watching was called “Dragon Ball Z”. There was other evidence that established that a program of similar name “Dragon Ball GT” was aired that night but not until 9pm. The complainant and her mother gave evidence that the complainant’s bedtime was 8pm on school nights and that she would not have been at the applicant’s home at that time on a school night.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there were additional difficulties in accepting the reliability of the complainant as a witness generally, having regard to the differences between her account of the circumstances in which she made her first complaint to her cousin TS and the evidence of TS. When interviewed in 2012 the complainant said that the first complaint had been made a couple of years previously, i.e. previous to the interview in 2012. She said that it occurred when she was in TS’s bedroom watching television. TS gave evidence to the effect that the complaint had been made in circumstances where they were on TS’s grandmother’s back step and that it had been made only a few months before the complainant gave her account in the police interview. TS was able to say this because she recalled that she was working at Pizza Hut at the time, i.e. in 2012.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that taken together, those matters established that the complainant’s account of what happened was unreliable.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [23] where the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) said:
	


“23   It was not sufficient to say that the complainant's account of the incidents was sufficiently particular to enable a jury to accept it. The complainant's evidence as to when they occurred was also part of her account and, potentially at least, a matter by which her other evidence fell to be considered. It may be that the argument of the applicant on the appeal, which focussed upon the complainant's nomination of the evening of 23 December as the date of the last two offences and then as one of many ""jury points"", served to distract the attention of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Observing that the complainant had not been dogmatic about 23 December may not have sufficiently overcome her identification of the days before Christmas as essential to her recollection. These were matters to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal.”


	
	The applicant submitted that these observations by the plurality were applicable to this Court’s consideration of the appeal. The applicant submitted that it was necessary for the Court to ascertain the date when it was alleged that the offence was committed in order to properly weigh the whole of the evidence in the trial in order to determine whether or not it was open to the jury to find the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt. The applicant submitted that it was not sufficient to point to the fact that the complainant was young at the time of the alleged offence and had to recall those events in interviews eights years after they were said to have occurred. The applicant submitted that the question was whether, despite those difficulties presented to the prosecution, the evidence of the complaint was demonstrably reliable such that it was open to find that the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in summary once the date of the alleged offence was ascertained so as to enable an assessment of whether or not it was open on the whole of the evidence to find the offence proved beyond a reasonable doubt, it is clear that the complainant’s evidence was unreliable. In those circumstances the only conclusion is that the verdict was not reasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. Since there was no reason to anticipate that the situation would be different at any retrial, the only appropriate order was one of acquittal.
	


Consideration


	
	The task of this Court in appeals of this kind was set out by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) in SKA v The Queen where their Honours said:
	


“The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11   It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

“Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”.

12   This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as ‘cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence’.""

13   The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

“In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

…

14   In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

“In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ‘none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	The jury clearly rejected the evidence of SD. Not only was that evidence patently false on certain issues, in particular the level of association between the two families during 2004, but SD conceded under cross-examination that in her statement to police she wanted to put forward as strong a picture as she could, that the offence could not have happened in 2004 (T.163.1). In that regard, it is significant that the applicant in submissions, did not at any time rely upon the uncorroborated evidence of SD to cast doubt upon that of the complainant. In particular, no reliance was placed upon the alibi of baseball training on a Tuesday night in September of 2004.
	
	
	In the way in which the trial was conducted it was accepted by both sides that it was an essential part of the Crown case that the evidence establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed on the date alleged, i.e. 14 September 2004.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of the date of the offending, the facts of this case are different to those in SKA in an important way. On the rehearing before this Court (SKA v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 205) the majority on this point (Adams and Hislop JJ) noted that the applicant there had called alibi evidence in respect of the occasions nominated by the complainant for when the offences occurred. They held that the date of those offences was an essential element in the Crown case and that the alibi evidence, which was not challenged by the Crown, precluded the applicant from being able to commit the offences on the dates alleged by the complainant (SKA v Regina at [315] – [318]).
	
	
	In contrast, the alibi evidence in this case was challenged effectively by the Crown. Accordingly, the evidence as to the date on which the offending occurred which had to be assessed, was that of the complainant. It is for that reason that the applicant’s submissions focused on what he asserted was the unreliability of the complainant’s evidence generally and as to particular matters identified in his submissions. This was not a case where there was objective (or unchallenged) evidence establishing that the offence could not have taken place on 14 September 2004.
	
	
	The reliability of the complainant’s evidence that the offence took place on that day fell to be considered as part of her overall account of events and the reliability of that account. The issue before the jury and this Court was whether the matters raised by the applicant were of such significance, when considered collectively, as to give rise to a doubt that the jury should have experienced about the complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	The way in which the complainant identified the date of the offending is important. She did not remember what time of the year it was when the offence occurred, but she did remember that it was early in the week and “it would have been a Tuesday” because she had been on a school excursion to a farm with “like, a weird name” (Q. & A. 65 – 69). The complainant recalled being in kindergarten with a teacher, Mr Pearce. Subsequent investigations revealed that the complainant’s kindergarten class, taught by Mr Pearce, had been on an excursion to the Featherdale Wildlife Park on Tuesday, 14 September 2014.
	
	
	The complainant did not adamantly adhere to any particular account of events which was demonstrably inconsistent with the offending having occurred on 14 September 2004. There were a number of matters upon which she accepted that she might have been inaccurate or imprecise. While the complainant did initially nominate “Dragon Ball Z” as the cartoon she was watching at the time of the offence, she used the expression “I think” in the police interview. In cross-examination she agreed that she was not certain that it was that particular cartoon that she was watching.
	
	
	Similarly, the evidence of the complainant concerning the time of day when the offending occurred was not internally inconsistent. The diary entry (which was written when she was aged 13) was “I will never forget that night”. Her evidence at trial was that it was late afternoon with the sun going down when the offence occurred. When cross-examined about that evidence, the complainant agreed that she had used different descriptions but expressed the view that there was not a significant difference between them.
	
	
	The evidence was:
	


“Q. And you wrote that I would suggest to you “I’ll never forget that night” because you were intending to convey that it happened at night?

A. It was late afternoon it just went - it was dark when it happened.

Q. You say it was dark when it happened?

A. The sun was going down when I got there.

Q. Well [complainant] was it dark, was it getting dark, or was it night?

A. When I arrived there the sun was like nearly gone so yes it was night.

Q. I thought you said it was late afternoon as part of your answers to me?

A. Isn’t that the same thing.

Q. I don’t know I’m asking you the question.

HER HONOUR: No, it only works if questions are asked and then you give answers because otherwise the system doesn’t work. It’s nearly 4 o’clock, we’ll be going home at 4 o’clock for the day but if you could just try and concentrate on the questions [complainant], okay.

…

Q. [Complainant] your answer in the record of interview was that it was getting dark, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Your answer to me a few questions ago just before we turned the screen off was that the sun was setting but it was late afternoon, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Sorry, I beg your pardon?

A. I said “Yes”.

Q. And your diary entry says “I’ll never forget that night”?

A. Yes.

Q. And you wrote “I will never forget that night” because I suggest to you you’re trying to convey that it happened at night?

A. Yes.

Q. So in your diary an entry which was made in the year that you spoke to the police you say that it was night, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Well which of those answers that you’ve given today “it was late afternoon, the sun was setting, it was getting dark, it was dark, it was night” which of those is correct?

A. It was getting dark.” (T.47.25 – 48.22)


	
	The difference between “it was getting dark” and the statement “I will never forget that night” are not matters of such import as would lead me to regard the complainant as unreliable. This is particularly so when the evidence came from a witness who at the age of 13 made the relevant entry in her diary and in the interview with the police said “it was getting dark”. This was evidence of observations made 8 years before when the complainant was aged 5 years and 10 months. I do not regard her evidence on that point as unreliable. It was open to the jury to reach a similar conclusion, i.e. that there was not a significant difference between the two statements in relation to which the complainant was being cross-examined given the circumstances in which the observation was made.
	
	
	The same can be said about the complainant’s recollection of her age at the time of the offending. The complainant recorded in her diary at “age 6 I was raped”. In fact she was aged 5 years and 10 months. The jury might well have regarded that as a distinction without a difference, particularly because children often describe themselves as older than they are, e.g. when asked their age it is not unusual for a young child to respond “almost six”. I do not regard that apparent “inconsistency” as a matter of importance.
	
	
	The complainant freely conceded that she was mistaken in some of the evidence she gave. She accepted that at the time of the incident, neither her aunt nor her mother was pregnant, her mother having given birth in February of 2004. Similarly, the complainant did not assert in dogmatic terms that the cartoon which she was watching was “Dragon Ball Z”. Rather the terminology she used was that she thought that this was the cartoon she was watching. In cross-examination she accepted in both cases that she might have been mistaken.
	
	
	In relation to such matters, it needs to be remembered that the surrounding circumstances of the offence, i.e. whether her aunt and mother were pregnant at the time and who was driving the car were being perceived by a child aged five years and 10 months and then recalled by a 13 year old child more than seven years later and then again when she was aged 16 during the course of the trial. In those circumstances, some inaccuracies might well be expected. It would be extraordinary if there were not such inaccuracies.
	
	
	The complainant’s apparent mistake as to her mother driving the car on 14 September 2004 is readily understandable when one has regard to the whole of the evidence. While her mother did not have her licence at that time, she did have a driving permit which had been renewed and she was driving in 2005 and subsequently. There were occasions at this time when the complainant’s grandmother (who lived opposite the applicant) would pick her up from school and then drive her home. Also during 2004 both SD and JH’s husband (her then partner) were driving vehicles in which the complainant travelled. However the complainant was transported to the applicant’s house, it is clear that there were occasions in 2004 when she was at his home after school in her school uniform (T.84.22). Apart from SD whose evidence was unreliable on this issue, there was no evidence to the contrary.
	
	
	The fact that JH could only remember two specific occasions when she left the complainant at the applicant’s home and went out with her sister SD says more about JH’s memory than that of the complainant. Keeping in mind the difficulties which JH subsequently experienced with drugs, that evidence meant no more than that JH could not remember another occasion, not that another occasion did not occur. Put another way, it went no further than a submission that JH’s evidence did not corroborate that of the complainant on this issue, not that it contradicted it (T.104.1 – .19).
	
	
	The complainant’s recollection enabled 14 September 2004 to be identified with some particularity. She remembered the name of her teacher, Mr Pearce; she remembered that she was in kindergarten; and she remembered that she had been on a school excursion to a farm with a “like, a weird name” on the day on which the offending occurred. These recollections are consistent with what one would expect from a child aged 5 years and 10 months rather than the more general background material in relation to which the complainant’s testimony was challenged.
	
	
	It is true that there was an inconsistency between the evidence of TS and that of the complainant as to where they were at the time complaint was made and the date on which complaint was made. Apart from the fact that TS was older than the complainant, and was able to remember the date by reference to her working at Pizza Hut, having commenced there in July 2012, there was nothing else to suggest that the evidence on these issues by TS was to be preferred to that of the complainant. Importantly, however, their evidence as to the content of the complaint was the same. There was no exaggeration. TS’s evidence as to what she was told by the complainant was in accordance with the transcript of the complainant’s interview with police and with the complaint to JH.
	
	
	Inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence or variations among the Crown witnesses about matters such as how long the complainant was left alone with the applicant on the occasion of the offence or precisely where and when the complainant made her complaint to her cousin, TS, are in essence peripheral matters. They are examples of matters which might well not be fully remembered by a child who had no particular reason to direct her attention to them. They are not matters which one would expect a child aged 5 years and 10 months to remember accurately, particularly after the effluxion of more than 7 years.
	
	
	What is important is the consistency of recollection of what occurred during the offending. There is no inconsistency between what is contained in the police statement, the complaint to TS and the complaint to JH. The differences to which the applicant has referred were in relation to peripheral detail and even then the differences were not great. They went no further than mistakes as to the pregnancies, whether the mother drove and the location and circumstances of the complaint to TS. The asserted inconsistencies as to her age and the time of day involved minor discrepancies at most.
	
	
	The jury saw and heard each of the witnesses and in particular the complainant whose credibility and reliability was of the utmost importance. The issue of her reliability was stressed not only by counsel in their addresses, but in the summing up. In circumstances where there were aspects of the evidence which were in some respects inconsistent, considerable weight has to be given to the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the witnesses to resolve those inconsistencies. By way of illustration, the jury were in a far better position to assess the responses of the complainant and the extent to which she understood questions or was becoming tired when giving her evidence. This was an advantage which this Court does not have. It can be seen in the evidence set out at [68] hereof when the complainant was being cross-examined as to the time of day when the offending occurred.
	
	
	The matters raised by the applicant, both individually and collectively, do not cause me to conclude that the jury’s verdicts were unreasonable or unsupportable. The matters upon which the applicant relies essentially relate to peripheral issues. No inroads of any substance were made in relation to the evidence concerning the offending. These were issues which one might readily accept as inaccuracies or inconsistencies which were not determinative of the complainant’s truthfulness and reliability. It follows that on the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable that the applicant was guilty of the offence charged. It is not sufficient for the applicant to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against conviction be granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	WALTON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL for the reasons given by his Honour.
	
	
	R A HULME J: The various points raised by the applicant that are set out in detail in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL do not lead me to conclude that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the applicant’s guilt. The reasons provided in his Honour’s judgment accord with my own assessment.

		13 April 2017",2017-04-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
4276567,Alhassan v R [2017] NSWCCA 73,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: The applicant, Hudu Abdulai Alhassan, seeks leave to appeal from his conviction on one count of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely, 1980.7 grams of methylamphetamine. He was tried in the District Court before a judge and jury of 12 on an indictment that also included a count of supplying 184.2 grams of cocaine. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the latter count.
	
	
	The single ground of appeal is that the guilty verdict on the first count was unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That ground had two aspects:
	



	
	that the evidence did not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that he knew or believed that there was a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug in his vehicle, and
	
	
	that the verdict was inconsistent with the acquittal on count two.
	



	
	The applicant requires a minor extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal. The explanation is that there were difficulties obtaining the transcript and the judge’s summing up. The explanation is reasonable, and the proposed grounds of appeal are not without substance. In the circumstances there should be an extension of time.
	
	
	Neither ground involves a question of law alone, and so in accordance with s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), leave is required for both.
	
	
	The events in question took place on the afternoon of 3 April 2012 in Bankstown in south western Sydney. Between 1.40pm and 2.02pm that afternoon, unchallenged surveillance evidence established the following matters:
	



	
	At about 1:40pm, the applicant arrived at a block of units at Meredith St Bankstown driving a black Jeep Cherokee. He walked into the driveway of that block of units. There was no dispute at trial that Moses Alozie lived in that block.
	
	
	At about 1:45pm two men (Icechukwu Ojimba and Kelvin Ndiokwelu) left the block of units in a white Toyota Corolla and drove to nearby premises at Reynolds Avenue Bankstown, some 300 metres away. The Corolla was parked on the street and the men entered the premises (where surveillance did not capture what they did).
	
	
	The applicant followed the Corolla for a short period of time in his Jeep, but returned to the Meredith St block of flats and drove down the driveway.
	
	
	Ojimba and Ndiokwelu returned from the premises on Reynolds Avenue, with Ojimba carrying a white shopping bag which he had not previously been carrying. They got into the Corolla and returned to Meredith St and drove into the driveway of the block of flats at 1:52pm.
	
	
	As will be seen, a white shopping bag containing some 1.9kg of methylamphetamine ultimately made its way into the applicant’s Jeep. There was no surveillance evidence establishing precisely when this occurred. There is a very powerful inference that this took place when both the Corolla and the Jeep had driven down the driveway of the Meredith St block of flats, between around 1.52pm and 1.54pm. The agreed facts on which the applicant was sentenced included that the bag of methylamphetamine was transferred to the Jeep at this time. On one view, that inference is the most favourable available to the applicant, because the alternative is that the methylamphetamine was in his vehicle for a considerably longer period prior to the attempted transaction with the undercover operative at the Three Swallows Hotel. However, there was no evidence that the applicant himself at any stage physically handled the bag containing the methylamphetamine.
	
	
	At about 1:54pm, the applicant drove the Jeep from the driveway of the Meredith St block of flats and stopped and parked immediately outside until, at around 1:56pm, the Corolla drove down the driveway, turned northwards and headed towards the Princes Highway.
	
	
	The applicant in the Jeep then followed the Corolla northwards to the Princes Highway and then to the Three Swallows Hotel in Bankstown.
	
	
	The Corolla entered the hotel carpark and parked next to a Volkswagen Golf in which there was an undercover police operative.
	
	
	The applicant drove his Jeep into the carpark, past the Corolla and the Golf, then out of the carpark where for around 35 seconds he parked on the road. At about 1:58pm, he did a three point turn and re-entered the carpark and parked in a separate row of parking spaces directly looking onto the Golf and the Corolla.
	
	
	At around 2pm, Alozie got out of the front passenger seat of the Corolla and walked to the Jeep, where the applicant remained sitting inside. Alozie opened the front passenger door and appears to have gotten into the Jeep.
	
	
	Some 15–20 seconds later, Alozie left the Jeep carrying the white shopping bag of methylamphetamine in his left hand. He returned to the Golf, got into the front passenger seat and handed the bag to the undercover operative. A recording device hidden inside the Golf recorded a short conversation between the two men, in which the undercover operative sought confirmation that the methylamphetamine supplied was “gold class”.
	



	
	Seconds thereafter, officers from the Tactical Operations Unit arrested Alozie. As the officers emerged the applicant fled in the Jeep, driving at speed, nearly colliding with an oncoming vehicle (which was driven by a police officer) and then crashing into a fence. The applicant left the car and fled on foot. He was ultimately arrested in a shop in a nearby building.
	
	
	In addition to the methylamphetamine the subject of the guilty verdict, there was also located in the rear pocket of the front passenger seat of the applicant’s Jeep a black plastic bag containing 184.2 grams of cocaine.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence and was cross-examined at the trial. He maintained that he was a friend of Ojimba and intended to give him a lift to the airport. He said that he was not involved in the supply of drugs, and that someone else had put the methylamphetamine and cocaine in his Jeep without his knowledge. He said that he met Ojimba at Meredith St, and initially followed the Corolla but lost them at the roundabout, and so returned to Meredith St. He denied he was performing counter-surveillance. He could not recall why, after following the Corolla to the carpark of the Three Swallows Hotel, he left the carpark, parked on the street, and then returned to the carpark. He denied checking that he was being followed by police. He said he took the first available parking spot. He said that he was using his mobile phone when Alozie came to his car, opened the front passenger door, and removed the white bag very quickly.
	
	
	The applicant denied knowing that the police were pursuing him until he was arrested. He said he panicked because he saw men running with uniforms, helmets and guns.
	
	
	The applicant called Ojimba in his case, who maintained that the applicant was “absolutely innocent of all this”. He also called character evidence from a former police officer who had known the applicant for some nine years and regarded him as “one of the straightest guys I’ve met since I’ve been here in Australia”.
	


Inconsistency of verdicts


	
	It is appropriate to deal with ground 2 first, because if accepted, it would lead to an acquittal.
	
	
	The test to be applied is “one of logic and reasonableness”: MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366. Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ added that “if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted”. In Allan v R [2017] NSWCCA 6 at [84], it was said (by Harrison J, Gleeson JA and Campbell J agreeing) that:
	


“It is not to be assumed too readily that a difference between verdicts returned inevitably demonstrates a want of credibility in the complainant or central witness: R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82; [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [219]. In Wingrove-Pryce v R [2014] NSWCCA 290 Hoeben CJ at CL observed at [42]:

‘As the authorities cited make clear, the fact that an acquittal has been entered does not necessarily mean that the jury disbelieved the complainant. It may simply mean that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to some element of the offence or, as was pointed out in MFA, the jury may be looking for some extrinsic element of corroboration.’”


	
	This is a straightforward case. In contrast with the surveillance evidence directed to the acquisition, movement and attempted transaction involving the methylamphetamine, there was no evidence relating to the placement of the package of cocaine in the applicant’s Jeep. There was no forensic evidence linking the cocaine with the applicant (indeed, there was no evidence that the packaging had been tested for fingerprints or DNA). The large majority of the evidence led at the trial was directed to the methylamphetamine. The purpose of travelling to the Three Swallows Hotel was concerned with the methylamphetamine, not (at least so far as the evidence disclosed), the cocaine.
	
	
	It was established that the applicant was the registered owner of the Jeep, but there was no evidence that established that he was aware that the cocaine was in it. It was a much smaller package, which had been placed in the pocket behind the front passenger seat. In contrast, there was ample opportunity for the applicant to see the methylamphetamine, no later than when it was placed into the Jeep while it and the Corolla were on the driveway of the Meredith St block of units.
	
	
	There is no inconsistency in the jury’s verdicts. Although there should be a grant of leave, this ground is not made out.
	


Unreasonable verdict


	
	Methylamphetamine is a prohibited drug. Section 25(1) and (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) create separate offences as follows:
	


“25 Supply of prohibited drugs

(1) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

(1A) ...

(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.”


	
	The penalty for the offence created by s 25(1) is 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 15 years: s 32.
	
	
	In 2012, the “commercial quantity” applicable to methylamphetamine was 250g, and a “large commercial quantity” of methylamphetamine was 1,000g (the latter is now 500g, following the making of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Amendment (Methylamphetamine) Regulation 2015, which as authorised by s 44 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act amends Schedule 1 of that Act). The penalty for the offence created by s 25(2) was 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, save that, if the offence involved not less than a large commercial quantity, then the maximum penalty was 5,000 penalty units or life imprisonment: s 33.
	
	
	The mental element of the offences created by s 25(1) and 25(2) may be established by demonstrating either knowledge or belief. However, the offences are structured such that it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew or believed that a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was being supplied before the jury could convict of the more serious offence created by s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), as opposed to the offence created by s 25(1). So much was common ground, consistently with Nguyen v R [2015] NSWCCA 78 at [41] and the cases there cited, as well as Yousef Jidah v R [2014] NSWCCA 270 at [34], where the joint judgment of Bathurst CJ, Fullerton and Davies JJ stated:
	


“The elements of the offence under s 25(2) of the DMT Act, applicable to this case, were that the appellant attempted to obtain possession of what he believed to be a prohibited drug, for the purposes of supply in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. To establish the count, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the appellant attempted to take possession of the drug for the purposes of supply, knowing or believing that the substance in the 45 boxes was a prohibited drug of not less than a large commercial quantity.”


	
	Counsel for the Crown properly accepted that it was necessary to negative as a reasonable hypothesis the proposition that although the applicant knew or believed that he was involved in a drug transaction, he believed (wrongly) that it involved not more than one kilogram of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the close involvement of the applicant in leaving the Meredith St premises at the same time as the white Corolla drove to Reynolds Avenue, in driving into the Meredith St premises once the white Corolla had obtained the methylamphetamine, in following the white Corolla to the Three Swallows Hotel, in performing what were described as “counter-surveillance” activities on both occasions, and in parking nearby in the carpark of the hotel. She pointed to the urgency of the applicant’s flight after the police emerged in the hotel carpark. She also pointed to serious inconsistencies and implausibilities in the testimonial evidence given by the applicant and one of his co-offenders.
	
	
	Those submissions may be accepted so far as they go. It was amply open for the jury to reject the explanation given by the applicant and the witnesses called in his case, and to find to the criminal standard that the applicant knew that he was involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. The uncontested evidence of the movement of his car was completely inconsistent with his evidence that he only attended to provide Ojimba with a lift to the airport. In the context of the transaction that took place between the undercover operative and Alozie, the movement of his vehicle was only consistent with his having knowledge that a transaction involving prohibited drugs was to occur. On this ground of appeal, the applicant’s counsel candidly accepted that the testimonial evidence in his favour might be put entirely to one side.
	
	
	The difficulty faced by the Crown is that the powerful evidence incriminating the applicant of involvement in the supply of drugs does not of itself bear upon the question, let alone exclude as a reasonable possibility, of the applicant’s belief that he was involved in a drug transaction involving less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. There is nothing implausible about all of the steps (including the involvement of two vehicles and the counter-surveillance measures) which were being taken in connection with the supply of a substantial quantity of methylamphetamine, although less than the commercial quantity of that drug (say, 200 grams).
	
	
	The fact that the jury disbelieved the applicant does not establish the Crown case. This is not a case where the applicant’s testimony narrowed the range of hypotheses reasonably available on the evidence so as to exclude one which is inconsistent with guilt of the offence charged: cf R v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35; (2016) 90 ALJR 1013 at [54] and [57]. The rejection of the applicant’s case does not bear upon whether the Crown has demonstrated a knowledge or belief of the supply of a large commercial quantity, as opposed to the supply of less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant recognised that success on ground 1 would yield the substitution of a conviction for the offence created by s 25(1), which indeed had been left open to the jury in the summing up of the trial judge. Such a course is authorised by s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: Spies v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 603; [2000] HCA 43 at [23]-[25] and [43].
	
	
	This Court was not supplied with evidence or submissions so as to enable it to resentence the applicant in the event that the second aspect of the appeal failed but the first succeeded. Counsel for the applicant submitted that resentencing should be remitted to the District Court. The Crown made no submissions to the contrary. That is the appropriate course to take. The applicant appears to have been refused bail following his arrest on 3 April 2012, then granted bail on 17 September 2012 which was revoked following the jury’s verdict on 10 November 2015.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Extend the time within which to apply for leave to appeal to 14 November 2016.

2. Grant leave to appeal.

3. Appeal allowed.

4. Set aside the guilty verdict on count 1, and set aside the sentence imposed on 31 March 2016.

5. In lieu thereof, substitute a verdict of guilty of an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), and remit the proceedings to the District Court for the imposition of sentence.

6. The proceedings be listed for mention in the District Court, at Parramatta, on Thursday 27 April 2017.

4276569,Jeffree v R [2017] NSWCCA 72,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 23 November 2014, the applicant became involved in an argument with his neighbour. During the course of this argument, the applicant produced a home-made pistol. He discharged a shot into the front of the neighbour’s car, in which the neighbour was then sitting.

The applicant later attempted to discharge the firearm a second time, but it did not discharge. When this occurred, the applicant hit the neighbour on the back of the head with the butt of his pistol, causing lacerations. When the neighbour’s father tried to calm him, the applicant pointed his pistol at the neighbour’s father’s head and stated that he was “going to kill him”, meaning the neighbour.

The applicant also smashed the front and rear passenger windows of the neighbour’s car. On searching the applicant’s house, police found a home-made firearm, four live bullets, spent casing and a pistol grip.

The applicant was charged with discharging a firearm contrary to Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 93G(1)(b), attempting to discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to Crimes Act, s 33A(1)(b), assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to Crimes Act, s 59(1), assault contrary to Crimes Act, s 61 and recklessly causing damage contrary to Crimes Act, s 195(1)(a). The applicant was also charged with a number of back up offences.

The applicant pleaded guilty to the offences charged and was sentenced to an aggregate term of 9 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years.

The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds:

Ground 1:    The internal accumulation demonstrates a totality error in the imposition of the aggregate sentence.

Ground 2:    The remarks on sentence disclose that the sentencing judge undertook no assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability in light of the overwhelming evidence of his mental condition.

Ground 3:    The remarks on sentence do not disclose any assessment of the relevance of the applicant’s vulnerabilities upon the overall sentence.

The Court granted leave to appeal and dismissed the appeal.

Beazley P (Walton and R A Hulme JJ agreeing):

In relation to ground 1:

(1)   An aggregate sentence must reflect the totality of the criminality involved in the relevant offending conduct. There is no general rule that determines whether a sentence ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. This is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality. [43]-[45]

   JM v R (2014) 246 A Crim R 528; [2014] NSWCCA 297; R v Harris (2007) 171 A Crim R 267; [2007] NSWCCA 130; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; [2007] NSWCCA 1

In relation to grounds 2 and 3:

(2)   The principles stated in Aslan concerning the effect on sentencing of mental illness and intellectual impairment are not absolute in their terms. In each case, it is a matter for the court to examine the relevant facts and determine whether the mental illness or intellectual impairment has an impact on the sentencing process. [30]-[33]

   Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114; Laspina v R [2016] NSWCCA 181

(3)   The sentencing judge demonstrated no error of principle in considering general deterrence to be a very important factor in determining the sentence imposed or in emphasising its role in the context of persons in the community with a reduced capacity to control their behaviour.

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: On 23 November 2014, the applicant committed a number of firearm, assault and property damage offences in respect of which he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced in the District Court by Cogswell SC DCJ on 4 December 2015 to an aggregate term of 9 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. The offences and the indicative sentences after applying a 25 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty in respect of each offence were as follows:
	


Count 1:   Discharge a firearm contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 93G(1)(b). The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment. The indicative sentence for this offence was 3 years imprisonment.

Count 2:   Attempt to discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act, s 33A(1)(b). The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. The indicative sentence for this offence was 9 years imprisonment.

Count 3:   Assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act, s 59(1). This offence carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The indicative sentence in respect of this offence was 18 months imprisonment.

Count 4:   Common assault contrary to the Crimes Act, s 61. The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years imprisonment. The indicative sentence for this offence was 9 months imprisonment.


	
	In respect of count 5, recklessly causing damage contrary to the Crimes Act, s 195(1)(a), for which the maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment, the applicant was fined $1,000.
	
	
	The applicant was charged with four back up charges pursuant to s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). These were: possess and use an unauthorised firearm: Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), s 7A(1); possess an unregistered firearm: Firearms Act, s 36(1); and possess ammunition without holding a licence, permit or authority: Firearms Act, s 65(3). His Honour recorded convictions under s 10A in respect of those offences: see generally the Criminal Procedure Act, s 167.
	
	
	The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1:    The internal accumulation demonstrates a totality error in the imposition of the aggregate sentence.

Ground 2:    The remarks on sentence disclose that the sentencing judge undertook no assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability in light of the overwhelming evidence of his mental condition.

Ground 3:    The remarks on sentence do not disclose any assessment of the relevance of the applicant’s vulnerabilities upon the overall sentence.


	
	The offences were committed in circumstances where the applicant became engaged in an argument with his neighbour. The neighbour had lent his car to the applicant, but on its return thought that the applicant had taken $5 from the car. The neighbour spoke to the applicant’s mother about the incident and was verbally abusive to her. When the applicant’s mother informed the applicant what had happened, the applicant went to the neighbour’s home and an argument began. The neighbour punched the applicant several times. The neighbour’s parents attempted to separate the two men. The applicant then returned to his home and picked up a home-made pistol. He went back to the neighbour’s home and discharged a shot into the front of the neighbour’s car, in which the neighbour was then sitting. Shooting the pistol into the car constituted the offence in count 1 of discharging a firearm.
	
	
	The two men again began to struggle with each other. The applicant went back to his home. He returned to the neighbour’s home and pointed the firearm at the neighbour. The applicant attempted to discharge the firearm at the complainant, but it did not discharge. The firearm was loaded with a single bullet at that time and was capable of firing one bullet at a time before it required reloading. This constituted the offence in count 2 of attempt to discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	When the weapon did not discharge, the applicant hit the neighbour on the back of the head with the butt of his pistol, causing lacerations to the neighbour’s head. This conduct constituted the offence in count 3 of assault occasioning bodily harm.
	
	
	The two men continued fighting and the neighbour’s father tried to calm things down, but the applicant pointed the home-made pistol directly towards the neighbour’s father’s head. The gun was about 10 inches away and at this point, the applicant told the neighbour’s father to get out of his way, as he was “going to kill him”, meaning the neighbour. The neighbour’s father continued to try to calm the applicant down, but the applicant again pointed the pistol towards the neighbour’s father, who took hold of the applicant’s arm and they engaged in a struggle. The pointing of the firearm constituted the offence in count 4 of common assault.
	
	
	The applicant went home but returned to the neighbour’s place, this time armed with a “sickle hook”, which he used to smash the front and rear passenger windows of the neighbour’s motor vehicle. This conduct constituted the offence in count 5 of reckless damage.
	
	
	The police were called to the scene and the applicant admitted that he had committed the offences as follows. He said that he had:
	


“… got my gun and put a bullet in it. I walked back to [the neighbour’s] car and fired into it. I went back and tried to fire at [the neighbour]. The gun would not fire and I tried again. When it did not fire the second time I used the butt of the gun and smashed him in the back of the head. I wanted to kill him, anybody tried to hurt my mother and I will kill them, nobody hurts my mother, that’s all it is. I did it.”


	
	Upon a search of the applicant’s house, the police found the home-made firearm with a .22 calibre bullet intact inside it. The police found another four live bullets, a spent casing and a pistol grip. The firearm, on testing, was in working order. The police later found the spent bullet inside the radiator of the neighbour’s car.
	


Sentencing judge’s reasons

Objective circumstances


	
	The sentencing judge accepted that the offence of attempt to discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was an objectively serious offence, involving the use of a firearm which the applicant was prepared to use. His Honour considered that general deterrence was a “very important factor” and that the sentence he imposed must carry a “significant component” for general deterrence, given the role of the firearm in the commission of the offences. His Honour acknowledged that the initial altercation had been initiated by the neighbour, but that the applicant’s actions were far more serious than the initial engagement between the two men.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	His Honour then recorded the applicant’s subjective circumstances which revealed that the applicant has both an intellectual and physical disability. He had an abusive childhood at the hands of his stepfather and also witnessed his stepfather’s abuse of his mother.
	
	
	The applicant was born with spina bifida, which caused him significant physical difficulties throughout his childhood and adult life, which in turn have led to psychological impairment. The applicant also had early learning difficulties and it appears he is dyslexic. An early diagnosis of autism was referred to in a report of Emma Hübner, psychologist, but as I understand it, she did not diagnose autism or otherwise confirm the early diagnosis.
	
	
	Ms Hübner administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd edition, and found that on the verbal subtest, the applicant’s performance fell within the ‘Below Average’ range and was better than 13 per cent of an “age matched normative sample”. His performance on the non-verbal subtest was also within the ‘Below Average’ range with his performance being equal to, or better than, 6 per cent of the normative population.
	
	
	The applicant’s overall IQ Composite score fell within the ‘Below Average’ range, with his overall performance being equal to, or better than, 8 per cent of the normative population. His mood and anxiety levels were found to be normal, but he had a mildly elevated level of chronic non-specific arousal as measured on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS -21; Lovibond & Lovibond 1995).
	
	
	Ms Hübner concluded that although the applicant had limited cognitive capacity, he did not have an intellectual impairment or cognitive dysfunction. Ms Hübner expressed the opinion that due to the applicant’s limited cognitive capacity, he was likely to have lacked the reasoning and communication skills necessary to effectively manage the situation in which the offending conduct occurred.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report effectively echoed these aspects of Ms Hübner’s report.
	
	
	The applicant had been seriously assaulted some years previously, causing him serious and ongoing back pain and further psychological injury.
	
	
	The applicant had developed an alcohol problem from about the age of 12, and subsequently commenced using drugs. Dr Matthew Hearps, who saw the applicant in prison, observed that he “appears to have relied on drugs extensively when in the community to manage stress and unpleasant affective (mood) states”. If anything, this worsened following the assault referred to in the previous paragraph. The Community Corrections Officer who interviewed the applicant described a “poly drug abuse” problem. The applicant was assessed as having a low risk of re-offending, the Community Corrections Officer reporting that the applicant:
	


“… presents with low cognitive functioning however his adaptive skills appear generally adequate to allow him to function in the community. He appears to have been a chronic substance abuser over many years. He enjoys the pro-social support of his extended family.”


	
	The applicant had a relatively short period of employment, including work opportunities provided by family and friends, but he had been on a disability support pension for approximately 10 years prior to these offences.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the strong family support available to the applicant evidenced not only by the references they had provided, but also by the fact that his mother attended court. His Honour also observed that there was a reference from the neighbour’s father, who had become involved in the incident on the 23 November 2014. The neighbour’s father described the applicant as being “a happy and friendly bloke to talk to” and said that the applicant was under a lot of emotional pressure on the day of the incident. Overall, the picture that emerged from the various references was of a quiet and well-behaved person, but one with significant cognitive issues and a low skill base, having a limited ability to read and write and a very low level of comprehension.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was inclined to accept that the applicant had a low risk of re-offending and that these offences arose out of “a regrettable combination of circumstances”. His Honour observed that he was:
	


“… dealing with a man who has a shocking background of abuse and disability and who had limited cognitive capacity, falling short of an impairment or a dysfunction.”


	
	His Honour accepted that the applicant had a strong support mechanism, supportive family and friends around him, and that his actions on the day in question were out of character. His Honour also observed that the applicant had been diagnosed whilst in custody with major depression with psychotic features, characterised by what Dr Hearps described as “depressed mood, anhedonia and auditory hallucinations”.
	
	
	His Honour accepted the account provided by the applicant’s mother in respect of the difficulties that the applicant was having in prison. His Honour stated, at [33], that he had given weight to that account and slightly reduced the non-parole period for that reason. His Honour made a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced the applicant to an overall sentence of 9 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.
	


Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal


	
	It is convenient to consider grounds 2 and 3 together, as they rely upon the same factual matters.
	
	
	The applicant submitted, as the sentencing judge found, that he had a number of physical and mental disabilities and vulnerabilities but that his Honour had failed to have regard to the extent to which those matters impacted upon his moral culpability for his offending conduct: ground 2. The applicant also submitted that his disabilities and vulnerabilities were such that it was not appropriate for the sentencing judge to give any weight at all to general deterrence in determining the sentence that ought to be imposed on him: ground 3. The applicant submitted, in respect of both grounds of appeal that, as Ms Hübner had reported, he lacked the reasoning and communication skills necessary to manage the situation and thus reacted:
	


“… by acting out his fear and/or anger and in a hasty and short-sighted manner, without consideration for the consequences to himself or others.”


	
	The applicant submitted that although his Honour had regard to his physical, emotional and intellectual limitations, as well as to his abusive background, his Honour nonetheless failed to make any assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability in light of these factors. The applicant further contended that his Honour placed significant emphasis on general deterrence in circumstances where this was an inappropriate case for general deterrence. In regard to both these matters, the applicant submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the principles stated by this Court in Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114.
	
	
	In Aslan, the Court, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (Adams and McCallum JJ agreeing) were concerned with the sentence imposed on an offender with an acquired brain injury. In that context, her Honour stated, at [33]:
	


“This Court has frequently had to grapple with the effect on sentencing (especially with respect to serious or violent crimes) of mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental or emotional impairment or disability. The compassion and sympathy that such a condition engenders collide with the need for sentences to reflect the objective gravity of the offence in question, the community's interest in general deterrence, and that criminal conduct must be met with appropriate denunciation and retribution. Over the years, the applicable principles have evolved. They were most recently re-stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. They are as follows:

‘[Principle 1]   Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence ...

[Principle 2]   It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed ...

[Principle 3]   It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced ...

[Principle 4]   It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence ...

[Principle 5]   Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public ...’ (internal citations omitted, italics added).”


	
	Simpson J pointed out, at [34], that none of these principles is absolute in its terms, nor is any there any presumption as to their application. It will be a matter for the court in each case to examine the relevant facts to determine whether in the case at hand, the mental condition has an impact on the sentencing process.
	
	
	Her Honour continued, at [35]:
	


“A central question (but not the only question) is whether the mental illness or other condition had a causative role to play in the commission of the offence or offences for which the offender is to be sentenced. Counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that this was the principal issue in this case. If it is concluded that there was a causal connection, then the offender's moral culpability may be reduced (see principle 1). That connection may also warrant lesser attention being paid to the need for the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence (principle 2).” (emphasis in original)


	
	The approach in Aslan was confirmed and applied in Laspina v R [2016] NSWCCA 181 at [39].
	
	
	The applicant submitted that although his Honour referred to his disabilities, he failed to assess how those disabilities contributed to the commission of the offences and thus failed to determine the extent of his moral culpability.
	
	
	The Crown contended that his Honour’s remarks at [38], which indicated that he had moderated the sentence because of the applicant’s disabilities, could only have been a reference to the applicant’s moral culpability. The Crown also reminded the Court that the offences demonstrated a degree of persistence that would indicate that the applicant had set on a determined course of offending behaviour. Consistent with this was the fact that the applicant had not retreated when he had an opportunity to do so.
	
	
	I agree with the Crown’s submission that his Honour, in moderating the sentence, did so as part of his assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability, having regard to the applicant’s disabilities and vulnerabilities. As the aggregate sentence imposed and the non-parole period that was ordered demonstrate, the degree of moderation was substantial.
	
	
	His Honour, at [34], considered that general deterrence was a very important factor. His concern was the fact that the applicant, who had a reduced capacity to react to an argument in an appropriate way, had access to firearms and having become embroiled in the argument with his neighbour, committed a series of extremely serious crimes. Such were his concerns in relation to firearms that his Honour had introduced his remarks on sentence by noting, at [1], that:
	


“This case illustrates why it is illegal in this state to have unlicensed and unregistered firearms in the community.”


	
	Although his Honour moderated the sentence because of the applicant’s disabilities, he nonetheless, at [34], considered that the sentence “must carry a significant component of general deterrence”. His Honour repeated, “[i]llegal firearms can fall into the hands of people with limited ability to control themselves”. In placing this emphasis on general deterrence, his Honour expressly did so in the context of persons in the community, such as the applicant, with a reduced capacity to control their behaviour.
	
	
	In my opinion, no error has been demonstrated in the manner in which his Honour dealt with general deterrence. This was not a case where general deterrence had no role to play. There was no evidence that the applicant did not understand the nature of his act. Although of limited cognitive capacity, the applicant was not found to have “an [intellectual] impairment or dysfunction”. There was no error of principle in that approach, nor could it be said, nor was it argued, that the sentence ultimately imposed demonstrated error because it was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	His Honour did not fail to apply the principles in Aslan. It is apparent from Simpson J’s remarks in Aslan, at [34], that the principles stated in that case are not a prescriptive formula that must be intoned in every case. It is the substance of the reasoning that determines whether a sentencing judge has had appropriate regard to the matters identified in the principles. His Honour’s careful consideration of the applicant’s psychological difficulties, his express reference to moderating the sentence and the actual sentence imposed demonstrate that his Honour was aware of, and applied, correct sentencing principles.
	
	
	I would reject grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal.
	


Ground 1 of the appeal


	
	The sentencing judge, having indicated the individual sentences that he would have imposed and the discount for the plea of guilty, stated, at [37], that he would accumulate the sentence in respect of each count by 3 months. The applicant submitted that the effect of the accumulation was that an additional 9 months imprisonment was indicated upon the sentence for the discharge firearm offence. He contended that this gave rise to a totality error, as there was no commonality between the offences such as to warrant an identical internal accumulation in respect of each of them. The applicant complained that his Honour’s remarks on sentence failed to reveal any discrimination or reasoning underpinning the uniform accumulation by reference to objective seriousness or any other relevant factor.
	
	
	When a court determines an aggregate sentence, the sentence so imposed must reflect the totality of the criminality involved: see JM v R (2014) 246 A Crim R 528; [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [40]. In R v Harris (2007) 171 A Crim R 267; [2007] NSWCCA 130, the Court, at [44], endorsed the leading statement of the effect of the totality principle from D A Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, which was endorsed by the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63:
	


“The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is ‘just and appropriate’.”


	
	A court, as part of the sentencing process, is required to state the indicative sentence for each offence: the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 53A(2). There is no statutory requirement, to state any period of accumulation although there is no prohibition in doing so.
	
	
	The principles governing the concurrency or accumulation of sentences were explained in Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41; [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27], where Howie J (Adams and Price JJ agreeing) explained that:
	


“… there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality … If [the sentence does not reflect the overall criminality of the offending] the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences.”


	
	As the Crown pointed out in this case, the applicant does not contend that the sentences ought not to have been partially accumulated. Rather, the applicant’s complaint is in respect of the identical period of accumulation for offences of differing seriousness. That complaint contains two premises, neither of which, as a free standing proposition, is correct. The first premise is that the offences of which the applicant was convicted were of varying degrees of seriousness. The second premise is that there must be a difference in the period of accumulation having regard to the seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	In the present case, there could be real room for debate as to whether there was a sufficient difference of substance in the objective seriousness of the offending in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4 so as to be able to draw any distinction between them which has any relevance. As to the second premise, whilst the degree of accumulation between offences may reflect an error in the totality of the sentence imposed in a given case, that is not the case here, in circumstances where the first premise has not been made out.
	
	
	But in any event, the complaint does not raise a point of substance in this case given that the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence. In that regard, the sum of the indicative sentences is 14 years and 3 months. It is apparent that, in imposing an aggregate sentence of 9 years and 9 months, his Honour understood that he was required to impose a total sentence that had proper regard to the objective seriousness of the offences, and the mitigating factors that were relevant to the applicant’s circumstances and the principles of sentencing that were applicable, including general deterrence, so as to reflect the applicant’s overall criminality.
	
	
	In my opinion, the Crown’s submission is correct and no error is demonstrated in the exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal;

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	WALTON J: I agree with Beazley P.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Beazley P.

4276583,Aloniu v R [2017] NSWCCA 74,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Walton J.
	
	
	WALTON J: This matter concerns an application for leave to appeal, filed on 17 November 2016, against the sentence imposed upon him on 9 October 2015 by Frearson DCJ (“the sentencing judge”) in the Sydney District Court. After pleading guilty, the applicant was sentenced for three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, knowing the complainant was not consenting with the circumstance of aggravation being that she was under his authority. The offences were contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (“the Act”) for which there is a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 10 years applied.
	
	
	Each charge, with respect to which the applicant pleaded guilty, was identical. The offences involved digital penetration (Count 1), cunnilingus (Count 2) and penile/vaginal intercourse (Count 3) during a single episode on a date between 9 December 2010 and 25 December 2010. The complainant was the applicant’s niece by marriage and was aged 15 at the time of the assaults.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the sentencing Act”). He was sentenced to imprisonment for an aggregate non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months with an additional term 3 years 2 months. His Honour indicated the sentences he would have imposed had he dealt with the matters individually as follows:
	


Count 1: A non-parole period of four years with an additional term of two years.

Count 2: A non-parole period of four and a half years with an additional term of two years and three months.

Count 3: A non-parole period of four years and eight months with an additional term of two years and four months.

Factual Background


	
	The complainant was the niece of the applicant’s wife, AB (“Aunt E”). She was born in Samoa but moved to Australia in 2007 at the age of 12 having been adopted by another aunt, BB. She had lived in Sydney between 2007 and 2010 before moving to a country location in April 2010 after being asked by Aunt E to stay with her and help her out with eight children.
	
	
	After moving to the country location she lived at the applicant’s home and enrolled in school at that location. She shared a bedroom with one of the applicant’s children, a daughter, M.
	
	
	At the time, the complainant moved to the applicant’s home, the applicant was away, working in Melbourne. The applicant did not return to the household until “a few months after” the complainant commenced living there.
	
	
	In early December 2010 Aunt E travelled to Samoa to attend a family reunion. The complainant and her cousins were left in the care of the applicant. She was 15 years of age. Aunt E returned in early January 2011. It was during this period that the offences were committed
	
	
	During the day prior to the offences, the complainant and M had had a fight. As a consequence that night she slept in a spare room. In the early hours of the following morning the applicant entered the room. The complainant felt her arm being grabbed and turned and saw that it was him. The applicant entered the complainant’s bed. The applicant then pushed his mouth on the complainant and tried to get her to open her mouth. She kept her mouth clamped shut and was crying. The applicant told the complainant not to tell anyone and that he would buy her anything for Christmas. He then took off the complainant’s shorts and underpants, touched her vagina and then put a finger inside her vagina, whilst at the same time trying to kiss the complainant on the mouth (Count 1). Thereafter the applicant moved his head between the complainant’s legs and performed cunnilingus on her (Count 2). The applicant then lay on top of the complainant, opened her legs and had penile vaginal intercourse with her (Count 3). The intercourse hurt the complainant. She lay crying while the applicant had intercourse with her. When the applicant finished he told the complainant not to tell anyone. He then told her to put her clothes on before leaving the room.
	
	
	The following day, the complainant made a complaint to another aunt (“Aunt S”). The complainant left the applicant’s home and, as a result of the complaint, commenced living with Aunt S and Uncle.
	
	
	In March or April 2011 the applicant admitted to the a Mr A, that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant. Mr A spoke to the complainant who confirmed the sexual intercourse. In December 2011 the complainant left Australia and commenced living with her sister in New Zealand.
	
	
	On 13 February 2012 Mr A reported the incident to a detective at a Police Station. The applicant was arrested at his home on 24 April 2013. During an interview the applicant admitted speaking about the complainant with Mr A but remained silent when questioned directly about the offences.
	


Procedural Background


	
	The applicant was charged with the offences on 24 April 2013. On 16 October 2013, he was committed for sentence in the District Court. After a number of adjournments, on 3 September 2014 the applicant withdrew his plea and entered pleas of not guilty. The applicant was re-arraigned on 17 August 2015 and after some pre-trial matters were dealt with the trial commenced. The pre-trial discussion and the partial cross-examination of the complainant revealed that it was the applicant’s case at trial that consensual sexual intercourse had occurred and that the complainant was in the house as a helper and not as a family member. Although it was accepted by the applicant that the complainant was 15 years old at the time of the offences.
	
	
	One pre-trial issue concerned the applicant’s perception or knowledge of the complainant’s age and in particular it was disputed that the appellant knew the complainant was 15 years of age at the time of the offence. The applicant submitted, by his counsel, that he “thought [the complainant] was older than she was” and, in an exchange with the sentencing judge, he did not know “how old she was”. The Court confirmed with the Crown that the charges in the indictment alleged aggravation because the complainant was under the authority of the applicant and not due to her age.
	
	
	However, the applicant was put on notice at this time that the Crown would rely on s 61Q(3) of the Act to establish an alternative verdict of guilty under s 66C(3) of the Act. The sentencing judge stated that the applicant was on notice that the Crown was seeking an alternative verdict.
	
	
	The trial commenced on that day after a plea by the applicant that he was not guilty. In the opening submission for the Crown there was no reference to the age of the complainant or to a statutory verdict being sought. However, the Crown stated:
	


I anticipate what you’ll hear from the accused is that at no time did he think that this young woman was under 16 years of age and I expect that you will hear reasons why he formed that view: appearance, behaviour, a whole range of things and I expect what you’ll hear is that because she had come from Samoa, come to live in Australia and then come out to [a country location], that he wasn’t in a position to know exactly her age and that what he was participating in was an illegal act because of that age difference.


	
	The complainant gave evidence in chief and under cross-examination.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that she was adopted by one of her aunties at the age of 12 and as a result moved from Samoa to Sydney. In 2010 she moved from Sydney to a country location to live with Aunt E and the applicant, who was Aunt E’s partner. The complainant could not remember the precise date but was certain it was “term 2 2010”. Aunt E had asked the complainant to stay with her and to help her. In early December Aunt E travelled to Samoa. It was about a week after Aunt E had departed that the offences occurred. The complainant described the offences. The complainant’s birth certificate was tendered showing her birth date on 22 September 1995.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was suggested to the complainant that when she came to the country location she was not in school. She denied that proposition and indicated that she continued school from Sydney in the country location. The complainant agreed she had met the applicant at family functions in Samoa “a few times before” she moved to the country location. It was put by counsel for the applicant, and the complainant agreed, that she was “a much smaller girl” at that time. The complainant could not remember the applicant paying attention to her at that time but agreed that was because she was “young”.
	
	
	The complainant indicated she was older than M; one of her cousins who was about 12 or 13. She saw the applicant as “like my second father”. It was suggested to her that she dressed like a teenager from Sydney (she indicated that she did not know if that was the case) and that she looked older than she actually was. The complainant denied that latter proposition. She agreed she wore makeup but disagreed she did so to make her look 18 or 19. Rather it made her “feel good”.
	
	
	The complainant also disagreed that helping with Aunt E’s children made her feel like the applicant’s wife. She denied she had any special connection to him other than him being like her father. She thought she was a family member.
	
	
	The trial was adjourned to the following day, 18 August 2015. The applicant was re-arraigned before the jury and entered pleas of guilty to each count on the indictment.
	
	
	Proceedings on sentence commenced on 19 August 2015. The Crown tendered the aforementioned statement of facts headed “Agreed Facts” and the applicant’s criminal history. It was an agreed fact that the complainant was 15 years of age as at the date of the offence. The applicant tendered a psychologist’s report of Ms Leah Dodsworth, dated 20 February 2014, and a medical report in relation to his back.
	
	
	The applicant’s wife gave evidence through an interpreter in relation to the impact the applicant’s incarceration would have on her family. She gave evidence that the applicant asked her to forgive him for what he had done and to forgive the complainant too. The applicant told her he had forgiven his wife and forgiven the complainant. There was no cross-examination.
	
	
	The proceedings were adjourned to 9 October 2015. On that occasion a complete Crown bundle was tendered, which included a pre-sentence report and an updated pre-sentence report dated 8 October 2015.
	
	
	The original pre-sentence report was dated 5 December 2013 and contained the following entry under the heading “Sex offending”:
	


At interview it was apparent that Mr Aloniu did not grasp the gravity of the index offences. The statement of facts was read to him and the specific charges summarised and he acknowledged that he understood. He agreed that the incidents took place but he maintained that they were consensual stating that the victim had removed her own clothing and that she was in the bed where he had been sleeping. Mr Aloniu accepted that the victim was below the age of consent. Aside from the implication that the sexual matters were consensual Mr Aloniu offered no other explanation for why the offences occurred.

(“the first pre-sentence report”).


	
	In the updated pre-sentence report of 8 October 2015, the applicant is recorded as stating “he was now aware that his actions were wrong, however, continued to claim he was not aware of same at the time of his offending.” (“the updated pre-sentence report”).
	
	
	In the report of the psychologist, Ms Dodsworth, the following record of statement was made by the applicant:
	



	
	“she did not look like a teenager, wore a lot of makeup, dressing with a thin top and shorts”;
	
	
	“her statement was not one hundred percent correct”;
	
	
	“no I do not know the law, but I broke my promise to my wife”; and
	
	
	“I know forcing someone is a bad thing to do but I do not know the law. I did not know how old Helen was”.
	



	
	In submissions on sentence, counsel for the applicant commenced his submission by stating “Your Honour, of course it’s a serious matter, it is a 15 year old girl in her own home and the agreed facts detail the plea”. He referred, inter alia, to the pre-sentence reports and the psychological reports and made a submission that the applicant had displayed remorse.
	
	
	The submissions of the Crown on sentence were devoted almost exclusively to remorse and the impact of the offence on the complainant. It was contended that the applicant had not understood the true nature of his offending and the impact on the complainant.
	


Grounds of the Appeal


	
	The applicant relied upon two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	The applicant was denied procedural fairness prior to the learned sentencing judge finding that the offences were aggravated by the fact that the applicant knew the victim was under the age of 16; and
	
	
	The sentencing judge erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew the victim was under the age of 16.
	


The Sentencing Judgment


	
	The sentencing judge delivered his judgment ex tempore on 9 October 2015.
	
	
	Having regard to the limited grounds of appeal it will not be necessary to traverse through the entirety of that decision.
	
	
	As the offender had changed his plea at trial the sentencing judge determined that he would give a 6% discount for the utilitarian aspect of the plea.
	
	
	His Honour then recorded the maximum penalty. After making some observations about the significance of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, noting in that respect that both matters relate to the objective seriousness of the offence and that those two guides are to be “taken into account in the one step process”, his Honour observed “it is significant that the complainant was actually under 16 years of age, which is another matter to be taken into account”. He recorded in the factual history that the “complainant was 15”.
	
	
	His Honour then recited the factual background which will be unnecessary to repeat. After recounting that history the sentencing judge recorded that the facts demonstrated that, “these are serious examples of this type of offence”. He also noted,
	


indictment contained the averment that the victim was under the authority of the offender, so that cannot be double counted, but there are degrees of being under authority and he was regarded as the uncle. They lived in the same house and this was a gross breach of trust. I am entitled to take into account the actual extent of the under authority and the extent of the breach of trust and I do.

No complaint is made about that finding.


	
	His Honour noted there were no antecedents of particular note although there was a common assault for which there was a fine. This related to domestic violence.
	
	
	His Honour then turned to give particular consideration to the age of the complainant in the following passage of his judgment:
	


Before I leave the facts, if I have not mentioned already, I meant to mention that what is of particular concern here is the age of the complainant. She was an underage girl who was subjected to non-consensual sexual intercourse in three different forms, albeit on the one night. There is a victim impact statement. I have looked at that. The statement is a demonstration of what happens to victims when they are subjected to this type of sexual exploitation… I do not need to treat it as separately aggravating and I do not, because it is just what one would expect from this type of crime. The facts speak for themselves. Non-consensual intercourse in three forms with a 15 year old, of course it has a devastating effect on the victim, and I take it into account as part of the offence.


	
	His Honour then turned to “reports” which set out the background of the applicant. In relation to the first pre-sentence report he noted that the applicant had mentioned the sexual intercourse was consensual and that the report writer suggested the applicant “did not grasp the gravity of the offences.” His Honour observed that this report and “the material” make it clear “that he does not” and, after dealing with his family situation and noting that the applicant does not have a problem with alcohol and drugs, stated:
	


This report says that he is now aware these actions were wrong. He continued to claim he is not aware of the same at the time of the offending. That statement – I have not got to some of the other material – does seem incompatible with the objective facts and the other material. I do accept that the girl was crying. I do accept that in some sense he forced his way on her and he had three forms of intercourse. I accept that he knew she was not consenting, it was without her consent, and I do find beyond reasonable doubt he knew she was underage as well. How could he not know? What he has done is just refuse to accept responsibility, the responsibility that he should accept.


	
	His Honour observed he would take into account the following objective features of the matter,
	


in particular the age of the complainant, the gross breach of trust. As I have said, I appreciate that the being under authority is not to be double counted. I take into account precisely what happened. Sometimes some forms of sexual intercourse are said to be more heinous than others, although the legislation does not differentiate, but here you have digital, cunnilingus and penile/vaginal. I take into account exactly what happened. I appreciate that they occurred in an almost transactional, the one incident.


	
	His Honour found that there was planning in the offence. The applicant indicated what he was about to do – “it involved considerable deliberation at the time”. He also recognised the harm to the complainant and the community at large.
	
	
	The sentencing judge made a number of findings as to subjective matters as follows:
	


There are reports which set out the background of the offender. In particular there is a presentence report of December 2013 which sets out the family and social circumstances. I will not read it all out because it is now 5 to 4. He was the youngest of ten children to his parent’s union. His parents are now deceased. He resided in Griffith with his wife and eight children aged between 16 and two. They came to Australia for a better life. The offender was educated in Samoa. He left school at 15 following the completion of year 9 and since coming to Australia he has always been employed, predominantly in seasonal work and more recently has been working as an interstate and local truck driver.

…

I have a document form Dr Yang, which details the offender’s lower back injury, symptoms and pain, the severe injuries to his head, neck and shoulder, and the fact he received steroid injections for all that. I have the report from a consulting psychologist, Leah Dodsworth. I do not propose to read it all in view of the time, but it talks about his intellectual functioning. He has some difficulty with comprehension. It gives his history, his history in Samoa. He had some problems with education, but she came from happy family and it does confirm he came to Australia for a better life. It confirms his work history and it points out that both the offender and his wife are religious. The entire family are practicing Mormons are that is of great importance to him.

…

I do have other material and I am aware of the difficulties in relation to his four year old child. I am aware of another son’s prowess in basketball. I am aware of the hardship on the family, and indeed I have a series of documents from lafeta Sekali. What is detailed in that document is the other positive attributes of the offender, how the offender participates in the sporting activities with the church and the community, and how he has loving care for his family. There is a document by his son Raymond who describes his dad as being very loving, caring and supportive, and about problem with the young brother, and the problem with people being candid when the father is not around.

There is a document from the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and it speaks of the positive attributes of the offender. There is a document by Earl Wallace, who was then the relieving principal of the Kalinda School, which talks about Zak’s intellectual disability and indeed a document from David Gilmour, the head volleyball coach, about Raymond being a vital member of the team and that the offender was keen to assist during the training sessions wherever possible. In addition to that, I also have some medical certificates, if I can call them that, which goes to the details of the back pain and the back injury. I appreciate it is the type of injury that will make life difficult in gaol.

I do take into account the hardship to the family, and there will be hardship.

…

I take into account the problems with his family, in particular his younger son.


	
	The sentencing judge also made a number of findings about remorse. He observed the applicant had no real appreciation for the plight of the complainant, her distress at the time and noted “she was underage and was not consenting”. His Honour found that the applicant’s “remorse” was centred upon his betrayal of his wife and letting his religion down but then observed “he is not being sentenced for breaking the marriage vows, he is being sentenced for having non-consensual intercourse in three different ways, as I have said, with a fifteen year old girl”. The sentencing judge stated that the applicant forgave the complainant but that “there was no reason to forgive [the complainant] for anything because she was the victim of the crime. This was the misapprehension of the offender”.
	
	
	Ultimately, his Honour found that the sentence imposed should not be mitigated for the remorse of the applicant. He found: “Try as I might, I am unable to find his actual remorse for having non-consensual intercourse with a 15 year old, on the totality of the material”.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the applicant was unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. He also found there was no need for “specific deterrence”.
	
	
	The sentencing judge then turned to questions of accumulation, concurrency and totality and deterrence. After discussing the indicative sentences for each count, his Honour stated:
	


Were I sentencing for those three matters at the one time, I would have adjusted that last sentence to four years non-parole with a three year additional term because of totality.


	
	His Honour concluded:
	


The upshot is that I impose an aggregate non-parole period of five years and nine months form 18 August 2015 which will expire on 17 May 2021. There will be an additional term of three years and two months commencing at the expiration of the non-parole period. I find special circumstances on the basis principally of the offender’s physical condition in relation to his back. The offender will be eligible for parole on 17 May 2021. The parole does not have to be supervised.

Consideration

Ground 1 – the applicant was denied procedural fairness prior to the learned sentencing judge finding that the offences were aggravated by the fact that the applicant knew the victim was under the age of 16.


	
	The central tenant of this ground of the appeal was that the sentencing judge had found, as an aggravating circumstance in sentencing the applicant, that the applicant had knowledge that the victim was under 16 years of age at the time of the offence. Counsel for the applicant emphasised, in that respect, the passage of the sentencing judgment which is extracted at para [39] of this judgment.
	
	
	As the submission was developed, it was correctly contended that the circumstance of aggravation averred (and admitted) as an element of the s 61J(1) offence as pleaded in the indictment was that the complainant was under the authority of the applicant. The charge was confined to the aggravating circumstance appearing in s 61J(2)(e) of the Act which related to a victim being under the authority of an “alleged offender”.
	
	
	It was further contended that at no point during the pre-trial argument, the trial or sentencing proceeding, did the Crown positively assert that it could establish knowledge on the part of the applicant (as to the age of the complainant) either beyond reasonable doubt or otherwise. That much may also be accepted. Additionally, I note that, in the appeal proceedings, the Crown did not contend that the statutory alternative verdict for an offence contrary s 66C of the Act referred to by the Crown in the pre-trial proceedings (see para [15] above) should be taken as creating a contrary indication. It was again correctly submitted that the Crown did not submit that the offences were aggravated because the applicant knew that the victim was under 16 years of age.
	
	
	The final step in the development of the applicant’s argument was that there had been a denial of procedural fairness because the sentencing judge was obliged to, but did not, draw to the defence’s attention that a finding might be made, in aggravation, that the applicant knew the complaint was under 16 years of age (and consequentially did not give the applicant an opportunity to be heard): see R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740; [2005] NSWCCA 145 (“Tadrosse”) at [19] (per Howie J with whom Grove and Hall JJ agreed) and R v Stokes (2008) 185 A Crim R 74; [2008] NSWCCA 123 at [13]-[15] (per Barr J with whom Giles JA and Hall JJ agreed).
	
	
	Those contentions contain a fundamental, but flawed, premise, namely, the sentencing judge did not treat the applicant’s knowledge of the age of the complainant as a factor in aggravation.
	
	
	In substance, the Crown submitted that the premise upon which the applicant had constructed his argument was flawed. In the passage of the sentencing judgment primarily relied upon by the applicant, his Honour was making a finding as to the applicant’s knowledge for the purpose of assessing remorse (responsively to the report of his attitude recorded in the updated pre-sentence report) rather than making a finding that the knowledge of the applicant at the date of the offence constituted in and of itself a factor in aggravation. It was further submitted that the sentencing judge was entitled to use the fact of the complainant’s age, when assessing the seriousness of the offences, given that the complainant’s 15 years of age at the time of the offence was an uncontested fact.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the sentencing judge did not engender an expectation in the applicant that he would not make a finding in respect to the applicant’s knowledge that the complainant was 15 years old at the time of the offence. The applicant’s counsel made no submissions about the applicant’s state of mind in relation to the complainant’s age. Nor could he in the absence of evidence from the applicant in the sentencing proceeding. Where the evidence led is not sufficient to satisfy the Court of the relevant matter, the sentencing judge is not required to sentence on a view that the facts most favourable to the offender.
	
	
	Contentions such as those advanced by the applicant under this ground need to be approached with caution in order to avoid the Court being drawn into a parsing exercise in which insufficient recognition is given to the pressure under which a busy court such as the District Court may deliver an ex tempore judgment (as occurred in this matter): see Currie v R [2013] NSWCCA 267 at [50] per Johnson J with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed).
	
	
	The Crown was correct to submit, in essence, that attention needed to be given to, in evaluating the merits of this ground, not only the expression used by the sentencing judge to which much attention was drawn “I do find beyond reasonable doubt he knew she was under age as well. How could he not know?” (“the impugned remark”) but to the entirety of the paragraph in which that phrase and sentence appeared (see para [39] of this judgment) and the paragraph of the judgment in which the sentencing judge first dealt with the age of the complainant in his reasoning process (as set out in [38] of this judgment – “the preceding paragraph”).
	
	
	I will begin with a consideration of the preceding paragraph. The first conclusion which may be drawn about the remarks there appearing, is that the sentencing judge was not dealing with the question of whether the applicant knew or did not know the age of the complainant at the time of the offence. He was there, as he plainly stated, dealing with the age of the complainant simpliciter. Whilst he stated he would “take it [that factor] into account as part of the offence”, I consider his Honour was doing no more than indicating that he would have regard to the applicant’s age when assessing the seriousness of the offence. It is clear from the confinement of the preceding paragraph to the age of the complainant simpliciter that, when his Honour subsequently returned to make the impugned remarks as to the knowledge by the applicant of the offence, he was referring to an additional factor bearing upon the seriousness of the offence which, by its nature, was an aggravating circumstance. This analysis also tends to undermine the Crown’s submission that his Honour was only dealing with remorse in making the impugned remarks to which I will return to further below after attending to one further matter in the preceding paragraph.
	
	
	It may be noted there is a component of the preceding paragraph which contradicts the applicant’s contention that the sentencing judge had regard to knowledge of age of the complainant at the date of the offence as an aggravating factor. His Honour remarked that he did “not need to treat it as separately aggravating”. The question is whether his Honour when using the word “it”, should be taken as illuminating his approach to the age of the complainant or dealing with some other consideration. In my view, he was adopting the latter course. I am satisfied that, his Honour was referring, in that respect, not to the age of the complainant but to the “substantial emotional harm” suffered by the complainant, his remarks in that respect appearing immediately prior to his reference to aggravation.
	
	
	As mentioned above, the Crown also submitted that his Honour was, in making the impugned remark, dealing with the question of remorse because his remarks appear in the context of a discussion regarding the updated pre-sentence report where issues of that kind were raised. I do not, however, agree with that submission for the following reasons. First, that construction requires a rather strained reading of the impugned remark. Secondly, his Honour deals squarely with remorse later in his judgment. Finally, whilst the last sentence of the paragraph referred to the acceptance by the applicant of responsibility, this statement does not necessarily verify the Crown’s contention. The concept of “responsibility” is ambiguous and may well concern the applicant’s offending or criminality given its proximity to immediately preceding findings of that character in the paragraph.
	
	
	I turn now to the impugned remark itself and the paragraph in which it appeared. When read literally, the language used in the impugned remark suggests the sentencing judge was making a finding that there was aggravation. The age of the complainant, if under 16 years, was a circumstance of aggravation for the purposes of s 61J(2)(d), which required proof by the Crown to the criminal standard. His Honour emphasised that he made the finding reflected in the impugned remark to the criminal standard (“beyond reasonable doubt”) in a manner thereby consistent with him taking into account a further aggravating circumstance. His Honour’s approach, in that respect, also contradicts any proposition that he might be dealing with a factor advanced by the applicant in mitigation such as remorse. Further, support for this conclusion may be found in the context in which the impugned remark appeared. It was encased in a group of other findings none of which concerned subjective matters but rather concerned the offence and the applicant’s criminality.
	
	
	It follows that his Honour was dealing, in my view, with the applicant’s knowledge of the complainant being underage as an aggravating factor. Given the charge plead aggravation in that respect and the Crown made no submission seeking such a finding at the sentencing hearing, it was necessary, as a matter of procedural fairness, for the sentencing judge to give an opportunity to the applicant to be heard on that issue before ruling upon it. The sentencing judge’s failure to give notice to the applicant of his intention to take into account that aggravating factor thereby resulted in a denial of procedural fairness. As Howie J stated in Tadrosse in relation to aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the sentencing Act at [19]:
	


If the sentencing judge considers that any of the aggravating factors listed are present, it seems to me that, in fairness to the offender and as a matter of good common sense, the judge should indicate to the offender’s legal representative that he or she is considering taking that matter into account so that, if necessary, the court might be persuaded that the aggravating feature is not present or for some reason it should not be taken into account in the peculiar circumstances of the particular case.


	
	In my view, Ground 1 of the appeal must be accepted.
	


Consideration

Ground 2 – The sentencing judge erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew the victim was under the age of 16


	
	The applicant submitted that, other than evidence of the actual age of the complainant, there was “only meagre evidence from which the applicant[’s] state of knowledge might be inferred. Properly considered that evidence could not have excluded the reasonable possibility that he was unaware of her age”.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that there was some circumstantial evidence from which the applicant’s knowledge of the offender’s age might be inferred. For example, the complainant had been living in the applicant’s home and going to school the country location for a number of months prior to the offences which were committed sometime between early December 2010 and early January 2011 (the complainant said Aunt E had only been away for a week when the assaults took place).
	
	
	It is contended, however, that other evidence undercut the strength of any such inference. That evidence included:
	



	
	Whilst the agreed facts were that the victim was the niece of the applicant, “it seems that the relationship was by marriage only”.
	
	
	The complainant was adopted and had only moved to live with her adoptive mother when she was 12 years of age. The evidence did not “[included] any detail of what, if any, contact the complainant had with the applicant prior to moving into his home in April 2010”.
	
	
	The applicant was not living at his residence when the applicant arrived as he had been working in Melbourne. The evidence of the complainant that he had returned a few months after she had moved in.
	



	
	In my view, the second ground of appeal should be rejected. There was circumstantial evidence from which the applicant’s knowledge of the complainant’s age might be inferred such that it open to his Honour to make a finding to the criminal standard that the applicant did so know.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel was incorrect in submitting that the applicant had not known the complainant prior to her coming to his residence. Rather, as I have earlier discussed, the applicant’s counsel established in cross examination that the applicant had met the complainant in Samoa whilst attending family functions. In cross-examination the complainant described herself at that time as “young”.
	
	
	Further, for the nine months prior to the offences the complainant lived in the applicant’s home with his children (her cousins) and attended school with them. Whilst the applicant was situated away from his home for “some months” after the complainant taking up occupancy, by the time of the offence the complainant had been living at the residence for a considerable period of time. No suggestion was made by counsel for the applicant that there was insufficient opportunity for the applicant to observe the complainant as being school aged. It might also be observed that arrangements were made between Aunt E and the applicant to take care of both the complainant and her cousins whilst she attended a family reunion; again suggesting a tender age for the complainant because parental care was required in the absence of her aunt.
	
	
	Finally, an inference may be drawn from the manner in which the complainant responded to the applicant, on the evening of the offence, which was demonstrative of her young age. This included not only the complainant clamping her mouth shut and crying without raising her voice, to avoid waking the other children, but the applicant asking her not to tell anyone for the reward that “he would buy her anything for Christmas”. This was demonstrative that the applicant knew he was dealing with a child.
	
	
	In my view Ground 2 should be rejected.
	


Resentencing


	
	Having found that the applicant was denied procedural fairness, this Court should exercise the sentencing discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors, inter alia, the sentencing Act requires to be considered: Kentwell v R (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [42]-[43]; Lehn v R (2016) 78 MVR 353; [2016] NSWCCA 255 at [60], [65], [86] and [128]. Such an exercise from an independent discretion may result in a lesser sentence where such a sentence is appropriate having regard to the offender and the offence.
	


Objective Seriousness


	
	I have earlier set out the facts surrounding the commission of the offences.
	
	
	These were three very serious examples of sexual intercourse without consent on a young person under the authority of the applicant.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence and the standard non-parole period indicate the seriousness of the offences. That the assaults occurred in the complainant’s home, where she was entitled to feel safe, is an aggravating factor (see s 21A(2)(eb) the sentencing Act). The commission of the offences also involved a gross breach of trust: Franklin v R [2016] NSWCCA 319 at [71] citing MRW v R [2011] NSWCCA 260 (per Bathurst CJ with whom James and Johnson JJ agreed).
	


Subjective Factors


	
	There was no challenge to the sentencing judge’s findings with respect to subjective matters or the discount afforded for the plea of guilty. I propose to adopt them for the purpose of resentencing with some brief further confirmatory observations below.
	
	
	The applicant had one offence of common assault in his criminal history for which he received a fine and a s 9 bond for 12 months, under the sentencing Act, that had expired by the time of the offences.
	
	
	In relation to the pre-sentence reports it may be noted with respect to the applicant:
	



	
	he was educated in Samoa. He left school at 15 after completing year 9.
	
	
	after coming to Australia he had always been employed, in seasonal work and then as a local truck driver.
	
	
	he had a wife and eight children aged between two and 16.
	
	
	he was now aware that is actions were wrong but continued to claim he was not aware of same at the time of the offending.
	



	
	With reference to the psychologist’s report of Ms Dodsworth, the following may be noted:
	



	
	the applicant’s distress in relation to the subject matters is centred on his betrayal of his wife and breach of his faith more so than the legal implications or impact on the victim.
	
	
	the applicant has no real appreciation of the plight of the victim, her distress at the time, the fact the she was underage or that she was not consenting.
	
	
	the applicant has a problem comprehending the illegality of his behaviour.
	



	
	The sentencing judge properly took into account the hardship befalling the applicant’s family and in particular his young son in the sentencing process. However, the evidence revealed the applicant was not remorseful for what he did and did not take responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	The applicant has good prospects for rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	Case notes from the NSW Department of Corrective Services, dated between 2016 and 2017, were annexed to the affidavit of Janet Witmer (affirmed on 10 February 2017) provided by the applicant during the hearing of this matter. I agree with Ms Witmer’s assessment that the applicant had not posed a management problem in prison and he was using his time profitably.
	
	
	The sentencing statistics provided by the applicant during the hearing of this matter do not illustrate that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was other than appropriate given the criminality of the applicant.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I do not consider a sentence less severe than imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted in law (see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)). Such a conclusion must result in the dismissal of the appeal: Thammavongsa v R (2015) 251 A Crim R 342; [2015] NSWCCA 107 at [5] (per Simpson J with whom Hulme J agreed). Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal and I would dismiss the appeal.
	


Orders:


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	PRICE J: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of Walton J. Although I agree with the orders proposed, I find myself in respectful disagreement with some of Walton J’s reasons. In particular, I do not agree that Ground 1 of the appeal must be accepted. The essence of the applicant’s complaint in Ground 1 is that he was denied procedural fairness as the judge found that his knowledge of the complainant’s age was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	In my view, the sentencing judge’s ex tempore remarks on sentence are to be considered in the context of the oral submissions that preceded them.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant put to the sentencing judge that the applicant’s remorse was genuine and was not confined to his wife, family and church but extended to the complainant herself. It was submitted that there was evidence of remorse. In reply, the Crown directed the sentencing judge’s attention to the requirements of s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides:
	


“…

(3) Mitigating factors

The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

…

(i) The remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)”.


	
	The Crown argued that the requirements of the subsection had not been satisfied by “the mere telling” for the purposes of the second pre-sentence report that the applicant was now aware that his actions were wrong. The Crown referred to the substantial harm to the complainant and went on to say (Tcpt 9/10/15, p 6–7):
	


“…in our respectful submission, your Honour, that’s a critical matter in the sentencing process that your Honour wouldn’t be satisfied that this offender is entitled to the remorse that Mr Watson’s eloquently submitted”.


	
	Immediately following these submissions, his Honour delivered his reasons for sentence. The impugned remarks are quoted at [39] above in Walton J’s judgment. Whilst it is unnecessary to repeat the passage in-full here, it is important to record the words that followed the finding that the applicant knew the complainant was underage. The sentencing judge said (ROS 6):
	


“…and I do find beyond reasonable doubt he knew she was underage as well. How could he not know? What he has done is just refuse to accept responsibility, the responsibility that he should accept.” [Emphasis added.]


	
	In order for the sentencing judge to take into account remorse as a mitigating factor, the applicant was obliged to provide evidence that he accepted responsibility for his actions, and he acknowledged any injury caused by his offending. In my opinion, when his Honour found beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew that the complainant was underage he was providing reasons for not being satisfied that s 21A(3)(i)(i) had been established. His Honour was firmly rejecting the applicant’s submission that there was evidence of remorse.
	
	
	The sentencing judge continued his consideration of the issue of remorse and concluded (ROS 7):
	


“I have received submissions on whether I should find any remorse in view of the legislation, 21A(3)(i), and it just seems to me that what he is sorry about is not for what he did, he is sorry about all sorts of other matters. Try as I might, I am unable to find his actual remorse for having non-consensual intercourse with a 15 year old, on the totality of the material.”


	
	I do not consider that the applicant was denied procedural fairness. The sentencing judge did not find that the applicant’s knowledge of the complainant’s age was a factor of aggravation. His Honour carefully considered all of the matters that had been placed before him which included the applicant’s remorse. I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal.
	
	
	Notwithstanding my disagreement with Walton J in respect of Ground 1, I agree that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Walton J.

		24 April 2017",2017-04-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
4276602,R v LN; R v AW (No. 8) [2017] NSWSC 331,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Today is the 20th day of the trial of LN and AW on a charge of murder. The evidence was completed yesterday. It was expected that today, after legal argument on some outstanding issues with respect to directions to the jury, the Crown would commence its closing address to the jury.
	
	
	The Court has been informed this morning that a member of the jury is absent on the grounds of illness. The remaining 11 members of the jury are present. A medical certificate has been furnished on behalf of the absent juror. It is dated today and states that the absent juror ""has a medical condition and will be unfit for work from 29 March 2017 to 31 March 2017 inclusive"" (MFI 43). The certificate accords with contemporary practice where it really tells you nothing about the nature of the problem. It is, of course, a certificate designed for fitness to work and not fitness to be a juror.
	
	
	At my request, the Sheriff's Officers have communicated with the absent juror. The absent juror has indicated that he is experiencing a stomach problem, which commenced to manifest itself yesterday and is still causing difficulty. The juror has indicated that he does not expect to be fit to return to serve on the jury this week. That communication accords with what is in the medical certificate.
	
	
	Faced with this situation, the question has arisen as to where to go with the trial itself. The expectation was that the Crown would address today, with the closing address of Mr Wilson SC for LN to follow, either later today or, more likely, tomorrow. Friday is a half-sitting day. I will be occupied in this Court sentencing another person on Friday afternoon, so that period is not available for this trial.
	
	
	Accordingly, at 12 noon on Wednesday 29 March 2017, the question is whether this juror should be discharged with the trial proceeding with 11 jurors, or whether the trial ought effectively be adjourned (as involving the jury at least) until next Monday, 3 April 2017.
	
	
	The Crown has applied to have the absent juror discharged and for the Court to proceed with the remaining 11 jurors constituting the jury.
	
	
	Counsel for each Accused has opposed the discharge application. Submissions have been made by Mr Wilson SC, for LN, that the criteria in s.53B(a) Jury Act 1977 are not made out in the present case. That provision states that a court may discharge a juror in specified circumstances where the juror is ill.
	
	
	It is submitted as well that this trial is, in effect, ahead of schedule in that it is in the middle of the fifth week when the trial was estimated to extend to the other side of Easter. It was submitted as well that, if the juror is discharged and the trial proceeds before a jury of 11, the closing addresses will commence this week but will not conclude and will spread into next week.
	
	
	Both Accused, through counsel, submitted that the appropriate course was to not discharge the absent juror but to proceed with the jury of 12 next Monday.
	
	
	The Court has a discretion as to whether to discharge the absent juror and to proceed with a jury of 11. However, the current form of the Jury Act 1977 uses language which, on one view of it, is fairly inflexible. It is a common experience in jury trials that a juror becomes ill for a period. However, s.53B(a) prescribes that the decision to discharge can be made if ""the juror is so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers a verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial"".
	
	
	The indication from the absent juror, supported by the medical certificate, is that there is a type of passing illness which, with some days' rest and treatment, will permit the juror to return to serve on the jury. It might be said that the juror’s absence between now and Friday will be further assisted by the intervening weekend, which should ensure that the absent juror would be fit for the resumption of the trial next Monday.
	
	
	There are other factors which are relevant as well to the exercise of discretion. The criminal justice system in this State operates on the basis that the trial ought proceed before a jury of 12, unless there is a basis for discharging a juror under the Jury Act 1977. Although that position is a starting point and is not inflexible, it is the expectation that trials should proceed with a jury of 12 unless there is a good reason (within the terms of the Act) to proceed with a lesser number.
	
	
	Each Accused is entitled to have a jury of 12 (subject to the statutory provisions for discharge) as, indeed, is the community which has an interest as well in the administration of criminal justice.
	
	
	A further factor which is of present relevance is that this trial has proceeded with reasonable expedition and is, effectively, ahead of schedule. Another factor, which must be considered, is that, if the closing address by the Crown commences on Monday morning, there will be four sitting days where the jury will hear, consecutively, the closing addresses on behalf of the Crown and each Accused with, I hope, the prospect that my summing-up may be well underway, if not completed, by 4.00 pm on Thursday 6 April. If that scenario resulted, there would be a prospect that the jury could be asked to retire to consider their verdicts on Thursday 6 April.
	
	
	As the parties are aware, I am presiding in the Arraignments List on Friday 7 April and would not be in a position to sit in this Court to continue with a summing-up. On the other hand, if the jury had retired on Thursday afternoon, it would be within the capacity of the Court to conduct the Arraignments List in the Law Courts Building in Queen's Square, and to return to this Court as needed in the event that there was a question from the jury or verdicts.
	
	
	All that is relevant to the exercise of discretion as well. Whether that scenario is unduly optimistic, in the sense that it will take more than four days for closing addresses and summing-up, remains to be seen.
	
	
	What should be emphasised, however, is if this juror is not discharged and counsel, effectively, have the balance of this week to prepare their closing addresses, it is the expectation of the Court that the closing addresses will be even better prepared than they would otherwise have been and delivered with appropriate expedition and avoidance of repetition. I bear that factor in mind as well.
	
	
	The question then is whether the Court should exercise its discretion to discharge this juror. There is a difficulty, in my view, in the Court being satisfied that the formula in s.53B(a) is made out in this case. The loss of time is significant but not excessive. Some of that time will be used in the remaining legal argument which must occur before any closing addresses could commence.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I decline to discharge the absent juror. The effect of this will be that the remaining 11 members of the jury will be informed that they will be required at 10.00 am on Monday, 3 April 2017, for the continuation of the trial.
	
	
	It is appropriate, in my view, that the 11 members of the jury come into Court and hear from me what the position is so that I can also remind them, once again, of the need to avoid discussion with other persons about issues in the trial in what will be an extended period before the trial resumes.

		19 April 2017",2017-03-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276608,R v LN; R v AW (No. 7) [2017] NSWSC 296,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: On Monday, 20 March 2017, I delivered a judgment which outlined the unsatisfactory history of this trial with respect to expert evidence: R v LN; R v AW (No. 6) [2017] NSWSC 283.
	
	
	As that judgment makes clear, the Crown accepts that it is confined in the way in which it puts its case against AW to the case which was opened to the jury. I will ensure that the Crown is so confined for the balance of the trial.
	
	
	Dr Issabella Brouwer was in the witness box for two days. The next witness to give evidence today is Dr Michael Rodriguez, a neuropathologist.
	
	
	In advance of Dr Rodriguez being called in the presence of the jury this morning, I inquired of the Crown as to what areas were proposed to be the subject of questioning in examination-in-chief. In particular, I inquired whether areas of questioning of Dr Rodriguez would involve events, which were said to have occurred where one or other of the Accused had assaulted Joseph in the 51-day period when he was living with them in Oberon.
	
	
	As is apparent from R v LN; R v AW (No. 6), the Crown has not, prior to this week, taken steps to invite the Crown medical experts to comment on various events admitted by one or other of the Accused, or referred to in the evidence of FN in the trial. These events include AW placing the child in an Esky on two occasions, one of which was said to have involved the lid being placed on the top of the Esky with AW either holding the lid down or sitting on it whilst the child was inside the Esky.
	
	
	Other incidents involve LN admitting that she closed a cupboard door on the head of the child on an occasion, as well as shaking the child vigorously on an occasion.
	
	
	There are other acts as well, which are the subject of admissions by one or other of the Accused, which involve force being used against the child including, amongst other things, the use of a wooden spoon and the tying up of the child (or parts of his body) with duct tape.
	
	
	The particular area that gave rise to an objection on Monday concerned the Crown's examination-in-chief of Dr Brouwer with respect to AW placing the child in an Esky, and closing the lid on top of him, in an incident which apparently caused significant pain to the child leading to screaming.
	
	
	In an attempt to minimise the prospect of a repetition of what occurred on Monday, I invited the Crown this morning to outline how the Esky incident (and any suggested injury that may have flowed from it to the child's neck or any other part of his body) was said to be relevant to issues in the trial. The Crown indicated the way in which this was said to be relevant, whilst stating that the Crown would not seek to depart from the case against AW opened to the jury.
	
	
	In the absence of any supplementary report from Dr Rodriguez, I took the view that there ought be a voir dire held where Dr Rodriguez gave evidence in the absence of the jury, with the areas about which the Crown sought to ask questions being explored in that way: s.149E Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	A voir dire has occurred and Dr Rodriguez has been questioned, including cross-examination by counsel for each Accused. Accordingly, the problem that existed before 10 o'clock today (that the defence were not on notice of what Dr Rodriguez was going to say about these very topics) has at least been cured.
	
	
	As has been made clear in earlier judgments, the principal issue in this case relates to the cause of the child's death. There is a scenario where it is said, by the Accused, that the child tripped over a rope tied between two dogs in a park opposite their house in Oberon, and that this fall gave rise to very substantial injuries that led to his death.
	
	
	The Crown’s primary case is that the child was not in the park at all and that the injuries which led to his death were inflicted by the Accused LN, in circumstances where the Accused AW was criminally liable for the murder of the child as well, by application of the principles of joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise. Against this background, it is understandable that the expert witnesses would be taken to such incidents or events which are identifiable where it is said that one or other of the Accused used force against the child.
	
	
	The source for these matters is the evidence of FN (which has a degree of uncertainty about it as to times) and also the interviews with each Accused in which admissions were made of the various acts which I have mentioned.
	
	
	The medical evidence so far from Dr Brouwer and, indeed, from Dr Rodriguez on the voir dire, makes clear that the estimation as to the time when a particular injury was caused is not a precise and accurate science. Estimates can be given, although the longer the period that may be suggested, the lesser the likelihood that a particular event may have contributed to a particular injury.
	
	
	Objection is taken, on behalf of counsel for each Accused, to Dr Rodriguez being asked by the Crown as to the Esky incident and any neck injury (or injury to the area of the neck or the spine) which may have flowed from that event.
	
	
	The objection is based on the proposition that the evidence suggests that the Esky incident (where the child was placed in the Esky with the lid secured on top of him) occurred maybe a week or even longer before 3 August 2014.
	
	
	Dr Rodriguez has expressed opinions on the voir dire which indicate that, in his view, the neck injury was unlikely to have been caused a week prior to 3 August 2014. Questions were asked as well as to whether it was a reasonable possibility that certain lesions on the child were present a week prior to 3 August 2014.
	
	
	The argument is put that the evidence is coming forward at this very late stage so that there are procedural problems given the Crown's late notice of these matters. Objection is also taken upon the basis that, upon an examination now of this evidence, it is not relevant to issues in the trial and that, even if it was relevant, its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value for the purpose of s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I am giving this judgment at a time when Dr Brouwer's evidence is already complete. There has already been examination-in-chief and cross-examination of Dr Brouwer about the Esky incident, and its possible relationship to the child's neck injury. That evidence was given before the jury. It is the case that Dr Brouwer, on a number of occasions, deferred to the opinion of Dr Rodriguez, the neuropathologist, who had carried out more specialised testing than she had.
	
	
	I approach the issue on the basis that there is a level of imprecision about the estimation of the date or time when injuries were caused. That said, the evidence of Dr Rodriguez, certainly with respect to the Esky incident, would suggest that it is a more remote potential explanation for any injury to the child's neck or cervical spine area.
	
	
	What has been indicated, however, is that, even if the Crown was not allowed to lead this evidence, there would be cross-examination of Dr Rodriguez to, effectively, shut the door which has already been opened through the evidence of Dr Brouwer.
	
	
	It seems to me that the appropriate way forward with these issues, given the state of this trial and the evidence already given by Dr Brouwer, is to permit the evidence to be led by the Crown and to be the subject of cross-examination by the defence. This will provide as complete a picture as is possible to the jury, given the imprecision involved in estimating the age of injuries.
	
	
	To shut this evidence out now would, it seems to me, leave an unsatisfactory position, given Dr Brouwer's evidence and, indeed, the indication by Ms Moen, counsel for AW, that she proposes to cross-examine upon some of this material in any event. I understand why counsel wishes to do that, but it seems to me that the appropriate way forward is to permit the Crown to ask questions in these areas. That will allow defence counsel an opportunity to cross-examine Dr Rodriguez in these areas in a way which will give the jury the complete picture.
	
	
	I am satisfied these areas of evidence are relevant. I am satisfied as well that the evidence should not be excluded under s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I allow the evidence adduced from Dr Rodriguez on the voir dire to be led by the Crown.

4276609,R v LN; R v AW (No. 6) [2017] NSWSC 283,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, LN and AW, are standing trial for the murder in 2014 of Joseph, a three-year old child. LN is Joseph's mother and AW his stepfather.
	
	
	The trial has entered its fourth week. Presently giving evidence is Dr Issabella Brouwer, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy upon the child.
	
	
	In the course of examination-in-chief of Dr Brouwer, objection has been taken by counsel for AW to a line of questioning which, it is said, seeks to advance a different case against him to that previously advanced by the Crown.
	
	
	The way in which the Crown puts its case against LN and AW was summarised in my judgment R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) [2017] NSWSC 119 at [58]-[59].
	
	
	Put shortly, (as summarised at [58] of R v LN; R v AW (No. 1)) the Crown puts its case against LN on the basis that she committed a voluntary act on or about 3 August 2014, accompanied by an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life, with that act causing Joseph's death. I pause at this stage to observe that the Crown has opened to the jury in this trial as against LN upon the basis of intention to kill or intention to inflict grievous bodily harm only, with no reliance being placed upon reckless indifference to human life.
	
	
	The Crown puts its case against AW (as summarised at [59] of R v LN; R v AW (No. 1)), on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise. The Crown alleges that LN inflicted fatal injuries upon Joseph on or about 3 August 2014 and that, from the time that Joseph came to live at Oberon on 14 June 2014, each of LN and AW engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to assault him and that AW foresaw the possibility that LN, during the course of that joint criminal enterprise, might commit a voluntary act causing Joseph's death whilst having the requisite intent for murder, namely, an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The Crown opened to the jury along similar lines on 27 February 2017. With respect to the case against AW, the Crown referred (T39) to its reliance upon joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise in a manner consistent with what I said in R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) at [59].
	
	
	Once again in the opening on 27 February 2017 (T42-43), the Crown outlined the basis upon which it put its case against the Accused AW emphasising reliance upon joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise, as well as, as against both Accused, the possibility of an alternative verdict of manslaughter.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Crown has put its case so far on the basis that no act of AW caused the death of Joseph or was a substantial contributing factor to the death of the child.
	
	
	The line of questioning by the Crown of Dr Brouwer, which gave rise to the objection, concerned the prospect that Joseph was injured to the neck by being placed by AW in an Esky with the lid being closed on top of him.
	
	
	Submissions have been made in the absence of the jury. They appear in the transcript (T781-798) and need not be repeated.
	
	
	This is a trial where the cause of Joseph’s death has always been a critical issue, if not the critical issue: see R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) at [56]-[57].
	
	
	The Crown case has been that Joseph was not in the park at all on 3 August 2014 and so did not sustain any injury in an incident involving a rope and dogs (as suggested by the Accused). The Crown says as well that, even if Joseph was involved in such an incident, that event did not cause his death.
	
	
	It has always been part of the Crown case that AW assaulted Joseph in a number of ways between 13 June 2014 and 3 August 2014, including placing the child in an Esky and putting the lid on the Esky. Police interviews with AW in August and September 2014 involved admissions along these lines and of other acts as well, and the evidence of FN (LN’s eldest son) provided further support that AW acted in this way towards the child with respect to an Esky. It has always been part of the Crown case that Joseph was injured to various parts of the body, with these injuries arising from assaults.
	
	
	On 13 February 2017, the solicitor for the Crown emailed the legal representatives for each Accused indicating that the Crown proposed to send further material to the Crown medical witnesses (Dr Brouwer, Dr Michael Rodriguez, Dr Susan Marks, Dr Terrence Donald and Dr Kristina Prelog) so as to enable them to provide what was described as “accurate and thorough evidence”. The further material which was intended to be provided included the committal transcripts of evidence given by each medical witness, and what were described as the schedules to the tendency notices upon which the Crown relied for the purpose of the tendency issues determined by me in R v LN; R v AW (No. 1).
	
	
	The email said that the tendency schedules were to be furnished to the expert witnesses as a “convenient summary of admissions and assaults”. In addition, the Crown indicated an intention to provide a copy of the witness statement of FN dated 17 September 2014, together with the expert statement dated 17 June 2016 from Dr Johan Duflou, the defence expert. The Crown email raised as well the prospect that the experts have a “joint conference to determine points of agreement”.
	
	
	Later on 13 February 2017, an email response was provided by the solicitor for AW (MFI 24). There was no objection to the provision of the committal transcripts to the expert witnesses. There was no objection to the Crown medical witnesses being provided with a copy of Dr Duflou's report. Objection was taken to any of the experts being provided with a copy of the schedules to the tendency notices. An inquiry was made by AW’s solicitors as to “precisely what questions the prosecution would be proposing to ask each expert in a fresh letter of instructions, if those Schedules were to be provided to them”.
	
	
	Objection was taken as well to the statement of FN being provided with a similar request that, if there were to be any further questions posed to the experts arising from FN's statement, then there ought be identification of the questions in a fresh letter of instructions. Reference was made as well to s.146(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It was said that there was concern that the representatives of AW may be unable to meet any new expert evidence adduced by the prosecution from its own witnesses.
	
	
	With respect to the suggestion that a joint expert conference may be appropriate, the email from the solicitor for AW said that some time would be required to reflect upon whether that was suitable, but that the initial inclination of AW’s counsel was to oppose it, but that was not, at that time, her considered view.
	
	
	It appears that the Crown did not take up the suggestion of identifying to the defence the particular questions said to arise from the schedules to the tendency notices, nor from the statement of FN. Accordingly, when the matter came before me on 20 February 2017 for a pretrial hearing, the issue had not been further progressed.
	
	
	On 20 February 2017, the Crown indicated that Dr Brouwer had raised the possibility of the doctors getting together in a ""hot tub type situation"" (PT2). Some discussion ensued, the transcript of which will speak for itself. I mentioned in passing (PT4-5), that provisions in Part 75 Supreme Court Rules 1970 may bear on this issue. The Court was not informed of the exchange of emails which took place on 13 February 2017 (see [15]-[19] above).
	
	
	There the matter rested until the next day, when I raised directly with counsel (PT26-27) the provisions of Part 75 Rule 3K Supreme Court Rules 1970 which allows for a joint expert witness conference in criminal proceedings in this Court with the consent of the parties. Reference was made as well to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Abdallah v R [2016] NSWCCA 34 at [51]ff.
	
	
	The Court has been informed today that no defence consent was forthcoming and thus there has been no joint expert conference.
	
	
	I have also been informed today by the Crown that the material referred to in the email of 13 February 2017 had not been provided to Dr Brouwer or other Crown medical witnesses and that Dr Brouwer (who was the first medical witness called by the Crown) is being asked about these matters, effectively, without a conference in advance and with all of this happening in the presence of the jury.
	
	
	The question which has given rise to the present controversy concerns a possible explanation for injuries observed on Joseph's body, both before and after death, arising from a number of incidents which have been referred to in the evidence, which include the Esky incident, alleged hitting of the child with a wooden spoon, and LN shutting a cupboard door on the child's head. The Crown has asked a number of questions as to whether some of those particular acts may explain some of the injuries observed on the child. It was only when the Esky incident was the subject of questioning that objection was taken. The Esky incident, of course, is said to be referable to AW only and not, as I understand it, to LN.
	
	
	The Crown has informed the Court that it does not seek to widen the way in which it puts its case against AW. It will not seek to argue that any of AW's alleged assaults caused the death of Joseph, or was a substantial contributing factor to the death of the child. The Crown case remains that it was the act or acts of LN which caused the death of Joseph.
	
	
	In circumstances where there is evidence of various alleged assaults by LN and AW using various means, it is open to the Crown to ask questions of medical witnesses concerning injuries which are said to arise from the alleged assaults.
	
	
	What the Crown cannot do, however, and what it has said it will not seek to do, is to alter the basis upon which the Crown puts its case against AW from that which was opened to the jury. The Crown may ask questions concerning injuries and whether certain methods of infliction may serve to explain injuries observed on the child. However, as against AW, the Crown will be confined to the case which it communicated before trial and upon which it opened to the jury on 27 February 2017.
	
	
	Before concluding these reasons, I observe that this case illustrates the strong desirability of the use of joint expert conferences under Part 75 Rule 3K Supreme Court Rules 1970. As the law presently stands, this cannot happen in this Court without the consent of the parties. In this case, the legal representatives for AW did not consent to that procedure.
	
	
	There is considerable force for the view that the commonly accepted practice of joint expert conferences used in civil proceedings (Rules 31.24 - 31.26 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005) should extend as well to criminal proceedings, in a manner which will assist the clear identification of evidence and issues which are disputed or not disputed, and which will also promote the efficient progress of criminal trials in furtherance of s.134 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

		19 April 2017",2017-03-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276636,R v LN; R v AW (No. 5) [2017] NSWSC 263,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, LN and AW, are standing trial for the murder in 2014 of Joseph, a three-year-old child. LN was Joseph's mother, and AW his stepfather.
	
	
	The Crown case is now well advanced and the jury have heard a considerable body of evidence. This evidence includes several recorded interviews between police and each Accused over a period from 3 August 2014 to about mid-September 2014. In addition, there has been surveillance device and telephone intercept evidence of conversations involving one or other or both of the Accused in that period.
	
	
	The background to the present trial may be found in my first judgment, R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) [2017] NSWSC 119. It is the Crown case that LN murdered Joseph by inflicting injuries directly to him with an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown case against AW involves the alleged existence of a joint criminal enterprise between LN and AW to assault Joseph over a period of time between 13 June 2014 and 3 August 2014.
	
	
	The evidence (expressed very generally) involves repeated statements by each Accused that Joseph tripped on a rope between two dogs in a park at Oberon in the early afternoon of Sunday, 3 August 2014. It is the defence case (once again put broadly) that the fatal injuries sustained by Joseph were caused in that incident.
	
	
	There is a substantial issue in the trial as to whether such an incident involving Joseph actually occurred on that day.
	
	
	There is evidence in the trial of a variety of admissions made by each Accused of having struck Joseph in various ways over the period of time when he was living with them in Oberon. All of that constitutes the background to the tender of some evidence to which objection is taken.
	
	
	Senior Constable Christopher Nocente of the Central West Crash Investigation Unit will give evidence, if permitted, that on 26 August 2014 whilst off duty, he attended the Centrelink office at Bathurst. Whilst sitting in the waiting area, he states that he overheard a conversation between a male and a female, who may be taken to be LN and AW.
	
	
	According to the statement of Senior Constable Nocente (MFI 22), he heard the female speaking on a mobile telephone. The female started crying and she was heard to say words to the effect, ""We were in the park walking the dogs and [Joey] was knocked over by the dogs. I took him home and called the ambulance"".
	
	
	Senior Constable Nocente says that, having heard that part of the conversation, he listened more carefully. He was aware that there was an investigation under way by the Bathurst police with respect to the suspicious death of a child at Oberon.
	
	
	Senior Constable Nocente says the female continued to speak on the phone. He could not understand much of what she was saying as she was crying a lot, but he heard the female say that ""[Joey] did not like to eat his food and all he wanted to eat was lollies but she could not give him lollies"". Another part of the conversation involved the female saying, ""That [Joey] would hit his head against the wall"".
	
	
	According to Senior Constable Nocente, at the conclusion of the mobile telephone conversation, the male (whom I take to be AW) said, ""You've got to stick with that"". The female was still crying and not long after that comment, the couple were called forward by a staff member.
	
	
	Senior Constable Nocente says that the next day, 27 August 2014, upon his return to work, he had a conversation with Detective Sergeant Fawkner who was the officer-in-charge of the case, and a statement was made by him which bears that date.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender this evidence upon the basis that it is relevant to issues in the trial. It is said that the conversation is taking place between the Accused and that the comment allegedly made by the male at the end (""You've got to stick with that""), supports the Crown case that there was a measure of a joint story being furnished which was, the Crown says, at least in part, not true.
	
	
	Objection is taken to the tender of this evidence upon a number of bases. It is submitted that it is not relevant, that Senior Constable Nocente does not purport to provide the full conversation which he hears taking place over the phone with the woman and, that without having the full conversation, the comment attributed to the male may be misunderstood and taken out of context. It is submitted that even if it was relevant, it ought be excluded under s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I note at the outset that there is no suggestion, of course, that what was happening this day was any type of official questioning. The police officer just happened to be in a public place where he heard things being said apparently by the two Accused persons - the woman on the phone and then as between the man and the woman. Having heard these things, Senior Constable Nocente has then spoken to the officer-in-charge about it.
	
	
	There is a significant issue in this trial, which involves an examination of what each Accused has said over a period of time between 3 August 2014 and mid-September 2014, concerning precisely what happened to Joseph on 3 August 2014.
	
	
	The Crown case is that there was a joint criminal enterprise between each Accused to assault the child over the period when he was living with them, and that AW is guilty of murder by application of the principle of extended joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	A great deal was said by each Accused to the police in many interviews. It seems to me that the words overheard, and in particular the words attributed to the male at the end (viewed together with the other words), are relevant to issues in the trial - namely the question of the truthfulness of the account given by each Accused as to what happened to the child on 3 August 2014, whether Joseph was in the park at all and whether any incident involving Joseph actually occurred in the park.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence is relevant to the case against each Accused.
	
	
	The point is made in submissions in support of the objection that there may well be a recording or a record of this conversation in police records because as at 26 August 2014, the police were conducting a multi-faceted investigation which included telephone intercepts. In addition, the police had relevant telephone records.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Fawkner gave evidence on the voir dire, and it has been indicated that a check would be made with the Travertine log (which forms part of the Crown brief) and further inquiries made to see if a recording does exist.
	
	
	I do not think that the possible existence or non-existence of a recording bears upon the question of the admissibility of this evidence. When one looks at what is attributed by Senior Constable Nocente to the weeping female, much of it is similar to what has been said by LN to police during interviews. The part that is attributed to the male is, itself, significant.
	
	
	I do not consider that the evidence, if allowed, should only be admitted against AW because he is the one who uttered the words at the conclusion of the telephone call. In circumstances where LN and AW were speaking to each other, and against the background of the many interviews and things said by the Accused to police and on the telephone or as detected by surveillance device, it seems to me that the fact (if it be the fact) that such words were spoken by AW to LN, is admissible in the case against both of them.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the evidence should be excluded under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. In my view, the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by any possible prejudicial effect.
	
	
	It will be appropriate, in my view, that Senior Constable Nocente not be called until such time as there is a complete examination of material to see whether there is any telephone record which relates to this suggested conversation. There is at least a week of evidence in the Crown case yet to come, so there should be ample opportunity for that inquiry to be completed. Senior Constable Nocente can be called at a convenient time when there is a response to that inquiry.
	
	
	I propose to allow Senior Constable Nocente to give evidence in accordance with the statement which is MFI 22.

		19 April 2017",2017-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276643,R v LN; R v AW (No. 4) [2017] NSWSC 221,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, LN and AW, are standing trial for the murder of a three-year-old boy, Joseph, in August 2014.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender video footage depicting Joseph in what is said to be May 2013, together with six still photographs of Joseph and others, said to be taken between 13 April 2014 and 13 June 2014.
	
	
	Objection is taken on behalf of each Accused to the tender of the video and photographs.
	
	
	Joseph was born on 13 April 2011. LN was his mother; AW was his stepfather. Joseph's natural father died in late 2010.
	
	
	From around the time of his birth in 2011, Joseph lived with his grandmother (LN's mother) at Rockdale. Also living in that household was LN's brother, RH, and other family members. It is the Crown case that Joseph was well cared for, healthy and happy during the period that he lived with his grandmother at Rockdale.
	
	
	LN informed the family that she wished Joseph to live with her and AW in Oberon. On 13 June 2014, Joseph accompanied LN and AW to Oberon where he lived until 3 August 2014.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that, during the 51-day period between 13 June 2014 and 3 August 2014, whilst Joseph lived with LN and AW in Oberon, multiple injuries were inflicted upon him by each of the Accused. It is the Crown case that both of the Accused were aware of the other's violence towards Joseph and were party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault, beat and ill-treat the child.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that, on or about 3 August 2014, Joseph received an inflicted injury that caused him to go into cardiac arrest at about 12.50 pm on 3 August 2014. He was transferred by helicopter to Westmead Children's Hospital where he was pronounced dead on 6 August 2014.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that LN inflicted injury to Joseph which caused his death and that she did so when intending to kill him or cause him grievous bodily harm. The Crown alleges that AW was guilty of murder by application of the principles of joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Evidence has been adduced from a number of witnesses called so far in the Crown case concerning observations of Joseph made on 30 June 2014 at the Oberon Nursing Clinic (Sarah Martin and Alana Benson), on 2 July 2014 at the Bathurst Dental Clinic (Katrina Holland, Jennifer James, and Dr Priyanka Grover) and at the Bathurst Dental Clinic on 7 July 2014 (Dr Narayan Prasad).
	
	
	A number of marks or injuries were observed on these occasions on Joseph and things were said by LN and AW to explain how these marks or injuries to Joseph had come about.
	
	
	Further, David Whitley, an electrician, gave evidence of visiting the Oberon house in which LN, AW, Joseph and others lived on 28 July 2014 on which occasion he observed a boy (Joseph) who he thought was autistic, and who was “just staring at the ceiling” and was looking with “a fixed gaze” and “no expression” (T307). He described the child as sitting with “a blank stare” (T309).
	
	
	In addition, recorded interviews on 3 August 2014 with AW (Exhibit J) and LN (Exhibit K) have been played to the jury. In the course of these interviews, AW and LN told police certain things about Joseph's health and explanations for marks which had been observed on the child.
	
	
	AW told police that Joseph had ""rickets or whatever it is, the bending of his feet"" (Q/A 49). AW said that, ""he's slow behind a kid for his age"" (Q/A 65). AW said, ""he's difficult to get to eat, sleep, and live a what would be a normal childhood life"" (Q/A 144). AW said, ""he's not a normal active three year old"" (Q/A 487).
	
	
	LN said, amongst other things, that Joseph ""doesn't lift his feet, he drags them and that's why he trips"" (Q/A 166).
	
	
	Joseph's uncle, RH, is presently giving evidence-in-chief in the trial.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender the video and still photographs of Joseph which are said to depict the child in Sydney in May 2013 and in the period April to June 2014. The still photographs appear to depict a happy child. The video footage depicts Joseph moving about (apparently freely) during the course of what appears to be a choir practice or performance.
	
	
	Objection is taken to the tender of the video and photographs on the basis that the evidence is not relevant to issues in the trial; or, if it was, that it ought not be admitted by application of s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the video and photographs are relevant to issues in the trial. It was submitted that statements made by one or other of the Accused during police interviews, or to one or more of the health professionals, with whom they came into contact in June and July 2014, suggested that Joseph had health or behavioural issues at the time he moved to Oberon in mid-June 2014. The Crown submitted that the photographic evidence would permit the jury to have direct evidence of aspects of Joseph's life and behaviour at the time when he was still living with his grandmother and family in Rockdale.
	
	
	In support of the defence objection, it was submitted that a limited argument would be advanced concerning Joseph and his health at the time that he came to live with the Accused on 13 June 2014. It was submitted that the photographs and video were not relevant to any issue in the trial. Further, it was submitted that the photographs would have an impact upon the jury in depicting the child in different settings before mid-June 2014, with the distinct prospect that the evidence would have an emotional impact upon the jury which may operate adversely to the Accused in a manner which was beyond the true worth of the evidence itself.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there is a real issue in the trial concerning Joseph's health, attributes and mobility, both before and after he came to live with LN and AW in Oberon on 13 June 2014.
	
	
	The jury has heard evidence from a number of nursing and dental witnesses concerning events in Oberon and Bathurst in June and July 2014, including observations of Joseph and statements made by one or other of the Accused about the boy's state of health.
	
	
	In addition, the jury has heard recorded interviews played which took place with each Accused on the afternoon of 3 August 2014, to which reference has already been made. These interviews include the statement by AW that Joseph ""was not a normal active three year old"" and by LN that the child ""didn't lift his feet"" but ""dragged them and that's why he trips"".
	
	
	Further interviews, including walk-through interviews, will be tendered and played to the jury at the trial. More will be said by LN and AW in those interviews concerning Joseph's health whilst he was living in Oberon.
	
	
	The jury is presently hearing from RH an account of Joseph's life between 2011 and 13 June 2014, when he was living with his grandmother, RH and the family at Rockdale. The evidence of RH describes a happy and highly mobile child with a number of other attributes being referred to so far in his evidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the video and photographs of Joseph will assist the jury in the fact-finding process with respect to Joseph's health, mobility and other attributes before 13 June 2014, in circumstances where the jury has a considerable body of oral evidence before them concerning those features of Joseph after that date.
	
	
	The fact that the video depicts Joseph in May 2013 when he was two years old does not, in my view, reduce the probative value of this evidence. If there is said to be some factor which affected the child between May 2013 and June 2014, that, no doubt, can be explored in the oral evidence of RH and his sister PH, who is also to be called in the Crown case.
	
	
	Through the evidence of RH, the jury have a word picture of the child before 13 June 2014 which can be assisted directly by the photographic images tendered by the Crown.
	
	
	I am satisfied for the purpose of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995 that the tendered video and photographs are relevant to issues in the trial.
	
	
	The Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the Crown if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused: s.137. The danger of unfair prejudice in s.137 directs attention to the risk that evidence may be misused in some unfair way by the tribunal of fact (the jury) so that the jury may not comply with judicial directions as to its use: see Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91]; R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506 at 582-584 [163]-[165]. There must be a risk that the evidence will damage the defence case in some unacceptable way, such as provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves: BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123; 231 A Crim R 537 at 549-550 [51].
	
	
	It is the case that there are aspects of this trial which have some emotional content. The Crown allegation is that LN and AW murdered a three-year-old child. The jury was informed, at the commencement of the trial, that there will be photographic evidence tendered during the course of the trial depicting injuries to Joseph. The photographs and video presently tendered appear to depict a happy child in different contexts.
	
	
	In circumstances where there is a form of before and after examination required on the part of the jury with respect to Joseph's health, attributes and mobility, before and after 13 June 2014, this evidence is of considerable weight in the trial. The jury will not be left with oral descriptions only, but will have a direct opportunity to view the child, including footage of Joseph moving about.
	
	
	In my view, any risk that this photographic evidence might provoke some irrational, emotional or illogical response or attract more weight than it truly deserves may be controlled effectively by appropriate directions to the jury. This evidence will form part of a range of photographic and other evidence which the jury will have for the purpose of determining the real issues in the trial.
	
	
	In addition, the jury have been reminded, at the commencement of the trial, of the need for a dispassionate examination of the evidence adduced at the trial. The jury will be reminded of this during the balance of the trial.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused persons. Indeed, without photographic evidence of this type, the jury may be left to speculate concerning the health, attributes and mobility of Joseph, in circumstances where evidence of this type is readily available to be placed before the jury.
	
	
	For these reasons, I allow the Crown to adduce in evidence before the jury the video recording (Exhibit VD1) and the six still photographs of Joseph.

	JOHNSON J: In the concluding phases of discussions between counsel concerning appropriate editing of lengthy interviews which have taken place between police and one or other of the Accused over many weeks, there is a single issue for consideration and determination by the Court. It is of course, highly desirable that the parties embark upon this process of discussion to narrow what is to be tendered, and to avoid the need for a Court decision unless necessary. The process undertaken in this trial, of which this is an example, is a highly satisfactory one.
	
	
	The issue that arises for consideration by the Court is this. On 13 August 2014, police conducted a walk-through interview where the Accused LN accompanied police to the park over the road from LN's house in Oberon where it is said that an incident occurred on 3 August 2014 involving the child Joseph, and some dogs. To understand this aspect, I refer to my outline of the Crown case against each Accused in R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) [2017] NSWSC 119.
	
	
	In the course of the recorded conversation in the park, the following was said:
	


Detective Sergeant Fawkner: ""All right. When you said that you wanted to tell me things about your thoughts of killing [Joseph], how did you think about that?”.

LN: “I, at first, I didn't think about it. It was the chatter that was making me angry”.

Detective Sergeant Fawkner: “Yep, but in what, how would you do it?”.

LN: “Like, what do you mean?”.

Detective Sergeant Fawkner: “How would you kill him?”.

LN: “I would have just strangled him, taken him to Oberon Police Station and I would have told them that ‘I did it’”.


	
	The opening part of that conversation, where the police officer asks LN what she wished to tell him about her thoughts of killing the child, is to be understood as a reference back to an earlier part of the conversation, recorded at page 45 of the transcript (part Exhibit PTF). The earlier part of the conversation was part of the material upon which the Court relied in allowing the Crown to utilise this evidence for tendency purposes, as explained in R v LN; R v AW (No. 1).
	
	
	The present part of the conversation (at page 57) was not included in the tendency notice. That may be a matter of oversight, but the fact is it is not part of my earlier ruling. The Crown has indicated, in those circumstances, that it would not seek to rely upon this part of the conversation for tendency purposes.
	
	
	Objection is taken to the tender of this material by Mr Wilson SC, for LN, upon the basis that it involves a form of speculation in that the police officer asked LN how would she kill the child, and LN replied by reference to strangulation. There is no medical evidence to suggest that strangulation played any part in the death of Joseph. It is submitted that this is not relevant and is prejudicial upon the basis that it involves a reference to an act that did not happen.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this is relevant in that it involves a further explanation by LN of her thought processes towards Joseph. Although it is not said that strangulation is involved in this case, the Crown argues that it provides a further illustration of what was in the mind of LN when she was discussing her approach to Joseph.
	
	
	In making this ruling, I keep in mind that the starting point in this part of the conversation is a reference back to what had earlier been said by LN. The topic of what LN had said about thoughts of killing Joseph is something that will be before the jury in the way in which I have outlined. This part of the discussion involved the police officer seeking further detail of LN's thought processes in that respect. It is true that what she said is something which, on the evidence, just simply did not happen - there was not any form of strangulation.
	
	
	That however, it seems to me, is one aspect only of the matter. The Crown case against LN is, in part at least, a circumstantial one. The Crown, of course, has to prove not only that LN committed an act or acts that caused the death of Joseph, but that she intended to kill him or to inflict grievous bodily harm. The fact that LN exposed her thought processes in this way, which involved an indicated intention to kill, utilising a particular means which did not actually get used in this case, does not it seems to me, stand in the way of its admission.
	
	
	It will be made entirely clear to the jury, of course, that strangulation is not said to have played any part in this case. However, the issue is what was in the mind of LN at relevant times towards Joseph, and in particular, in circumstances where she had told police that she had thoughts of killing the child.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this evidence is relevant and probative. I am not satisfied that any prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. The fact that there is the reference to strangulation which is not directly relevant to this trial, is not something which, in my view, would distract the jury in such a way as to activate exclusion under s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to admit this part of the conversation in evidence.

4276655,R v LN; R v AW (No. 2) [2017] NSWSC 153,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, LN and AW, are to stand trial for the murder in 2014 of Joseph, a three-year-old child. LN was Joseph's mother and AW his stepfather.
	
	
	The nature of the allegations against the Accused was summarised, by reference to the Crown Case Statement, in R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) [2017] NSWSC 119.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender at the trial evidence of certain conversations in August and September 2014 which were recorded by use of surveillance devices or telephone intercepts. The conversations were recorded lawfully under warrants obtained by investigating police.
	
	
	Objection is taken by the Accused to the tender of parts of these conversations on a number of bases.
	


Factual Background


	
	Before moving to the particular objections, it is appropriate to say something of the relevant background to this judgment.
	
	
	Joseph died in August 2014. Each Accused was interviewed by police and participated in recorded walk-through interviews on a number of days in August and September 2014. Speaking generally, each Accused told investigating police about their interaction with Joseph between 13 June and 3 August 2014, and what had allegedly occurred to the child on 3 August 2014.
	
	
	Put shortly, the Crown alleges that the child sustained fatal injuries inflicted by LN on or about 3 August 2014. It is the defence case that the fatal injuries were sustained when the child had an accidental fall on 3 August 2014 in a park opposite the Oberon house where they lived. The Crown says that Joseph was not in the park at all on that occasion but, even if he was, that any injury resulting from a fall was not the cause of death.
	
	
	The conversations recorded under warrant, which the Crown seeks to tender, took place between 9 August 2014 and 12 September 2014. The conversations involve the Accused persons speaking to each other or one of the Accused speaking to a third party, a relative.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to tender these various recorded conversations upon the basis that one or other of the Accused made statements which may constitute an express or implied admission or otherwise demonstrate consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	In circumstances where both of the Accused persons were being spoken to (with their consent) by police over the same period, the Crown says that these recorded conversations form part of the range of statements or comments being made by each Accused in August and September 2014 concerning what had happened to Joseph, and what led to his death and that this evidence is, accordingly, relevant and probative evidence.
	


Role of Surveillance Device and Telephone Intercept Evidence


	
	Before turning to the particular areas of objection, it is appropriate to say something about the manner in which surveillance device and telephone intercept evidence has come forth in these proceedings.
	
	
	There was in this case, perhaps unusually, a four-day committal proceeding, which took place at the Bathurst Local Court between 15 and 18 February 2016. Counsel now appearing for each Accused at trial also appeared at the committal proceedings.
	
	
	It was clear that the Crown intended to rely upon some of the evidence obtained by use of surveillance device or telephone intercept. The Crown Case Statement prepared on 5 March 2016 (part of Exhibit PTD) adverted to this (at paragraph 63), with reference being made in summary form to comments said to have been made by each Accused in recorded conversations on 13 and 16 August and on 4, 5, 6, 14 and on 15 September 2014. Accordingly, I accept that the substance of what the Crown seeks to rely upon had been identified to the legal representatives for the Accused, at least in summary form, at that time.
	
	
	There is evidence that investigating police provided a USB stick (or sticks) containing recordings of conversations to the Orange Legal Aid Office in December 2014 (Exhibit PTG).
	
	
	On 3 June 2016, both Accused were arraigned in this Court and pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder. A trial date was fixed for 20 February 2017, and orders were made for the filing and service of prosecution and defence notices for the purpose of ss.142, 143 and 144 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The notice of prosecution case was filed and served on 11 October 2016. It made no express reference to the Crown’s intention to rely upon electronic evidence, although the attached Crown Case Statement (which I have mentioned) did refer to evidence of this type. Certainly the s.142 notice did not identify any existing transcripts of recorded conversations which were to be made available to the defence.
	


Requirements Under s.142 Criminal Procedure Act 1986


	
	I pause at this stage to observe that, in my view, a s.142 notice ought refer expressly to evidence of this type. Section 142(1)(d) requires the prosecution notice to contain (or at least identify) a copy of each “document”, evidence of the contents of which the prosecution proposes to adduce at the trial. Section 142(1)(i) requires the notice to contain (or at least identify) a copy of any “document or other thing” provided by law enforcement officers to the prosecutor.
	
	
	Section 149A(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that a copy of a proposed exhibit, document or thing is not required to be included in a notice if it is impossible or impracticable to provide a copy, but s.149A(2) requires a framework to be established for inspection of items of that sort.
	
	
	I note that the word ""document"" is not defined in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is defined in s.21 Interpretation Act 1987 as meaning ""any record of information"" and includes, amongst other things, ""anything from which sounds may be reproduced with or without the aid of anything else"".
	
	
	In my view, s.142 requires the prosecution to identify and make available recordings and transcripts of electronic evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution. At the least, there ought to be a clear statement in the notice of an intention to rely upon evidence of this type and of the steps being taken by the prosecution to allow for meaningful disclosure by the prosecution of this material and its preparation for trial.
	
	
	I am reinforced in this conclusion by s.143(2)(b) which relates to the defence response to the prosecution notice. This provision allows the Court to make a discretionary order that the defence indicate whether evidence obtained ""by means of surveillance"" will require all prosecution witnesses to be called.
	
	
	In the Second Reading Speech for the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Mandatory Pre-trial Defence Disclosure) Act 2013, the Attorney General said with respect to s.143(2)(b) (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 13 March 2013):
	


“Proposed subsection 2(b), for example, requires the defence to confirm whether the prosecution is required to call witnesses to corroborate any surveillance on which it is intended to rely. Surveillance evidence within the meaning of the subsection is intended to have a broad meaning. It can include traditional surveillance evidence such as physical observations of suspects recorded in logs by the police, as well as that obtained under warrant, such as evidence resulting from the placing of a listening device in a particular location. This evidence may not be relevant in some cases and allowing the Court to make an order means that the Judge can tailor its terms to fit the type of evidence in question.”


	
	In addition, s.143(2)(d) allows the Court to make a discretionary order that, if the prosecutor disclosed an intention to tender at the trial “any transcript"", the defence response must indicate whether the Accused person accepts the transcript as being accurate and, if not, in what respect the transcript is disputed.
	
	
	These provisions confirm the view that the s.142 prosecution notice and the s.143 defence response are intended to assist identification of electronic evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution, and areas of dispute to be raised by the defence.
	
	
	In this case, the defence notices were filed and served in November 2016. The proceedings were mentioned before me as the trial Judge on 8 November 2016, and I raised with the Crown what steps were being taken with respect to telephone intercept and surveillance device evidence (T3-4, 8 November 2016). Accordingly, it was clear that this issue needed to be progressed.
	
	
	The commencement date of the trial was put back by a week to 27 February 2017, with various pre-trial issues being argued and determined this week. In this context, the Court was informed that transcripts of extracts from the various conversations had been furnished by the Crown recently with the need for defence counsel to listen to the full conversations for the purpose of considering whether more than that selected by the Crown should be tendered if the evidence was to be admitted.
	
	
	I note that emails were sent to the Crown by a solicitor for one of the Accused on 24 and 27 January 2017 and on 1 February 2017 (Exhibit PT1) asking that the Crown furnish the transcripts which were proposed to be tendered.
	
	
	Yesterday, on what was intended originally to be the fourth day of the trial, argument proceeded before me concerning objections to parts of the electronic evidence to be relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	What has happened in this trial is not uncommon. In my capacity as Criminal List Judge, I am aware that late provision by the Crown (both State and Commonwealth) of telephone intercept and surveillance device evidence has, on occasions, delayed trials and, in some cases, caused the trial to be adjourned to a later date.
	
	
	I make these observations against the background of s.134 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which states that the purpose of the case management provisions, including ss.142, 143 and 144, is to reduce delays in proceedings on indictment by requiring certain pre-trial disclosure by the prosecution and defence and enabling the Court to undertake case management of the proceedings.
	
	
	I note, as well, the existence of s.146(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which provides that the Court may refuse to admit evidence in proceedings that is sought to be adduced by a party who failed to disclose the evidence to the other party in accordance with requirements for pre-trial disclosure imposed by provisions, including ss.142, 143 and 144. An argument of this type was referred to in R v Turnbull (No. 25) [2016] NSWSC 831 at [16] and [21].
	
	
	I observe, as well, that the prosecution and defence disclosure obligations are ongoing: s.147 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	It should be observed as well that the statutory disclosure regime in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is additional to the common law prosecution duty of disclosure considered in cases such as Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65; 75 ALJR 593; R v Reardon (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 197; 60 NSWLR 454 and Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at 133 [17].
	


The s.146 Objection


	
	I return to the present case. Senior Counsel for LN submitted that the Court should decline to admit so much of the electronic evidence which has been objected to by the defence under s.146(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	On the view I have taken, I do not think that the Crown s.142 notice complied strictly with the statutory requirements with respect to electronic evidence. However, I am satisfied that each Accused was aware of the substance of what was to be relied upon by the Crown, so that this aspect has not taken the Accused by surprise. However, the late provision of the transcripts has given rise to other late steps being taken, including the need for the Court to determine these objections in the shadow of the commencement date of the trial.
	
	
	Having considered the arguments which have been advanced, however, I decline to exclude under s.146(1) the portions of the transcripts to which objection has been taken.
	
	
	I move now to the particular areas of objection to the material contained in a folder (Exhibit PTF).
	


Objection to Part of a Telephone Conversation Between AW and LN at 3.21 pm on 15 September 2014


	
	I will consider, firstly, the objection by Senior Counsel for LN to the tender of a conversation recorded by telephone intercept between LN and AW which commenced at 15:21 on 15 September 2014. At that time, neither of the Accused had been charged with respect to the death of Joseph.
	
	
	In the course of that conversation, the following was said as between AW and LN, who was, at that time, in the Panorama Clinic:
	


“AW: I have a hard question to ask ya. 

LN: Ask me anything. 

AW: Did you do it? 

LN: Yeah, I did it. I did everything, but you know what. No matter how much I tell them or what I tell them, they still don't believe me. So no matter what, I am still looking at gaol time. You know what, I don't care. 

AW: Yeah, but what you said the other day, I was hoping that...going away for a long time too, so...

LN: You're not the only one that's copping this shit. I am too. 

AW: I just want the truth out there. I told Joel everything, that's why I have criminal charges pending but, at the end of the day, I didn't kill [Joey]. 

LN: Because they don't believe that he was in the park, yet there's fucking witnesses saying that he was there. Do you see what I'm saying? They are twisting everything and now they are trying to drive a wedge between you and me.”


	
	The reference to ""Joel"" by AW is a reference to the officer-in-charge of the case, Detective Sergeant Joel Fawkner.
	
	
	Before moving to the specific argument, I should mention two other features. Telephone conversations recorded by the police included one on 13 August 2014 between AW and his father. In that conversation, AW suggested to his father that the officer-in-charge had suggested to him that he should ask LN the question as to whether she had killed the child in a direct way.
	
	
	I note as well that, at 15:48 on 15 September 2014, Detective Sergeant Fawkner rang AW to tell him that he had been informed that LN was leaving the Panorama Clinic. In the course of that conversation, AW told Detective Sergeant Fawkner that he had asked LN if she had done it and she had said that she did.
	


The Pavitt v R Objection


	
	In written submissions (MFI5), Mr Wilson SC submitted that this evidence should be excluded, relying upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pavitt v R [2007] NSWCCA 88; 169 A Crim R 452. He submitted that, in having the conversation with LN on 15 September 2014 at 15:21, AW was, effectively, acting as an “agent of the state” in asking questions of LN, so that, according to the submission, the evidence of the conversation should be excluded in accordance with the decision in Pavitt v R or, alternatively, under s.137 Evidence Act 1995 upon the basis that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to LN.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it should not be found that AW was an “agent of the state” at the time of the conversation, so that the principles in Pavitt v R were not engaged. The Crown submitted further that the evidence should not be excluded under s.137.
	
	
	Unlike Pavitt v R and other decisions where similar arguments have been run, this is not a case where a police officer asked a person to make a pretext call to a suspect, so that the response of the person to the question could be recorded. There is no evidence that, at the time that AW spoke to LN at 15:21 on 15 September 2014, he (AW) had any knowledge that his conversation was to be recorded. That is in clear distinction to other cases where an arrangement is put in place for such an event to actually occur.
	
	
	In this case, police had interviewed both LN and AW several times over a number of weeks, with each of the Accused consenting to that process. It is the case that there is a suggestion made by AW to his father, in a conversation about one month before the relevant call was made, that the police officer had been encouraging him to ask LN what had happened. There is no other evidence before me on that aspect.
	
	
	The appropriate conclusion, in my view, is that, whatever may have been said, AW had formed a belief that he should ask that question at some point, but he was not directly urged to do so by the police officer, let alone that he was asked to do it on an occasion when it was expected that the relevant conversation would be recorded.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it was argued by Mr Wilson SC that the police officer had effectively put the idea into AW's head, with AW, a month later, deciding to ask LN the question, but not that the officer “deliberately provoked it” (T122.48-50, 23 February 2017).
	
	
	I have considered this aspect of the objection and have kept in mind the principles contained in the joint judgment of McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt v R at 487-488 [70].
	
	
	By reference to the factors identified in paragraph [70] of Pavitt v R, I note that the first is that the underlying consideration in the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations is to look at the Accused's freedom to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom had been impugned. In this case, both Accused had spoken to police frequently and sometimes at their own suggestion about these matters. This is not a case where LN had declined to speak to police at all. In fact, there were frequent discussions, as I have said.
	
	
	I move past paragraph (b) in [70] as I am not satisfied that any freedom to choose was impugned.
	
	
	I move directly to paragraph (d) in [70]. The Court should consider whether the Accused, who is alleged to have made the admission, had previously indicated that he or she should refuse to speak to the police. As I have said, this is not the case. LN had been speaking to the police regularly and, at times, at her own suggestion.
	
	
	As to paragraph (e) in [70], it is said that the right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informer (in this case AW) who caused the Accused (in this case LN) to make the statement, and where AW was acting as an “agent of the state” at the time LN made the statement. There are two distinct inquiries required. Firstly, as a threshold question, was the evidence obtained by an “agent of the state”. Secondly, was the evidence elicited?
	
	
	I am not satisfied in this case that, at the time this call was made, AW was acting as an “agent of the state”. The fact that there may have been earlier discussion a month before with the police officer is, in my view, a tenuous basis to suggest that what happened on 5 September 2014 involved AW being deployed as an “agent of the state”.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the second aspect under paragraph (e) in [70].
	
	
	I note, as well, what is said in paragraph (f) in [70] - a person is a state agent if the exchange between the Accused and the informer would not have taken place, in the form or manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its agents. I am simply not satisfied in this case that that factor is made out. This is one of a long line of communications between the two Accused with each other. The fact that AW may have, at this time, thought he would do what had been the subject of some general discussion with the police officer a month before, did not render him an “agent of the state”.
	
	
	I do not think any of the other factors identified in Pavitt v R at [70] are engaged. I observe that the fact that the conversation was covertly recorded is not, of itself, unfair or improper, at least where the recording was lawful ([70](i)). In this case the recording was lawful and, as I have said, there is no evidence that AW knew that the conversation was being recorded at the time.
	
	
	I have kept in mind that there is evidence that, soon after this call, the police officer rang AW to tell him that LN was to leave the Panorama Clinic and AW reported to Detective Sergeant Fawkner what had been said in the conversation with LN. I do not think that elevates the position to one where AW was, on the evidence, an “agent of the state” at the relevant time. Accordingly, in my view, the principles in Pavitt v R have no application here.
	
	
	AW spoke to LN as part of many conversations taking place between them over a period of weeks which, unbeknownst to both of them, were being recorded. I decline to exclude that evidence upon that basis.
	


Objection Under s.137 Evidence Act 1995


	
	I move to the s.137 objection. I am satisfied that the evidence of this conversation is relevant, as a form of admission allegedly made by LN to AW with respect to the death of the child. I have kept in mind that this was one of a series of conversations over a period of time involving AW and LN, including police interviews and conversations with third parties.
	
	
	In my view, a complete account of what was said by each Accused concerning what had happened to the child bears directly upon the facts in issue in the trial.
	
	
	Section 137 Evidence Act 1995 is expressed in terms of an evaluative judgment which, in specified circumstances, mandates exclusion: IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 257 CLR 300 at 306 [16]. Section 137 requires the “probative value” of the evidence to be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused. This requires that the evidence be taken at its highest in the effect it could achieve on the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts in issue: IMM v The Queen at 314 [47].
	
	
	The danger of “unfair prejudice” in s.137 directs attention to the risk that evidence may be misused in some unfair way by the tribunal of fact (in this case a jury) so that the jury may not comply with judicial directions as to its use: Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91]; R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506 at 582-584 [163]-[165]. There must be a risk that the evidence will damage the defence case in some unacceptable way, such as provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves: BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123; 231 A Crim R 537 at 549-550 [51].
	
	
	The existence of competing inferences (or alternative interpretations), available to be drawn from the proposed prosecution evidence, plays no part in the assessment of probative value for the purpose of s.137: R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335; 237 A Crim R 238-280 [196].
	
	
	I have kept in mind that, over the time of these conversations and at the time of the conversation on 15 September 2014, both Accused were under pressure which affected their emotional state. LN in particular was under a degree of pressure and she was, at the time of this conversation, about to be discharged from the Panorama Clinic.
	
	
	However, it is appropriate, in my view, that the jury have a complete picture as to what was said by each of the Accused concerning what had happened to Joseph and, in particular, what act or events led to his death.
	
	
	I have considered the argument with respect to suggested prejudicial effect concerning this piece of evidence. I am not satisfied that the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to LN, and I decline to exclude it under s.137.
	
	
	This conversation will be admitted into evidence at the trial.
	


Other Areas of Objection


	
	I turn to other discrete areas of objection which may be dealt with more briefly.
	


Conversation at 7.29 am on 11 August 2014 Between LN and FN


	
	With respect to a conversation which took place commencing at 7.29 am on 11 August 2014 between LN and her adult son FN, objection is taken on behalf of the Accused upon a number of bases including s.137.
	
	
	The tendered conversation involves the Accused LN discussing with her son whether, if a person had fractured vertebrae close to the base of their spine, the person would still be able to walk. In support of the objection, it is argued that this is a conversation between two lay persons on the topic and that there is no evidence that fractured vertebrae appear to be involved in this case. It is submitted that the probative value of this evidence is little and that it should not be admitted.
	
	
	I bear in mind that this conversation is taking place five days after Joseph had died at the Westmead Children's Hospital. It is necessary to keep in mind that there were a number of conversations occurring with each of the Accused and police.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the suggested relevance of this conversation is that it reveals thoughts in the mind of LN, expressed to her son, about the capacity of someone who had suffered an injury of that type to walk. It is said that this may bear upon the question of whether any injury said to have been sustained by Joseph in the park on 3 August 2014 may be able to explain his death.
	
	
	I accept that this reference is indirect, in the context of this case. However, in my view, this reveals the thought processes of LN at an important time during the course of the investigation. I am satisfied that this conversation has probative value. I am not satisfied that its probative value is outweighed by any prejudicial effect, for the purpose of s.137.
	
	
	That conversation will be admitted into evidence.
	


Conversation at 2.09 pm on 13 August 2014 Between AW and his Father


	
	The next area which drew objection involved parts of a telephone intercept conversation commencing at 14.09 on 13 August 2014 between AW and his father. The Crown seeks to rely on parts only of this conversation.
	
	
	This evidence, if admitted, would only be admissible against AW. The Crown says it reveals a degree of consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	There is discussion (at pages 4 and 5 of the transcript in Exhibit PTF), with AW telling his father that there are eyewitnesses in the park who are allegedly saying what happened (to the child). It seems to me that this aspect, which is significant to the trial, namely, what happened in the park on 3 August 2014, is relevant to issues in the trial. The exposure of AW's thought processes on that issue as at the time of this conversation on 13 August 2014, is relevant to issues in the trial.
	
	
	I am satisfied that pages 4 to 5 of this transcript are relevant, and I am not persuaded it ought be excluded under s.137.    
	
	
	I move to pages 9 to 11 of the same transcript. Once again, there is discussion between AW and his father about the possibility that AW may be charged. There is reference, once again (at page 10), to the fact that one of the eyewitnesses in the park has told the police what had happened. On the same basis as that applied to pages 4 and 5 of this transcript, I am satisfied that pages 9 to 11 should be admitted.
	
	
	Next, the Crown tenders page 36 to part way down page 40 of this 72 page transcript. At this point, AW is speaking to his father and is, on the face of it, indicating that he had (with respect to Joseph) ""smacked him hard and stuff"", but as he said to the police, ""It wasn't life threatening"".
	
	
	This material is capable of constituting admissions of acts which AW carried out towards Joseph over time. There are further references to conduct of that type on page 37, including the placing of ice on the child’s head and of pushing him. It is agreed that parts will be omitted at page 38.
	
	
	There is a reference at page 39 in which AW says that he did not see what happened when LN carried Joseph into the house after the park incident on 3 August 2014. I accept that this is relevant to issues in the trial. Although aspects of what is said at that point are somewhat indirect, it does bear in my view, upon the facts in issue in the trial so as to render it relevant, and I am not persuaded that it ought be excluded under s.137.
	


Conversation at 3.37 pm on 13 August 2014 Between LN and AW


	
	The next document to which objection is taken is a listening device transcript of a conversation involving LN and AW at 15:37 on 13 August 2014. This transcript apparently records what was happening initially in the presence of Detective Sergeant Fawkner. It is said that Detective Sergeant Fawkner left the room and soon after, LN is said to have whispered, ""I did it and I want to die"". Then a little later, LN says to AW, ""I don't want to talk about it no more, I just want to be arrested. I don't care”.
	
	
	The Crown tenders this as a form of admission by LN with respect to the crime charged.
	
	
	Objection is taken by the Accused upon a number of bases - that it is necessary to understand what was said in context, that this was a week after the child had died, there had been many discussions about this, and there had been police interviews and that both Accused had indicated to police that they had used a measure of violence against the child over the period between mid June 2014 and 3 August 2014, although both denied killing the child.
	
	
	It was argued that this comment is capable of being understood as indicating a state of fatigue after many questions had been asked of LN by people concerning what had happened to Joseph. It is argued that it may be considered ambiguous in that it may relate to other acts of violence towards the child, but not the critical alleged act or acts of violence which are said to have caused death.
	
	
	Firstly, I accept that the evidence is relevant and admissible as a prima facie admission by the Accused LN. What one makes of it, viewed in context of the discussion on that day, and viewed in the context of many discussions over many days which have been recorded and will be before the jury will, in my view, be a matter for the jury to determine by reference to all the evidence. The arguments which have been advanced in opposition to the tender of this evidence may well be deployed in the presence of the jury to indicate that this is not an admission to murder. However, in my view, these are issues of fact for the jury to consider. Accordingly, I will admit this conversation.
	


Conversation at 6.02 pm on 4 September 2014 Between AW, LN and FN


	
	The next area to which objection is made is the part of the conversation commencing at 18:02 on 4 September 2014 between AW, LN and FN (LN's son). What the Crown seeks to tender lies at the end of the conversation where the following is recorded:
	


“AW: You have to understand what these detectives - that's their full-time job, they live and breathe it, they won't give up until they find an answer.

LN: But if Joel [Detective Sergeant Joel Fawkner] gets sick and tired of this shit that's going around and around in circles, then he is going to hand this case to Homicide, and then we are fucked. We have no leg to stand on.

AW: They are Homicide as well.”


	
	The Crown submits that this is a form of admission or evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part of LN, in particular, and it is tendered on that basis. Mr Wilson SC, for LN, objected upon the basis that there is a level of ambiguity with this, that what is happening at that time with both LN and AW was concern about what would happen to their daughter, who was younger than Joseph. It is argued that it is not truly evidence of consciousness of guilt, and reliance is placed once again on s.137.
	
	
	I accept that it is necessary to consider the tender of this piece of evidence in context. The context, as I have now said on a number of occasions, was a prolonged period of investigation and interviews and discussion with police officers about what had happened to this little boy. It may well be that this part of the conversation is able to be construed in a way that detaches it from evidence that bears upon the question of who killed Joseph and how. At the same time, it does seem to me that it reflects what was in the mind of LN at this time, and as such, has probative value. Its prejudicial effect, in my view, to the extent that there is any, does not outweigh its probative value. I decline to exclude it under s.137. That evidence will be admitted.
	


Conversation at 7.24 am on 5 September 2014 Between AW and LN


	
	The final evidence to which objection is taken was a conversation at 7.24 am on 5 September 2014 between AW and LN recorded by a listening device. In the course of this conversation at one point, LN says:
	


“LN: Yep, I'm sorry [AW].

AW: Hey, what are you sorry for? You've done nothing wrong.

LN: I've stuffed everything.

AW: Hey, stop that, all right. You haven't.”


	
	At this point LN was crying. AW says:
	


“AW: All right. You haven't, all right. Get that shit out of your fucking head, all right. It's a bit like what you said last night. Don't start talking crap or I'll get angry at you, all right, because you haven't.”


	
	And there was some discussion then with LN suggesting that AW should have left with their little daughter.
	
	
	Objection was taken to this on the basis that it is said to be ambiguous as to what it is that LN is apologising for. It may not relate to anything that she did. It may just relate to the state of exasperation which existed at that time, and the status and future with respect to their daughter. The Crown submitted that this is capable of being evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part of LN.
	
	
	This conversation is less direct than some others in so far as it is said to be evidence of consciousness of guilt. There are competing arguments that may be advanced as to what it was that LN was apologising to AW for. However, as I have already said in this judgment, it seems to me that what was said by the Accused (in this case LN) over the period of weeks that followed the death of Joseph, and which may bear on that issue, is prima facie relevant.
	
	
	This piece of evidence is open to a construction that LN is apologising to AW for what has happened to Joseph. The Crown says that she is apologising, in effect, for her part in the death of Joseph. Whether that is an appropriate construction to place on this will, in my view, be a matter for the jury. The jury will have all the evidence which bears on that topic and can make of it what they will, considering it in light of all of the other evidence, as to what LN said at different times on the topic.
	
	
	The way in which the Crown seeks to prove that LN murdered Joseph involves, in part, a circumstantial case. It seems to me that this piece of evidence is capable of shedding light on that question, although the weight to be given to it ultimately will be a matter for the jury. I am satisfied that it is relevant. I am not satisfied that any prejudicial effect it has (if any) outweighs its probative value, so I propose to allow it.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the various reasons set out in this judgment, I allow the Crown to adduce the evidence to which objection was taken. I note that a number of edits will be carried out to transcripts and some further material will be included in some of these transcripts to give greater context to what was said. That will happen, as I understand it, with the agreement of the parties.

		19 April 2017",2017-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4276657,R v LN; R v AW (No. 1) [2017] NSWSC 119,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Each of LN and AW is charged with the murder of a child, Joseph, on or about 3 August 2014 at Oberon in the State of New South Wales.
	
	
	The trial of LN and AW is to proceed before a jury commencing on 27 February 2017.
	
	
	In advance of trial, an issue has arisen for determination concerning the admissibility and use of certain evidence at the trial. It is accepted by each Accused that the evidence in question will be admitted, and thus will be before the jury. The question is whether the Crown should be permitted to rely upon this evidence against each Accused for tendency purposes under ss.97 and 101 Evidence Act 1995.
	


The Crown Case Against LN and AW


	
	What follows is drawn from the Crown Case Statement (Exhibit PTD).
	
	
	Joseph was born in April 2011. LN was his mother. AW was his stepfather. Joseph’s natural father died in late 2010.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that, during the 51-day period between 13 June 2014 and 3 August 2014 whilst Joseph lived with LN and AW in Oberon, multiple injuries were inflicted upon him by each of the Accused. It is the Crown case that both of the Accused were aware of the other’s violence towards Joseph and were party to a joint criminal enterprise to abuse the child and to cover up the abuse.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that on or about 3 August 2014, Joseph received an inflicted injury that caused him to go into cardiac arrest at about 12.50 pm on 3 August 2014. He was pronounced dead at Westmead Children’s Hospital on 6 August 2014. Joseph was three years and four months old at the time of his death.
	
	
	From around the time of his birth in 2011, Joseph lived with his grandmother (LN’s mother) at Rockdale. It is said that whilst he lived with his grandmother and her family, he was described as a happy child. Over the course of his life, Joseph was immunised and visited a general practitioner when sick. It is the Crown case that Joseph had no relevant illness or injury during the period he was living with his grandmother at Rockdale.
	
	
	LN met AW in 2011 (after Joseph was born) and they formed a relationship. LN and AW have a daughter of their relationship who was born in March 2013 (whom I will call “Mary”, which is not her real name).
	
	
	After Mary’s birth, LN and AW moved to a house in Oberon. AW was listed at Centrelink as LN’s carer.
	
	
	On about 14 February 2014, LN changed Joseph’s surname to that of AW by registration at the Office of Births Deaths and Marriages.
	
	
	In about March 2014, FN (LN’s eldest son who was then 22 years old) moved into the Oberon house.
	
	
	In June 2014, LN contacted her mother and asked to have Joseph come and live with her. The grandmother initially refused and LN threatened to take legal action in this regard. After further discussions within the family, a decision was made to return Joseph into his mother’s care.
	


13 June 2014 - Joseph Moves to Oberon


	
	On 13 June 2014, LN and AW drove to Rockdale and took custody of Joseph, then about three years and two months old.
	
	
	On 21 June 2014, a photograph taken by AW showed Joseph with a bruise to the side of his head which, at that time, had been shaved.
	
	
	On 30 June 2014, LN and AW took Joseph to a Child and Family Health Clinic in Oberon. AW told the nurse, Sarah Martin, that he thought that the child had rickets. The nurse noted that Joseph had visible sores on his face, arms and ankles which had been treated with a red substance. Joseph was referred for a hearing test and to a dental clinic.
	
	
	On 2 July 2014, Joseph was taken to the Bathurst Hospital Dental Service where he was seen by a dental therapist, Jennifer James. With the exception of his face, Joseph was completely covered in clothing. Joseph had a graze that ran down the centre of his forehead, nose and chin. According to AW, Joseph received this injury after a fall whilst running on the carpet. AW said that Joseph was not a fast runner and had something wrong with his feet. He told Ms James that Joseph could not walk properly let alone run. Joseph was found to have significant dental decay. AW said it was because of his grandparents. He told the nurse that Joseph had been “knocked about before they got him”. Ms James told LN and AW to take Joseph to the Emergency Department to have his face looked at.
	
	
	On that day, Joseph was taken to the Emergency Department where he was examined. He weighed 17.4 kilograms. An innocent explanation was maintained for the injuries.
	
	
	On 7 July 2014, Joseph had six teeth extracted by Dr Narayan Prasad. Dr Prasad did not notice any visible injuries on that day.
	
	
	On 10 July 2014, AW took Joseph to a hearing test. He told the nurse, Alana Benson, that Joseph did not walk because he had rickets and that he had only had him for a couple of weeks as the child had been abused by his mother. Joseph was covered by a big jacket which was left on throughout the testing. Joseph had left middle ear fluid and the nurse recommended some gentle exercises to clear the fluid.
	
	
	As at 21 July 2014, Centrelink recognised AW as the 100% carer for Joseph. At that time, AW was receiving compensation from Racing NSW relating to an injury whilst working as a stable hand. Centrelink payments commenced for Joseph by this time.
	
	
	FN, who is to be called as a Crown witness, states that he witnessed LN and AW smack Joseph after the child’s arrival in the house. On one occasion, about three weeks after the child’s arrival, FN saw LN grab Joseph by the shoulders and shake him in a way described as very hard, with the child’s head going back and forth. FN described the child as falling to the ground afterwards and developing a stare after this incident that he did not previously have.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that both LN and AW hit Joseph with a wooden spoon on his legs and bottom. According to FN, LN and AW would also use an esky to give the child ice baths. The esky would be filled with water and ice and the child would be made to sit in it. Both LN and AW were present whilst this was occurring. It is the Crown case that the purpose of these baths was to hide the injuries inflicted upon the child.
	
	
	According to FN, on one occasion he found Joseph lying face down on the floor with a graze on the right side of his temple. The child was crying. LN and AW told FN to leave Joseph where he was. AW told FN that Joseph was being a “fuck head”. It is said that Joseph remained lying in the same way for at least 30 minutes.
	
	
	It is alleged that FN saw AW apply duct tape to close Joseph’s eyes. FN also saw AW use duct tape to hold a ball in Joseph’s mouth. He saw him feed the child salt. FN heard LN say that she was going to pummel Joseph’s head in with a baseball bat.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014, an electrician visited the Oberon premises to repair some electrical wiring. He observed Joseph sitting on his bottom with his legs crossed. He was told by LN and AW that the child would not touch the power point as he just sits there. The electrician was of the view that the child was autistic and he did not make a sound and was staring into “thin air”. The electrician mentioned the child to the real estate agent.
	
	
	FN states that he saw further injuries to Joseph in the days prior to his death, including:
	



	
	a graze to his forehead above the right eye;
	
	
	grazes near both of his temples; and
	
	
	injury to his lips.
	



	
	AW told FN that the injuries to Joseph were from the child rubbing his head on the cot and self-mutilation. AW put mercurochrome on the injuries. At around this time, Joseph is said to have wet himself in his cot. The sheets were removed from the cot and Joseph commenced sleeping in a baby bouncer.
	
	
	The following day, FN tried to speak to Joseph but he just stared at him. He saw Joseph close his eyes even though he was awake. FN described AW as trying to open Joseph’s eyes.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 2 August 2014, FN saw LN burst into tears and cradle Joseph. She was feeding him formula through a syringe. In the days prior to Joseph’s cardiac arrest, he was eating only milk and water. LN told AW not to touch the child. On that night, Joseph was rolled in a blanket and put to sleep in the baby bouncer.
	
	
	According to Dr Michael Rodriquez, a neuropathologist with the Department of Forensic Medicine who became involved in the investigation after Joseph’s death, Joseph had suffered a previous subdural haemorrhage in the right middle cranial fossa overlying the temporal lobe. Dr Rodriquez believes this injury occurred several weeks before death. It is the Crown case that this is consistent with an inflicted injury occasioned after Joseph moved to Oberon.
	


Events on 3 August 2014


	
	On 3 August 2014, FN states that he woke to find Joseph sitting on the floor in the front of LN’s chair. FN states that AW and LN were not speaking to each other. FN states that he saw AW dress Joseph and change his nappy. He saw bruises on the child’s legs and bottom. He saw AW go outside and get the dogs into their harnesses and put on a long lead connecting the two dogs.
	
	
	FN states that AW led the dogs through the house and started towards the park. It is the Crown case that FN is not telling the truth in stating that Joseph went to the park as well. It is the Crown case that Joseph was left with FN and that he is not telling the truth because he feared that if he was the person who had Joseph in his care at the time of his cardiac arrest, he would be implicated.
	
	
	According to FN, LN carried Mary outside and Joseph walked behind her. The three followed AW across the road into a park. FN states that he went inside and spent 20 minutes in the lounge room before getting some vegetables from the vegetable patch.
	
	
	At 12.37 pm, a photograph was taken of Mary in the park. This photograph was found on LN’s mobile phone.
	
	
	Across the park was a skate ramp and two young men, SM (then aged 17 years) and BB (then aged 15 years), were present on that day with their skate boards. Both observed a family on the other side of the park. The family consisted of a man, a woman, two dogs and one child. The dogs were joined by an orange rope.
	
	
	SM saw the child, whom he described as a girl, get knocked over by the dogs’ lead. The child got back up and was walking around before the family left the park.
	
	
	BB saw the child get back up and walk around after the child had fallen over. He described the child as having long blondy-brown hair. He saw the male in a grey hoodie carry the child across the road.
	
	
	Shortly after the family left the park, both SM and BB noticed an ambulance arrive.
	
	
	FN states that he was walking to the back door of the Oberon house from the garden when he heard LN call out his name. He could see her walking across the front garden with Joseph in her arms. He met LN at the front door and took Joseph and ran him into the lounge room where he placed him on the floor. He could not feel a pulse. He told LN to call “000”. There was white froth on Joseph’s mouth. FN commenced CPR. AW came into the lounge room and poked one of Joseph’s’ eyes. He said that Joseph was playing at it. It is the Crown case that FN’s account of seeing Joseph being carried back into the house from the park is untrue for reasons mentioned at [33] above.
	
	
	LN made a “000” call at 12.54 pm on 3 August 2014. She said “We were out in the park playing with my three year old son and we were running around and then the dogs ran past him and knocked him over and then he went limp and he was still breathing and then he started gurgling and now I don’t think he’s breathing”.
	
	
	FN continued CPR on Joseph until an ambulance arrived at about 1.00 pm. Paramedic Matthew Wilkinson was the first on the scene. He spoke to AW, who told him that Joseph had been knocked over in the park by a dog. AW added that he was initially OK and that they brought him back to the house where he became catatonic.
	
	
	Joseph was unresponsive when the paramedics arrived. Various police and paramedics noted a number of injuries to the child, his face and head which appeared to be inconsistent with falling backwards on a grassy area.
	
	
	CPR was commenced and adrenalin was administered. Whilst working on Joseph, Mr Wilkinson saw that he had abrasions to both temples and to the zygomatic arch and there was redness to the forehead.
	


Joseph Conveyed to Westmead Children’s Hospital


	
	A helicopter crew arrived at 1.42 pm including Dr Daniel Moi and another paramedic, Mark Ellis. Mr Wilkinson noticed fresh bruising to Joseph’s forehead as the child was carried from the house. Mr Ellis also noted that a bruise to the child’s forehead was developing as the resuscitation went on.
	
	
	Joseph was airlifted to the Westmead Children’s Hospital. Paramedic Michael Tweedle was the helicopter pilot on the day and he was aware that the child had a pulse during the flight to Westmead.
	
	
	The helicopter arrived at Westmead Children’s Hospital at 2.43 pm.
	
	
	A brain CT scan undertaken at Westmead Children’s Hospital revealed that Joseph had “diffuse extensive supratentorial cerebral oedema without evidence of herniation. Bilateral subdural convexity haematomas. Bilateral intraocular haemorrhages”.
	
	
	A CT of the spine displayed “Loss of differentiation between the upper cervical spine cord and intraspinal subarachnoid space, suggestive of intraspinal subdural and/or subarachnoid haemorrhage, no fracture seen”.
	
	
	Joseph required maximal support including ventilation. Efforts of treatment continued for a period of about three days but Joseph did not regain consciousness. Joseph was declared dead at 1.26 pm on 6 August 2014.
	
	
	The cause of Joseph’s death was stated as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as a result of blunt-force craniospinal injury which caused hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
	


The Police Investigation


	
	Police conducted an investigation into the death of Joseph. Warrants were obtained for the use of surveillance devices to record conversations involving LN and AW. In addition, LN and AW each participated in recorded interviews and walkthrough interviews with police.
	
	
	In summary, LN and AW maintained throughout the investigation that Joseph was walking in the park opposite his house when he was tripped by a rope that was connected to the two dogs.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that Joseph was not in the park at all on 3 August 2014 and that the incident concerning a child falling involved the young girl, Mary. It is the Crown case that, even if Joseph was in the park on that day, the incident described by LN and AW did not cause his death given the circumstances surrounding Joseph’s life at the Oberon house and admissions which were allegedly made by each Accused.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that each of LN and AW made admissions concerning the use of violence towards Joseph over a period of time whilst he lived at Oberon. Put shortly, the Crown seeks to rely upon statements made by LN and AW in interviews with police, or allegedly made in conversations with FN as general evidence in the trial as well as being the foundation for use for tendency purposes as well.
	


The Central Trial Issue


	
	Notices of Defence Case under s.143 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 relied upon for each Accused indicate that each Accused will contend that the injury causing Joseph’s death occurred by accident as a result of a fall in the park on 3 August 2014.
	
	
	It is said that the central issue in the trial will relate to the cause of Joseph’s death.
	


The Ways in Which the Crown Puts its Case Against LN and AW


	
	The Crown puts its case against LN on the basis that she committed a voluntary act on or about 3 August 2014, accompanied by an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life, with that act causing Joseph’s death.
	
	
	The Crown puts its case against AW on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise. The Crown will allege that LN inflicted fatal injuries upon Joseph on or about 3 August 2014 and that, from the time that Joseph came to live at Oberon on 14 June 2014, each of LN and AW engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to assault him and/or to expose him to the danger of death or serious injury and/or to fail to care for him, and that AW foresaw the possibility that LN, during the course of that joint criminal enterprise, might commit a voluntary act causing Joseph’s death, whilst having the requisite intent for murder, namely an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm (T29, 21 February 2017).
	


The Crown’s Tendency Notices


	
	The Crown initially served tendency notices with respect to each Accused which were dated 9 November 2016. Those tendency notices were subsequently withdrawn and, in their place, tendency notices dated 9 February 2017 were served upon the legal representatives for each Accused.
	


The Tendency Notice Concerning LN


	
	The tendency notice with respect to LN (Exhibit PTA) states that the tendency sought to be proved is LN’s tendency:
	



	
	to act in a particular way, namely to inflict violence on her three-year old son, Joseph, between 14 June 2014 and 3 August 2014;
	
	
	to have a particular state of mind, namely to be preoccupied with killing Joseph and/or to want to kill him between 14 June 2014 and 3 August 2014.
	



	
	The tendency notice referred to statements made by LN as contained in five source documents:
	



	
	a video and transcript of a walkthrough interview at the park with LN and police on 13 August 2014;
	
	
	a transcript of a recorded interview with LN and police on 4 September 2014;
	
	
	a transcript of a recorded interview with LN and police on 15 September 2014;
	
	
	a transcript of a further recorded interview with LN and police on 15 September 2014; and
	
	
	a statement of FN dated 17 September 2014.
	



	
	As amended at the pretrial hearing on 21 February 2017, the tendency notice is said to bear upon the following facts in issue in the prosecution of LN:
	



	
	that LN by an act or acts of violence inflicted upon her son, Joseph, on or about 3 August 2014 caused the death of Joseph;
	
	
	that LN inflicted the injury or injuries causing Joseph’s death with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or to kill Joseph.
	



	
	Broadly speaking, the extracts from these various documents record LN stating that she used force against Joseph on a number of occasions, and in a number of forms, and having thoughts of killing Joseph and wanting to kill him in the period between 13 June 2014 and 3 August 2014. These matters are expressed in different ways, but may be summarised shortly in this way.
	


The Tendency Notice Concerning AW


	
	The Crown’s tendency notice with respect to AW (Exhibit PTB) states that the tendency sought to be proved is AW’s tendency to act in a particular way, namely to inflict violence and ill-treat three-year old, Joseph, a child in his care.
	
	
	The notice refers to statements made by AW in six source documents:
	



	
	the transcript of a recorded interview between AW and police on 3 August 2014;
	
	
	a transcript of a walkthrough involving AW and police on 13 August 2014;
	
	
	a transcript of an interview of AW by police on 12 September 2014;
	
	
	a video and transcript of a walkthrough involving AW and police on 17 September 2014;
	
	
	a transcript of a recorded interview of AW by police on 17 September 2014; and
	
	
	a statement of FN dated 17 September 2014.
	



	
	As amended at the pretrial hearing on 21 February 2017, the Crown contends in the notice that the tendency evidence sought to be adduced bears upon the following facts in issue in the prosecution of AW:
	



	
	that AW was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with LN to assault and ill-treat Joseph, a child in his care, between 14 June 2014 and 3 August 2014;
	
	
	that AW acted in this way to expose Joseph to the danger of death of serious injury.
	



	
	Put shortly, the statements made by AW, as contained in these interviews and the statement of FN, involve admissions that AW used violence of various forms towards Joseph over the time he was living at the Oberon house.
	


The Crown Application to Rely Upon Evidence for Tendency Purposes


	
	It is necessary to consider three topics in determining the Crown application to rely upon this evidence for tendency purposes:
	



	
	whether the Crown gave each Accused reasonable notice in writing of its intention to adduce the evidence: s.97(1)(a) Evidence Act 1995;
	
	
	whether the Court thinks the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced, have significant probative value: s.97(1)(b);
	
	
	if the requirements of s.97(1)(b) are satisfied, the tendency evidence about an accused person cannot be used against that person unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on that accused person: s.101(2).
	


The Notice Issue - s.97(1)(a)


	
	Mr Wilson SC, counsel for LN, made submissions concerning the requirement for reasonable notice with respect to the proposed tendency evidence. I will deal briefly with that issue.
	
	
	In my view, the Crown’s tendency notices dated 9 February 2017 set out in sufficient detail the tendency or tendencies upon which the Crown seeks to rely, and the suggested link between the alleged tendency and the facts in issue with respect to each Accused. Unlike the Crown’s original tendency notices dated 9 November 2016, the tendency notices of 9 February 2017 included summaries of the substance of the evidence to which the notice related together with dates, times, places and circumstances at or in which the alleged conduct occurred, as contained in the particular interviews or the statement of FN referred to in the notices. I am satisfied that the tendency notices of 9 February 2017 complied with the requirements of Clause 5 Evidence Regulation 2015.
	
	
	It is correct to observe that the tendency notices of 9 February 2017 were served 11 days prior to the date fixed for trial, namely 20 February 2017. As it happens, the date for empanelment of the jury was put back to 27 February 2017 at the request of the parties.
	
	
	The parties were in a position on 20 February 2017 (if not before) to address the Crown application that this evidence be used for tendency purposes, with written and oral submissions being made by counsel for each of the Accused. Clearly, the ruling which I am making will be known to the parties prior to the empanelment of the jury on 27 February 2017.
	
	
	It was not submitted that any actual prejudice had been suffered by either Accused as a result of the relevantly late notification by the Crown of its intention to rely upon this evidence for tendency purposes.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the requirements of s.97(1)(a), concerning reasonable notice in writing by the Crown, have been satisfied with respect to each of LN and AW in this case. If it had been necessary to resort to a grant of leave to the Crown under s.192 Evidence Act 1995, I would have made any necessary grant of leave.
	
	
	I have kept in mind that the evidence in question will be admitted at the trial and accordingly will be before the jury. The present controversy relates to the use of that evidence and, in particular, whether it may be relied upon for tendency purposes.
	
	
	I have kept in mind, as well, that there does not appear to be an issue that each Accused made the statements referred to in the February notices, the vast majority of which have been recorded electronically.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that reasonable notice has been given by the Crown of the application to rely upon evidence for tendency purposes against each of LN and AW.
	


Applicable Legal Principles Concerning Tendency Evidence


	
	If evidence is admissible for a non-tendency purpose, it cannot be used for tendency purposes unless the requirements of ss.97 and 101 are met: s.95 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Tendency evidence is a species of circumstantial evidence: Elomar v R [2014] NSWCCA 303; 316 ALR 206 at 277 [356]. Elsewhere in Elomar v R, it was said at 278 [359]:
	


""Tendency evidence is a stepping stone. It is indirect evidence. It allows for a form of syllogistic reasoning.""


	
	In Elomar v R, the Court of Criminal Appeal said at 260 [253]:
	


""Tendency evidence is evidence tendered to establish that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind. It is evidence that is tendered in order to provide the foundation for an inference that, because the person has or had that tendency, it is more likely that he or she behaved in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind at a time or in circumstances relevant to the issues in the dispute: see Gardiner v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 190; 162 A Crim R 233 at [124].""


	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal continued in Elomar v R at 278 [360]:
	


""The process of reasoning is:

on an occasion or occasions other than an occasion in question in the proceedings, a person acted in a particular way;

it can therefore be concluded or inferred that the person had a tendency to act in that way;

by reason of that tendency, it can therefore be concluded or inferred that, on an occasion in question in the proceedings, the person acted in conformity with that tendency.

Alternatively:

on an occasion or occasions other than on an occasion in question in the proceedings, a person had a particular state of mind;

it can therefore be concluded or inferred that the person had a tendency to have that state of mind;

by reason of that tendency, it can therefore be concluded or inferred that, on an occasion in question in the proceedings, the person's state of mind conformed with that tendency.

Tendency evidence is a means of proving, by a process of deduction, that a person acted in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind, on a relevant occasion, when there is no, or inadequate, direct evidence of that conduct or that state of mind on that occasion.""


	
	In considering the probative value of evidence under s.97(1)(b), an assumption of the jury's acceptance of the evidence must be made. No question of the credibility or reliability of the evidence can arise: IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14; 257 CLR 300 at 315 [52].
	
	
	As it happens, nearly all of the evidence relied upon by the Crown (which is the subject of this judgment) is in video, audio or documentary form. It does not appear that there would be any issue of credibility or reliability about that material in any event. It may be that issues of credibility or reliability will arise concerning FN’s evidence.
	
	
	With respect to the concept of ""significant probative value"", the word ""significant"" means important or of consequence - it requires more than mere relevance: R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457; Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330 at [163]. The evidence must be influential in the context of fact finding: IMM v The Queen at 314 [46].
	
	
	As the terms of s.97(1)(b) make clear, an assessment of whether the evidence has ""significant probative value"" is not confined to the evidence itself, but is to be made having regard to all the evidence sought to be adduced by the tendering party (the Crown): BC v R [2015] NSWCCA 327 at [82]-[83]. What must be assessed is the role that the evidence, if accepted, would play in the resolution of the disputed fact - its capacity to contribute to that resolution: DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 at 774 [72]; BC v R at [83].
	
	
	In IMM v The Queen, the High Court said at 313-314 [45]:
	


""The use of the term 'probative value' and the word 'extent' in its definition rest upon the premise that relevant evidence can rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue to different degrees. Taken by itself, the evidence may, if accepted, support an inference to a high degree of probability that the fact in issue exists. On the other hand, it may only, as in the case of circumstantial evidence, strengthen that inference, when considered in conjunction with other evidence.""


	
	Application of the ""significant probative value"" test calls for a focus on the fact in issue, the probability of the existence of which the evidence is said to cast light.
	
	
	I note that in Hughes v R at [182], the Court of Criminal Appeal said that an assessment of significant probative value involved consideration as to whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation consistent with innocence.
	
	
	It is appropriate to consider the level of generality of the stated tendency for the purpose of assessing significant probative value: R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451 at 468 [53]; Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55; 239 A Crim R 528 at 537-538 [40].
	
	
	The evidence need not demonstrate a tendency to commit a particular crime. It is not necessary for the acts relied upon to be rare or unusual: Aravena v R [2015] NSWCCA 288 at [87]. There is no need for there to be a striking pattern of similarity between the incidents: R v Ford at 485 [125]. However, qualitative differences in conduct are relevant: Sokolowskyj v R at 538 [41]-[43]; BC v R at [78]-[81].
	
	
	The second step, being a s.101(2) assessment, calls for consideration of probative value and prejudicial effect to determine whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect the evidence may have on the Accused.
	
	
	In DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 at 597 [150], Simpson J observed that the term ""prejudicial effect"" in s.101(2) is a reference to evidence being used against an accused person for a purpose other than that for which it is admitted. In R v Ford, at 469 [58], Campbell JA addressed the topic of prejudice under s.101(2) of the Act in the following way:
	


""The same concept, of evidence being prejudicial if it involves a risk of an unfair trial, has been adopted in relation to section 101(2). In R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413, this Court (Sully J, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) adopted, as expressing the essence of the task called for by section 101(2), the statement by McHugh J in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 528-9: 

'If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial'.""

Reliance Upon Evidence for Tendency Purposes Against LN


	
	Mr Wilson SC made helpful written and oral submissions on the question of the Crown’s proposed use of evidence against LN for tendency purposes. I have had regard to the written submissions of Senior Counsel (MFI1) together with oral submissions made by him and by the Crown at the pretrial hearing.
	
	
	The Crown contends that LN had a tendency to act in a particular way and to have a particular state of mind as set out at [61] above. The Crown identified the facts in issue as to which the proposed tendency evidence would apply (at [63] above).
	
	
	The Crown seeks to rely upon the tendency evidence involving acts of LN over a period of time, and statements made by her as to her state of mind at different times, including an intention to harm or kill Joseph, as a means of proving, by a process of deduction, that LN at the time when it is asserted that the fatal injury was inflicted, acted in a violent way towards Joseph whilst having a particular state of mind, namely an intention to kill him or inflict grievous bodily harm against him. The Crown alleges that the fatal injury was inflicted by LN on or about 3 August 2014, but does not attempt to identify the precise time when it occurred, although it is contended that it took place in the Oberon house.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Crown will invite the jury to draw an inference that, because LN had a tendency to cause physical harm to Joseph with a particular state of mind (intending to kill him or cause serious harm), that those aspects constitute stepping stones along the way to a conclusion that LN in fact struck the fatal blow or blows to Joseph on or about 3 August 2014 accompanied by the relevant intention for the crime of murder. The principles explained in Elomar v R at [80]-[82] above are called in aid by the Crown in this regard.
	
	
	I am satisfied that reliance upon this evidence in this way carries significant probative value. The evidence is significantly influential in the context of fact finding in this trial. In reaching this view, I have had regard to the role of the tendency evidence in conjunction with all the evidence to be adduced by the Crown in the trial.
	
	
	Mr Wilson SC submitted that the Court should have regard to whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation consistent with innocence in this case, relying upon the principle mentioned at [89] above. It was argued that the Court should have regard to the alternate explanation arising from the suggested fall in the park where, on the defence argument, Joseph sustained a head injury.
	
	
	It will be apparent from what I have said earlier that there are very live issues in the trial, as to who was in the park, and what in fact occurred. I have taken into account the intention of the defence to rely upon this scenario but I do not consider that that proposed argument undermines what is otherwise the significant probative value of the evidence. It will, in due course, be a matter for the jury to consider what findings of fact should be made in light of all the evidence to be adduced at the trial.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the evidence has significant probative value so as to satisfy the requirement in s.97(1)(b) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I turn to the assessment under s.101(2) of the Act to consider whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect the evidence may have on LN. I have kept in mind the principles referred to at [92]-[93] in undertaking this task.
	
	
	In considering the issue of prejudice, it is important to note that the evidence will be before the jury in any event for other purposes. This is not a case where the evidence will only be before the jury if admitted for tendency purposes.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the proposed tendency evidence with respect to LN has substantial probative value. I am satisfied, as well, that the probative value of that evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect which the evidence may have on LN in this trial. I note, as well, that there is no factual dispute in this case that LN said the things which are attributed to her in the tendency notice, at least in the various recorded interviews undertaken with her by police.
	
	
	It is appropriate to keep in mind that the Court will give directions to the jury concerning the use of this evidence for tendency and other purposes. A draft direction concerning tendency evidence against LN has been furnished by the Crown (MFI3) and I have taken into account this material for the purpose of this ruling.
	
	
	I record my conclusion that the evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely against LN for tendency purposes is, in my view, admissible for that purpose having regard to the requirements of ss.97 and 101 Evidence Act 1995.
	


Reliance Upon Evidence for Tendency Purposes Against AW


	
	Ms Moen, counsel for AW, submitted that the evidence upon which the Crown sought to rely should not be permitted for tendency purposes against AW. It was noted that the Crown puts its case against AW on the basis of complicity, where AW is not said to have inflicted the fatal injuries and may not have been present when they occurred.
	
	
	Ms Moen noted that the evidence relied upon by the Crown in the tendency notice of 9 February 2017 was already admissible as direct evidence as to the existence of the joint criminal enterprise, and AW’s alleged participation in it during the period from 14 June 2014 to 3 August 2014. It was argued that, although admissible for that purpose, there was no identifiable tendency purpose against AW upon which the Crown is able to rely in this case. It was submitted, as well, that if the evidence was admitted for tendency purposes as well, there were areas of prejudice which would arise.
	
	
	The Crown made oral submissions in support of the tendency application against AW (T65-70, 21 February 2017).
	
	
	I have already concluded that evidence is admissible for tendency purposes against LN. It was part of my reasoning, applying statements in Elomar v R in particular, that the proposed tendency evidence in the case of LN could be used appropriately in the relevant inference-drawing process in her case.
	
	
	The position is different with respect to AW. The statements of AW over a period of time, and his admissions as to conduct and words, are to be relied upon by the Crown as part of its proof that AW was party to a joint criminal enterprise with LN and that AW participated in that joint criminal enterprise. As I understand the Crown case, the Crown does not contend that AW struck the fatal blow to Joseph, nor that he was necessarily present when that occurred.
	
	
	In reality, the Crown relies upon this evidence in proof of the elements of the offence which it alleges AW has committed.
	
	
	It is important to keep in mind that s.97(1) is concerned with evidence that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind. The assessment as to whether the evidence has “significant probative value” under s.97(1)(b) must focus upon that suggested use of the evidence. Here, the evidence which the Crown seeks to rely upon for tendency purposes is, in reality, the same evidence that the Crown relies upon to prove the offence against AW. I do not see any additional tendency purpose available to the Crown with respect to this evidence. The difficulties which the Crown had in submissions in articulating how the tendency principle would operate with respect to AW, confirms my conclusion that the evidence cannot, in fact, be used for a tendency purpose (T68-70, 21 February 2017).
	
	
	Further, even if there was some tendency purpose available against AW (which I do not find), a substantial degree of confusion would be introduced into the directions to the jury with respect to tendency evidence concerning AW. There is almost a process of circular reasoning where the Crown relies upon the same matters as direct evidence of AW’s guilt, whilst at the same time saying that those matters also reveal a relevant tendency.
	
	
	I am not satisfied in the case of AW that the evidence, which will otherwise be before the jury, has significant probative value as tendency evidence to be adduced against him.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the application of s.101(2) by reference to the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect. It is sufficient to observe that, if this evidence was able to be used for tendency purposes, a measure of prejudice may well arise from the likely confusing directions which a jury would be given as to its use.
	
	
	To the extent that the Crown relied upon passages in BC v R and AC v R [2016] NSWCCA 21, I record my conclusion that nothing said in those cases is of assistance to the Crown with respect to AW.
	
	
	I decline to allow the Crown to rely upon the evidence contained in the tendency notice of 9 February 2017 for tendency purposes in the trial of AW.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the above reasons:
	



	
	I allow the Crown to rely upon the evidence contained in the tendency notice of 9 February 2017 with respect to LN for tendency purposes;
	
	
	I decline to permit the Crown to rely upon the evidence contained in the tendency notice of 9 February 2017 with respect to AW for tendency purposes.

		19 April 2017",2017-02-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4336529,Application by AMZ pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2017] NSWSC 432,"DECISION


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application made pursuant to Part 7 Division 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon AMZ (“the applicant”) whose identity is subject to a suppression order for reasons that will become apparent.
	
	
	The applicant seeks referral of the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal in order for it to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Such action is authorised by s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, but only “if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”: s 79(2). In Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 221 the Court of Appeal considered this precondition, stating that the “statutory language is not whether there is a doubt or question, but whether there appears to be a doubt or question” (original emphasis, per Beazley P and Leeming JA) at [16].
	
	
	The issue raised in this application is one of parity between the applicant’s sentence and the sentence received by a co-offender. The pre-requisite in s 79(2) is satisfied if there appears to be a “doubt or question” regarding the sentence imposed: Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; 85 NSWLR 783 at 791-792, [28]-[32].
	


Background to the applicant’s case


	
	In 2010 the applicant became involved in a large scale drug supply operation. He began by travelling from Perth to Sydney carrying large amounts of cash. In Sydney he met Mr Sahba Yazdani, who was the principal of the criminal syndicate. Yazdani asked the applicant to be a driver for him and also test drugs for him, both of which he did. The sentencing judge found that the applicant “acted as the personal assistant to the principal” (AMZ ROS p. 13). In this role the applicant travelled around the country assisting with the transport of several separate deliveries of drugs (large commercial quantities of methylamphetamine and heroin), helped cut and package drugs, and collected profits from interstate. Berman SC DCJ found that the applicant did not get involved in drug dealing due to addiction, but for money (AMZ ROS pp. 1, 13). The applicant was arrested on 15 February 2011 after the police intercepted suitcases containing almost 10 kg of methylamphetamine with a street value of more than $2.9 million.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to six charges relating to the supply of large commercial quantities of methylamphetamine and heroin through his participation in a criminal group. The applicant was sentenced in the District Court by Berman SC DCJ on 2 December 2011. The applicant’s overall sentence was 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years, starting on 15 February 2011, making the applicant eligible for parole on 14 February 2020.
	
	
	The applicant received a discount of 55% on his sentences for his guilty plea, remorse, contrition, and assistance to authorities. Upon his arrest, the applicant provided immediate assistance to the police. He described the inner workings of the criminal syndicate and told police much more about his own illegal activities than they would have otherwise been able to discover. He promised to give evidence against others involved in the operation, including Yazdani, which he did. The sentencing judge found “This is high level assistance. I will not say it is unknown, but assistance at this level is uncommon. It was immediate, comprehensive and useful.” (AMZ ROS p. 11).
	
	
	The offences and individual sentences are as follows:
	


Sequence 4 - Participate in a criminal group: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 93T

2 years fixed term, starting 15 February 2011

Sequences 5 and 6 – Each: Supply a large commercial quantity (6 kg) of methylamphetamine: Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA) s 25

For each: 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, starting 15 February 2011

Sequence 7 – Supply a large commercial quantity (1.05 kg) of heroin: DMTA s 25

6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years, starting 15 February 2012

Sequence 8 – Supply a large commercial quantity (6 kg) of methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25

9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, starting 15 February 2012

Sequence 9 – Supply a large commercial quantity (10 kg) of methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25

Taking into account the Form 1 offences (listed below) 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, starting 15 February 2013


	
	The Form 1 offences were:
	


(1)   Possess prescribed restricted substance, namely anabolic steroids, contrary to s 16 of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW); and

(2)   Deal with the proceeds of crime, namely $16,500, contrary to s 193C of the Crimes Act.


	
	The applicant appealed against his sentence. There were four grounds of appeal: three asserted specific errors by the sentencing judge, while the fourth asserted that the sentences were manifestly excessive. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal on 1 February 2013: AMZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 6. This appeal was dealt with before Yazdani’s sentence. The issue of parity was not raised.
	


Proceedings against Yazdani


	
	Yazdani pleaded not guilty to 16 counts relating to supply and distribution of drugs, and stood trial in December 2014. On two counts there was a directed verdict of not guilty (counts 7 and 15), on one count there was a finding by the jury of not guilty (count 12), and on one count he was found not guilty as charged but guilty of the statutory alternative relating to the indictable quantity of the prohibited drug (count 13). The jury found Yazdani guilty of the remaining 13 counts.
	
	
	On 15 May 2015 Yazdani was sentenced by Woods QC DCJ in the District Court at Gosford. His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence for all the offences of imprisonment of 28 years with a non-parole period of 21 years, beginning on 27 March 2012, with Yazdani eligible for parole on the 26 March 2033.
	
	
	The offences and the indicative sentences assessed by Woods QC DCJ are as follows:
	


Count 1 – Participate in a criminal group: Crimes Act s 93T 3 years

Counts 2–4 – Each: Supply a large commercial quantity (6 kg) of methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25

For each: 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years

Count 5 – Supply a large commercial quantity (slightly over 1 kg) of heroin: DMTA s 25

 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years

Count 6 – Supply a large commercial quantity (1.65 kg) of 3.4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy): DMTA s 25

 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years

Count 8 – Supply a large commercial quantity (7 kg) of methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25

 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years

Count 9 – Supply a commercial quantity (700 g) of heroin: DMTA s 25

8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years

Count 10 – Supply a large commercial quantity (approximately 18 kg) of 3.4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy): DMTA s 25

 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years

Count 11 – Supply a large commercial quantity (slightly under 10 kg) of methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25

 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years

Count 13 – Supply a commercial quantity (337 g) of methylamphetamine: DMTA s 25

5 years

Count 14 – Deal with the proceeds of crime, namely a sum slightly over $7,000, knowing it was the proceeds of crime: Crimes Act s 193C

5 years

Count 16 – Deal with the proceeds of crime, namely a sum of $861,300, knowing it was the proceeds of crime: Crimes Act s 193C

8 years


	
	Yazdani appealed against his conviction but did not seek leave to appeal against his sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal on 2 September 2016: Yazdani v R [2016] NSWCCA 194.
	


Present application

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The sole issue raised in the current application is one of parity. The applicant contends that he has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed upon Yazdani on 15 May 2015, after both the applicant’s sentence (2 December 2011) and appeal against sentence (1 February 2013). The applicant submits that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case, namely, the lack of appropriate disparity between his sentences and those assessed for Yazdani.
	
	
	It was submitted that the applicant’s sense of grievance was readily apparent from the starting point adopted by Woods QC DCJ in respect of Yazdani being 28 years, compared to that adopted by Berman SC DCJ for the applicant of 29 years.
	
	
	This was said to be indicative of legitimate grievance because “Yazdani was sentenced in respect of a greater number of offences, involving greater criminality”, as well as the fact that “his role was greater than that of the applicant; and that the applicant was able to put forward a strong subjective case, in contrast to which, Yazdani had previously been convicted for similar offending, and he was unable to advance anything by way of mitigation.”
	
	
	It was also submitted that a comparison between the sentences imposed on the applicant and the indicative sentences specified in respect of Yazdani bears out the applicant’s sense of grievance. The following comparisons are made:
	



	
		
			
			Offence
			
			
			Applicant

	In the applicant’s submissions it was observed that the applicant’s undiscounted sentence for participating in a criminal group (4 years 5 months) was substantially higher than the indicative sentence for Yazdani (3 years); the applicant’s undiscounted sentences for sequences 5, 6 and 8 were identical to the indicative sentences for Yazdani (20 years); the applicant’s undiscounted sentence for sequence 7 (13 years 4 months) was greater than the indicative sentence for Yazdani (12 years); and the applicant’s undiscounted sentence for sequence 9 (24 years 5 months) was greater than the indicative sentence for Yazdani (20 years). These comparisons, it was said, make it clear that the applicant was dealt with more harshly than Yazdani.
	


Whether there is the appearance of a question or doubt


	
	The submission that the applicant has a grievance based upon the aggregate sentence imposed on Yazdani of 28 years cannot be accepted. It cannot be said that Berman SC DCJ adopted a starting point of 29 years imprisonment for the applicant before applying the discount of 55%, as was claimed in the applicant’s submissions. The discount attached to the individual sentences. The overall sentence was affected, not just by the 55% discount, but also by the degree of accumulation decided upon by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The notion that Berman SC DCJ adopted an overall starting point of 29 years was one that was attributed to him by the Court of Criminal Appeal (AMZ v R at [9]) and repeated in subsequent judgments when the sentencing of AMZ was referred to. There is nothing in the sentencing remarks to indicate that his Honour was not aware of the fundamental obligation to assess the sentences for the individual offences before considering the issues of concurrence, accumulation and totality: see Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45].
	
	
	The issue of equal justice can be assessed from calculations of the starting point for the applicant’s individual sentences before the application of the discount. Having regard to the notional starting point for the applicant’s individual sentences compared to the indicative sentences for Yazdani, there appears to be a basis for the applicant to have a legitimate sense of grievance.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there are significant differences between the circumstances of the applicant and Yazdani so as to justify the applicant’s sense of grievance. Yazdani was the “principal” (Yazdani ROS p. 2) whereas the applicant was “the personal assistant to the principal” (AMZ ROS p. 13). Berman SC DCJ found that whilst the applicant’s “role was much higher in the hierarchy than a mere courier”, his actions were “at the direction of others” and there was no suggestion that he “exercised any independent or innovative thought about this drug supply business” (AMZ ROS p. 13).
	
	
	The issue of parity was raised by counsel for Yazdani at his sentence hearing. It was submitted on his behalf that Yazdani should be seen in equivalent terms of culpability as the applicant. Woods QC DCJ rejected that submission, finding that “although ‘the witness’ [AMZ] started out as a beginner and did indeed become more enterprising and active in his dealings with the drugs, he was always the lieutenant, never the boss” (Yazdani ROS p. 5).
	
	
	His Honour also made findings about Yazdani’s greater role in the organisation of specific offences. For example, he found in relation to Count 5 (the applicant’s Sequence 7) that “it was ‘the witness’ [AMZ] who did a lot of the actual donkey work, so to speak, but the organising hand was that of Mr Yazdani” (Yazdani ROS p. 6).
	
	
	Furthermore, as the applicant’s submissions noted, there is a significant difference between the subjective cases of the applicant and Yazdani. Berman SC DCJ accepted that the applicant was remorseful, most unlikely to reoffend, had good prospects of rehabilitation and had no prior convictions (AMZ ROS p. 13). Yazdani, on the other hand, had a criminal history of previous drug offences and was declared a habitual trafficker in Western Australia (Yazdani ROS p. 11). Woods QC DCJ found that the only mitigating factor in Yazdani’s case was the dislocation in his early life and his family coming to Australia as refugees (Yazdani ROS p. 12). This was one of two factors which convinced the sentencing judge not to impose a sentence of life imprisonment (Yazdani ROS p. 13). Psychiatric material was tendered but it did not mitigate Yazdani’s culpability (Yazdani ROS p. 11).
	


Parity and aggregate sentences


	
	Given Yazdani was given an aggregate sentence, one issue that arises in this application is the validity of comparing actual sentences with indicative sentences. There is authority for such an exercise being valid.
	
	
	Sentences between two co-offenders may be compared for the purposes of determining whether there has been equal justice despite the fact that one offender received an aggregate sentence: R v Clarke [2013] NSWCCA 260 at [68] and [75] per McCallum J; Prelipceanu v R [2016] NSWCCA 280 at [57] per Button J. The primary consideration in the exercise will be considering the indicative sentence for the equivalent offence: R v Clarke at [68]. One of the functions of requiring judges to provide indicative sentences is to afford an ability to analyse sentence structures and compare sentences imposed on offenders who share crimes: JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39](6); Prelipceanu v R at [57].
	


Attorney General’s submissions


	
	The Attorney General accepted that it would be open to the Court to find that there is the appearance of a question or doubt as to a mitigating circumstance in the applicant’s case within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. However, it was further submitted that there are reasons why the Court may properly exercise its discretion to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application. Three arguments were presented to that end.
	
	
	First, it was submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal has already upheld the severity of the applicant’s sentences as “within the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion”. Although such a finding was made, it is significant that AMZ v R was decided prior to the sentencing of Yazdani. Therefore, the issue of parity between the applicant and Yazdani’s sentences did not form part of the Court’s consideration in AMZ v R.
	
	
	Second, it was submitted that any further reduction in the applicant’s sentence would result in a sentence that was so low as to be an affront to the administration of justice having regard to the nature and circumstances of the applicant’s offending. This is a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider.
	
	
	Third, the Attorney General pointed to the fact that a reduction in the applicant’s sentence would have an adverse impact upon another parity issue, namely parity between the applicant’s sentence and the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on another co-offender, Robert Plaisted. Plaisted was involved in the same criminal group as Yazdani and the applicant. Garling ADCJ, who first sentenced Plaisted, made remarks comparing AMZ and Plaisted which a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal found to display an unjustified equivalence between the two offenders’ situations: Plaisted v R [2015] NSWCCA 287 per Basten JA at [8] and RS Hulme AJ at [51]. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered the issue of parity between AMZ and Plaisted, and reduced Plaisted’s sentence after finding that “AMZ’s role was very substantially greater than [Plaisted’s]”: Plaisted v R at [52] per RS Hulme AJ (Basten JA making a similar finding at [8]). Consequential issues of parity between the applicant and Plaisted do not alter the applicant’s grievance in relation to Yazdani. The more significant matter in this application is that of parity between the applicant and Yazdani.
	


Applicant’s submissions in reply


	
	The applicant made submissions in reply to those from the Attorney General, but having regard to the view I have already formed there is no need to deal with those responsive arguments.
	


Further issues for the Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	There is a possibility that the degree of partial accumulation of the applicant’s sentences could be regarded as unduly lenient. The Court of Criminal Appeal may form a different view to the sentencing judge: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601. This does not need to be considered at this time.
	


Conclusion


	
	It appears that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the parity issues between his sentences and the sentencing of Yazdani. It therefore appears to me that there is a doubt or question as to the sentence imposed on the applicant by Berman SC DCJ.
	
	
	I refer the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act.

		20 April 2017",2017-04-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4336597,R v Li [2017] NSWDC 86,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The issue I have to decide at this stage of trial is whether a deeming provision in s 308.2(3) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code applies.
	
	
	Briefly, that deeming provision reverses the onus of proof such that if the prosecution proves that the accused was in possession of a substance, it becomes the task of an accused to prove that he or she did not possess the substance with an intention to manufacture a controlled drug rather than it being the usual case that the prosecution has to prove that element beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	There are a number of steps which need to be considered in determining whether the deeming provision applies. The first step is to determine whether a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory required the possession of the substance to be authorised. That in turn depends upon whether the substance the accused possessed was a Schedule 9 poison and that in turn depends on whether the substance the accused possessed is a “derivative” of MDMA. It is agreed between the parties that this is an issue for me to decide rather than a question of fact for the jury.
	
	
	The accused was found in possession of 3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propane, “MDP2P”. He is charged in count 2 on the indictment with possessing that drug with the intention of using it to manufacture a controlled drug, namely MDMA.
	
	
	This morning I heard brief evidence from Dr Degratzia who has a PhD in chemistry. He drew me two diagrams, one showing the MDP2P molecule and one showing the MDMA molecule. He explained the process by which MDP2P is converted, or can be converted, to MDMA both in oil form and then in its more common powder or tablet form. He explained that the Regulation which the Crown relies on does not have a lot of meaning to a chemist.
	
	
	MDP2P is not named in Schedule 9. MDMA is. The Crown therefore relies on Part 1.1 of the Poisons Standard which says that
	


“Unless the contrary intention appears a reference to a substance in a Schedule or an Appendix to the standard includes ... (c) every salt active principle or derivative of the substance ...”


	
	The Crown says that MDP2P is a “derivative” of MDMA, relying on some words in the Poisons Standard introduction which say:
	


“Classification of a substance as the derivative of a scheduled poison relies on a balanced consideration of factors to decide if a substance of a similar nature (e.g. structurally, pharmacologically, toxicologically) to a scheduled poison or is readily converted (either physically or chemically) to a scheduled poison”.


	
	The Crown says that MDP2P and MDMA are similar and have a similar structural nature. Therefore, says the Crown, MDP2P is a Schedule 9 poison, its possession is required to be authorised, so the deemed provision applies.
	
	
	I do not agree with that submission and I will explain why. The Crown relies on the word “derivative”. The Crown says that the word “derivative” should be interpreted as an expression which covers two substances of a similar nature. There is, however, no evidence that MDMA can be converted to MDP2P. There is evidence that MDMA can be derived from MDP2P in the process described by Dr Degratzia. In my view the word “derivative” has been chosen by the draftsperson such that things only work one way. The substance MDP2P cannot be, or at least there is no evidence that it can be, derived from MDMA.
	
	
	The Poisons Standard Introduction does not say that the word “derivative” is to be interpreted as “similar”. I accept that the two molecules are similar in structure but I am of the opinion that structural similarity is not enough. There must be evidence that one molecule is derived from another molecule. As I have said, the evidence established that MDMA can be derived from MDP2P but there is no evidence to suggest the contrary.
	
	
	The result is that I am satisfied that the deeming provision does not apply and the Crown for count 2 will have to prove an intention on the part of the accused to manufacture a controlled drug beyond reasonable doubt.

		20 April 2017",2017-03-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4336609,R v Errington; R v Pantea [2017] NSWDC 85,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Many people appear before these courts charged with offences of drug supply, but few such offenders have a child at a private school and conduct some of their drug dealing activities from a BMW convertible.
	
	
	The offenders appearing for sentence today are in a rare category of offender. They are people who are living a lifestyle which many others might envy. They were themselves drug addicts but their drug dealing activities appear to have gone beyond merely a means of funding their own drug habits. To fund their own drug use they could have sold the BMW, they could have pulled their son out of private school but they did not.
	
	
	The two offenders are appearing for sentence on different charges. Andrew Lee Errington pleaded guilty at a late stage to an offence of supplying heroin on an ongoing basis and to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, also heroin, relating to a significant quantity of that drug found in his possession.
	
	
	Ms Christina Pantea also pleaded guilty at a late stage to an offence of supplying heroin based on her possession of a significant quantity of heroin for the purposes of supply. They each ask when I sentence them that I take into account offences of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime. A substantial sum of money is involved, almost $80,000.
	
	
	Andrew Errington was suspected by the police of running a drug supply business. Investigations were carried out and the police suspicions were confirmed. Part of those investigations involved physical surveillance as well as electronic surveillance of mobile telephones used by Mr Errington and others. The statement of facts records a number of actual supplies of drugs to a number of people. There were five such supplies and when he was arrested he was found to have possession of 4.4 grams of heroin for the purpose of supply in a blue Tarago, 2.4 grams for the purpose of supply in the BMW and a wallet, and 30.85 grams of heroin for the purpose of supply in his home unit. There was also a much larger quantity of heroin and this forms the basis of the second charge to which Mr Errington pleaded guilty, 120.38 grams of heroin in a storage unit.
	
	
	Ms Pantea’s plea of guilty relates to the 30.85 grams of heroin found by police in the home unit she shared with Mr Errington.
	
	
	A remarkable feature of one act of supply by Mr Errington is this, he supplied some drugs to a woman called Bettina Rogers on 8 March 2015. After that telephone call the offender rang Ms Rogers. He was concerned that he had given her too much heroin. He frankly admitted his concern that he did not want to be responsible for her death. When the offender was supplying drugs he thus well knew the harm that he could have caused to his customers.
	
	
	Andrew Errington’s experiences with drugs began when he was about 30. He had been in a relationship with a woman and had a daughter with her but lost contact with his daughter. A girlfriend who he was with at the time introduced him to heroin. The offender told a psychologist that he was down in the dumps. For some time he maintained a daily habit which was not that heavy. He and Ms Pantea used the drug together. He told the psychologist that they were able to hide their usage from the children, that may not have been entirely successful. After Mr Errington was stopped by police at one stage Ms Pantea rang her son and told him that Mr Errington had been arrested in possession of heroin. It is clear from the terms of the telephone call that the son was aware that Mr Errington was a drug dealer.
	
	
	Mr Errington has made attempts in the past to rehabilitate himself to get himself off drugs but as is obvious these have been unsuccessful. Since his arrest however, he says that things have improved dramatically as far as his drug use is concerned. He spent 15 months in custody. He was released on bail and has been working as a courier, a job which he loves. He has assisted in his work by his brother who has funded the purchase of a ute for him and his nephew who assists with the physical aspects of the job. His health has improved since quitting heroin and stabilising on methadone.
	
	
	Mr Errington did not give evidence and so why exactly it is that the offender decided to turn from being a mere drug user to a drug supplier is difficult to understand. As I began these remarks on sentence, he was not in financial difficulties and yet he made the very serious criminal decision to become a drug dealer of some significance. Fortunately, his drug dealing activities were detected by police. I say fortunately, fortunately for the community and, as it turns out, fortunately for the offender as well.
	
	
	He is a former prison officer. Whilst in custody bail refused he lived in fear of being recognised. He has recently undergone a sleep study which has revealed that he suffers from sleep apnoea. A recommendation has been made, not only that he lose weight, but that he also use a CPAP machine.
	
	
	Whilst on bail he has been subject to fairly strict bail conditions. It is undeniable that he has achieved a great measure of rehabilitation and that he is doing well in the community. Unfortunately he still needs to be sentenced for having committed two very serious offences. His ongoing drug supply offence relates to his street level drug dealing. His possession for the purposes of supply offence relates to a significant quantity of drugs which he intended to supply
	
	
	As he no doubt recognises, each time he supplied drugs to another person he was harming them. Not only does drug supply harm the individual drug user but the community at large suffers too. Anyone who has spent any time in the criminal courts in New South Wales would know the enormous proportion of offences committed which are the result of drug addiction. The offender played a significant role in the business of drug dealing.
	
	
	He has spent one year, three months and six days in custody and Mr Kirkasharian who appears for him today suggested that any custodial sentence imposed on his client could be such that he was not sent back to gaol. The level of his drug dealing activities is such that a non-parole period of one year, three months and six days would simply fail to affect the objective gravity of his conduct.
	
	
	I will take into account in determining the length of sentence to impose upon Mr Errington that there is a risk that he will be recognised, or otherwise identified as a prison officer. There is a risk that he might have to serve some part of his sentence, if not all of it, in protection and there is a risk that if that happens his conditions of custody will be worse than those of a general prison population. Even if he is not ultimately recognised, everyday in custody he will live in fear of being recognised.
	
	
	I will take into account in Mr Errington’s case that he has no criminal history involving any offence remotely approaching the seriousness of these offences. He has expressed his remorse to a psychologist, although as I have noted he did not give sworn evidence before me.
	
	
	It remains the case that as I have said he has achieved a significant level of rehabilitation. I have to recognise that by sending Mr Errington back into gaol there is a risk of interruption to that rehabilitation. I do not assess the risk as being a terribly big one given everything that Mr Errington has achieved including whilst in custody beforehand, but even if it were the case that sending Mr Errington back into gaol would undo the good work that he has done, it would nevertheless be necessary to do so.
	
	
	No-one would deny that drug dealing is serious offending and that the Courts must do what they can to deter others, people like Mr Errington, who are living a reasonable lifestyle who may be tempted to fund their own drug use and maybe even make a bit of money themselves through drug supply activities. Such people should be deterred by the prospect of heavy sentences of imprisonment being imposed upon them.
	
	
	I turn now to Ms Pantea’s case, her drug use apparently began when she started to rebel against her parents as a teenager. She began smoking cannabis at the age of 14, using amphetamines at the age of 15, and she was using ice regularly leading up to her arrest. She has used heroin and cocaine on top of all that. She has a significant history of drug use. She drank a lot as well.
	
	
	She has three children, two to an earlier partner and one to Mr Errington. She said to the psychologist who interviewed her that it was Mr Errington who introduced her to hard drugs. She describes a relationship with Mr Errington in which she was very much dominated by him.
	
	
	I do have to say a couple of things about that. Firstly, like Mr Errington, she did not give evidence to that effect. Secondly, I made a ruling in the course of the evidence that that evidence to which I have just referred was not to be used in the case of Mr Errington. It may be true, it may not. Ms Pantea said it to a psychologist but her failure to give sworn evidence before me is a substantial impediment to me putting much weight on what she has said.
	
	
	She too appears to have achieved a large measure of rehabilitation since her arrest. She has been seeing counsellors who report that she tells them that she is not using drugs and they say they have no reason to doubt her. She is caring for her youngest son, and her two oldest sons when she can. The question becomes of course whether a sentence of full time custody is required.
	
	
	Ms Rodger who appears for Ms Pantea concedes that Ms Pantea was trafficking to a substantial degree, clearly the amount of drugs that she was in possession of for the purpose of supply are enough to establish that. But Ms Rodger says that Ms Pantea should not go to gaol full-time for two reasons. Firstly, in accordance with the principal laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal for many years that those who traffic in drugs to a substantial degree should go to gaol full-time unless there are exceptional circumstances demonstrated, Ms Rodger says that there are such exceptional circumstances in this case.
	
	
	The second reason Ms Rodger says that full-time custody is not required is this. The principal laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal was laid down at a time when intensive corrections orders were not available. It is unknown what the Court of Criminal Appeal will say as to whether the rule needs to be modified now that ICOs are available.
	
	
	Ms Rodger relies on the hardship that would be occasioned to Ms Pantea’s youngest son if she were incarcerated. I can only take into account hardship to third parties where such hardship is exceptional. Unfortunately it is not exceptional that parents go to gaol. Often these are single parents and so the gaoling of a parent often leads to a child being without the care of his or her parents. It is also, I regret to say, somewhat distasteful for an offender to commit offences, offences where a home is used to store drugs where at least one child knows about a parents drug dealing activities and where the offender must know that if she is detected as a drug dealer then she might well go to gaol, to then rely on the hardship to those children when she appears for sentence. I place greater weight on other factors relied on by Ms Rodger.
	
	
	Ms Pantea is a woman with no prior record and has not committed any offences since her arrest for this matter. She has undertaken significant rehabilitation and putting her in gaol would risk her being granted public housing for herself and her children. There is also the rehabilitation that she has achieved that I have referred to earlier.
	
	
	So when I consider those circumstances and when I consider that the rules to which I earlier referred was laid down at a time when ICOs were not available, I am satisfied of the following: a custodial sentence is required; it is likely to be two years or less; and if suitable I would order that Ms Pantea serve her sentence by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	Accordingly in her case I will adjourn the matter to a date to be discussed with counsel for the consideration of a report into her suitability to serve her sentence by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	I return now to Mr Errington’s case. There are special circumstances in his case, they relate to the need to ensure that upon release from his further period of custody his rehabilitation will continue. He and the community would be assisted by a longer period of supervision on parole than the statutory ratio would otherwise result in.
	
	
	I take into account the pre-sentence custody of one year, three months and six days and so the sentence I am about to announce will commence on 18 November 2015. I impose a non-parole period of three years to date from 18 November 2015 and a head sentence of five years. The non-parole period will expire on 17 November 2018 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I note that backup charges on the s166 certificate are withdrawn.

		20 April 2017",2017-02-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4336635,R v P [2017] NSWDC 84,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The reasons that significant, and sometimes even harsh, sentences are imposed on those who commit sexual offences upon children are well known. One of the most important reasons involves the principle of general deterrence. Children are vulnerable to the exploitation of adults. They need to be protected from predatory behaviour on the part of those who would seek to obtain sexual gratification from children who often have no real understanding of what is taking place.
	
	
	The offender has committed two serious offences against a child. When I sentence him for those matters he ask that I take into account other offences involving the same child. It is conceded by Mr Luckman, who appears for the offender, that nothing less than full-time custody is appropriate. That concession is an appropriate one.
	
	
	The offender was 13 years older than the victim of his offending, a 12 year old girl who he knew through their joint membership of a soccer club. The offender began sending regular and frequent text messages to the complainant. On 14 September the complainant, and her family were at an end of season function. The offender was also there. At the end of the function the complainant and her family went home and the complainant went to bed.
	
	
	The following morning, 1 o’clock in the morning that is, the offender sent a text message to the complainant asking her to come out and meet him at a park where he was drinking with friends. What the offender was doing was encouraging the complainant to sneak out of home without her parents knowledge. She did this, she dressed and quietly left her home, going on foot to the park. There the offender gave her something to drink. That is an offence on one of the form 1’s.
	
	
	After about two hours the others had gone, so that the offender and the complainant were on their own. Although they were together, the offender was still communicating with the complainant by way of text message. One of those text messages asked the complainant whether she wished “to do anything”. Eventually, at about 4.45 in the morning, the offender took the complainant home. She had to be home because her father was due to get up at 5 o’clock in the morning.
	
	
	When they got near her home the offender kissed her and tried to insert his tongue into her mouth. That is an offence of indecent assault appearing on another form 1.
	
	
	Following this contact the offender resumed sending regular and frequent text messages to the complainant late at night. About three weeks after the incident I just described, again the complainant was at home and receiving text messages from the offender. He asked her to come back to the park and to bring some alcohol with her. Again she did what the offender asked. She took some rum from her father’s drink cabinet and went to where the offender was with a number of other friends from the soccer club. The offender gave her some rum and cola to drink. That is another offence on the first form 1.
	
	
	After a while the other people left and the offender and the complainant were left alone. They both got into the offender’s car. Once again the offender sent text messages asking whether the complainant wanted to do anything asking if she wanted to try anything. He then kissed the complainant on her mouth. There is no suggestion that she invited him to do so.
	
	
	He then unbuttoned her pants, slid her pants and her underwear to her knees before inserting his finger inside her vagina. The complainant asked him to stop, but he did not, he continued saying “Up a little bit further”. The complainant then asked him to stop again. He removed his finger from her vagina and took her home. That is an offence of having sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 14 years. The maximum penalty for that offence is 16 years imprisonment.
	
	
	A short time afterwards there was another soccer function at a hotel. The complainant was not at this function, but the offender was. A party was held after the function ended, the offender was there. At about midnight he contacted the complainant and asked her to come out and meet him.
	
	
	Again, she dressed, left her home and walked to a service station where she met the offender and another man. They walked to the house where the party was. Whilst out the front of the house the offender took hold of the complainant’s hand and placed it on the outside of his pants on his groin. The complainant could feel the offender’s penis through his pants. She removed her hand straight away. That is another offence of indecent assault. This appears on the second of the form 1’s.
	
	
	The complainant and the offender then went to a party where once again he supplied her with alcohol - Yet another offence on the second form 1.
	
	
	About 3 o’clock the offender called a taxi which took him and the complainant to a laneway in Maryland where he had left his car parked. They got into the car. Once again the offender began communicating with the complainant by text message, despite the fact that she was seated right next to him. He sent her a message asking her if she wanted to do anything, then pulled her pants and underwear down slightly before inserting his finger in her vagina. This penetration was of relatively short duration, a matter of seconds. What appears to have stopped these events occurring was that the complainant’s mobile telephone rang.
	
	
	This call was from the complainant’s father who become aware that the complainant was missing from her room. When the phone rang the offender removed his finger from her vagina and began to panic. He told the complainant what she should say in order that he would not be discovered as a person who had been doing what he had been doing.
	
	
	Two or three days after that the complainant told her parents what had happened. Police became involved on 18 December. A conversation took place between the complainant and the offender and the complainant’s father in which the offender denied doing anything with the complainant and denied ever being at the park with her. Some months later he attended a police station, he was interviewed and again he denied the allegations of sexual assault.
	
	
	When the matter was listed for trial the offender pleaded not guilty and continued to maintain that plea of not guilty, even after the first trial was vacated because of the unavailability of a witness. Eventually he did plead guilty.
	
	
	He claims he is remorseful. I will accept that he is remorseful now but I do have to note that this remorse came upon him very belatedly.
	
	
	The offender comes from a good family and has had an excellent upbringing. There is no real explanation for his behaviour, no real explanation as to why he would commit a serious offence on a girl who he knew was only 12 years of age.
	
	
	It is to be noted that the offender was drinking at the time these offences occurred, but it is clear that self-induced intoxication is not a mitigating factor in an offence, especially an offence of this kind.
	
	
	The only real suggestion of an explanation seems to be that this was a time of emotion for the offender. He had a relationship which had broken down and he had lost a job. That scarcely explains why the offender would seek sexual gratification from a 12 year old girl. There is nothing to suggest that he was in any way encouraged by the complainant and indeed her reluctance to engage in sexual activity with the offender is obvious.
	
	
	The offender has prior convictions but they are of little relevance. I should have said earlier when discussing the plea of guilty that despite its lateness, the plea of guilty does have utilitarian value. I will discount the sentence that I would have otherwise imposed by about 15% to reflect that circumstance.
	
	
	Of course, what I have to do is to assess the objective gravity of the offences, particularly the offences on the indictment. It is sometimes said that the form of sexual intercourse which occurred here, digital penetration of the complainant’s genitals, is one of the least serious forms of sexual intercourse. What judges might think about the gravity of the various forms of sexual intercourse does not necessarily match how the victims of such offences see them. However, I will sentence the offender on the basis that this was one of the less serious forms of sexual intercourse.
	
	
	That is not to deny the significant harm that these offences have caused.
	
	
	A victim impact statement was tendered. It reveals exactly the sort of harm that can be expected from offences of this type. Such harm was entirely foreseeable. The offender must have known there was at least the risk that he would cause such harm when he committed the two offences on the indictment.
	
	
	I also note that these offences appear to have been of a relatively short duration, although whatever comfort the offender gets from that circumstance is limited in the case of the second offence because it was the complainant’s father’s telephone call which caused the offence to cease.
	
	
	Related to that is this circumstance, there is no suggestion that the offender would have voluntarily ceased his offending had the complainant not disclosed what was happening, firstly to her parents and then to the police.
	
	
	In assessing the objective gravity of the offences I have also got to take into account the substantial efforts the offender took to bring about a situation where he was able to commit these offences. The Crown described what the offender was doing as “grooming”, an accurate description as far as I am concerned. He was exploiting the complainant’s naivety. He was encouraging her to leave her home in the middle of the night and supplying her with alcohol.
	
	
	I mentioned that the offender was remorseful. He expressed in evidence, his ability to understand the likely consequences of his offending and apologised for his behaviour. Why this remorse was not experienced sooner, I do not understand, but nevertheless despite its belated nature I will take into account that the offender has accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.
	
	
	It is always difficult to assess an offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, but I am satisfied that I can, in this case, describe them as good. It is unlikely that the offender will offend again, particularly in this way. The sentence I am about to impose on him will have a significant impact in that regard. It will be such that it will act as a personal deterrent to him acting in this way in the future.
	
	
	But, I return to where I started. The sentence will also act as a deterrent to others who might have broken up with a girlfriend and lost a job. Sentences such as I am about to impose should act as a deterrent to such people seeking sexual gratification from a young girl.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case, the offender will be serving his first time in custody and he will be assisted by an extended period of supervision on parole as he reintegrates with society upon his release from custody.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were I not to have done so I would have imposed a sentence of two and a half years imprisonment on each count on the indictment. Instead I will impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of two and a half years with a head sentence of four years.
	
	
	The sentence will date from today, 10 February 2017 and so the non‑parole period will expire on 9 August 2019, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		20 April 2017",2017-02-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4336639,R v Duong & R v Phan [2016] NSWDC 414,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Keller has just described his clients as “foot soldiers” in a large scale cultivation of cannabis. That categorisation appears to be accurate. There is no suggestion that Duc Duong or Hung Phan who appear for sentence today, having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to offences of cultivating a large commercial quantity of a prohibited plant, by enhanced indoor means were anything other than labourers who have decided to involve themselves in this serious criminal enterprise because they were short of money.
	
	
	Indeed, it is rare that the principals in such operations ever come before the Courts. Such people rely on offenders such as the two whom I am sentencing today. The principals generally work in the background, leaving people like Mr Duong and Mr Phan at risk of discovery and ultimately punishment. But it has to be recognised that these offenders went into this operation very much with their eyes opened. It would be impossible not be aware of the scale of the operation and what its ultimate objective was.
	
	
	Matters came to the attention of the authorities when police began investigating some premises in Mascot. They maintained surveillance on the premises and watched as on a number of occasions both offenders entered and left the premises. At some stage while the premises were unoccupied, police were granted a search warrant to enter the premises and only a short time thereafter, the following day, when the offenders returned they were arrested.
	
	
	The offenders at first claimed to have only done things such as tidying up and cleaning. When this matter first came before me I raised with the parties whether the offenders were actually admitting their guilt in relation to the charge of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of cannabis plants. The only admissions that they had made were admissions to tidying up but neither admitted to doing what I considered amounted to taking part in cultivation. the definition of “taking part” in s 6 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, requires that the person takes or participates in any step or causes any step to be taken in the process of cultivation. Turning then to the definition of cultivation and cultivate, that means to sow or scatter the seed produced by the prohibited plant and to plant, grow, tend, nurture or harvest a prohibited plant. I do not believe that tidying amounts to the taking of any step or participating in a step in sowing or scattering, planting, growing, tending, nurturing or harvesting the cannabis plants.
	
	
	The matter was therefore adjourned so that Mr Keller could obtain further instructions from his clients. A supplementary statement of facts has now been tendered in each case. The offenders now admit that they attended premises not only to do general cleaning but to also water the plants by turning on the water pump and checking on the water pipes as directed by another unknown person. That of course does amount to participating in the cultivation of cannabis plants.
	
	
	After the offenders were arrested, police went back into the premises and took photographs. The photographs show a very sophisticated hydroponic set up for the growth of cannabis plants. There were three separate rooms constructed, with a considerable amount of equipment to feed the plants, to water them, to cool the area and to provide light for the plants growth. As is common, the electricity meter was bypassed and indeed the offenders have each asked I take into account offences of using electricity without authority, admitting to the commission of that offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	A total of 653 plants were found. That is more than three times the large commercial quantity. The criminality of the offenders was, despite their low level in the hierarchy, nevertheless significant. They committed their offences for financial gain. The number of plants was significantly more than the large commercial quantity and it was apparent to even a casual observer that a great deal of effort had been put into this illegal enterprise, an enterprise in which they admit they participated.
	
	
	Both offenders were born in Vietnam. Mr Duong has only come to Australia in recent times, about 12 months ago, and has no criminal history. Mr Phan on the other hand has been in Australia for more than ten years and, significantly, has a previous conviction for cultivating cannabis. Mr Phan is clearly not entitled to any leniency on the basis that this is his first breach of the criminal law. He has other offences on his criminal history too. As Mr Keller, who appears for both offenders today, submitted, it would not be surprising if I impose different sentences on the two offenders to reflect their different criminal histories.
	
	
	Mr Duong is in his late thirties. He came from a loving and supportive family. They were farmers in Vietnam. He left school in his adolescence to financially assist his parents. The offender had no difficulty obtaining and maintaining employment until securing training as a baker. He married and he had children. He came to Australia, as I said, a relatively short time ago. Once in Australia, he has obtained permanent employment as a store manager and enrolled his daughter in school.
	
	
	His involvement in this offence came about after he met a man who he knew as Cuong at a coffee shop in Bankstown. During that conversation, he was offered some cash in‑hand work, to clean and maintain the lawn at Cuong’s warehouse. Mr Duong told a psychologist- that they exchanged telephone numbers and that shortly thereafter, he went to the warehouse, met Mr Phan, were they both did some cleaning and mowing of the lawns. Later they went back to the warehouse and went inside.
	
	
	It must have been apparent at that stage that Mr Cuong was asking Mr Duong to do something highly illegal. He was told he did not have to touch the cannabis plants. He said that he needed some money and accepted the job offer. Of course the accuracy of any statement that would suggest that he had no involvement in actually growing cannabis plants needs to be moderated by the offender’s belated admission that he did more than simply clean.
	
	
	Mr Phan is older than Mr Duong. He is in his mid‑fifties. His parents died when he was quite young and he came to Australia as a refugee in 1992. He too gained employment, married and had children but found himself in financial difficulties after his relationship broke down. He too says that he met Mr Cuong, this time at a newsagency. There was a similar story of having been offered a job cleaning and maintaining a warehouse. He told his psychologist that while he was aware the warehouse housed cannabis, he reports “not having any direct involvement with the plants”. Of course, again, that statement to the psychologist needs to be considered in the light of Mr Phan’s belated admission to actually being involved in the cultivation of the plants by watering them. Mr Phan suffers from psoriasis, a condition which is exacerbated by stress. No doubt sitting in gaol awaiting sentence is a highly stressful experience. It is possible that his condition will improve once he knows the outcome of today’s sentencing proceedings but it is possible that he will suffer from psoriasis and the unpleasant consequences of that, for some time.
	
	
	Both offenders will serve their sentences in what is for them a foreign country although not too much can be made of this. Firstly, because Mr Phan has been here for ten years but more importantly because each offender chose to offend knowing that if they were discovered, they would go to gaol in Australia. I am unsure as to the level at which both of them speak English but I do know that they are assisted by an interpreter today. Communication in gaol will be more difficult for them than it would be for a native English speaker.
	
	
	I mentioned before that the offenders committed this offence for financial gain. There is no suggestion that these men were wealthy or were to receive a percentage of the proceeds of the sale of the crop. That is consistent with the categorisation of them as being foot soldiers in the manner with which I began these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	I mentioned also the plea of guilty. I should emphasise that that came at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I will impose upon each offender, will be about 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Fortunately, the cannabis was not disseminated in the community although it was certainly intended that that would be the case. There is no doubt that this was highly organised criminal activity. Neither offender would appear to have been involved in the planning but it was a highly planned enterprise nevertheless.
	
	
	It is possible that each offender has prospects of rehabilitation. Whether they are good or not remains to be seen. In Mr Duong’s favour is the fact that he has no previous convictions and it is quite possible that this will be an isolated breach of the criminal law. In Mr Phan’s case, the prospects for rehabilitation must be bleaker, given his previous convictions. Both offenders accept that fulltime custody is the only possible sentence.
	
	
	I was assisted by a table of cases prepared by the solicitor for both offenders. More than just providing sentencing statistics, that table contained some detail as to the offences and the offenders in those earlier cases. Mr Keller also referred to a decision of mine where I sentenced an offender, that sentenced being upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal. I think it may have been in that decision that I did comment that it appeared that the current sentencing range for offences of this type may not reflect the seriousness with which parliament says these offences should be treated. After all, the maximum penalty is 20 years’ imprisonment. There is a standard non‑parole period of ten years. I of course have taken into account both the standard the non‑parole period and the head sentence in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon these offenders.    My reasons for not imposing the standard non‑parole appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	It is not for me to impose a sentence on the offenders which would be outside the sentencing range disclosed by the cases to which the Crown and Mr Keller have referred. The High Court in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606, spoke about inconsistency in sentencing being a badge of unfairness. That case is of course usually cited when issues of parity arise but the principle is of much wider application than that. Sentencing judges must ensure that they do not sentence on an idiosyncratic basis. Judges must approach their task on the basis that it should not matter which particular judge is sentencing an offender. Thus, despite what I have said, on more than one occasion now, about the range of sentences for offences of this kind, I will sentence in accordance with that range.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. They relate to the fact that because of language difficulties the offenders will have less opportunity for counselling and the like whilst in custody. In Mr Duong’s case, it is important that he be assisted to ensure that this is an isolated breach of the criminal law.
	
	
	The sentences I impose are as follows, taking into account in each the matter on the Form 1.
	
	
	For the offender Duong, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non‑parole period of two years and a head sentence of four years. The non‑parole period will expire on 4 November 2017, on which day Mr Duong is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	In Mr Phan’s case, I impose a sentence consisting of a non‑parole period of two and a half years with a head sentence of five years. His non‑parole period expires on 4 May 2018, on which day he is eligible to be released to parole.

4336640,R v Ross [2016] NSWDC 416,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: One evening in May 2015 a woman I will call “A” had a get-together with a few of her friends at her home in Swansea Heads. Part way through the evening the offender turned up, uninvited and unwelcome. He was a friend of  A’s partner who was unable to attend the get-together because she was in custody.
	
	
	The offender was intoxicated, aggressive and, so it would seem, clearly had intentions towards A. He was seen at one stage to touch her on her thigh, an advance she rebuffed.
	
	
	After having consumed some drugs and alcohol A went to bed. She had a recollection of, at one stage, the offender being in her bedroom sitting on her bed charging his phone, but her next memory is of waking up to find the offender having sex with her. In forceful terms she told him to stop, which he did. A then left her bedroom and made immediate complaint to her friends about what the offender had done to her, going to the police a couple of days later.
	
	
	Accordingly the offender was charged with an offence of having sexual intercourse with A without her consent. He denied that the sex was without her consent, giving evidence at his trial that she had been an enthusiastic participant in the sexual activity which he agreed took place in A’s bedroom.
	
	
	The jury found him guilty after a relatively short trial. That verdict was a surprise to no one. There was not the hint of any suggestion at all that A had acted in such a way as to give the offender the idea that she might be willing to have sex with him, and indeed, as it turned out, at the time the offender penetrated A’s genitals with his penis there was a tampon in her vagina because she was menstruating. The jury were entitled to think that a woman who wishes to have consensual sex, and who has a tampon inserted at the time, is likely to remove that tampon before intercourse commences.
	
	
	Further the offender had no explanation for some bruises which were later seen on A’s inner thighs. Those bruises were consistent with fingertips being used to forcefully spread A’s legs so that the offender could have sex with her.
	
	
	Consistent with the jury’s verdict I will sentence the offender on the basis that without any encouragement at all from the complainant he had sexual intercourse with her while she was asleep. Not only did she not consent to that sexual intercourse, she was completely unable to do so because she was asleep. The offender took advantage of her vulnerability to do what he did.
	
	
	The offence for which the offender is now to be sentenced has a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in determining the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The offender was born in Sydney and lived there till he was about seven. The family, his mother, father and a younger brother and sister, moved to the Newcastle area. The offender has had learning difficulties throughout his life. Although there was some suspicion that he suffered from ADHD it was not until he was an adult that diagnosis was made. He was given a prescription for a drug to treat that condition but chose not to take it in an ongoing way.
	
	
	A psychological report prepared, it must be noted, before his conviction for this matter, speaks of the offender’s sensitivity and hostility in social interactions which probably serve as formidable obstacles to the development of close relationships with the result that he is likely to be withdrawn and isolated. That observation by a psychologist seems to be borne out by the offender’s relationships with friends and family.
	
	
	What is most apparent both from the evidence in the trial, and the evidence tendered today on sentence, is that the offender has a significant problem with drugs. More than most, it would seem, drugs are a factor in him becoming a most unpleasant person when he is using them.
	
	
	The psychological report refers to the offender’s behaviour during attempts by the psychologist to obtain an accurate assessment as to the offender’s personality. The psychologist describes his behaviour whilst he was on drugs, which description is entirely consistent with the way he was described on the night that he sexually assaulted A. Clearly he was drug affected at the time of his offending, but it is equally clearly the law that self-induced intoxication is not a mitigating factor.
	
	
	On the other hand, as Mr Bickford points out, that is not to say that the fact that he was under the influence of drugs at the time he forced himself upon A is irrelevant. The prospects of him re-offending are clearly linked to the prospects of him continuing to use drugs, and the circumstance that he was under the influence of drugs can throw light on what led to the offence in the first place.
	
	
	This was a most serious form of the offence. The offence was committed in A’s home while she was vulnerable in the extreme. Whilst there is of course no hierarchy of the various forms of sexual intercourse, it is to be noted that the offender had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with A, the most intimate form of sexual connection whilst he was not wearing a condom.
	
	
	On top of that we turn to what the offender knew. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was fully aware that A was asleep when he began to have sexual intercourse with her, thus he was fully aware that she was not consenting, and indeed not even in a position to consent, at the time he began to have sex with her. On the other hand it must be recognised that the offence occurred over only a very short time, and once A became fully awake and told him to stop, he did so.
	
	
	The offender has a number of offences on his criminal history but nothing approaching this seriousness. All his previous offences have been dealt with in the Local Court with no previous custodial sentences imposed. As the Crown pointed out, at the time he committed this offence against A he had committed a number of other offences at around the same time.
	
	
	I cannot say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, indeed Mr Bickford did not suggest that I would, but that is not to say that he has no prospects of rehabilitation. He has at times been able to hold down a job, a job where, as part of his employment, he would need to be drug free. He was also, for a considerable time, caring for his daughter as a single father, and so the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation are not as bleak as they might otherwise have looked. All of course will depend on what happens with his drug use once he is released from custody. It is certainly not the case that he is remorseful. Mr Bickford did not suggest otherwise.
	
	
	One of the most important factors in determining a sentence to impose upon an offender concerns the harm that that offence caused. A victim impact statement was tendered today by the Crown. In it A speaks about the significant impacts upon her of the offender’s wrongdoing. I will read out a small part of it.
	


“Before all of this I considered myself a happy-go-lucky kind of person. Now I physically cannot leave the house. I feel anxiety and now I do not trust people. I knew there were people out there like him but never thought it would happen to me.”


	
	That harm is entirely foreseeable from an offence of this type. It is regrettably commonplace. Women who are sexually assaulted often report consequences of the kind A has spoken about. The harm that such offences cause is an important aspect in deciding that there needs to be a significant component of general deterrence built into the sentence that I will ultimately impose upon the offender.
	
	
	Other purposes of sentencing are there as well. Personal deterrence is of importance, as is retribution and denunciation. There is no reason that any aspect of the sentencing process should not be given full weight in the case of this offence, and this offender.
	
	
	The offender has been assaulted in gaol causing a significant injury to him. As a result he has been moved from the general prison population. There is a risk that he will serve a significant part, perhaps even all of his sentence, whilst in protection, and there is a risk that if he does so his conditions of custody will be harsher than those of the general prison population. I have taken both of those matters into account.
	
	
	I accept that there are special circumstances in this case. They relate to this being the offender’s first time in custody, his significant drug history, and his difficulties in concentrating, which will all suggest the need for a longer than usual period of supervision on parole once the offender is released from custody.
	
	
	On the other hand it is a fundamental rule in sentencing that not only the head sentence, but also the non-parole period, must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. As I hope to have demonstrated, this was an offence of significant seriousness.
	
	
	The sentence I impose is as follows: I set a non-parole period of five years to date from 10 August 2016, and a head sentence of eight years. The non-parole period will thus expire on 9 August 2021, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

4336641,R v B [2016] NSWDC 415,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Almost invariably when sentencing for offences of child sexual assault, the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence is of prime importance. Children are very vulnerable to the sexual predations of adults. Offences such as the one I am about to describe often occur in secret, often enough go undetected, and often enough cause enormous harm. When offences are detected it is important that the criminal law responds by imposing sentences of such severity that they act as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to satisfy their sexual desires by committing offences of sexual assault upon young children.
	
	
	This is a tragically common case too. The offender, B, indecently assaulted his stepdaughter. The offence came about when the complainant, who I will not name in order to protect her privacy, came home from school. Without any warning it would seem, when she was in the lounge room with the offender, he pushed her onto the couch and told her to take her pants off. She did this, removing her pants and underwear, after which the offender pushed her against a wall in the lounge room and started to touch her vagina with his fingers. The complainant was crying and told the offender to stop. After he did this, he told her to have a shower and to wash her body and her hair.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the complainant was distressed by what had just occurred. She was crying in the shower and was told to stop crying because a friend of the offender’s was coming over. This occurred sometime between 3 October 2012 and 3 October 2013.
	
	
	In December 2013, there was a complaint to police. The offender was arrested early the following year but he declined to participate in an interview with police. Shortly before his trial was due to commence, he pleaded guilty to an offence of assaulting the complainant and at the time of the assault, committing an act of indecency upon her, she being under age of 16 years, namely, nine years. That is an offence which carries a maximum penalty of ten years and a standard non‑parole period of eight years. I have taken into both the maximum penalty and the standard non‑parole period in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose. My reasons for not imposing the standard non‑parole appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	It is agreed that the offender’s plea was somewhat belated but it had a utilitarian a discount nevertheless. I will therefore impose a sentence which is approximately 15% less than it would otherwise have been. It is also important to note that by pleading guilty, the offender has spared the complainant the need to give her evidence and be cross‑examined. That is perhaps the only evidence of remorse in the present case.
	
	
	This was a very serious example of an indecent assault upon a child under the age of 16. Force was used. There was a significant breach of trust. The complainant was well under the age of 16 years and the form of the indecent assault whereby the offender touched the complainant’s genitals is of course one of the most serious forms of indecent assault with which the Courts deal.
	
	
	I have no hesitation in finding that this was an offence well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I make that finding even given the circumstance that there is no suggestion that the assault went on for a significant period of time. There was no evidence of any planning, nor any threat in an effort to prevent her revealing his wrongdoing to others.
	
	
	The offender’s background is somewhat troubled. His parents separated when he was in Primary School. He had a difficult relationship with his mother, mainly, it would seem, over his need to take ADHD medication. His relationship with his stepfather suffered from the latter’s desire to be a father to him, something which the offender had difficulty accepting. On the other hand, he has a good relationship with his father. He was a positive role model and who indeed supports him even today, travelling up from Wagga to be present at his son’s sentencing.
	
	
	A psychological report was tendered. It speaks of the offender’s social isolation or what is described as a long history of interpersonal difficulties with others, not only with his mother and stepfather but noting that he was unable to secure peer relationships during his education. He has not established them in his adulthood. Despite that, he has been able to form some relationships, including with the mother of the complainant. He has had a spasmodic work history but is presently employed as a truck driver.
	
	
	His prospects of rehabilitation were the subject of submissions. The psychologist applied the Static‑99 test. I note the results of that test but I also note, as the psychologist herself says, Static‑99 is an actuarial test which says something about a number of offences in the population who are likely to re‑offend. It says much less about the prospects that an individual will do so. Certainly, the offender has prospects of rehabilitation but a lot will depend on the effects of the treatment he has indicated his is willing to undergo.
	
	
	One issue concerning the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation is this. The offender has never actually explained why he did what he did. The question which thus arises, is how one knows that given a similar situation in the future, the offender would not act in exactly the same way. The psychologist addresses this in her report, noting that denial or minimisations of offending do not necessarily suggest poorer treatment outcomes. As I have said, the offender is willing to undergo treatment. There are prospects for his rehabilitation but a lot will depend on the effect of treatment. I will take into account his willingness to be treated in assessing the appropriate sentence to impose upon him.
	
	
	It is conceded by Ms Mendez, who appears for the offender today, that nothing less than fulltime custody is appropriate. That is a concession with which I agree. This was, I repeat, objectively a most serious form of this offence and in the cases of almost all such offences, general deterrence is of prime importance. This case is no exception.
	
	
	I accept that there are special circumstances in this case. This is the offender’s first time in custody, a factor which of course is not by itself enough to demonstrate special circumstances, but the need for the offender to be treated, the benefits which could well flow to him and thus the community if he is treated, and the fact that he has struggled with interpersonal relationships in the past, so will benefit from assistance upon release from custody, all demonstrate in my view, that this is an appropriate case to make a variation from the statutory ratio between head sentence and non‑parole period. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct, and that is enough to justify a significant sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non‑parole period of three and a half years, and a head sentence to date from 8 December 2016. The head sentence is one of five and a half years. The non‑parole period will expire on 7 June 2020, on which date, the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		20 April 2017",2016-12-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4336642,R v CP [2016] NSWDC 413,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: When K , the complainant in this matter, told her mother that, as she put it, “Me and poppy have sex,” she was but six years of age. A few days later she was interviewed; the interview being electronically recorded. That interview became the primary source of evidence against the accused, the complainant’s grandfather. It is a remarkably powerful piece of evidence. In a most matter-of-fact way the complainant describes a number of different sexual activities which she and the offender engaged in. She was not distressed about what had occurred at all. So sexualised had she become that she appeared to have seen nothing wrong in the offender sexually assaulting her in the ways I will shortly describe. This case is a perfect illustration of why children are vulnerable to the sexual predations of those who should be caring for them. She clearly loved her grandfather, a circumstance that the offender took advantage of in a most depraved way.
	
	
	As well as giving evidence of other sexual activity, the complainant spoke about three specific things which occurred at a time that she was staying at her grandparent’s place, with her grandmother being out at a party. These three matters form the basis of the three counts on the indictment.
	
	
	The accused committed an indecent assault upon her by licking her bottom; at the time she being under the age of 16, namely six years of age; the offender had sexual intercourse with her by licking her genitals, at the time she was under the age of ten, and also under the authority of the offender. Finally, the offender had sexual intercourse with her by penetrating her genitals with his penis, again she being under the age of ten, and under the authority of the offender. These are serious offences, those latter two offences carrying maximum penalties of life imprisonment.
	
	
	That the complainant had something of an intimate knowledge of adult sexual activity was undeniable. For example, when she was speaking to police about the accused performing cunnilingus upon her she demonstrated the position that she would be in by lying down on the couch on which she had been sitting, spreading her legs, and pointing to her genital region. Mr Provera, on behalf of the offender, accepted in his submission to the jury that the complainant had a knowledge of adult sexual matters, but suggested that the jury could not be satisfied by reasonable doubt that her knowledge came from the offender sexually assaulting her, as the Crown alleged. By their verdict the jury clearly rejected that submission beyond reasonable doubt, as would have I if it were necessary for me to make that decision.
	
	
	There were two particular features of the interview which suggested strongly that the accused was the person responsible. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, on three occasions while being interviewed the complainant was asked to describe the offender’s penis; on each occasion she said that it was “soft.” As it turns out, the offender suffered from erectile dysfunction at the time; his condition thus matches the complainant’s description of his penis. Secondly, the complainant gave evidence that she had been told by the offender that if the offender’s wife learnt that he and the complainant had engaged in sexual activity, he would go to gaol. Whilst other explanations for a six year old knowing about adult sexual activity can be contemplated, few of them would involve the complainant also learning that revelation of the offender’s behaviour would see him incarcerated. This was a very strong Crown case.
	
	
	It is hard not to feel sorry for the complainant. Since disclosing matters to her mother a great deal has happened to her. She was medically examined, she was interviewed for an hour and 40 minutes, and she gave evidence at an aborted trial held in November 2015. Whilst that trial was going on she was interviewed twice more, and then finally she gave evidence once again in the trial before me.
	
	
	I want to emphasise that the offender is not to be punished for pleading not guilty, but when it comes to considering questions of remorse, for example, the offender has done nothing to mitigate the harm that he caused his granddaughter through sexually assaulting her in the first place.
	
	
	These three offences for which the offender is to be sentenced were not isolated, the complainant giving evidence that things of this nature had occurred earlier as well. She spoke at one stage of things happening “heaps of times.” There was evidence in the trial to suggest that the occasions on which the offender had the opportunity to commit offences of this kind were more limited than that, and I will sentence the offender on the basis that this did not happen “heaps of times,” but it did happen often enough that he is not entitled to any leniency on the basis that these three offences were isolated.
	
	
	It is my job to assess the objective seriousness of these three offences. As I mentioned, the first offence, the indecent assault was occasioned when the offender licked his granddaughter’s bottom, it carries a maximum penalty of ten year’s imprisonment. In her first JIRT interview the complainant marked a diagram showing whereabouts on her body the offender licked her. That diagram shows that he had licked her all over her buttocks, and also in her anal area. Objectively this is a most serious example of an offence of indecent assault.
	
	
	Count 2 involves an act of cunnilingus. There is no rule that suggests the various forms of sexual activity covered by the term “sexual intercourse” are to be ranked in any particular order; in my view this was a serious form of offending even though some other forms of sexual intercourse would, in the circumstances of this case, be regarded as more serious.
	
	
	Count 3 involves a form of sexual intercourse traditionally regarded as particularly serious, penile penetration of the six year old complainant’s genitals. However, this was not penetration by an erect penis. No injuries to the complainant’s hymen were observed on medical examination, and I am satisfied that the penetration which did occur was to a limited extent. Certainly there is no suggestion of the complainant being injured in any way, nor is there any suggestion that the offender ejaculated, or indeed was capable of doing so.
	
	
	As well as the maximum penalties to which I have referred, each offence carries with it a standard non-parole period; eight years for the first count, and 15 years for the second and third counts. I will not impose the standard non‑parole period in any case, my reasons for not doing so appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The breach of trust involved in these offences is obvious. The complainant’s parents had separated; and with her father, the offender’s son, living with his parents for a while after the separation, the complainant would visit her father and stay at her grandparent’s place regularly. Then the complainant’s father got a job in Queensland. Despite that, the complainant would regularly visit the home of her grandparents and often stay the night.
	
	
	On the occasions, the subject of the three counts on the indictment, the complainant’s grandmother went to what was described as a “candle party”, leaving the offender and the complainant home alone. The three offences occurred whilst the two of them were on the bed which the complainant used, watching a DVD. Of course it is an element of counts 2 and 3 that the complainant was under the authority of the offender, so I will not regard the breach of trust, despite its enormity, as an aggravating feature of those offences.
	
	
	Only today the Court of Criminal Appeal handed down a decision, Johnson v R [2016] NSWCCA 286, which considered the question as to in what circumstance it could be an aggravating feature of an offence that it occurred in the home of either the victim or of someone else. That decision confirms that it is an aggravating factor in the present case that these offences occurred in the offender’s home. This was a place where the complainant had her own bedroom and which was effectively, for her, a home away from home.
	
	
	It is not surprising that the consequences for the complainant of this offence appear to have been significant. The Crown does not suggest that the harm caused to the complainant in the present case goes beyond what is to be expected from offences of this kind, and I will not sentence the offender on any other basis. These consequences for the complainant were nevertheless significant and foreseeable. Not everything referred to in the victim impact statement can be attributed to the offender’s crimes but a great deal of it clearly was. In particular one would not at all be surprised to learn that the complainant now is confused about many matters. She was manipulated by the offender to think that what they were doing was acceptable behaviour, but has now learnt that a person she had previously loved had lied to her about that. It is also not surprising that as a result of the offender’s conduct the complainant’s relationship with many family members, particularly males, has been detrimentally affected. The consequences for a victim of offences of this type are almost always serious, and those consequences need to be reflected in the sentence imposed upon the offender.
	
	
	This is not the first time that the offender has committed offences of this type, albeit it has been a considerable period of time between his offending as a child, and then young man, and his offending for which I must sentence him which came about in his early 60s. When he was 19 he committed an offence on a 14 year old girl, his first wife’s niece; and before that as a child he had committed an earlier offence of indecent assault as well.
	
	
	The offender is now 63 years of age. His parents split up when he was eight, and following that he lived with various relatives for 12 months at a time before leaving school at 15. He has had many jobs along the way. He began on the railways. At one stage he was in the armed forces and served on HMAS Sydney on tour to Vietnam in the early 70s, but most of his working career has been on the railways. At the time of his arrest he was in a contract management position. He had to resign after his arrest in order to obtain access to his superannuation to pay the mortgage and to fund his legal representation.
	
	
	He has been married twice, firstly at the age of 18. He was divorced a few years later. He has two children from that marriage, and although they were alienated from him for some time he has now reconciled with one of them. He later met his current wife and has been married almost 40 years to her. They have two children; two boys, one of whom was the father of the victim in this matter.
	
	
	Like many males of his age he suffers from some ailments. His blood pressure is high, but that is controlled by tablets; he has diabetes, his condition is currently not insulin dependent but that may of course change. He has had surgery on one of his shoulders, and although he has full range of movement there is a limit to how much he can lift, and he has begun noticing problems in his other shoulder. As far as his heart is concerned, he had a triple bypass nine years ago, and double stents inserted two years ago. Although that list of medical conditions is not something anyone would wish to suffer from, it has to be said that they are not terribly unusual medical conditions in the case of a 63 year old man. The medications that he requires for those conditions are currently supplied to him in custody.
	
	
	As far as his mental condition is concerned, he suffered from depression and anxiety, but that seems to have arisen as a result of being arrested in this matter. Depression and anxiety at the prospect of going to gaol for a significant period of time is not at all unusual either.
	
	
	The offender described his conditions of custody in evidence today. It has to be said that gaols are terrible places; they are not places which anyone at the age of 63 would find to be terribly pleasant. The offender has been serving time before sentence in various forms of protection. It is a possibility that the offender will continue to serve the remainder of his sentence in custody, and if that is the case there is a possibility that his conditions of custody will be more onerous than that of the general prison population. I have taken both of those risks into account.
	
	
	Some evidence was given today about the consequences of the offender going to gaol upon his family members, in particular his wife. It seems that she has depended on him in many ways concerning what Mr Provera described as “the business of life.” She apparently cannot use a computer and has difficulty dealing with financial matters. However, hardship to the offender’s wife is far from exceptional, it is a regrettably common place consequence of a breadwinner going to gaol. In any case, for many years before the offender’s arrest the offender’s wife and the offender effectively spent the working week apart; the offender living in a home unit in Liverpool while he worked down in Sydney, returning to his home in Newcastle on the weekends.
	
	
	It goes beyond saying but I will say it; that the offender has expressed no remorse. He pleaded not guilty to these offences and even today denies his guilt, despite the overwhelming case against him. As to his prospects of rehabilitation, an application of an actuarial test puts him in the low risk range, but one of the features which put him there is his age. Given that he committed the offences for which I have to sentence him in his 60s, another pre‑sentence report tendered today notes, in what I believe to be an accurate way, that that protective factor may have limited applicability to the offender. In any case, whilst Static-99 says something about the numbers in a population who will offend, it says much less about the risk that an individual in that population will do so. I am unable to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	One of the features that Mr Provera relied upon as regards to the absence of a need for specific deterrence was the unlikelihood that the offender would have access to children in the future. I know that he has a number of children, I know that he has at least one grandchild, the victim of this offence. It certainly cannot be said that the offender will not have an opportunity to commit offending in the future should he wish to do so.
	
	
	There is one matter that I should have referred to earlier when I was speaking about the objective gravity of these offences, and that is the youth of the victim. She was significantly younger than the upper age threshold for each of the three offences.
	
	
	I turn now to what is clearly the most important factor in sentencing for an offence of this type, general deterrence. Perhaps more than any other type of offence, general deterrence has a significant part to play. Offences of this kind are usually committed in secret; a loved family member is often able to persuade the victim of an offence to keep it a secret. Although Mr Provera relies on the circumstance that there was no violence used, in this case it was simply not necessary; the offender was able to sexualise his granddaughter to the extent that it appears she looked forward to her time with her grandfather.
	
	
	Another factor suggesting the need for general deterrence in cases of child sexual assault is precisely what I have just said, the chances of detection are reduced because of the power that the offender holds over the victim of his offending; and finally, there are often lifelong consequences of offending involving a sexual assault on children. General deterrence is, I repeat, of prime importance in sentencing the offender today.
	
	
	The Courts need to impose sentences which may even be considered harsh by some people as the Courts endeavour to protect other six year olds with grandfathers who would use them to satisfy their own sexual desires.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Had I not done so I would have imposed the following sentences, on count 1 a head sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years; on count 2 a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five years; and on count 3 a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of seven and a half years and a head sentence of eleven years to date from 29 October 2016. The non-parole period will thus expire on 28 April 2024, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. As is obvious, I have found special circumstances in this case, they relate to the combined effect of this being the offender’s first time in custody and his age.
	
	
	Is there any other order required, Mr Crown, Mr Provera?

		20 April 2017",2016-12-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4336645,R v AB [2016] NSWDC 417,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The harm that an offence causes the victim of that offence is a very important part in assessing the appropriate sentence to impose. In this case the offender, AB, has caused a great deal of harm to his stepdaughter. She - and I remind people here present there is to be no publication of any information which would identify or tend to identify her name - read a Victim Impact Statement in Court just a few moments ago. She spoke eloquently of the consequences for her of her stepfather’s crimes. Those consequences are significant and they have persisted for many years. The consequences were, entirely foreseeable. The offender must have well known the harm he was likely to cause through his offending.
	
	
	The complainant and her mother began living with the offender when the complainant was relatively young. The complainant’s mother and the offender then had four children before they separated, at least, in the physical sense, with the complainant’s mother and her five children moving first to Perth and then to Melbourne.
	
	
	The offender had hopes of resuming co-habitation and so travelled to Melbourne. One day when the complainant and her mother were together they saw the offender. This caused some clear distress to the complainant, who immediately walked away, later complaining to her mother about what the offender had been doing to her.
	
	
	Relatively shortly thereafter the complainant was interviewed by a police officer in Victoria. In that interview she gave details of three separate incidents and told him that there were others which she could not specifically remember. After a relatively short trial, in which that interview was played to the jury, the accused was found guilty of two counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of ten and one count of sexual intercourse without consent committed upon the complainant when she was under the age of 16.
	
	
	The offences of aggravated indecent assault carry maximum penalties of ten years with standard non-parole periods of eight years. The offence of aggravated sexual assault carries a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of ten years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in any case appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Count 1, the first offence of aggravated indecent assault, was the first time that the offender had behaved inappropriately towards the complainant. They were in the sunroom of the house where they lived. The complainant said that it was a hot day. The accused put his hand down her pants, over her underwear at first, but then inside her underwear, after which he was rubbing and pinching the sides of her genitalia. She was either seven or eight at the time.
	
	
	Count 2 concerned an occasion when the complainant, the offender and some of her half siblings were on a bed watching a movie. The offender put his hands down her pants or her skirt, but not into her underwear on this occasion. He then began to rub her genitalia with his hand on the outside of her underwear. The complainant was either seven, eight or nine at the time this occurred.
	
	
	Count 3 was the last time that anything inappropriate happened. It was not long before the complainant had her first period that she and the offender were watching a movie, perhaps while her mother was outside having a cigarette. She sat on the offender’s lap and he put his hand down her pants, penetrating her genitals with his finger. He stopped when the complainant’s mother came in. The actual description of the actions for this count were a trifle unclear, but upon analysis I am satisfied that what the complainant was describing was the offender penetrating her genitalia, but not penetrating her vagina, for about five minutes. She was either nine or ten at the time of this offence.
	
	
	It goes without saying that these were serious offences committed by a person whom the complainant regarded as a father. She was entitled to expect that she would be looked after by the offender, not abused for his own sexual purposes. It was clearly a significant breach of trust in these offences.
	
	
	The offender is now 40 years of age. These offences were committed some years ago between 2007 and 2009. He is at present a man of otherwise good character. He has some criminal involvement in the past. In 2000 he was convicted of driving whilst his licence was suspended. In 2007, around the time these offences started, he was dealt with in the Local Court for assaulting an officer in the execution of that officer’s duty, and although there were no charges in relation to it, he was a drug user for many years. Indeed, this drug use was probably what precipitated an episode of mental illness. The offender suffered from bipolar disorder for some years, but has not experienced symptoms for some time now. He is a hard worker, an electrician, who is regarded by a friend as a person who was honest and frank, as well as being a caring and loving father. Of course, some parts of that are inconsistent with the jury’s verdict, but I am prepared to accept that these offences were isolated, in the sense that there is no suggestion the offender has acted in any similar way towards any other child.
	
	
	There was some submissions this morning as to whether the three counts on the indictment were themselves isolated. As I mentioned, the complainant at her interview suggested that there may have been other times. It is not necessary really to resolve the question as to whether there were other uncharged occasions, certainly the offender cannot say that his offending as far as this complainant is concerned was isolated. The three counts on the indictment are enough to demonstrate that.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report describes AB’s upbringing as unremarkable. He retains the support of his mother and brother and upon his release from custody he intends to live with his mother. He was not exposed to domestic violence or alcohol or drug abuse as he was growing up and he was not badly behaved as a child. There is no real explanation for these offences, apart from the obvious, namely that the offender wanted to satisfy his sexual urges.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that he has been in custody in circumstances where he has limited association with other prisoners. It is no longer the case that it is automatically assumed that those convicted of offences of this type will do their time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. I am prepared to proceed on the basis that there is a risk that AB will spend his time in custody in some form of protection and there is a risk that if he does so the conditions of custody will be more onerous than those of the general prison population. I have taken those risks into account in deciding the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	It is important to note that the offender has not pleaded guilty to these offences. He is not to be punished for that, of course, but often when comparative sentences are compared the circumstance that a person who has pleaded guilty earlier received a discount is sometimes overlooked. Thus anyone who looks at the sentence that I am ultimately going to impose on AB must remember that no such discount was applied.
	
	
	Further, the offender does not express any remorse, to do so would be inconsistent, of course, with his continued claims of innocence. That absence of remorse causes another issue. Can it be said that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to offend again? In circumstances where this offender does not express regret for his misconduct I am unable to make those findings. It may be that programs available to what are referred to as “deniers” will have some impact, but that is a matter for the future and I cannot make any predictions, let alone confident predictions, as to what will occur. I am certainly not saying that those who plead not guilty and maintain their innocence can never be found to have good prospects of rehabilitation. What I am saying that in this case that has not been demonstrated to me on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	A fundamental aspect of sentencing is that the sentence imposed needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. I have already described what the offender did and the age of the complainant at the time he did it. As far as each of the indecent assaults is concerned the complainant was closer to the top of the range of ages covered by the offence than the bottom. However, looking at the sexual intercourse matter, she was much younger than the 16 years which is the top of the age range for an aggravated offence of the kind for which the offender must be sentenced. The offending does appear to have been opportunistic. Count 1 is a very serious form of indecent assault, involving the offender touching the complainant’s genitals under her underwear. Count 2 is slightly less serious, because the touching was above the complainant’s underwear, but serious nevertheless, because of the offender’s contact with a very private part of the complainant’s body.
	
	
	As far as the objective gravity of the offence of sexual intercourse is concerned, there is no hierarchy of seriousness as regards the various forms of sexual intercourse covered by that term. Each case has to be assessed on its own facts. Here I find, as I said earlier, that penetration of the complainant’s genitals did not extend to her vagina, it was, as things go, a less serious form of digital penetration than many other offences. Many forms of sexual intercourse are also more intimate than the form of sexual intercourse committed by the offender. Assessments such as these are usually made by judges who may be quite wrong about how complainants perceive various forms of sexual intercourse, but I have to do the best I can with the information available to me. All forms of sexual intercourse are serious, but not all are of the same seriousness.
	
	
	I do not want anyone to misunderstand what I am about to say, but in considering where in the hierarchy of seriousness the acts, the subject of count 3, fall I will sentence on the basis that they are a less serious form of sexual intercourse than many other offences of that kind.
	
	
	But I must return to where I started. These were offences involving a breach of trust and a significant breach of trust. There is no question but that a custodial sentence is required. The offender has been in custody since I refused him bail on 14 September 2016 following the jury’s guilty verdicts.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. Although it has never been the law that merely because an offender is going to spend his first time in custody amounts to a special circumstance, that is a factor that can be combined with other circumstances, such as the risk that the offender will spend his time in protective custody with more limited access to programs, counselling and the like than would otherwise be the case. However, the variation from the statutory ratio between head sentence and non‑parole period is relatively small in this case. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, the effective non-parole period I will shortly announce is the least which I consider properly reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. Secondly, the period of eligibility for parole is sufficient to allow the offender to be assisted to resume life outside gaol.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were I not to have done that I would have imposed sentences as follows:
	
	
	For count 1 on the indictment a non-parole period of three years with a head sentence of four years.
	
	
	Four count 2 on the indictment a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of three years.
	
	
	Four count 3A on the indictment a non-parole period of four years with a head sentence of six years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence I instead impose consists of a non-parole period of six years with a head sentence of nine years, to date from 14 September 2016. Thus the non-parole period will expire on 13 September 2022 from which date the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		20 April 2017",2016-12-01 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4336649,R v Tighe [2016] NSWDC 412,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: In 2012 the offender Aaron Tighe was sentenced in the District Court for a number of offences of armed robbery, indeed, a significant number of offences of that kind. He was released to parole in January 2015. Within a short time he was back to using drugs and ended up, as a result, committing ten offences of aggravated break, enter and steal for which I must now sentence him.
	
	
	He began, whilst on parole, using synthetic drugs such as synthetic cannabis and synthetic cocaine. He obtained these from a tobacconists. He was able to pay for those drugs using cigarettes which were the proceeds of the crimes for which I must sentence him. That circumstance explains why it is that the offender focussed on cigarettes when he committed these ten offences.
	
	
	I will not detail the offences in any significant way, they all followed a fairly similar format, except for one. The offender and another person, and perhaps on one occasion a third person but it is not clear, would go to small businesses, newsagencies or convenience stores, force their way inside, often using a crowbar, disguise themselves so that any CCTV cameras which were operating would not capture their identity, and take from those premises cigarettes, sometimes cash, sometimes alcohol and on one occasion two iPads.
	
	
	The value of the property taken varied. Sometimes they did not get very much but at other times they took cigarettes of some value which, as I have mentioned, were apparently handed over to a tobacconist who would hand Mr Tighe synthetic drugs in return. There were ten such offences.
	
	
	One offence, the offence committed on 22 May 2015, was of more seriousness than the others in that the owner of the shop who lived upstairs came downstairs in response to the noise that the offence was creating. When he got there the offender who was holding a crowbar pointed it at him and his co-offender struggled with Mr Zhu who sensibly eventually retreated fearing for his safety.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to these offences and so the sentences I impose upon him will be 25% less than they would otherwise have been. I note that the maximum penalty for each offence is 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years. I have taken into account the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in any case are to be found in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The offender had a childhood which presented many challenges to him. His parents died when he was quite young and his childhood was described, accurately it seems, as “chaotic”. He was introduced to drugs from a young age. His father was a violent drug dealer who died in custody, his mother having died a year before. Once his parents died he was taken in by relatives, some of whom were drug users themselves. He has a criminal history which is consistent with an upbringing of the kind I have described.
	
	
	Not all of us have the same abilities to make decisions in life. Some members of the community are exposed to poor role models from an early age. The decision the offender made upon his release from parole to recommence using drugs and then to fund his drug addiction through these ten offences of aggravated break, enter and steal has to be looked at in the light of his upbringing.
	
	
	It is important to identify some aspects of these offences, especially as regards the question as to whether the standard non-parole period should be imposed. Aggravated break, enter and steals can be committed upon both residential and non‑residential premises. It is undeniable that offences involving residential premises are more serious than offences involving non‑residential premises. The offender’s ten crimes did involve small businesses, and whilst of course they were very distressing to the owners of such businesses and of course serious offending, when comparing these crimes with other offences of aggravated break, enter and steal the very fact that these offences involved non‑residential premises points to a lower level of objective criminality than would otherwise be the case.
	
	
	Consistent with what I have just said, is another circumstance. Nothing of sentimental value appears to have been taken. As I mentioned before, there were cigarettes, alcohol, money and a couple of iPads.
	
	
	Nor does there appear to have been element of gratuitous damage or vandalism. The offenders’ appear to have been interested in getting into the premises, taking property and then leaving as quickly as possible.
	
	
	On the other hand it has to be recognised that the very number of such crimes means that the offender must spend a significant time in custody in order to reflect the totality of his offending.
	
	
	I mentioned already that the offender was on parole at the time of these ten new offences. That is a significant aggravating factor but I have to be careful not to double count by both not giving the offender credit for any presentence custody and at the same time regarding these offences as aggravated by the circumstance I have just referred to.
	
	
	In the course of submissions I suggested that I was considering commencing the sentence which I will impose for these matters from 13 June 2016, which is one year after the offender went into custody and began serving the balance of his parole. Mr Murray who appears for the offender did not speak in opposition to that. The Crown, I think, wanted the sentence to start a bit later but I am satisfied that the principles of sentencing are such that 13 June 2016 is an appropriate date.
	
	
	I should briefly mention the other offender, a woman by the name of Belinda Moffitt. She was referred to the Drug Court and sentenced a short time ago to an aggregate sentence of four years and six months which was suspended. Although I do have to ensure that the offender cannot have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with that imposed upon Ms Moffitt, I do have to say I know nothing about Ms Moffitt, I know nothing about her subjective features, I do not even know whether she was on parole at the time of her offences, and so, the principle of parity can really not be applied in any meaningful way in the present case.
	
	
	Since going into custody the offender has not had drugs detected in his urine or refused any urine analysis, at least no such offence appears on his custodial history.
	
	
	I have no doubt that the offender wishes to leave behind a lifestyle he has led up until today, a lifestyle which is focussed on drug use, offending to obtain drugs and serving the resulting sentences in custody. The offender is on protection at the moment, at least according to the psychological report tendered today. I will take into account the possibility that he will serve further time on protection and the possibility that if he does that will involve harsher conditions of custody than those applying to the general prison population.
	
	
	The offender has plans to live with his sister, a positive influence in his life, outside Sydney upon his release from custody. Despite the favourable matters concerning his rehabilitation it has to be said that his prospects for rehabilitation remain guarded. If he can give up drugs, then things are promising. If he does not, there is probably only one result, he will continue to commit offences and to continue to go to gaol for longer and longer periods until he reaches the stage where he looks back on his life and sees that it has been wasted.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. The offender’s longstanding use of drugs means that he will be assisted upon his release on parole by close supervision from the Probation and Parole Service. Perhaps even a residential rehabilitation will be required, that will of course be up to the parole authorities and not me.
	
	
	Another circumstance suggesting special circumstances is that given the length of the sentences imposed for the armed robbery offences and the comparatively short space of time, four or five months, before the offender reoffended, we are getting towards the stage where the sentences for the armed robbery and the sentences I am about to impose should be regarded as cumulative.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence. Recent amendments to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have not removed the obligation of a sentencing Judge who imposes an aggregate sentence for offences which include offences with a standard non-parole period to specify the non-parole period which he or she would otherwise have imposed.
	
	
	Accordingly, were it not for an aggregate sentence I would have imposed the following sentences:
	
	
	For each offence, apart from the offence of 22 May 2015, I would have imposed a head sentence of three years with a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	For the offence on 22 May 2015 I would have imposed a head sentence of three and a half years with a non-parole period of two years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of three and a half years and a head sentence of five and a half years to date from 13 June 2016.
	
	
	That means that the offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 12 December 2019.

4336653,R v Field; R v Sibbritt; R v Tran; R v Ting; R v Yueng [2016] NSWDC 411,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Joshua Field, Kristy Sibbritt, Gilbert Yeung, Kwun Yip Ting and Cam Tang Tran each appear for sentence in respect of a variety of charges all involving either the manufacture or supply of the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Joshua Field appears in relation to a total of six charges and one additional charge to be taken into account on a Form 1. Those charges are, in chronological sequence: 9 July 2014, being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence, being the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being 19,343 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty provided by s 350 of the Crimes Act for such an offence is five years’ imprisonment. A large commercial quantity at the time was 1 kilogram or more, although the legislature has, as of approximately September 2015, reduced the large commercial quantity qualifying amount to half a kilogram. At the time of this offence a large commercial quantity was 1 kilogram.
	
	
	In addition, the second matter for which he is to be sentenced is supplying a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine, being 385.1 grams. A commercial quantity is 250 or more grams. The maximum penalty provided by legislation is 20 years’ imprisonment. There is a standard non‑parole period of ten years.
	
	
	In addition, there is a further offence commenced by way of an ex officio indictment in respect of an offence on 3 September 2014 of manufacturing a prohibited drug, being more than an indictable quantity and being 24.61 grams of methylamphetamine contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty provided by legislation is 15 years’ imprisonment and/or 2,000 penalty units. There is no relevant standard non‑parole period. An indictable quantity is 5 grams or more.
	
	
	The fourth matter is supply of a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. There were three separate supplies of approximately 80 grams each on each occasion for $18,000. The total quantity involved was 259.97 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty provided by the legislation is 20 years’ imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units. There is no standard non‑parole period provided in respect of such an offence.
	
	
	When being sentenced for that offence, the Court is asked to take into account a further offence on a Form 1, being supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, being 0.61 grams of methylamphetamine. That matter would have been dealt with, if it stood alone, in the Local Court, where the maximum penalty provided is two years.
	
	
	In addition, there is a further offence of supplying a prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The penalty is again a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units, and there is a standard non‑parole period of ten years provided by the legislation.
	
	
	The final offence is a further offence of supply a prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity, that is, 282 grams of methylamphetamine and the maximum penalty is the same as for the last mentioned offence.
	
	
	Kristy Sibbritt appears to be sentenced in relation to five offences and there is a Form 1 to be taken into account in respect of one of those offences. The first offence is being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence, being the manufacture of a prohibited drug, being more than a large commercial quantity. The quantity was 19,343 grams of methylamphetamine. A commercial quantity is one kilogram. The maximum penalty provided by s 350 of the Crimes Act for such an offence is five years’ imprisonment.

	In addition, there is a further offence commenced by way of ex officio indictment of take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, being more than an indictable quantity contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the quantity being 24.61 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty available is 15 years’ imprisonment and/or 2,000 penalty units. The indictable quantity is 5 more grams.
	
	
	The fourth offence is take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Act, being 282 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty is 20 years and/or 3,500 penalty units and there is a standard non‑parole period of ten years. When being sentenced in respect of that offence, the Court is asked to take into account a further offence contained on a Form 1, being take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being more than an indictable quantity contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, being 103.10 grams of methylamphetamine. When dealt with separately, such an offence attracts a maximum penalty of 15 years and/or 2,000 penalty units.
	
	
	The final offence in relation to Sibbritt is take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, being 279.29 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty is 20 years and/or 3,500 penalty units. The legislation provides a standard non‑parole period of ten years. The commercial quantity is 250 grams.
	
	
	Gilbert Wai Yeung appears for sentence in respect of a single offence, being supply of a prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the quantity being 282 grams. The maximum penalty is 20 years and/or 3,500 penalty units and there is a standard non‑parole period provided by the legislation of ten years. In being sentenced in respect of that offence, he asks the Court to take into account a further matter contained on a Form 1, also being supply of a prohibited drug in a commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, being a quantity of 279.29 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Kwun Yip Ting appears for sentence in respect of a single offence, being supply of a prohibited drug, of more than a commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Act, being 282 grams of methylamphetamine. The maximum is 20 years and/or 3,500 penalty units and the legislation provides for a ten year standard non‑parole period.

There was no Form 1 offence in respect of Mr Tran.
	
	
	The Court has been provided in respect of the sentences with nine separate sets of facts in relation to the five offenders. I have endeavoured to combine the facts into a single set of facts, and for that purpose I note that not all of the facts that I will refer to are relevant to all of the offenders. It is necessary to provide some material by way of background, in particular to the accessory after the fact offences in respect of Mr Field and Ms Sibbritt.
	
	
	On 12 March 2014, Thomas Levar became the registered tenant of Unit 170/398 Pitt Street, Sydney, being a 30 level apartment complex. At all relevant times that was Mr Levar’s place of residence. On 15 May 2014, Kristy Sibbritt and Joshua Field signed a lease for Unit 20 at 48 to 68 Wentworth Park, Glebe. At all relevant times this was their place of residence. On 8 July 2014, Levar was arrested and charged with the supply of methylamphetamine. He was released on police bail. His phone was kept by police and when looking through the phone they located drug-related messages.
	
	
	During the evening of 8 July 2014, a male named Jason Pereira came under the attention of staff from 398 Pitt Street for parking his blue Mitsubishi Magna so that it was obstructing traffic. Police were called and he moved his car. At about midnight Pereira entered Unit 60/398 Pitt Street. He did not know the occupants, who were all in bed and were woken by his presence. Security was called and he left without incident. He was identified by security as a person they had dealt with earlier regarding the parking issue. Unit 60 was in the same position as Thomas Levar’s apartment, albeit several floors below. It appears that Pereira had entered Unit 60, thinking it was Levar’s.
	
	
	Police were notified of the incident and began patrolling the area looking for the Mitsubishi Magna. At about 1am the vehicle was located on Oxford Street, Darlinghurst. They activated their warning lights and pulled up behind the vehicle. Levar immediately exited from the passenger side. The officers approached the driver, Pereira, and Levar. Levar was questioned and told police that he had only known Pereira for about five minutes and was just getting a lift down the road. He was unable to produce any identification. At the time of speaking to Levar, police observed a bulge protruding from his jacket pocket. He denied anything was in the pocket. He was then searched and a plastic resealable bag containing 166.1 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 79.5% was located. Three smaller bags were found in other pockets. They contained a total of 9.55 grams of methylamphetamine, bringing the total to 175.68 grams, having a street value of approximately $42,000.
	
	
	He was also found to be in possession of three mobile phones. He was in the circumstances arrested and charged.
	
	
	At 8.18am on 9 July 2014, Levar was granted bail by police. In the hours after his release police began looking at the phones that were seized. One contained approximately 700 text messages. Many related to the supply of prohibited drugs.
	


LARGE COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURE OF METHYLAMPHETAMINE - 19,343 GRAMS


	
	Also located on Levar’s phone were plans for a methylamphetamine lab and instructions for making methylamphetamine. As a result police suspected that Levar was using his unit for the manufacture of drugs. While they were waiting for a search warrant to be authorised they obtained CCTV from the management of 398 Pitt Street and in particular from outside Levar’s unit.
	
	
	A male, John Poniris, was shown entering and leaving the unit on a number of occasions between 7:48pm on 8 July 2014 and 2.48am on 9 July 2014. He had also been in the company of Levar and others at the unit during that time. The footage showed that at 1.53am on 9 July, Kristy Sibbritt and two other males entered Unit 170. Sibbritt and one of the males exited the unit at 2.05am.
	
	
	The recording showed that at 5.34am on 9 July (that is, four hours after Mr Levar’s arrest but prior to his release on bail at 8.18am) the male, John Poniris, exited Unit 170 in possession of numerous boxes and bags. He moved the items downstairs, loading them into a taxi and left. At 8.32am. Levar arrived back at his unit 14 minutes after his release on bail. At 9.59am Levar left his apartment in possession of a large sports bag and did not return.
	
	
	At about 10am, John Poniris returned to Unit 170 and at 10.44am left again. On this occasion he was pushing a trolley stacked high with plastic storage bins and bags, including a distinctive blue and white striped bag. He was also in possession of a 40 litre plastic bucket and a laundry basket. When he reached the lobby, an Asian woman assisted him to move the items outside and load them into a taxi. He directed the driver to a location in Wiley Park where the items were unloaded onto the footpath. A short time later he and his female associate made arrangements to transport themselves and the various items to 48-64 Wentworth Park Road, Pyrmont. Unit 20 at that address was at the time leased by Kristy Sibbritt and Joshua Field. The items that John Poniris had removed from Levar’s apartment were carried into the unit.
	
	
	By about midday police viewing the CCTV were of the belief that John Poniris was in the process of removing the clandestine lab from Levar’s apartment, however they were still waiting on the search warrant to be signed. They therefore conducted covert surveillance on the lobby area of 398 Pitt Street.
	
	
	At 2.39pm Poniris was observed carrying a number of items from a lift into the lobby. As before, he hailed a taxi and loaded the items into it. The Asian female was not with him on this occasion. He then directed the taxi to the Wentworth Park premises. Upon arrival police observed Field assisting Poniris to unload the items and place them on the ground outside the unit block. After observing this for a short time, police approached Field and Poniris and placed them both under arrest.
	
	
	Police then searched the items removed from the taxi. In the bags were numerous pieces of clothing bearing a Fight Gym logo, being a business owned and run by Levar. Also located were a number of items commonly used in clandestine methylamphetamine labs, including:
	



	
	A freeze dryer machine to promote the formation of methylamphetamine crystals.
	
	
	A condenser.
	
	
	Reactionary flasks.
	
	
	Heating equipment.
	



	
	On Poniris, police located a small set of electronic scales, five mobile phones and six small resealable bags containing a total of 8.28 grams of methylamphetamine. It was later discovered that one of the phones had a video recording of a process for refinement of methylamphetamine. Poniris and Field were conveyed to Sydney City Police Station.
	
	
	While police were outside the Wentworth Park premises, Kristy Sibbritt exited the unit complex. A senior constable stopped her briefly to ascertain her identity. She gave her name and the Unit 20 number. Unit 20 is on the second floor of the complex. She then entered a taxi and departed. At that time, police had not connected her or Unit 20 to the actions of Poniris and Field.
	
	
	A few minutes later, police entered the complex and spoke with the building manager, who resided in the unit directly opposite number 20. She reported suspicious activity at Unit 20, including a large number of people coming and going. She also said that in the moments prior to speaking with police she had heard someone running to the fire escape, and what sounded like objects being dropped. Police inspected the fire escape and immediately noticed a strong chemical smell. They also observed a number of items stacked together at the top of the stairs. A guard was put on the stairwell while one officer went downstairs to call the chemical operations officers.
	
	
	A few minutes later an officer entered the lift at ground level and immediately saw Kristy Sibbritt had returned to the location and engaged her in conversation. She admitted that she had seen Field being arrested and that they were in a relationship. When they reached level 2, the sound of a toilet flushing could be heard coming from Unit 20. Concerned that evidence was being destroyed, police gained entry. It was immediately apparent that the unit contained drugs and equipment used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Sibbritt and a female were located inside the unit.
	


SUPPLY 385.1 GRAMS OF METHYLAMPHETAMINE (SIBBRITT AND FIELD)


	
	Police conducted a comprehensive search of the unit. The Asian female who had helped Poniris to move items in and out of taxis during the morning was present. She was released without charge. On top of the fridge, police located a bag of white crystals, being 385.1 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 79%. Police also located 1.31 grams of methylamphetamine located in several small resealable bags on a table in the lounge.
	
	
	There was also equipment consistent with the supply of drugs including two sets of electronic scales and small resealable plastic bags.
	


MANUFACTURE EQUIPMENT LOCATED AT 20/48-68 WENTWORTH STREET


	
	Police also located a large amount of equipment and liquids that are used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Some of the items included:
	



	
	Three 4 litre containers of Diggers demineralised water.
	
	
	One 20 litre bucket three-quarters full of brown liquid.
	
	
	3.5 litres of formic acid.
	
	
	Two 500 gram packs of caustic soda.
	
	
	One 5 litre bottle of hydrochloric acid.
	
	
	A pressure cooker containing clear liquid.
	
	
	A ceramic hotplate with white residue.
	
	
	A fan.
	
	
	Funnels.
	
	
	Glass equipment and tubing.
	
	
	125 mls bottle of isopropyl alcohol.
	
	
	125 mls bottle of isopropyl alcohol.
	



	
	Chemical operations police attended the location and searched the stairwell. There they located numerous pieces of equipment and liquids involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine including the laundry basket (containing a 20 litre round bottom reaction flask) and the blue stripy bag that Poniris was seen with earlier in the day. Other significant items include:
	



	
	a temperature/pH meter,
	
	
	4 glass condensers;
	
	
	a 10 litre separating funnel;
	
	
	various flasks;
	
	
	funnels;
	
	
	stands;
	
	
	clamps;
	
	
	filters and strainers;
	
	
	320 litre plastic pails with various amounts of coloured liquids;
	
	
	an 11 litre pail;
	
	
	a pressure cooker;
	
	
	4 litres of Diggers Turpentine; and various liquids, many of which contained methylamphetamine of varying purity.
	



	
	Many, if not all of the items, had been removed from the Levar’s unit by Poniris earlier that day. Fingerprints belonging to both Field and Poniris were located on various items located at the address. Police removed the s-bend to the kitchen sink; testing showed that this had liquid methylamphetamine in it, consistent with efforts to destroy evidence.
	


THE SEARCH OF 170/398 PITT STREET


	
	Shortly after the search of Sibbritt and Field’s unit began, detectives also executed a search warrant on Levar’s unit. Upon entry, a strong chemical smell was detected; bottles of chemicals and drug manufacture equipment were located all throughout the apartment, as was equipment consistent with drug use. In the main bedroom, a ventilation system was located, and throughout the apartment smoke detectors had been covered with plastic bags to prevent activation.
	
	
	Amongst numerous items the following were located:
	



	
	two heating mantles;
	
	
	two electric frypans with white meth residue;
	
	
	two gas ring burners;
	
	
	one 250 ml Pyrex jug containing brown crystal substance;
	
	
	two 4 litre Diggers Acetone; one litre Pyrex jug;

	approximately 100 filter papers;
	
	
	two 500 grams of caustic soda;
	
	
	1 litre of methylated spirits;
	
	
	5 litres of hydrochloric acid; and
	
	
	various liquids, many of which contained methylamphetamine of varying purity.
	



	
	Fingerprints belonging to both Field and Poniris were located on various items located at that address.
	


EXPERT OPINION ON MANUFACTURE


	
	A chemist involved in the analysis of the items located at the two premises opined that the totality of the equipment and the various chemicals located were proof that methylamphetamine was being manufactured.
	


Evidence of primary stages:


	
	There are two ways of manufacturing methylamphetamine that relate to the chemicals present in this case. The equation is basically ephedrine and/or pseudoephedrine + iodine + plus hydro-phosphorous or red phosphorous = methylamphetamine.
	
	
	At 170 Pitt Street, two items containing ephedrine were located; they were each in quantities of approximately 10 grams. At Wentworth Park a large pail was located at the stairwell which contained 3,032 grams of liquid that contained both methylamphetamine and ephedrine. None of these compounds contained hydro-phosphorous acid or iodine, suggesting that these compounds related to the early stage of manufacture.
	


Evidence that extraction had taken place:


	
	Once methylamphetamine has been produced it initially exists in a liquid compound and needs to be extracted; this is commonly done by adding caustic soda which causes the methylamphetamine to separate from the mixture as an oil which can then be extracted using a solvent such as Xylene. Xylene was located at 170 Pitt Street and caustic soda was located at both Pitt Street and Wentworth Park.
	
	
	Chemists established that of the items located at Wentworth Park, both in the unit and the stairwell, there was a total of 47,970 grams of waste material. This material contained methylamphetamine in an unknown concentration. Waste material is what is left over after methylamphetamine has been extracted; it may either be intended for waste or further extraction procedures to obtain the small amounts of remaining methylamphetamine. A significant proportion of the waste material had been transported from Unit 170 to Wentworth Park by Poniris.
	


Liquid containing methylamphetamine pre-refinement:


	
	In other containers, chemists located liquid containing higher amounts of methylamphetamine; this liquid was located in 17 different containers. It weighed a total of 17,849 grams. Of the couple of items that were tested, the purity ranged from 1% to 7%. It is not known at what stage of manufacture the liquid was at, however the processes could be used to extract the methylamphetamine from that liquid. The vast majority of this was located in the stairwell at Wentworth Street but had been transported from Levar’s apartment by Poniris in the blue and white striped bag.
	


Evidence of extraction taking place:


	
	Once methylamphetamine has been extracted, in order to be marketable it is ordinarily made into a solid which can be done by the application of heat evaporating all but the methylamphetamine solids. In an alternative process heat can be used to refine methylamphetamine through a crystallisation method. Both locations had multiple items that were used in one or both of these processes, almost all of them had methylamphetamine residue on them. At Levar’s apartment two electric frypans were located; at Field and Sibbritt’s unit the following were located: a pressure cooker; a ceramic hotplate; an electric wok; hairdryer; and fan.
	
	
	In addition to the heating equipment, which is suggestive of a refinement process, chemists located two items which actually contained crystals. One of these was located at Pitt Street and weighed 369 grams. It contained methylamphetamine, but the purity was not tested. The other item was located at Wentworth Park; it weighed 3,169 grams, and consisted of 32% methylamphetamine. This was therefore a total of 4,438 grams of methylamphetamine-containing substance in the process of refinement. If refined to 100% purity, this would result in no less than 1,012 grams of methylamphetamine and almost certainly more, as the 369 grams is not included in this calculation, given that its purity was not tested.
	


Solid marketable product:


	
	Methylamphetamine in crystal form was located at Pitt Street in the amount of 113.5 grams; this was located in varying amounts in equipment used to extract/refine methylamphetamine.
	


Calculation:


	
	Through this manufacture operation, the participants had already refined and extracted,
	



	
	113.5 grams of marketable methylamphetamine. They were in the final stages of refining
	
	
	3,169 grams of methylamphetamine, which could theoretically realise 1,012 grams of pure methylamphetamine
	
	
	369 grams of methylamphetamine. The purity was not tested, so it is unknown how much pure methylamphetamine could have been realised.
	



	
	There was a total of 17,849 grams of liquid from which the methylamphetamine could be extracted.
	
	
	The total manufacture is estimated to be equal to 113.5 grams + 3,169 grams + 369 grams + 17,849 grams = 19,343 grams of methylamphetamine. There was also a total of 47,970 grams of waste liquid which contained methylamphetamine, from which it would be possible to extract a small additional amount of methylamphetamine from the liquid. That amount was not used in the above calculation.
	
	
	Those facts of course concern the offenders Field and Sibbritt and not Mr Yeung, Mr Ting, or Mr Tran. The offenders Field and Sibbritt are not charged with the manufacture of the prohibited drug, but with being accessories after the fact of such manufacture as evident from the removal of various items of equipment and solutions and chemicals to their premises in Wentworth Park, Glebe. Either they were aware that Mr Levar had been arrested, or they were sufficiently aware of the operation and trusted by others to take part in a prearranged removal of equipment from the Pitt Street premises to the Wentworth Park premises. There is no evidence that they were aware that Mr Levar had been arrested, but their conduct as accessories after the fact, as outlined in the Facts, demonstrates that they must have known and been trusted in relation to the dismantling of the lab and its removal to premises where it might be anticipated it was intended to continue the manufacturing process. Their role in doing so makes their offending in respect of the offence of being an accessory after the fact an offence in the mid‑range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The following facts again relate only to Joshua Field and Kristy Sibbritt, being the counts I previously referred to as “ex-officio counts” in respect to the manufacture of a prohibited drug being more than an indictable quantity, being 24.61 grams of methylamphetamine. The charge in respect to Mr Field was one of manufacturing a prohibited drug, and in relation to Ms Sibbritt was of knowingly take part in the manufacture, both offences being contrary to s 24(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts are as follows, on 2 September 2014, management of the Adina Apartments, located at 183 Coogee Bay Road, Coogee, identified a number of abnormal routines and behaviour relating to Apartment 55. Management made a number of observations relating to the apartment, namely a strong chemical smell emanating from within the apartment, and due to safety concerns within the apartment identified a number of sheets hung over the windows and plastic taped over the fire alarms. A review of the building’s closed-circuit television footage identified a large number of comings and goings from within the unit at late hours of the evening. On that day, building management contacted police to attend and investigate.
	
	
	Police attended on 2 September 2014 and made a number of inquiries into the activities within the unit. It was established that on 28 August 2014 Kristy Sibbritt had checked into the unit using her driver’s licence. A review of the CCTV at the apartments was conducted and police identified her and Joshua Field as the occupants of Apartment 55. The CCTV review revealed Field paying cash for the room at 11.15 on 28 August 2014.
	
	
	Between the hours of 12.50 and 5.55 on 2 September 2014, Field, Sibbritt, and a male known to police as Cuong Pham, and three other males repeatedly entered and exited the Adina Hotel. All persons were seen to carry varying sized bags in and out of the hotel.
	
	
	At about 1.15pm on 2 September 2014, Sibbritt and Field were recorded on CCTV leaving the apartments carrying various bags, and entering a taxi. Room 55 was not occupied again until Field and Sibbritt’s subsequent arrest on 3 September 2014.
	
	
	At 9pm police executed a search warrant on Unit 55 and during the conduct of that search warrant a number of items consistent with the manufacture of prohibited drugs were identified and seized. The chemical operations unit provided specialist advice and assistance to process the crime scene, numerous pieces of equipment and liquids involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine were identified and seized.
	


MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT LOCATED AT 55/183 COOGEE BAY ROAD, COOGEE


	
	Police located a large amount of equipment and liquids used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The items included:
	



	
	portable fuel filters;
	
	
	vacuum sealed bags;
	
	
	funnels with white staining;
	
	
	a plastic container with brown staining and “Poison” written on the sides;
	
	
	two pH probes;
	
	
	a pH test machine with a pH controller box;

	a bottle of approximately 200 mls LTC pH and calibration;
	
	
	plastic tubing;
	
	
	an electric air pump;
	
	
	Aquapro Waterfeature Pump;
	
	
	a metal stand with recessed area;
	
	
	a 20 litre plastic Maxi Pail buckets;
	
	
	grey buckets containing a small amount of brown liquid hydrochloric acid;
	
	
	1,000 ml conical flask;
	
	
	a vacuum condenser head;
	
	
	circular glass head apparatus with measuring intervals to 300 mls;
	
	
	circular glass bowl with a large amount of white residue stuck to the basin sides;

	an electronic pump;
	
	
	a tablecloth covering windows;
	
	
	a 2 kg bottle of caustic soda, half full;
	
	
	a 3 litre plastic bottle labelled “Mildura” containing 2,486 grams of liquid methylamphetamine with a purity of 0.3%;
	
	
	a 1 litre plastic bottle labelled Diggers Acetone containing 1,043 grams of liquid methylamphetamine with a purity of 0.4%;
	
	
	a 1 litre plastic bottle labelled KCB Methylated Spirits containing 1,041 grams of liquid methylamphetamine with a purity of 0.4%;
	
	
	a 750 ml glass bottle labelled Bickford’s Lemon, Lime & Bitters containing 742 grams of liquid methylamphetamine with a purity of 0.4%; and
	
	
	a 600 ml plastic water bottle labelled Cool Ridge Spring Water containing 429 grams of liquid methylamphetamine with a purity of 0.7%.
	


ARREST AND CHARGE OF FIELD AND SIBBRITT


	
	At around 12am on 3 September 2014, Field returned to the premises and was stopped by police as he approached the door to Unit 55. He was arrested for his suspected involvement in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. At 12.05am Sibbritt was approached by the police in the foyer of the building and placed under arrest for her suspected involvement in the manufacture of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Forensic analysis was conducted in the unit. Fingerprints matching those of Joshua Field were located within the unit on a glass bowl containing white methylamphetamine residue; DNA matching that of Kristy Sibbritt was also located on a drinking straw within the unit. After further advice from specialist police processing the apartment, police discontinued Sibbritt’s arrest, and she was released from police custody pending further investigation. Field was not charged with the manufacture of prohibited drugs and was advised by police that they would be conducting further investigations. The manufacture charge was subsequently proceeded with by way of an ex-officio count of which each of the offenders was informed on 10 March 2016, and each entered a plea of guilty six days later.
	


EXPERT OPINION ON THE MANUFACTURE


	
	A New South Wales Police Force chemist determined that methylamphetamine manufacture had taken place.
	


Evidence that extraction had taken place:


	
	Once methylamphetamine has been produced, it initially exists in a liquid compound and needs to be extracted; this is commonly done by adding caustic soda which causes the methylamphetamine to separate from the mixtures and oil. Caustic soda was located at Unit 55. Items located within the unit contained a total 5,741 grams of waste material. This material contained methylamphetamine in varying purity. Waste material is what is left over after methylamphetamine has been extracted, it may either be intended for waste or further extraction procedures to obtain the small amounts of remaining methylamphetamine.
	


Evidence of extraction taking place:


	
	Once methylamphetamine has been extracted, in order to make it marketable it is ordinarily made into a solid. This can be done by the application of heat which evaporates all but the methylamphetamine solids. In an alternative process heat can be used to refine methylamphetamine through a crystallisation process.
	
	
	Unit 55 had multiple items that were used in one or both of these processes; almost all of them had methylamphetamine residue on them. During the process involved in the manufacture of prohibited drugs, hazardous vapours or fumes are produced. These vapours can condense on surfaces such as walls and ceilings, leaving residues. Methamphetamine can be found on surfaces within a premises from coming in contact with methylamphetamine, being in proximity of the manufacture of methylamphetamine, and being in proximity to the smoking of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	During analysis of the unit, a swab of the cooktop area of the unit contained methylamphetamine, amphetamine, and N-isopropylbenzylamine. A swab of the range hood contained methylamphetamine and N‑isopropylbenzylamine; a swab of the intake area of the air conditioner contained methylamphetamine and N-isopropylbenzylamine.
	


Solid Marketable Product:


	
	Methylamphetamine in crystal form was located in the unit in an amount of 2.91 grams; this was located in a glass bowl used to extract/refine methylamphetamine.
	


Calculation:


	
	There was a total of 5,741 grams of waste liquid which contained methylamphetamine; it would be possible to extract a small additional amount of methylamphetamine from this liquid. The chemist involved in the analysis of items located at the premises opined that 21.7 grams of methylamphetamine was manufactured within the unit, that amount did not include the 2.19 grams of solid product located. A combination of those two figures gives the total of 24.16 grams, the subject of the charge.
	
	
	The conduct of the offenders involved the manufacture of methylamphetamine in a commercial apartment complex. It involved the release of volatile and toxic fumes contaminating the apartment, and in circumstances where the fire alarms or fire alarm had been covered to prevent it from alerting a fire if one had occurred.
	
	
	The quantity produced, at 24.61 grams of methylamphetamine as estimated, is not a particularly large quantity but it is the offenders’ participation together in the process of manufacturing methylamphetamine in those circumstances which makes this offence a matter in the midrange of objective seriousness despite the small quantity involved. It was fortuitous that the operation was discovered so soon after it had commenced.
	
	
	Finally, I turn to the Agreed Facts relating to each of the five offenders. In February 2015, investigations commenced into the supply of prohibited drugs, namely methylamphetamine. During the course of the investigations Joshua Field, Kristy Sibbritt, Gilbert Wai Kit Yeung and Cam Tang Tran were identified as prohibited drug suppliers of methylamphetamine. Field was in a de facto relationship with Sibbritt and they were known to reside together at 409/37 Amalfi Drive, Wentworth Park Point, New South Wales.
	
	
	Field’s role in relation to the identified drug related offences is that of prohibited drug distributor. Yeung acted in part as a prohibited drug distributor to Field, able to supply him with commercial quantities of prohibited drug. Sibbritt acted to assist Field in the distribution of prohibited drug as identified during this investigation. Tran is the lowest placed associate, able to supply indictable quantities of prohibited drug to Field when he required it.
	
	
	On 17 March 2015, investigators were granted a warrant authorising the use of surveillance devices in respect of the conversations, activities and geographical locations of Field, Sibbritt and Yeung.
	
	
	Throughout the conduct of the investigation between 5 May 2015 and 1 July 2015 numerous surveillance operations were undertaken targeting Field, Sibbritt and Yeung. The operations were supplemented by the interception of the telecommunications services of Field and Sibbritt.

	On Tuesday 5 May 2015 at 1.36pm, Field entered the front passenger seat of a vehicle in Mill Park Street, Rhodes, where he supplied a female undercover operative with 81.98 grams of methylamphetamine for the sum of $18,000. The vehicle then travelled to the underground car park of 2 Timbrol Avenue, Rhodes.
	
	
	On Tuesday 12 May 2015 at 1.40pm, Field entered the front passenger seat of a vehicle at Mill Park Street, Rhodes, whereby he supplied a female undercover operative with 84 grams of methylamphetamine for a sum of $18,000. The vehicle travelled via Shoreline Drive where it became stationary on the eastern kerb near the intersection of Timbrol Avenue, Rhodes. Field exited the vehicle and walked via the driveway to the underground car park of 2 Timbrol Avenue, Rhodes.
	
	
	On Tuesday 19 May 2015 at 1.50pm, Field was monitored entering the front passenger seat of a vehicle on Shoreline Drive, Rhodes, near the intersection of Timbrol Avenue, where he supplied a female undercover operative with 93.99 grams of methylamphetamine for a sum of $18,000.
	
	
	Those three individual supplies of approximately 80 to 93.99 grams constitute the offence of ongoing supply, relevant only to Mr Field.

	On Tuesday 2 June 2015, Tran was the subject of electronic and physical monitoring. At 10.27am Field called Tran and arranged for Tran to meet with the female undercover operative who had arranged to purchase an amount of prohibited drug that day. Tran asked, “Have they got any paper (money)?”
	
	
	At 2.26pm Tran called Sibbritt and asked for the phone number of the female drug buyer.
	
	
	At 2.30pm Tran called the female buyer and introduced himself as Simon.
	
	
	At 2.36pm Sibbritt called the female buyer and introduced herself. During this conversation Sibbritt told the buyer that Field had sent his friend “Simon” (Tran) to meet her because “things were a little bit off” with Field. Sibbritt told the buyer that Simon was “all good 100%”.
	
	
	At 2.40pm Sibbritt called Tran. During this conversation Sibbritt told Tran that “it’s all good” and directed Tran to call the female again.
	
	
	At 2.45pm Tran entered the front passenger seat of a vehicle on Shoreline Drive, Rhodes, where he met with the undercover female operative and discussed the supply of prohibited drugs. The vehicle travelled via Shoreline Drive to Rhodes Shopping Centre where Tran exited the vehicle and entered the shopping centre.
	
	
	At 3.06pm Sibbritt called Tran. During this conversation Tran informed Sibbritt that he was nervous. Sibbritt asked Tran if it was “done”. Sibbritt told Tran to call her once it is “done”.
	
	
	At 3.10pm Tran returned to the vehicle where he supplied the female with 103.10 grams of methylamphetamine for a cost of $18,000.
	
	
	At 3.15pm Tran exited the vehicle. At 3.19pm Tran called Sibbritt. During this conversation, Sibbritt asked Tran if it was “all good”. Tran asked where Sibbritt was. Sibbritt asked Tran if he could see her at her place.

	At 9.32pm on 22 June 2015, Field called Yeung. During this conversation Yeung asked Field, “Is tomorrow still going ahead?”, referring to “the lady”. Field told Yeung that he needs to talk to him about it.
	
	
	On Tuesday 23 June 2015 at 11.50am, Yeung called Sibbritt. During this conversation Yeung told Sibbritt that his friend said, “He can do, he is a little busy” but Yeung had told him the time frame and he had said that he will work within that. Yeung told Sibbritt that the “numbers are a little high and going to be 4,500 an ounce each”. Yeung asked Sibbritt to have Field call him back.
	
	
	At 12.25pm Yeung called Field. During this conversation Field asked Yeung how long he would be. Field asked Yeung to get two more, and told Yeung, “Even if you can get the five man all up and then I’ll do it”. Field told Yeung, “I’ve got to be there at 1.50pm”.
	
	
	At 2.25pm a blue coloured Hyundai hatchback being driven by an Adam Amato with Kwun Ting, Field, Sibbritt and Yeung as passengers was observed travelling on Mill Park Street, Rhodes.
	
	
	At 2.27pm Field entered the front passenger seat of a vehicle at Mill Park Street whereby he met with the female undercover operative buyer. On the instruction of Field, the buyer sent Sibbritt a text message that read, “Tell K to come over”.
	
	
	At 2.30pm Sibbritt called Yeung. During this conversation Sibbritt told Yeung to “go over”. Yeung told Sibbritt that he is going to “send his mate”.
	
	
	At 2.31pm Ting entered the rear passenger seat of the vehicle where he supplied the female with 279.29 grams of methylamphetamine for a cost of $50,000. The $50,000 provided by the female as the cost of the drug transaction was then handed by Field to Ting. Both Ting and Field then exited the vehicle.

	On Monday 30 June 2015, Yeung contacted Field and the following conversation was recorded.
	


“FIELD: Hello.

YEUNG: Hello.

FIELD: Hey buddy, how are you?

YEUNG: Good, whereabouts are you?

FIELD: I’m at the hotel at Marrickville near Watsons.

YEUNG: Oh okay have you got wheels?

FIELD: No, no I haven’t.

YEUNG: Well how do you want me to - how do you want to meet?

FIELD: You haven’t got no wheels?

YEUNG: No I haven’t got no wheels, I got my dad to drive me.

FIELD: Oh okay, even if you want to jump in a cab or whatever and I’ll fix you up or something for you.

YEUNG: Yeah all right, I’m going to head home first but yeah I will…whatever, whatever you wanted I got.

FIELD: Yeah, cool cool.

YEUNG: All right.

FIELD: All right, thank you.

YEUNG: I told him, I told him, I said um well he just have - have to give me another six tomorrow.

FIELD: All right, cool cool.

YEUNG: The rest tomorrow morning and then um he was still sussing out, he was still sussing out are they trustworthy. I was like fuck man are you serious.

FIELD: Yeah.

YEUNG: Yeah but it’s all good.

FIELD: All right, all right, cool.

YEUNG: If you can, if you can then maybe you try and come past.

FIELD: Yeah all right no worries.

YEUNG: Yeah all right, I’ll try and get some wheels if I can, I’ll make a phone call, I’ll see if Gavin’s available or not.

FIELD: Yup.

YEUNG: If not then I’ll leave it but yeah we’ll see what happens.

FIELD: Okay, all right mate.

YEUNG: Thanks, bye.

FIELD: Bye.

YEUNG: If you need it before that, if you’re urgent then come past and grab it.

FIELD: Yeah all right, cool.

YEUNG: All right.

FIELD: All right, bye.

YEUNG: Bye bye.”


	
	On Wednesday 1 July 2015, Field and Yeung were the subject of electronic and physical monitoring. At around 10am Field and Sibbritt were observed as they attended 8 Terry Street, Blakehurst, after exiting a taxi. Yeung resided at 8 Terry Street, Blakehurst.
	
	
	At around 11.35am Sibbritt was observed exiting 8 Terry Street and then went by taxi to the Hurstville Aquatic Centre where she met a female drug buyer in a vehicle. Sibbritt and the female drug buyer continued in conversation up to around 12.31pm.
	
	
	During this time, Sibbritt made a number of calls to Field discussing aspects of the proposed drug supply and requesting a timeframe for how long Field would be before attending her location to complete the drug supply to the female.
	
	
	Around 12.31pm Sibbritt exited the vehicle, and around 12.43pm Field, Yeung, Ting and Amato as the driver were monitored as they left the address of 8 Terry Street and travelled to the Hurstville Aquatic Centre.
	
	
	At that location, Field and Ting exited the vehicle and met with the female drug buyer. At that time Ting supplied the female with 282 grams of methylamphetamine. A short time later, Field, Yeung, Ting, Sibbritt and Amato were arrested and detained. All persons were conveyed to the Kogarah police station. Amato was later released from custody, with the remaining persons charged with a number of criminal offences as identified during the investigation.
	
	
	A short time later Tran was arrested at Unit 8, 84 Harris Street, Fairfield, during the execution of a search warrant on those premises. At that time he was detained for his part in the offence as committed on 2 June 2015 and conveyed to the Fairfield police station. He was subsequently charged with the relevant criminal offence.
	
	
	The facts in relation to this sequence of offending demonstrate a close relationship between each of the offenders in relation to the supply of methylamphetamine on a number of occasions, although their roles vary, and in particular, in relation to Mr Tran, he is only involved in one instance of supply, being 103.1 grams of methylamphetamine. It is, however, clear that Sibbritt was an intimate of Field and Yeung, trusted to participate in communications and arrangements in relation to the supply of methylamphetamine on a number of occasions.
	
	
	It would appear from the facts that Field was the most senior person, if that is a correct way to describe him, who called on others from time to time to actually supply the prohibited drug to be sold to persons that he had arranged to supply to.
	
	
	In respect of each of Field and Sibbritt, it is of serious concern that having been arrested in respect of the accessory to the manufacture and the first offence I referred to in respect of each, of supply prohibited drug, each continued thereafter to participate in criminal offending relating to methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Field, at the time of the first offending before this Court was subject to a s 12 bond imposed on 1 April 2014 in respect of an offence of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm. He was given a ten month sentence suspended pursuant to s 12. Having been arrested in respect of the first sequence of offending, at the time that the manufacturing process at the Adina apartments was discovered, he was not only still subject to the s 12 bond, he was also on bail in respect of the first set of offending, and at the time of the final sequence of offences involving Field, Sibbritt, Yeung, Ting and Tran, he was no longer subject to the s 12 bond but he was subject to bail in respect of the original offending, and must have been cognisant of the likelihood of being charged in respect of the manufacture at the Adina apartments.
	
	
	On 7 May 2015, he was committed for trial in respect of the offences that occurred on 9 July 2014. Of note is that the three offences of ongoing supply occurred on the 5th, 12th and 19 May 2015, that is, in close proximity to the time at which his trial on the earlier charges was before the Court for committal proceedings.
	
	
	A s 12 bond had been imposed in respect of his being found in possession of what is referred to as a “keychain gun” which I will refer to later. That offence was the only offence on his record prior to the offending represented by these charges.
	
	
	Kristy Sibbritt had no criminal convictions prior to the commencement of her offending in relation to these matters, but in respect of the take part in the manufacture at the Adina apartments, she was then on bail as a result of being arrested for the offences in respect of 9 July 2014. The manufacturing offence was only approximately two months later, and at the time of the third sequence of offending involving Field, Sibbritt, Yeung, Ting and Tran, she was still on bail in respect of the offences from 9 July 2014, and had been committed for trial in respect of those offences on 7 May 2015.
	
	
	In respect of Mr Yeung, I will subsequently refer to his criminal history but I note at the moment that at the time of his offending, he was on conditional liberty, being subject to a s 9 bond for possessing a prohibited drug. The bond was for two years from 5 June 2015, that is, shortly before the commission of the offence and the offence on the Form 1. He was also on bail in respect of two offences of driving while disqualified, for which he had been charged on 22 February 2015 and 27 May 2015.
	
	
	As to Mr Ting, at the time of his offending - I will refer to his criminal record later, but he was the subject of a s 9 bond of nine months, imposed on 19 March 2015 for driving while disqualified, and he was also the subject of a s 9 bond of 18 months, imposed on 5 May 2015 in respect of an offence of possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Each of the offenders, Field, Sibbritt, Yeung and Ting, was, accordingly, at the time of the commission of the offences on conditional liberty, which is an aggravating circumstance. I will deal with the respective subjective matters.
	
	
	Joshua Field was born on 17 February 1984. He was at the time of the various offences aged either 30 or 31, and he is now 32 years of age. He is the eldest of two children, his parents having separated amicably when he was nine years of age. He lived with his mother until Year 8 and then with his father after being suspended from school. He had a supportive family who have remained supportive.
	
	
	He obtained the School Certificate and then moved out of home and commenced an apprenticeship at approximately 16 years of age, being more interested in sports than academia. For approximately one year he was employed by Telstra as a pipe and pit layer, and over a period of approximately a year and a half he completed an apprenticeship in formwork and carpentry at the Tuggerah TAFE. He started a concreting business with a friend but sold the business when the friend died in 2009. He worked for approximately one year on a casual basis before moving from the Central Coast to Sydney. The work on a casual basis would appear to have been with a business called Remote Drilling Australia as a site supervisor - see Exhibits JF2 and JF1.
	
	
	At about the time that he moved to Sydney, a relationship of approximately ten years duration ended. On moving to Sydney, he became associated with drug users and quickly became addicted to methylamphetamine or “ice” and became isolated from his earlier life, friends and family. He formed a relationship with Kristy Sibbritt, which continued throughout the period of offending.
	
	
	He did not give evidence on sentence, and the subjective matters are taken from the material that was tendered on his behalf: Exhibit JF1 being a psychological report of Helen Kearney, dated 4 July 2016, and JF2 being a reference from Clint Bass, the director of the business Remote Drilling Australia, as well as the material provided by the Crown as to the criminal history and a Pre-Sentence Report under the hand of Stephen Mahoney, the unit leader of the Cessnock Parole Unit, dated 29 June 2016.
	
	
	The offender informed Helen Kearney, psychologist, that:
	


“He lived in the moment and his only concern was his next fix. This need for a consistent supply of ice was his motivation for becoming involved in criminal activities as he had to have a regular supply to prevent withdrawal and maintain his addiction.”


	
	He is said to have overcome his addiction while in custody and has undertaken relevant courses in custody. There have been no disciplinary infringements while in custody. He has been assessed as a medium risk of re-offending by Mr Mahoney. He has only two prior entries in his criminal history, one being an offence of public nuisance committed in Queensland in 2008, but in respect of which a conviction was not recorded, and he was fined $450.
	
	
	I have already referred to the charge of possess unauthorised prohibited firearm, being the “key chain gun”. That matter also came before me and I have previously dealt with the s 12 by revoking the s 12 and imposing the sentence that had been determined by the learned magistrate of ten months, and imposing a five month non-parole period commencing on 15 May 2015. The sentence in respect of the revoked s 12 of ten months commenced on 1 July 2015 and the five month’s non-parole period expired on 30 October 2015. The total sentence expired on 30 April 2016. Since 1 December 2015 he has been in custody solely in respect of these matters.
	
	
	As I have previously said, of serious concern and an aggravating factor, is the fact that he was on conditional liberty in relation to the s 12 as well as also being on bail after the detection of the first offences during the period when the subsequent offences were committed.
	
	
	As to remorse, he is said to have gained some insight into his offending and he is determined not to use and wishes to in due course return to the Central Coast where he is apparently still held in high regard by the proprietor of Remote Drilling Australia, who has indicated he is prepared to employ him in the future.
	
	
	His addiction to methylamphetamine is not an excuse for the offending behaviour, but it is at least some explanation for why a person who had had no relevant trouble with the authorities for so long fell foul of the law. It cannot be said, in light of the continued offending or repeated offending over the period from July of 2014 to July 2015, and the re-offending occurring in the circumstances of conditional liberty, that there is a low prospect of re-offending, except in circumstances where the offender first addresses his drug-related problems and not only determines to cease using prohibited drugs in the future but in fact manages to do so. Considering his prior good character, should he be able to achieve cessation of the use of prohibited drugs, in my view he would have a low prospect of re-offending, and there is in the circumstances at least a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Kristy Sibbritt was born on 24 June 1993. She did not give evidence on sentence and the subjective matters are drawn from the Pre-Sentence Report of Oscar Yu, dated 29 June 2016, and the material contained in Exhibit KS1, being the report of Ruth Allen, psychologist, dated 9 May 2016, a mental health care plan dated 5 October 2011, and a letter from Fe Limjap, psychologist, dated 3 June 2011, the Justice Health Mental Health Assessment dated 22 December 2015, and a letter from Michelle Tzirkas of Odyssey House, dated 28 January 2016.
	
	
	At the time of the offending, she was variously 21 to 22 years of age. She is now 23 years of age. She is one of four children from a blended family, her parents separating when she was eight years of age due to her father’s substance abuse and violence towards her mother. Unfortunately, her mother is apparently also an abuser of prohibited drugs, in particular amphetamines and methylamphetamine. The offender maintains contact with her mother but not with her father. The material indicates that she had a very disrupted childhood both in relation to emotional support and education. She attended six different high schools, but managed to obtain the School Certificate and Higher School Certificate, and later attended the University of Western Sydney to do a one year diploma in Social Science. However she discontinued this course in order to help and support her then partner’s studies and never returned.
	
	
	At 15, she had left home and then lived with a boyfriend and his family while finishing her Year 10. She had moved in with a new boyfriend when she was approximately 17 years of age. During her Years 11 and 12 she worked in butcher shops and then did some store work and bartending. After ceasing at university, she commenced escort work to support herself and her then partner. She is said to have met the co-offender, with whom she formed a relationship, through her mother’s drug associates when she was approximately 20 years of age. She was said to have been exposed to drug use at an early age and on an ongoing basis.
	
	
	At 17, it was her mother who introduced her to methamphetamine, although she did not begin using that substance regularly until approximately three years ago while working as an escort. Her usage increased over time and particularly after forming the relationship with the co-offender, Field. She has been previously diagnosed with anxiety, depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when she was 17, and was prescribed the anti-depressant Prozac. Since being taken into custody she has re-commenced that medication. She has had some assistance in the past with cognitive behaviour therapy, and was medicated with Lovan in 2011 for her Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. She is said to have gained insight into her offending. She has no prior convictions, has not incurred any institutional charges, and has been employed as a leading hand in the kitchen while in custody.
	
	
	She has been assessed by Probation and Parole as having a low to moderate risk of re-offending. I accept that she is remorseful, and should she be able to conquer her addiction to the prohibited drug methylamphetamine and/or any other prohibited drug, there is a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation. Should she fail in the future to address those problems, then she is very much at risk of re-offending.
	
	
	Gilbert Wai Kit Yeung did not give evidence on sentence. Before the Court in respect of subjective matters is his criminal history and a number of documents tendered on his behalf, being a report from Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, dated 16 May 2016, a letter from Jane Wilson of the Offender Services and Programs Unit, dated 8 June 2016, a character reference from Gavin Koo, dated 10 June 2016, and a further character reference from Vivienne Rodgers, dated 20 June 2016. In addition tendered on behalf of the offender was a letter from him to the Court, tendered without objection from the Crown. In addition a certificate of completion dated 13 July 2016 of the EQUIPS Addiction program, being a 20 session program, has been tendered and is Exhibit GY2. The subjective material is drawn from that material.
	
	
	He was born on 27 September 1983. He is now 31 years of age, and was 33 at the time of the offending. I have already referred to the fact that at the time of the offending he was on conditional liberty in relation to a Section 9 Bond for possessing a prohibited drug, and on bail in respect of two offences of driving while disqualified.
	
	
	He is one of two siblings born in Hong Kong. He came to Australia with his parents and his sister when he was approximately seven. His father continued to operate a business in Hong Kong and visited Australia every two months for approximately a fortnight. He discontinued high school in Year 12 after failing the trial Higher School Certificate. While supported initially by his parents, he was for several years unemployed, and attended a number of TAFE courses which he failed to complete.
	
	
	When approximately 25 years of age, his parents financed him into an Optus dealership, but the business failed. He married at approximately 25 years of age, and there were two children approximately six and a half and eight years of age, however, he and his wife separated at a time when the offender was serving a term of imprisonment, and he has had no physical contact with his children, who reside with their mother in Hong Kong. There had been ongoing conflict in the marriage due to the offender’s mood changes and drug abuse. His use of methylamphetamine or “ice” had commenced when he was approximately 25 and it escalated over time to an addiction and a significant level of use.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, has diagnosed him as suffering from major depression with features of an anxiety disorder. While in custody, he has worked in the metal workshop at Parklea and in the textile industry at Lithgow. On 4 May 2016, he commenced the EQUIPS program, being 22 hour sessions targeting substance abuse, which he completed in July 2016. He continues to be supported by his family and friends.
	
	
	His criminal history includes four previous offences of possessing prohibited drugs, and at the time of these offences, as previously referred to, he was subject to the Section 9 bond. He has been convicted of a total of ten drive whilst disqualified offences, and is disqualified from driving until the year 2040. The relevance of those offences in particular is that he had previously served a period of time in custody in respect of such offences. There are a small number of other offences of a comparatively minor nature. After being arrested in respect of the current matters, he was sentenced to two terms of imprisonment for drive whilst disqualified offences which were committed in February and May of 2015. The terms were partially concurrent and the total effect was a sentence of 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 months commencing on 13 August 2015, the non-parole period expired on 12 September 2016.
	
	
	From his arrest on 1 July 2015 to 13 August 2015 .which was the commencement of the combined sentences for the drive whilst disqualified offences, he spent a period of 43 days in custody which are solely referable to this matter and must be taken into account. There was apparently no action taken in respect of the breach of the s 9 two year bond for possessing a prohibited drug. While in custody there have been no disciplinary charges.
	
	
	His remorse has been referred to by Mr Watson-Munro. It is also contained in a letter to the Court from the offender and was also referred to by his sister, Vivienne Rodgers, and also his friend Gavin Koo. I accept that the offender is remorseful for his conduct, and I accept that should he be able to conquer his addiction there would be a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation and a low prospect of re-offending. However, I note that he has had a significant addiction for a substantial period of time. The absence of any disciplinary charges while in custody and the fact that he has completed the EQUIPS Program would appear to hold out reasonable hope that the offender either has or can successfully address his drug addiction.
	
	
	Kwun Yip Ting was born on 21 August 1977. He was 37 years of age at the time of the offending, and he is now 39 years of age. At the time of the offending, as I have previously referred to, he was subject to two Section 9 bonds for driving whilst disqualified and a Section 9 bond of 18 months in relation to the possession of a prohibited drug. There appears to have been no action taken in relation to any of the Section 9 bonds.
	
	
	Again, the offender gave no evidence on sentence. Subjective material is drawn from his criminal history, part of Exhibit 11, the Corrective Services Report, also being part of Exhibit 11, the material contained in Exhibit KT(1) being a psychological report from Mr Milic, psychologist, dated 5 July 2016, and a report from Mr George Tirris, being a MERIT or Magistrate’s Early Referral Into Treatment program report, dated 30 April 2015, prepared and provided for his appearance at the Local Court on 5 May 2015 at Burwood for an offence of possessing a prohibited drug. Of note of course is that the Section 9 bond of 18 months was imposed on 5 May 2015, and the two matters that are before the Court by way of the charge on the Form 1 occurred on 23 June 2015 and 1 July 2015, that is, in close temporal relationship to his being given the benefit of the 18 month bond for possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	He was born after his parents migrated to Hong Kong from mainland China, and he has an older sister. During his second year of high school he was transferred to a Hong Kong English language school, where because of his poor English language skills, he fell behind and truanted in order to play video games with like-minded friends. He arrived in Australia at the age of 13 and spent one year in a language school; having been bullied at school in both Hong Kong and Australia he continued truanting and performing poorly academically. After completing high school, he worked picking and packing for Woolworths and Franklins for approximately two to three years which was followed by a number of odd jobs. He was a computer technician with Optima for nearly two years and with Asus for about 18 months prior to his last period of imprisonment. However, due to his drug abuse, his performance had deteriorated in those jobs, causing him to lose them.
	
	
	He is said to have commenced using MDMA (“ecstasy”) at the age of 20 during a period of social and familial isolation, later becoming dependant on methylamphetamine at the age of 30, and after a successful period on parole for offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime and possessing counterfeit money, the offender reoffended in November 2014. He attended the MERIT program between February and April 2015 and completed detoxification but ultimately did not enter a residential rehabilitation or attain complete abstinence. He had of course failed in his attempt to cease the use of prohibited drugs by 23 June 2015, as the offender was using half a gram of ice over a period of two to three days at around about the time of this offence.
	
	
	Mr Milic opined;
	


“It is likely that the offender’s addiction and the underlying issues maintaining his addiction were significant causal factors in his offences.”


	
	I accept that an addiction to methylamphetamine is of course likely to contribute to the motive for participating in offences such as this, but it is not an excuse.
	
	
	His criminal history is consistent with a long standing dependency on illicit substances.
	
	
	His past criminal history indicates a variety of offences: such matters as wilful and obscene exposure, larceny, shoplifting, using false instruments, obtaining money by deception, and a number of those offences, particularly using false instruments, have been the subject of a number of charges. There are also offences of receiving/disposing of stolen property and terms of imprisonment have been imposed.
	
	
	He has four previous offences of supplying prohibited drugs, and two previous offences of possessing prohibited drugs, again including several periods of imprisonment between 2003 and 2015. As well, there have been offences involving the proceeds of crime, driving while disqualified, possessing and uttering counterfeit money. His Corrective Services Report indicates that he has had no disciplinary charges while in custody at any time.
	
	
	In relation to rehabilitation, it is clear from the records that past attempts at rehabilitation have failed, and appear to have failed relatively quickly. There is no expression of remorse contained in any of the material. The offender clearly has a significant difficulty with the consumption of prohibited drugs and while I accept that it is likely that most of his criminal history is orientated around that addiction it cannot in the circumstances be said that there is a good prospect of rehabilitation, or a low prospect that he would not reoffend.
	
	
	Cam Tang Tran was born on 26 September 1974. He was aged 40 at the time of the offending, and is now 42. However, according to the psychologist’s report and one of the birthdates given in his criminal history, he was 42 years of age at the time of the offending and is now 44. As I understand it, the offender’s case is that the correct ages are 42 and 44.
	
	
	I note that the Crown material contained an error in relation to suggesting that he was the subject of bail at the time of the offending, but that error has been acknowledged by the Crown, and I disregard that information. The offender did not give evidence on sentence, and the subjective material was taken from: a Pre-Sentence Report under the hand of Christine Moellmer, Community Corrections officer, dated 1 July 2016, his criminal history, and the Corrective Services Report contained in Exhibit 13, the Crown bundle, and from material contained in Exhibit CT1, the report of Dr Jeremy O’Dea, forensic psychiatrist, dated 8 July 2016, a discharge referral from New South Wales Health and various hospital notes from Justice Health, in particular in relation to a previous shooting injury. In addition, I note a number of certificates from TAFE in relation to courses of: “Working Safely with Industrial Chemicals and Materials”, “Producing Powder Coated Products” and a letter to the Court from the offender which was not objected to by the Crown.
	
	
	The offender was born in Vietnam and is the youngest of six children. He came to Australia with his family, when he was approximately 15 years of age. There is no significant family history. The offender claims limited education in Vietnam and that on coming to Australia he attended Fairfield High School and participated in a “Special English” class, completing Years 8 to 11 by the age of twenty, and leaving school in 1992 with limited skills in respect to reading and writing. He commenced using heroin in 1998 and rapidly escalated to a daily habit. He was a member of the “5T” gang for approximately twenty years before ceasing.
	
	
	He has a very limited work history, and the Pre-Sentence Report indicates a considerable difference between his claims and his sister’s reporting of his work history. He continues to have family support but to a lesser degree than claimed by him. While in custody he has worked in the powder coating unit and has received high praise from the overseer. As referred to, he has completed relevant TAFE courses.
	
	
	He married at 23 and there is one 18 year old child of the marriage. He was divorced in 2001 and he has had no contact with his wife or child for approximately ten years. He has been in a further relationship for a period of approximately two years.
	
	
	In 2002, he was “ambushed” and shot by “enemies” to the hip, shoulder and jaw while seated in a motor vehicle. The face/jaw injury has required multiple operations and resulted in chronic pain and infection. He lost all of his lower teeth. While previously in custody he commenced a methadone programme. He states that he ceased using heroin in 2002/2003 but unfortunately had commenced using ice to deal with the pain. He was using ice twice a week at the time of the offence.
	
	
	He has an extensive criminal history, commencing as a juvenile. There are nine previous convictions for possession of prohibited or restricted substances, although no convictions for supply. The penalties imposed would appear to indicate that they were all relatively minor matters. He has been subject to a number of fines, bonds and custodial sentences. He has had the benefit of two s 12 bonds and one s 9 bond with supervision, but breached the bonds due to non-compliance with supervision. There are a number of offences involving violence or threatened violence. His longest sentence was one of six years and six months with a two and a half year non-parole period, concluding in August of 2003.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that he responded well to parole supervision and complied with all parole requirements and conditions. However, by 2009, he was again regularly before the courts with a poor record of attendance. There have been no disciplinary charges while the offender has been in custody.
	
	
	As to remorse, Mr O’Dea’s report contains the following p 5:
	


“...I went to my friend’s house...they asked me to smoke (ice)...they asked me to do them a favour...I know dealing drugs is bad...but I did not realise until the day that I delivered the package...I did not realise it was a serious crime...I feel like I owe him a favour...because he asked me if I wanted to smoke...”


	
	In light of the offender’s past history of offending in respect of drugs, and previous terms of imprisonment as well as his admitted lengthy connection over twenty years to a notorious criminal gang titling itself “5T”, it cannot be accepted that the offender did not appreciate the seriousness of his conduct in participating in the supply of the prohibited drug on this occasion.
	
	
	The submissions by Mr Payne, Barrister, on behalf of the offender indicated:
	


“...benefitted to the extent he was able to further his own drug habit”.


	
	There is no evidence of financial involvement, but in his submissions, Mr Payne accepted that he participated for financial gain. There is no evidence as to what that may have been, but at least there appears to be no issue that there was at least a gain, or expected gain in the sense of obtaining access to the drug to which he was addicted.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that he informed the officer that he was to be given drugs in return for his services. It also states that he expressed remorse for his actions as well as accepting responsibility. In the absence of dealing with his drug addiction, in respect of which his past history indicates great difficulty, it cannot be said that there is a low risk of reoffending or a good prospect of rehabilitation. That is, of course, not to say that there is no prospect of rehabilitation or that he will necessarily reoffend in the future. While it is not an excuse for the offending conduct, I accept that having a significant addiction to the prohibited drug methylamphetamine is a strong motivation for participating in offences of this nature.
	
	
	Endeavouring to sentence the five offenders in relation to this matter has been a complex task, not assisted by the provision of nine sets of individual facts and complicated by the manner in which the Crown has elected to proceed such as in respect of Mr Field and Ms Sibbritt, and in relation to the last series of offences, the Court being expected to sentence separately for the two offences, that is, on 1 July 2015 and 23 June 2015 of supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine in the amounts of 282 grams and 279.2 grams as separate offences, when in respect of the offenders Yeung and Ting, the Crown has accepted that it was appropriate to proceed by way of a single charge of supply prohibited drug, being 282 grams, and to place on a Form 1 the second offence of 279.29 grams of methamphetamine.
	
	
	I note as previously indicated during the hearing of the sentence proceedings, that the Court of Criminal Appeal has frowned in the past on offences which have legislated standard non-parole periods being included on a Form 1.
	
	
	However, despite the past comments of inappropriateness by the Court of Criminal Appeal, I will deal with the matters. But it does I note make the task of providing parity between offenders more difficult than it might otherwise have been.
	
	
	While I have endeavoured to reduce the facts into one set of facts, I indicate that I only take into account the facts that I have referred to that were specifically relevant to each of the offenders, as contained in the individual set of facts provided in respect of each of them. As I noted on a previous occasion, I have been careful to note where there was any difference between the facts for the individual offenders, a process which required a considerable period of time to achieve.
	
	
	I note that where an offender at the time of the offending was the subject of conditional liberty, whether that be by way of a s 12 bond, a s 9 bond, or bail, that there is a long line of authority that that fact is a serious aggravating circumstance. The protection of the community from those who abuse their conditional liberty calls for significantly deterrent sentences.
	
	
	In respect of these matters, I will later refer to the individual discounts for the utility of the plea as allowed when dealing with the individual charges.
	
	
	In respect of each of the offenders, in my view both specific deterrence and general deterrence are important factors for the Court to take into account. For the purposes of sentencing, the Court must have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors as referred to in s 21A(2) and (3).
	
	
	Any sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, as well as the need for both specific and general deterrence, as well as meeting the fundamental purpose of punishment, that is, the protection of society. The protection of society is important in relation to offences involving the prohibited drug, methamphetamine, which in recent years has become such a scourge in the community that the legislature has seen it appropriate since the time of this offending to reduce the large commercial quantity from 1 kilogram to half a kilogram.
	
	
	I am of course, however sentencing, according to the state of the legislation at the time of this offending.
	
	
	I am satisfied, pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in relation to each of the individual offenders, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. I note that no counsel on behalf of any offender has suggested in submissions that there is any course available to the Court other than a period of imprisonment.
	
	
	I have taken all of those matters into account, and I intend to deal with the offenders by way of sentence in the reverse order to which I have so far referred to them.
	
	
	Accordingly, in respect of the offender Cam Tang Tran and the offence of supply prohibited drug, more than an indictable quantity, being 103.1 grams of methamphetamine, with a maximum available period of imprisonment of 15 years, noting that the plea of guilty was entered in the Local Court on 2 March 2016 and that in those circumstances it is appropriate to provide a utility discount of 25%, as referred to in Thomson and Houlton [2000] 49 NSWLR 383, and noting that the quantity of 103.1 grams is somewhat less than half of the next level of seriousness, being a commercial quantity, 250 grams, but is nonetheless approximately 20 times more than the indictable quantity, the sentence will be a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 1 July 2015, when he was taken into custody. The non-parole period will expire on 31 December 2016. The balance of term, having found special circumstances to provide for a period of one year on parole to assist him with supervision in relation to rehabilitation and dealing with his drug habit, the full sentence is two years and six months with an 18 month non-parole period. The sentence will expire on 31 December 2017.
	
	
	I order that he be released on the expiry on the non-parole period. I direct that his parole be subject to supervision by Community Corrections with particular regard to treatment and/or counselling in respect of drug abuse and note that such supervision should include random drug urinalysis.
	
	
	Mr Tran, I have no doubt in relation to you and your past history that you understand that if you are in breach of your conditions of parole you will end up back in custody for any unexpired parole period, all right? Please take a seat.
	
	
	In respect of Kwun Yip Ting, and in respect of the offence of supply of prohibited drug being more than a commercial quantity, being 282 grams of methamphetamine, and taking into account the matter contained on the Form 1, being a further offence of supplying a commercial quantity of methamphetamine, being 279.29 grams, I have allowed for the maximum utility discount of 25%, the plea of guilty having been entered in the Local Court at the earliest opportunity, on 2 March 2016.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since the 1 July 2015, and only in respect of this matter, however Mr Ting was involved, unlike Mr Tran, in two separate matters involving significantly larger quantities. The sentence must reflect that as well as the fact that he was on conditional liberty.
	
	
	The sentence in respect of Mr Ting is a non-parole period of two years and six months with a balance of term of one year and six months, the total sentence being four years. The sentence commences on 1 July 2015. He will be first eligible for parole on 31 December 2017 and then subject to parole for the balance of the four years. The full term of sentence will expire on 13 June 2018.
	
	
	I have again found special circumstances in relation to Mr Ting, those special circumstances being to provide for a more significant period on parole than would otherwise be the case if the statutory relationship applied to assist him with rehabilitation, that is treatment and/or counselling in respect of his drug addiction.
	
	
	I recommend that when released on parole, he be subject to requirements to participate in drug counselling and/or treatment as well as being subject to random urinalysis. Thank you, sit down.
	
	
	In respect of Gilbert Wai Kit Yeung, and the offence of supply prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity, being 282 grams of methamphetamine, and taking into account the further offence contained on the Form 1, being the further offence of the same nature in respect of a quantity of 279.29 grams of methamphetamine, noting again, as previously referred to, that he was on conditional liberty, and that the plea of guilty was entered at the Local Court on 2 March 2016, that it is appropriate to provide a 25% discount for the utility alone of the plea.
	
	
	Further, taking account of the fact that after entering custody, he was sentenced in respect of the two drive while disqualified offences to a combined sentence totalling one year and six months, with a non-parole period of one year and one month, that sentence commencing on 13 August 2015, he having been taken into custody in respect of these matters on 3 July 2015, the non‑parole period of one year, one month, expired on 12 September 2016.
	
	
	I recognise that the sentencing discretion to be exercised today includes the ability to make the sentence imposed in this matter concurrent, partially concurrent with or wholly accumulative upon the sentence to which the offender has been sentenced as a result of the drive while disqualified charges for the reasons referred to be Simpson J in Callahan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58.
	
	
	In my view, however, it is not appropriate to make the sentence to be imposed in respect of this matter in any way concurrent with the sentences imposed for the drive while disqualified offences, and so I intend to commence the sentence to be imposed in respect of Mr Yeung from 13 September 2016, that is, the first day after the expiry of the non‑parole period imposed for the drive while disqualified offences, but I intend to take into account the 43 days in custody between 1 July 2015 and the commencement of the drive while disqualified offences on 13 August 2015. Accordingly, the sentence will be backdated by 43 days from 13 September 2016.
	
	
	Mr Yeung had a significantly more senior role in the supply for which he is to be sentenced than Mr Ting, who essentially appears to have only acted at the direction as necessary of Mr Yeung. Mr Yeung was himself a supplier of methamphetamine at the direction of Mr Field, and in view of his much more significant role, it is appropriate to impose a more significant sentence than was imposed on Mr Ting.
	
	
	In respect of Mr Yeung, he is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and nine months, commencing on 13 September 2016, but, backdated by 43 days, it will commence on 1 August 2016, meaning that he will be first eligible for parole on 30 April 2020. The balance of term is one year and nine months, the total sentence being five years and six months.
	
	
	I have found special circumstances in respect of Mr Yeung in relation to his need for a longer period of supervision on parole to assist him to deal with his drug addiction problems. I have also taken into account the concept of totality. While I have made the sentence cumulative on the non‑parole period for the drive while disqualified offences, the overall relationship of the total non‑parole period for those offences and this offence to the total sentence for those offences and this offence is less than 75%, having found special circumstances both on the basis of the need for assistance in rehabilitation and also to take account of the principle of totality.
	


Thank you, Mr Yeung, I take it, in view of your past history, you have no difficulty in understanding that your release on or about 30 April 2020 will depend largely upon how you perform in custodial circumstances and with Community Corrections. There are courses available in custody. You should ensure you make full effort to take whatever courses that might assist you in the future in relation to both your use of prohibited drugs, and also possible work in the future.


	
	I turn first of all to Ms Sibbritt. Ms Sibbritt, like Mr Field, has to be sentenced in respect of a number of offences, and I have decided that it is appropriate to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence, in which case it is necessary for me to give individual indicative sentences for the various offences currently before me, including where such offences have a standard non‑parole period provided, indicating not only the head sentence or total term, but the non‑parole period that would have been imposed for the individual offence. Accordingly, I will indicate, first of all, each of the indicative sentences.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of accessory after the fact to the serious indictable offence of manufacture a prohibited drug, in respect of which the maximum penalty is five years’ imprisonment, noting that while the quantity assessed to have been manufactured was in fact almost 19.4 kilograms of methylamphetamine, there is no indication in the evidence that the offender was aware of such a quantity, the indicative sentence is a fixed term of 18 months. I have taken into account that the plea was entered on 16 March 2016, which was two days after the trial had been listed to proceed.
	
	
	I have allowed in respect of the accessory after the fact offence a utility discount, in those circumstances, of 10% for that offence. I similarly allow a discount of 10% in respect of the further offence of supplying 385.1 grams of methylamphetamine on the same basis; that is that the plea was a belated plea, two days after the trial was listed to commence.
	
	
	In respect of the second offence of supply a prohibited drug, being contrary to s 25(2), being 385.1 grams of methylamphetamine, the indicative non‑parole period is two years and nine months. The total term is four years and nine months, which would have meant a parole period of two years on the basis of special circumstances.
	
	
	In respect of the charge of take part in the manufacture, being 24.61 grams of methylamphetamine, commenced by way of ex officio indictment, of which the offender was informed on 10 March 2016, that is, four days before the trial was anticipated to commence, and in respect of which she entered the plea six days later, on 16 March 2016, it is appropriate to allow the maximum discount for the utility of 25%, and I do so. The indicative sentence is a fixed term of 22 months.
	
	
	In respect of the offence on 1 July 2015 of take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity, being 282 grams of methylamphetamine, I take into account the Form 1 attached to that offence, being a further offence of take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being 103.10 grams of methylamphetamine, and in respect of the further offence on 23 June 2015 of take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being 279.29 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Each of the pleas was entered in the Local Court on 2 March 2016 and I allow in each case a maximum utility discount of 25%.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of take part in the supply of prohibited drug, 282 grams, the indicative sentence is a three year non-parole period with a balance of term of two years, that is, a sentence of five years with a three year non-parole period.
	
	
	In respect of the further offence of take part in the supply of prohibited drug, 279.29 grams, the indicative non-parole period is again three years with a further balance of term of two years, that is, a total indicative sentence of five years with a three year non-parole period.
	
	
	It will be obvious from that, that I have found special circumstances, it being the offender’s first time in custody, and also on the basis of the significant term that she will serve, the need for an extended period on parole to take into account the need for counselling and/or treatment in respect of her drug addiction and to assist her in returning to a lawful life in the community.
	
	
	Having indicated the indicative sentences, the aggregate sentence will commence from 1 July 2015 when she went into custody. The non-parole period is five years and the balance of term is two years. The non-parole period having commenced on 1 July 2015, she will be first eligible for parole on 30 June 2020, and the balance of term of two years will expire on 30 June 2022.
	
	
	It will be evident in relation to the sentence that I have reduced the statutory relationship of the non-parole period to the full term by some three months to provide for a full two years of supervision, should she be released at the earliest time on parole. In my view, two years of parole is a significant period of parole to effect rehabilitation, and to assist her in returning to a lawful life in the community. I recommend when released on parole that she be subject to a requirement to participate in drug rehabilitation and/or counselling or treatment for that purpose, as well as recommending that she be subject to random urinalysis during the period of parole.
	
	
	Ms Sibbritt, I take it you would understand by now, from what I have said to the others, that you will be first eligible to be released on parole on or about 30 June 2020. That will depend on your performance while in custody and you will then be subject to a further two years, or whatever balance remains of the parole period, subject to supervision by Community Corrections. If in breach of any of the conditions imposed upon you in parole you will no doubt end up being returned to custody for such balance.
	
	
	I should indicate of course that I have, in reaching the sentence, taken into account not only special circumstances but also the principle of totality.
	
	
	I then turn to Mr Field, who is before the Court for sentence in respect of a total of six offences, together with one offence on a Form 1, and I again, as indicated, will proceed by way of an aggregate sentence. The first offence was accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence, being manufacture a prohibited drug. The same comments that I have made in respect of Ms Sibbritt are relevant to Mr Field in relation to the actual commission of that offence, and I have again noted that the plea was entered two days after the trial was due to start. In those circumstances, a utility discount of 10% is appropriate, and in respect of Mr Field, the indicative sentence for that offence is 20 months imprisonment, that is, two months more than I provided in respect of Ms Sibbritt.
	
	
	In respect of the second offence of supply prohibited drug, being more than a commercial quantity, 385.1 grams, again the utility discount allowed is 10%, in view of the late nature of the plea, and the indicative sentence is a three year non-parole period with a balance of term of two years, meaning a total term of five years with a three year non-parole period.
	
	
	In relation to the ex officio offence of manufacture prohibited drug, 24.61 grams of methylamphetamine, the plea having been entered at the earliest time, the utility discount allowed is 25%, and the indicative sentence is one of two years, a fixed term.
	
	
	In respect of the further offence of supply prohibited drug on an ongoing basis on 5, 12 and 19 May 2015 in a total quantity of 259.97 grams of methylamphetamine, the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity. The utility discount allowed is 25%. I note that the offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis was originally introduced in particular to deal with persons who sold drugs on a regular basis in the street in small quantities, being singular grams or points of grams. The offending on this occasion in each case involved a quantity on three occasions of more than 80 grams, and is for that reason alone a more significant offence than might otherwise be reflected by the statistics, on each occasion involving a payment of some $18,000.
	
	
	The plea of guilty, if I did not say it, was entered at the earliest opportunity, that is, on 2 March 2016 in the Local Court, and I allow a utility discount of 25%. The indicative sentence is a six years fixed term of imprisonment. In sentencing him for that offence, I have also taken into account the Form 1 matter involving a minor quantity of 0.61 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	In relation to the further offence of supply prohibited drug more than the commercial quantity, 279.29 grams of methylamphetamine, the plea having been entered at the earliest opportunity, the utility discount is 25% and the indicative sentence is five years with a three year non-parole period.
	
	
	I have again in respect of Mr Field found special circumstances on the basis of need for an extended period of supervision on parole to deal with his drug addiction.
	
	
	I also take into account the principle of totality, and with regard to Mr Field; that principle also takes into account the five months non‑parole period in respect of the revoked s 12 bond. While the sentence will commence on the expiry of the five months non-parole period for the revoked s 12 bond, I have, however, taken it into account in setting the above by way of referring myself to the total term of imprisonment involved, and the total non‑parole period represented by the parole period to be imposed for these offences, and the aggregate sentence, and the five months I have referred to.
	
	
	Accordingly, in respect of Mr Field, the non-parole period is six years commencing on 1 December 2015. He will be first eligible for parole on 30 November 2021. The balance of term is two years and six months. Accordingly, the total sentence is a term of imprisonment of eight years and six months with a non-parole period of six years. I have, off the top of my head, I think reduced the non-parole period to reflect special circumstances and totality by approximately some four and a half months from the statutory relationship.
	


Mr Field, I take it you don’t need me to explain that you will be released on parole on or about 30 November 2021, depending on your conduct while in custody, and you will then be subject to parole for the balance of the term, whatever that may be. Again, I recommend that you be required, when released on parole, to participate in counselling and/or treatment for the abuse of prohibited drugs and subjected to urinalysis. Thank you, please take a seat.

This has been, as evident, a complex process. There may be some individual matters that I have omitted to refer to in dealing with the complexity of this matter. I propose to annex to my reasons, when they become available, a schedule of the charges*, maximum penalties, whether the offender was on conditional liberty and some reference to criminal history, as well as the timing of the pleas, the utility discount and the time in custody, as well as the indicative sentences and the actual sentence for the assistance of counsel, having found it impossible to deal with this matter without having created such a schedule.

So I’ll hand down six copies. That might assist you in deciding whether for your individual clients parity has or has not been achieved, rather than having to weave your way through the reasons on sentence when they become available, and it may assist the Court of Criminal Appeal in the future.

BARR: Thank you for sitting late. Before your Honour rises and if your Honour might, there is one very brief matter outstanding, which is a claim for compensation which I have consent orders in relation to.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Isn’t it also necessary to make an order for the destruction of any drugs and/or equipment?

BARR: I’d ask formally for that order to be made.

HIS HONOUR: I make an order for the destruction of the drugs and the forfeiture or destruction of any equipment obtained by the authorities in the investigation of these matters, noting of course that it may be necessary for some of the equipment and drugs to be retained until such time as other co‑offenders such as Mr Poniris and Mr Levar might be dealt with.

BARR: Your Honour, I have consent orders in relation to a claim for compensation by EIG Insurance in relation to the damage to the Coogee flat concerning Ms Sibbritt and Mr Field.

WALTERS: Your Honour, for the record, I appear for Mr Field. There is consent to the terms handed up by the learned Crown.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right.

HALL: May it please your Honour, the same is the case for Ms Sibbritt.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right.


	
	I order that pursuant to s 97(1), the sum of $105,927.43 be directly paid out of the property of the respondent defendants Joshua Field and Kristy Sibbritt to EIG Insurance Limited by way of compensation for loss sustained through one of the offences for which the respondents have been convicted. The liability under this direction may not be enforced so as to exceed a total of $105,927.43.
	


WALTERS: Your Honour, I appreciate it’s been a long morning, but in relation to Mr Field, there is one issue regarding the commencement date of the sentence. Should that be left to another date after I raise it with the learned Crown?

HIS HONOUR: No.

WALTERS: That relates to your remarks in relation to the sentence your Honour imposed, and your Honour revoked the s 12 bond. Initially when your Honour remarked, your Honour indicated that your Honour sentenced Mr Field to ten months imprisonment with a non-parole period of five months from 15 May 2015 to 14 October 2015, bearing in mind he went into custody in respect of the matters for which your Honour sentenced him on 1 July 2015. Mr Rowe of counsel who appeared informed me that what your Honour did is your Honour took into account the period of custody he’s served in relation to that offence of keychain pistol in effectively backdating that sentence, which your Honour can of course do pursuant to s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. A criminal record would confirm what your Honour’s sentence was in relation to the s 12 bond, so on my calculations that sentence that your Honour has imposed today of a non-parole period of six years would commence on 15 October 2015 to reflect the period he’s been in custody for these matters for which your Honour sentenced him. I’ve raised that with my friend’s instructing solicitor just by way of a note, I didn’t want to interrupt the proceedings.

BARR: As I understand that’s the note that the Crown has also in relation to that commencement--

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I must confess that I realised as I was delivering the sentence some problem, but I thought I had it resolved in my mind that it was the later date. But you are no doubt correct. These are your orders, Mr Crown, let me just return them. In respect of the s 12 bond the five months non‑parole period expired on 14 October 2015?

WALTERS: That's right, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So the sentence in respect of this matter should commence on 15 October 2015.

WALTERS: Yes, thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And he would then be eligible for parole on 14 October 2021 and the total term will expire is it 14 March 2024, two years six months later?

WALTERS: I think it’s April, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: April?

WALTERS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, sorry, April. All right, I correct what I said in respect of Mr Field and you should correct your schedule and I’ll correct the schedule to be attached to the reasons.


	
	The sentence with a non-parole period of six years in respect of Mr Field commenced on 15 October 2015. He will be first eligible for parole on 14 October 2021. The balance of term is two years and six months. The total term of the sentence is eight years and six months expiring on 14 April 2024.

4336657,"R v Barlow, Charles Cameron [2015] NSWDC 422","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Charles Barlow appears for sentence in respect of four offences, the first being assault occasioning actual bodily harm to GS contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty provided is five years imprisonment.
	
	
	The second offence is use offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful detention, to wit, a knife, contrary to s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty is 12 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The third offence is aggravated detain for advantage, the aggravation being actual bodily harm contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty is 20 years.
	
	
	There is no standard non-parole period provided in respect of those three offences.
	
	
	The fourth offence is cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty provided is 25 years. There is a standard non-parole period in respect of that offence of seven years. When sentencing in respect of the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the Court is asked to take into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 an additional charge listed on a Form 1, being intentionally damage property at the Campsie Police Station, the property being a telephone. The offence is contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. There is a maximum penalty provided of five years imprisonment. That offence will be taken into account when sentencing for the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In respect of each of the offences that the offender is to be sentenced for, he entered a plea of guilty on 15 October 2014 at the Burwood Local Court. It is accepted that he entered the pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity, and is entitled to a 25% discount for the utility alone of the plea in each case as referred to in Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.
	
	
	The date of the offences was 18 August 2013, and the offender was arrested on that date. At the time, he was the subject of a number of s 9 bonds for two years for offences of contravening an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order and two offences of destroy or damage property. He was also on conditional liberty in respect of an offence of reckless wounding, committed on 23 June 2013. He was on bail in respect of that offence.
	
	
	Since being taken into custody as a result of the commission of these offences, he has been sentenced for the offence of reckless wounding to a term of imprisonment of two years to date from 19 August 2013, with a non‑parole period of 18 months which expired on 18 February 2015. Since that date, he has been in custody in respect of these offences alone.
	
	
	I also note that at the time of the offence, he was the subject of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order, the offence being committed in circumstances where the order was breached. That offence is contained on a s 166 certificate.
	
	
	The facts have been agreed, and are as follows.
	


BACKGROUND


	
	At the time of the offence, the victim, Mrs TW, resided with her daughter, Ms TW and the offender’s son, YW, in Kensington Street, Punchbowl. The child has been diagnosed as autistic.
	
	
	At the time of the offence, an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order was in force for the protection of Ms TW. The order was made by the Burwood Local Court on 30 September 2011 and was operative for a period of two years. In addition to the standard orders that the accused must not harass, molest, threaten, intimidate or stalk Ms TW, there was an additional condition preventing him from entering or loitering near the premises in Kensington Street, Punchbowl.
	


EVENTS OF 18 AUGUST 2013


	
	On 18 August 2013, the victim Mrs TW was at home with her grandson. Ms TW was at work.
	
	
	At about 3pm, a family friend, GS, rang and spoke to the victim, who invited him to dinner later that night.
	


CONTRAVENE APPREHENDED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER


	
	At some stage during the afternoon, the victim went into the backyard to collect some clothes. The offender was in the backyard. The victim spoke to him and told him to leave as he was not welcome. There was an argument between them about the child, the offender indicating that he wanted to take the child from the home.
	
	
	The offender hit Mrs TW hard to the head. She told him not to hit her as her grandson was around and she did not want any violence in front of the child. The accused continued to hit the victim to the head and face.
	
	
	At about 5pm, GS arrived at the home of the victim. He noticed the front flyscreen door mesh had been ripped out and was lying on the front porch. He knocked on the front door a number of times and heard a muffled response from the victim telling him to push the front door. Mr GS pushed the door open. The door was unlocked but had a lounge pushed up against it.
	
	
	He found the victim lying on the lounge against the door. She had dried blood on her face and was bleeding from her forehead near her temple. Her right eye was starting to become swollen. Mr GS asked the victim what had happened.
	
	
	The victim was incoherent. Mr GS attempted to assist her to stand. She was unable to stand. He observed that the house was untidy and that there were clothes strewn about, and that the lounge had been moved from its usual position, that there was blood on the carpet and the linoleum underneath where the carpet had been pushed up.
	
	
	Mr GS noticed that the child was not then present.
	
	
	Mr GS cleaned the victim up. The victim asked where her grandchild was. Mr GS looked for the child in the rooms of the home but could not find him. He observed chairs in the hallway that were turned on their side, which he righted and then assisted the victim to bed. Mr GS suggested that a call be made to Ms TW, the victim’s daughter. However, the victim asked him not to call. Mr GS insisted that the victim go to a hospital and the police be called to find the child.
	
	
	Mr GS searched the house for the victim’s phone. The victim returned to the lounge. She appeared calmer and able to stand. The victim and Mr GS went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea.
	
	
	Whilst they were in the kitchen, Mr GS noticed the offender and the child standing in the lounge room of the house.
	
	
	The victim shouted out, “Oh YW, YW” being the nickname for the child.
	
	
	The offender screamed, “He is my son” and kicked the victim to her stomach. The offender hit the victim to the head with a closed fist, using both hands. The victim fell to the floor. The offender continued to kick the victim in the stomach. The victim was crying and saying, “No”.
	


ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM TO GS


	
	Mr GS grabbed hold of the offender’s hands and tried to stop him assaulting the victim. The offender fought with Mr GS, and with a free hand pulled open the kitchen drawer, from which he grabbed a barbeque fork. The offender wrestled Mr GS to the floor and tried to poke Mr GS in the face with the barbeque fork. The offender jabbed the fork towards Mr GS. However, he was able to get free of the offender. Mr GS went into the lounge room where he noticed the victim was bleeding and silent. He attempted to go to the victim, but was prevented by the offender wrestling him away. The offender was still armed with the barbeque fork. The offender pushed Mr GS, and he fell to the ground. The offender said, “Stay down”.
	
	
	Mr GS stood back up, and he and the offender wrestled. They ended up on the front porch of the home. The offender again pushed Mr GS, who fell backwards and landed on the concrete steps at the front of the house.
	
	
	Mr GS got up and ran to a neighbour’s home, but as there was no response, he ran up the street where he found a woman who assisted him to call Triple-0 at 5.34pm. Mr GS returned to the victim’s home. However, the offender came back out the front, and Mr GS then ran from the home.
	


USE OFFENSIVE WEAPON TO PREVENT APPREHENSION


	
	Police arrived at the premises at 5.47pm in response to the Triple-O call made by Mr GS. Constable Dirani went to the front door of the home. As he was about to knock, he saw the offender in the front window of the home. The offender was naked from the waist up and holding a knife in his right hand. The blade of the knife was about 20 centimetres long. Next to the offender at the time was the child. The offender closed the curtains to the front room.
	
	
	The offender opened the curtains and appeared, holding the child. He moved the knife towards the child, holding it five to ten centimetres from the child’s throat, and yelled:
	


“I’ve barricaded the house. Fuck off or I’ll kill them all”.


	
	The offender again closed the curtains. Two officers moved towards the back of the house, while another two officers remained at the front of the house. Further police assistance was requested.
	


CAUSE GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM WITH INTENT TO CAUSE GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM TO MRS TW

AGGRAVATED DETAIN FOR ADVANTAGE


	
	Police could hear the offender inside the home, yelling out:
	


“I’ll kill them. I want (Ms TW) and Channel 7 here now or the bitch is dead.”


	
	Officers were able to look through a window at the back of the home. They observed the victim, covered in blood and leaning back against the cupboard. She was observed by one of officer to be moving.
	
	
	An officer called out to the offender requesting that they be allowed to help the victim, the offender said, “This cunt is going to die tonight if you don’t get me (Ms TW).” Police talked to the offender in an attempt to calm him down. The offender continued to make threats to kill the victim. At one stage, police were able to hear the victim yell out, “Help me, he’s going to kill me.” Police continued to talk to the offender and questioned him about Ms TW. The offender informed police that Ms TW’s number was on his phone, however, it was flat.
	
	
	An officer observed the offender move towards the victim, who was sitting propped against the cupboard. He heard a number of soft thudding noises which sounded like the offender striking the victim. The offender said, “I’ll kill this cunt, she fucked my life, get Ms TW here.”
	
	
	Police continued to try to persuade the offender to let the victim and the child leave.
	
	
	Specialist police arrived at the premises. The offender had barricaded the doors to the home with items of furniture, but police were able to open a rear sliding door to the home. They pulled back a curtain to get a better look inside the home.
	
	
	The offender was standing next to the victim holding the knife. An officer un-holstered his Taser. The offender said, “Put the Taser away, cunt, or I’ll kill her.” The offender threw his mobile phone to police and said, “Here, cunt, you find it, the number is in there.”
	
	
	The offender grabbed the victim by the hair and held her up as a shield in front of his body. He walked back towards a sofa in the living room and sat down on it. At this time, police observed the child sitting quietly on the floor looking at an iPad.
	
	
	The offender pulled the victim into his lap and held the blade of his knife at her throat. He screamed, “Fuck off. I’ll cut the cunt’s throat.” The offender pushed the blade of the knife towards the throat of the victim so that it was touching her skin. The victim reached up and attempted to grab hold of the blade being held at her throat. The offender pushed the knife towards her chin or throat area. A police officer called out, “No, don’t hurt her, stop.” The offender dragged the victim across the lounge room floor. The victim slumped to the floor and the offender began to kick, punch and elbow her. She was moaning. This continued for a couple of minutes.
	
	
	The offender said, “There’s no way out for me, that’s what that’s for” and pointed to a loop of rope suspended from the ceiling. The offender was then swigging from a soft drink bottle.
	
	
	Police repeatedly asked the offender to release the child and the victim. He refused to do so. Police asked the offender to place the child in a bedroom towards the front of the house. The offender picked up the child and dragged the victim by her hair with him into another bedroom. He placed the child on a bed in the room. The victim was slumped on the floor in the hall, just outside the door to the bedroom. Police moved around the house to establish a line of sight into the area of the home where the offender and the victim were now situated.
	
	
	The victim’s hair was matted with blood. Police spoke to the victim; she did not respond to them but attempted to crawl very slowly in their direction.
	
	
	The offender moved towards police, who were then standing on furniture looking into the bedroom through a window. He had a knife in his hand. As he passed the victim, he struck her a number of times with his fist and feet. Police asked him to leave her alone. He walked towards the police and appeared to be agitated.
	
	
	The offender alternately placed the knife in the front of his shorts and on a chest of drawers. The offender approached the victim and again, kicked and punched her. The victim continued to move towards police.
	
	
	The offender requested a cigarette, and police passed him a cigarette. The offender closed the curtains to the window where the police were standing. The police pulled the curtains open again. The offender showed police a frame which contained the foot and handprints of his and Ms TW’s two year old son, who had died some years previously.
	
	
	The offender continued to abuse the victim, saying, “This soulless cunt she has ruined my life.” The offender said, “I don’t give a fuck, I’m going to kill this cunt.”
	
	
	The victim had managed to pull herself upright. The offender bent over her and head-butted her to the head so that she again slumped to the floor. The offender said, “That’s it, this cunt needs to die. I’m going to fucking cut your throat.” The offender grabbed the victim by the hair with his left hand, pulling her upright and exposing her throat. He then began to lower the knife to the throat of the victim.
	
	
	An officer drew his firearm and pointed it at the offender, and said, “Charlie, drop the knife, leave her alone.” The offender paused and dropped the knife, and shoved the victim back to the floor. The offender then picked the knife back up and put it down the front of his shorts. He kicked the victim before walking out of the room.
	
	
	Whilst this was occurring, police at the back of the home had managed to move a table that was blocking entry. They entered and continued to move furniture to allow greater access to the home.
	
	
	Police pulled open the hall door. However, it had been tied up with cord or rope preventing it from being opened. They cut the cord and moved into the hallway. They observed the offender hiding behind a shower curtain in the bathroom. The offender moved his hand towards his shorts.
	
	
	Police discharged a Taser at the offender, who fell backwards and was arrested by police at 6.34pm.
	


FORM 1 OFFENCE INTENTIONALLY DAMAGE PROPERTY


	
	The offender was taken to Campsie Police Station. During his detention he damaged the telephone at the police station.
	


VICTIMS


	
	As a result of the offences, YW, Ms TW’s son, was found by police on a bed in the home in a state of distress, holding a pillow over his head. He had not been physically injured.
	
	
	Mr GS suffered an impacted transverse fracture of the distal left radius. This fracture did not require surgery and was managed conservatively.
	
	
	Mrs TW was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital. She had a wound measuring around 10 cm at the top of her head. The wound began at the margin of the forehead and extended back towards the middle of the scalp. There was no evidence that the wound had penetrated the skull. Based on an examination of the wound, it was determined that it was possibly an incised wound caused by the use of a cutting implement such as a knife, but more likely to have been a laceration caused by contact with a blunt object. If that is the case, it would not have been caused by a blow with a fist or head-butt but more likely caused by a blow with a hard object or colliding with a hard object as a result of a fall, or being pushed hard into something.
	
	
	Mrs TW also sustained a wound on her chin. It is unclear whether the wound was a laceration inflicted by some form of blunt force trauma or an incisive wound inflicted by the use of a cutting implement such as a knife. It is not inconsistent with Mr Barlow holding the knife to her chin or throat area as observed by the police.
	
	
	The victim had a wound on her left forearm which appears to be an incised wound caused by a sharp cutting implement.
	
	
	She also suffered fractures to her left second, third and fourth ribs.
	
	
	CT scanning revealed left anterior temporal lobe intraparenchymal haemorrhagic contusion. This contusion was as a result of significant blunt force trauma. A fracture to the victim’s right orbital wall was also noted, being a fracture to the thin bones of the eye socket in its medial and inferior aspects. The fracture required reconstructive surgery, and was most likely caused by a reasonably heavy blow to that area by a punch or head-butt.
	
	
	As a result of the contusion to the temporal lobe, the victim was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. The victim was treated in the Intensive Care Unit for 14 days.
	
	
	As a result of the brain injury, the victim suffered amnesia for a period of 30 days which was consistent with a severe traumatic brain injury. She was discharged home in the care of her daughter on 27 November 2013.
	
	
	The victim’s current prognosis is unclear. She suffers from ongoing issues with mood, and has lost her functional independence. It is likely that she will make some further recovery; however, she will have long term impairments as a result of her injuries.
	
	
	In addition to the Agreed Facts, a report from the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit of the Southwest Sydney Local Health District, located at Liverpool Hospital, has been provided. The report indicates, inter alia, that her post traumatic amnesia of 30 days was consistent with a “very severe traumatic brain injury.” The report notes that prior to her injury, she had lived in Department of Housing accommodation and had worked part time in the Bankstown Community Resource Group facilitating Aboriginal playgroups, and was also involved in caring for her grandson.
	
	
	At the time of her discharge from the brain injury in-patient program she had ongoing issues with mood and behaviour management, anger management, adjustment to change, relationship dynamics with the family, anxiety, difficulty coping with stressful situations, difficulty multi-tasking, difficulty following complex instructions, difficulty dealing with crowded environments and group situations, reduced attention and poor short term memory. She also required supervision, prompting and assistance in completing housekeeping tasks.
	
	
	After discharge, on 27 November 2013, she was regularly reviewed until being unable to attend her last clinical appointment on 12 February 2015. The last clinical review was on 20 November 2014. At the time she continued to live with her daughter and grandson. She did not feel confident of being able to live alone again. She had ongoing issues with mood and behaviour although she was able to self-regulate to a greater extent. She continued to have difficulty with short term memory, for which she was using various memory strategies. She continued to avail herself of counselling support from a local practitioner, and at around the time of the legal proceedings, she had increased emotional distress. She continued to need the support of her daughter for completing domestic chores, and she took longer than previously to complete her personal care. She also had neuropathic pain and altered sensation on the right side of her face, and was on medication for that as well as remaining on medication prescribed for her mood. The report concludes:
	


“In summary, (Mrs TW) suffered a very severe traumatic brain injury (based on initial Glasgow scale score, CT scan findings and PTA duration). While she has made a reasonable recovery, she continues to suffer from ongoing issues outlined above. The most significant impact of this event has been her loss of independence and changed family relationship dynamics. At 18 months post injury she has made most of her recovery. Although some improvements may be expected in the next 6 months, given the severity of her TPA, some of the above impairments are likely to be permanent.”


	
	A Victim Impact Statement by Mrs TW was provided to the court. The victim had required some assistance from her sister in order to prepare the Victim Impact Statement.
	
	
	She refers to herself as before the accident having been very independent and full of life, that she reared her daughter by herself and sometimes worked two different jobs to make sure they did not go without.
	
	
	At the time of the offence, she said she was working as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer at Bankstown Community Resource Centre for two years and felt good about herself and the work she was doing in the community. She liked her job and the people she worked with, and she now missed that as she cannot work anymore as a result of the offender‘s conduct. She also worked as a weekend relief manager for Aboriginal Hostels Limited. She had also looked after her grandson, YW, while her daughter worked, training as a chef. She said that they had been doing “real good and everything was starting to pick up for us”. As a result of the impact of the offences on her, the domestic situation had of necessity changed. Her daughter was unable to work anymore, because she now needed to work full time in looking after the victim and also her child. She said that the right side of her face aches because of the metal plate under her eye and the area around her top lip goes numb. She also notes that at times she cannot control what she says, and that she has blurted out some nasty things to members of her family. She said she was not nervous before, but she now did not trust anyone outside her own family. In particular, she did not trust males, with the exception of members of her own family. Her daughter now had to do all of the cleaning and cooking. She herself could only cope with a quick shopping trip to the local area and she no longer went out with her friends.
	
	
	Before the offences were committed, she had not needed tablets for anything but said that she was fit and healthy, leading a very active lifestyle. She now has to take medication every day, and she was still attending appointments with a psychologist and brain injury doctor, as well as seeing a counsellor as of 20 February 2015.
	
	
	Considering the nature of the assaults and the injuries caused, I have no difficulty in accepting the victim’s Impact Statement as being an accurate reflection of the significantly adverse effects that the offender’s conduct has had on Mrs TW.
	
	
	The Court has also been provided with a Victim Impact Statement in respect of the child who was also a victim, YW. The statement was in fact made by the child’s mother, Ms TW. It indicates that the child is autistic. The content of the Victim Impact Statement refers to the child as having autism and a mild developmental delay. While the document purports to be a Victim Impact Statement, it contains in effect no further information in respect of the child or any effect that the offences may have had on the child. There is no information before the Court as to the child’s degree of autism or as to how his presence during the course of this conduct, including having a knife presented at his throat by his father, may have impacted on him, if it impacted at all.
	
	
	I note in respect of the child that at least at the time when the police were able to obtain access and the offender having been arrested, the child was then observed to be in a distressed state and hiding his head under a pillow. Clearly, the events had some impact but the extent of that impact and its duration is not information before the Court.
	
	
	The Victim Impact Statement by Ms TW on behalf of her son is in reality not a Victim Impact Statement. Almost the entire content relates to the effect on Ms TW, who was not a primary victim, including the effect on her as a result of the significant changes to her mother which have had adversely impacted on the domestic situation.
	
	
	As pointed out to counsel when the Victim Impact Statement was tendered, the Victim Impact Statement in my view does not come within the provisions with respect to such statements as provided by s 30 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, the document was tendered by consent, and after the issue as to its admissibility had been raised by me, Mr Winch, counsel, on behalf of the offender, submitted the Court should limit what it drew from the statement as to the impact on the child’s life as a result of the overall impact on the family as a result of the offences..
	
	
	He further submitted that the Court could not use the impact on Ms TW as an aggravating factor with regard to s 28, in those circumstances. I accept that submission as correct, and will limit the use of the Victim Impact Statement as submitted.
	
	
	In respect of the impact on Mrs TW, as previously noted, the impact has been substantial, and is continuing, at least in respect of the sequelae as a result of the traumatic brain injury. While her injuries are not the only factor to be taken into account in respect of the sentence to be imposed for the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, it is a very significant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296.
	
	
	In AM v R, Johnson J set out some of the other applicable sentencing principles relevant to an offence contrary to s 33, and noted;
	


“The absence of planning and premeditation is relevant to objective gravity, although this feature may be diminished (as a factor favouring the offender) given the requisite intention of a s 33 offence: R v Zamagias at (14). This is expressly so where the attack is sustained and there are opportunities for the offender to desist from the attack but he does not do so: R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 151 at (17). Likewise, where the offender does not voluntarily end the attack, but it is necessary for another person to pull him away to protect the victim: R v Zamagias at (13); R v Mitchell at 101 (28).

The fact that a s 33 offence involves an unprovoked, uncalled for and unjustified attack elevates the subjective gravity: Matzick v R [2007] NSWCCA 92 at (23). An attack upon an innocent citizen who is going about his ordinary business is a crime of increased seriousness: R v Woods (NSW 9 October 1990 Lee CJ at CL Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ unreported).”


	
	All of those principles referred to by Johnson J are apposite to the current matter. In addition, this was a persistent attack involving escalating violence on a deteriorating victim, which increases its objective seriousness. Ashe v R [2010] VSCA 119; AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 at 78.
	
	
	In addition, this was a matter involving domestic violence.
	
	
	In determining the sentence in respect of this offence, the Court is required to remain mindful of both the maximum sentences and the standard non-parole period, as they remain guideposts. It is well recognised that a standard non-parole period may be more significant where there is little that operates in an offender’s favour by way of mitigation; R v Tuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at 49.
	
	
	I have referred to the injuries suffered by Mrs TW, which are summarised as wounds, fractures, and a traumatic brain injury: her brain injury resulting in significant impairments, diminishing the quality of her life, and likely to be permanent. I accept the Crown’s submission in respect of this offence: that it falls at the upper end of the midrange of objective seriousness for offences of this type.
	
	
	There are also a number of aspects that increase its objective seriousness:
	


1.   The assault on the victim was sustained over the course of at least one and a half hours.

2.   The offender struck the victim to the head and face.

3.   The assault occurred in her home while she was going about her ordinary everyday life.

4.   The assault occurred, at least in part, in the presence of her grandson, who was then 4 years of age.

5.   The victim was kicked after she fell to the floor.

6.   During the assault the offender threatened to kill the victim on multiple occasions.

7.   He armed himself with a knife during the course of the assault, which he both presented at her and used as part of a threat to kill her.

8.   Although he ceased assaulting the victim on a number of occasions, he subsequently recommenced the assaults.

9.   There was a significant degree of gratuitous violence.

10.   The assault also constituted a serious example of domestic violence, the offender and the victim having previously resided together for an approximately two year period.


	
	Those matters also contribute to the finding as properly characterised as being at the high end of midrange of objective seriousness. In respect of this offence, there is nothing that operates in the favour of the offender, and for that reason, the standard non-parole period has a greater significance in the sentencing exercise.
	


AGGRAVATED DETAIN FOR ADVANTAGE


	
	The aggravation is assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	Latham J in R v Allen [2010] NSWCCA 47 at 20, made the following apposite observations:
	


“A combination of factors relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence under s 86 of the Crimes Act were identified by this Court in R v Collett and Robson (NSWCCA, unreported, 7 June 1979), per Roden J, as the duration of the detention, the extent of fear or terror occasioned, the manner of treatment and what is demanded of the victim by the offender, the purpose of the detention, and the extent (if any) to which third parties were subjected to ordeal or anguish by reason of fear for the welfare of the victim.”


	
	The circumstance of aggravation is the infliction of actual bodily harm, which has a comparatively low threshold. The injuries referred to here were serious ones. The period of detention from the time of arrival of Mr GS and until the incident was terminated was approximately an hour and a half. The incident, however, had commenced at an earlier unknown point in time in the back yard of the premises.
	
	
	During the time of the detention, the victim was periodically assaulted, each assault involving gratuitous violence on a defenceless victim. During the detention, the offender also used Mrs TW as a shield, threatening to kill her in an effort to avoid being apprehended by the police.
	
	
	While the victim had post traumatic amnesia for 30 days, it is clear from the facts that she suffered a significant degree of terror during her detention, as is indicated alone by her pleas for the offender to cease and for the assistance of police. I accept on the Crown’s submission that the manner in which Mrs TW was dragged along the floor and kicked while she was on the ground and threatened reveals a manner of treatment that borders upon the sadistic. Her injuries far exceed the infliction of actual bodily harm, and I do consider them as being a factor further aggravating the offence.
	
	
	The offence was further aggravated by the fact that the victim’s grandson was present throughout the entire period of the detention, and that despite police pleas for the child to be released, he was not.
	
	
	There was at least some degree of planning in that the offender had attended at the premises in breach of the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order and in that during the course of the detention he barricaded various areas of the house with furniture, tied one of the doors shut and installed a noose. I accept that they are all indicative of some degree of planning, although it may not have preceded the commencement of the offences by any substantial period.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of detain for advantage, I accept, as submitted by the Crown, that it can properly be characterised as at the high end of the mid‑range of objective seriousness.
	


USE OFFENSIVE WEAPON WITH INTENT.


	
	The weapon was a large kitchen knife with a 20 centimetre blade, capable of causing significant injury. At one point during the stand-off with police, the offender held the knife to the victim’s throat and threatened to kill her. At another point, he began to lower the knife to the victim’s exposed throat. She sustained a wound under her chin that was “not inconsistent with Mr Barlow holding the knife to her chin/throat.” The use of the knife to deter police entry prolonged the terror that was experienced by Mrs TW, and prolonged the exposure of her grandson to the events the subject of the charges. In those circumstances, I accept the Crown’s submission that the offence of use offensive weapon also falls into the upper end of the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


ASSAULT OCCASIONING ACTUAL BODILY HARM TO GS.


	
	Mr GS was going about his ordinary life, attending the premises because he had been invited to dinner, and he only became involved with the offender in an attempt to stop the offender from committing further assaults upon the already obviously injured Mrs TW. During the course of the assault upon Mr GS, the offender armed himself with a barbeque fork and attempted to “poke” Mr GS in the face with it. After their wrestling continued onto the porch, the offender pushed Mr GS so that he fell backwards, landing on the concrete steps at the front of the home. That would appear to be most likely point at which Mr GS sustained a broken wrist.
	
	
	Mr GS’ injury did not require surgery and was managed conservatively. There is no information before the Court as to any sequelae, and there is no Victim Impact Statement from Mr GS. It would appear most likely that the injury was sustained when Mr GS, as a result of the push, fell backwards and landed on the concrete steps. I accept the Crown’s submission that the offence can be regarded as falling at or about the mid‑range of objective seriousness for offences of this type.
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS.


	
	At the time of the offence, the offender was 22 years of age. He is now 24 years of age. The offender did not give evidence on sentence. Subjective matters are drawn from the following material: his criminal history, a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 21 September 2013, a report of Mr Patrick Sheehan, a psychologist with the firm Big Picture Psychology, dated 14 February 2015.
	
	
	The offender is an indigenous person. He was one of five children to his parents; he was born in Walcha, but grew up “all over the place”. His parents separated when he was young and he did not meet his father until he was approximately 16 years of age, which was after his mother was released from a period of imprisonment, his mother having apparently been incarcerated when he was approximately one year of age as a result of what is said to be a charge of murder. He was looked after by his maternal grandfather, while his siblings went into what is referred to as “welfare” and were later placed in foster care with various relatives.
	
	
	He attended several primary schools in the country and left school either in Year 8 or in Year 9. He is not certain of what school year he left in but was certain that he had not commenced Year 10.
	
	
	His grandfather died when he was approximately 14 years of age, and he resided with an aunt until he was approximately 16 years old, when his mother was released from custody. He then lived with her. He informed the psychologist that she “likes to have a drink every now and then”, and that she had no subsequent problems with the law and was generally stable.
	
	
	When he was 18 years of age, his father, who had also been serving a term of imprisonment, was released and came to reside with the family. According to the offender’s assessment, his father was bipolar and a bad alcoholic who was aggressive when intoxicated and would engage in bouts of violence until such time as the offender defeated him in a fist fight. As to all of his siblings, they are said to all be doing well and have not turned to crime.
	
	
	He stated that after changing primary school at one time that he had then taken up at the new school with a population of indigenous children who did not apply themselves to study or homework, and that he followed that example. He was apparently never suspended or truanted. When in high school, he was placed in a special class which he claims had no syllabus and the students were generally permitted to watch movies instead of focussing on learning. He is able to read with comprehension but is halting in his reading.
	
	
	Since leaving school, he has never been employed. His period of residence with his grandfather was interrupted after the age of 11, due to a number of periods in Juvenile Detention facilities. He informed Dr Nielssen that he did not usually drink alcohol, having observed the adverse effects on others, but that he, however, “self‑medicated” with cannabis from around the age of 12, and smoked the drug constantly whenever he was at liberty. He had also apparently used methamphetamine and the opiate medication, OxyContin, until he had met Ms TW, when he said that he stopped using those drugs during that relationship. (As previously indicated, he resided for approximately a two year period with Ms TW and Mrs TW and his autistic son.)
	
	
	However, after the relationship broke‑down, he said, “I got back on it and went hard”. He did not report any use of cocaine or MDMA. I note that at the time of his consultation with the psychologist, he had been medicated with methadone approximately half an hour before the interview. The psychologist, on testing, indicated that there was a significant difference between the offender’s verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning skills. His verbal intellectual skills were said to be on the cusp of the low/average to average range and his perceptual reasoning and intellectual skills were said to be in the upper end of the average range. The psychologist stated that:
	


“Mr Barlow may function above the level suggested by his presentation, particularly given that he was dosed on methadone immediately prior to testing and the testing environment was suboptimal (hot room, lawnmower operating nearby).”


	
	In respect of Dr Olav Nielssen’s report, I note first of all, that the report was for the primary purpose of determining whether he was fit for trial. The final paragraph reads:
	


“A limitation of this report is that it is based on a single interview without witness statements, medical records or other corroborative information about Mr Barlow’s upbringing and mental state around the time of the offences.”


	
	Dr Nielssen’s report is dated 21 September 2013, and there is no updated report. Dr Nielssen’s report, in those circumstances, must be regarded as having some limitations, as conceded by him.
	
	
	In respect of the offence itself, the offender claimed that he had no memory of the events. He said, “I don’t know what I am going to plead...I can’t even remember what I did”. When asked to explain the background of the offences, he said:
	


“All I remember is coming back to Sydney...I got in touch with my girlfriend...She came for a night and left...I tried to see my son and she (Ms TW) would not let me in...I slept outside...She still would not let me in.”


	
	He said, “I went back to town and got a handful of pills and had something to drink...It was the first time I took them and I don’t normally drink”. He said:
	


“I just remember going to the park with my mum...I was drinking red wine...One of the boys came and had pills on him...I was feeling depressed so I took some.”


	
	He said that the tablets were the potent anxiety relieving sedative, Alprazolam (Xanax). He said that he did not remember how many tablets he took but said, “It was a handful...Close to ten, maybe”. He said that he did not remember how much wine he consumed that day. He said that he was at Mawson’s Park at Campbelltown and had no memory of travelling to his former partner’s family house in Kensington Street, Punchbowl, and had no memory of threatening to kill Mrs TW. He said:
	


“I used to stay with them until my son passed away...They are way different...When I met her daughter, I left the gang life and stopped dealing and started cleaning...I don’t even know why they treated me this way...I did everything for them.”


	
	He confirmed that Ms TW had taken out an Apprehended Violence Order against him. He said, “They’ve treated me like shit and I’ve ended up losing it”. He said he had no memory of being Tasered by the police. He said, “I just remember waking up in the cells at Surry Hills”. It is noted from that report that he claimed to be affected by alcohol and Xanax. He claimed to Dr Nielssen that he had not taken anxiety relieving sedatives such as Xanax until the day of the offence.
	
	
	When seen by Mr Sheehan on 11 February 2015, he again claimed not to remember anything of the offences, and claimed that he was heavily using methylamphetamine and buprenorphine for some months up to his arrest and that on the day of the offences, he was affected by a combination of alcohol, methylamphetamine, cannabis and a number of benzodiazepine tablets. That is contrary to the report of Dr Nielssen where he only referred to alcohol and Xanax. As to the quantity of alcohol, he informed the psychologist that he had consumed a bottle of red wine prior to the offences. As indicated, the offender’s claim of alcohol and drug use at the time of the offences has escalated over time, as the sentence approached. There is no independent evidence that confirms that he was affected at the time by alcohol or drugs. Considering the period of time and the reference to one bottle of red wine, taken some time before going to the premises and the duration of the events, it would not appear that alcohol would have been a significant contributing factor in his offending, nor does Xanax, if taken, provide any excuse for his conduct. Dr Nielssen reports that although the offender stated that he had been previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with an anti‑psychotic medication, Seroquel, while in Juvenile Justice, but at the time of these offences, he did not report any recent symptoms of psychosis and there were no objective features of chronic mental illness evident during Dr Nielssen’s interview with him. Dr Nielssen expressed the following:
	


“Mr Barlow reported, at the time of the offence, he was affected by a combination of a quantity of wine and as many as ten tablets of Alprazolam, which is an anxiety relieving sedative that reduces inhibition and also affects memory formation. The combination of alcohol and benzodiazepine medication can have an additive affect that increases the intoxicating effect of both drugs.”


	
	I note of course that that is phrased as being a possibility of “an additive affect”. As I have previously indicated in respect of Dr Nielssen’s report, it was based on a single interview without witness statements, medical reports or any other corroborative information about Mr Barlow’s upbringing and mental state around the time of the offences.
	
	
	In any event, I note that pursuant to s 21A (5A)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the offender’s self-induced intoxication cannot be taken into account as a mitigating factor, if he was in fact intoxicated. To the extent that his cognition may have been in any way reduced, it was not such as to deprive him of the capacity to form the requisite intent necessary for the offence contrary to s 33 or 33B(1) of the Crimes Act as is implicit in the plea of guilty.
	
	
	As noted by the Crown, there are a number of aspects of the facts which are inconsistent with an assertion that the offender was heavily intoxicated by alcohol or drugs, including:
	


1. The offender’s placement of the furniture around the premises prohibiting police access.

2. The offender’s use of a rope to secure a door to prevent police access.

3. The offender having sufficient situational awareness to place the knife down when a firearm was finally drawn by one of the police officers and pointed at him.

4. His dialogue with police in connection with contacting his partner.


	
	Where there is voluntary ingestion of drugs or alcohol prior to offending conduct it may serve to aggravate the offence rather than to operate in mitigation, as stated in Mendez v R [2012] NSWCCA 103 at para 75. I note in that respect that I have difficulty in accepting that the offender, in relation to what he has said to either Dr Nielssen or to Mr Sheehan, was being truthful in the absence of any sworn evidence and cross-examination. In that regard, it might be said that those assertions, having made that statement, neither assist him nor hurt him on sentence.
	
	
	Before turning to the offender’s criminal history, I note that the psychologist, Mr Sheehan, on the offender’s medical and psychiatric history stated that he had no medical history of significance, although Mr Barlow had stated that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia while in a juvenile justice facility and treated with an antipsychotic medication, but this was after he had been engaging in heavy amphetamine use. The only psychotic symptom was paranoia, with no hallucinations, ideas of reference or thought disorder. Mr Sheehan offered the opinion that his symptoms at that time were attributable to an amphetamine binge and lack of sleep.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan stated that it was likely that he would meet the criteria for substance use disorder (moderate and impartial remission in a controlled environment) and that he otherwise met the diagnostic criteria for an antisocial personality disorder which would “appear to be attributable to his disadvantaged childhood environment where he described a collective acceptance that this approach to life was considered nominative and inevitable.” That is, a pattern of antisocial conduct, impulsivity, recklessness, irritability and aggression, irresponsibility and a failure to learn through consequences throughout adolescence and early adulthood.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen opined the following psychiatric diagnosis:
	


1. Substance dependence and abuse disorder.

2. Conduct disorder.

3. Possible learning disorder.

4. Possible drug-induced psychosis.


	
	I note the limitations of Dr Nielssen’s report, as I have previously referred to it, and also to his diagnosis involving learning disorder and drug-induced psychosis as being referred to as “quite possible” and that there is no further relevant information.
	
	
	The offender has a significant and lengthy criminal history. I quote the summary of that history as provided by Mr Sheehan:
	


“Mr Barlow’s criminal history/bail report reveals an extensive history of mostly petty crime commencing from 2002 at the age of 11 years, and there are court dates for every year thereafter. The charges are mostly contained to personal violence (including domestic violence) and property theft or damage. I note many breaches of conditional liberty. Most of his convictions have been dealt with by way of bonds, supervision or control orders with a few custodial sentences not exceeding one year.

Mr Barlow recently incurred a conviction for reckless wounding (15 July 2014) for which he is currently serving a total sentence of two years. During the interview he stated that this was in relation to a knife wound sustained by an associate in Moree. However he stated that he was not guilty and that the wound was not caused by him. This was during the period of chaotic drug use and emotional distress preceding his index offence.”


	
	With the exception of the expression of Mr Sheehan’s understanding of the reckless wounding offence, his summary is a reasonably accurate reflection of the offender’s past criminal history.
	
	
	I will refer to the types of offences, noting in advance that I will endeavour to avoid repeating offences of the same type where the record contains a repeated offence.
	
	
	In the Children’s Court in 2004 he was dealt with for a number of offences including destroy or damage property; throw or release etcetera object or substance to damage property, enter prescribed premises of any person without lawful excuse. In 2005, offences of: shoplifting, possess ammunition without holding licence, permit or authority, enter enclosed lands, receive, dispose of stolen property, be carried in a conveyance, break and enter building, steal value less than $15,000. In 2006, he was charged and subsequently dealt with in 2007 for offences of: common assault, steal property in dwelling house, enter building/land with intent to commit indictable offence. In 2008: behave in an offensive manner in or near a public place or school. I have missed some offences. In 2007, destroy or damage property, three counts of larceny and possess implements to enter/drive conveyance, enter vehicle or boat without consent of owner/occupier, two counts of common assault, a further enclosed land not prescribed premises, entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse. In 2008, as previously stated, behave in an offensive manner in or near a public place or school, be carried in conveyance taken without consent of the owner. In 2009, goods in personal custody suspected of being stolen, stalk, intimidate intend fear of physical or mental harm. In 2011, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2013, he was dealt with for offences committed in 2012: common assault, contravene a prohibition/restriction in an AVO, destroy/damage property, more than one count, and two further counts of contravene a prohibition/restriction in an AVO. (I note that I may need to correct some of those references to criminal offences as a result of the confusing way in which criminal records are now provided to the Court.)
	
	
	In any event, what the record shows is a continuing contempt for the law and, indeed, the extent that the offender has on occasions failed to comply with the conditions of his release and has been called up in relation to offences even where he has had the benefit of s 12 suspensions.
	
	
	As previously referred to, one of the offences in relation to which he was on bail at the time of this offending was the offence of reckless wounding. The fact sheet in respect of that matter has been provided as Exhibit 3. It is the offence that I previously referred to as having been referred to in Mr Sheehan’s report with the particular version given to him by the offender. The facts to which he had pleaded are apparently that there was on 23 June 2013 a fight between unknown persons at which a large number of persons had gathered at Moree. A person was being set upon by the offender and a co-offender, or co‑accused. The victim intervened to attempt to assist the person being set upon, who was his cousin. This offender approached the victim and stabbed at him with a yellow and black handled screwdriver, which pierced his neck causing a small laceration to the left side. I note that it appears to be in respect of that matter, although it is difficult to tell from Mr Sheehan’s report because it refers to a date of 15 July 2014, that it was in relation to a knife wound sustained, in respect of which the offender was not guilty.
	
	
	In any event, the relevance of the previous offence is only that the offence that he was on conditional liberty in respect of was an offence in relation to the infliction of a wound with an implement.
	
	
	I am not sentencing him in respect of that matter. He has already been sentenced for that matter, but it is of some significance that within a period of approximately two months of the commission of the reckless wounding offence, and while on bail, that he committed these offences.
	


Mr Tuckey, is there some matter in relation to that?

TUCKEY: I think to clarify that, I think Mr Barlow was convicted after a hearing at Moree.

HIS HONOUR: After hearing?

TUCKEY: Yes, and the way--

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, the criminal record doesn’t indicate whether it’s been a hearing or not, but I will take that in--

TUCKEY: I don’t think it causes a problem because of the way your Honour said that he’s going to use it, but I’m not sure if that was the--

HIS HONOUR: I will correct that.

TUCKEY: Yes, I’m not sure on what basis the magistrate sentenced there, but that was the allegation.

HIS HONOUR: There is a long line of authority that the commission of offences while on bail is a serious aggravating factor as expressed in R v Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464 by Street CJ at 465: The protection of the community from those who abuse their liberty on bail to commit further offences calls for ‘severely deterrent sentences’, which would ordinarily involve a significant accumulation of the sentence for any subsequent offences on top of the sentence to be passed, or passed for the original offence.


	
	For the purpose of sentencing, the Court must have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and must take account of the aggravating factors and mitigating factors as outlined in s 21A(1) and (3) of that Act as are present, and any other relevant factor.
	
	
	Any sentence imposed must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and ensure that any time spent in custody by the offender reflects all of the circumstances of the offence, including the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence, as well as meeting the fundamental purpose of punishment: that is, the protection of society.
	
	
	In this matter both specific deterrence and general deterrence are significant factors to take into account.
	
	
	I am satisfied pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. So much has been appropriately conceded by Mr Winch, counsel for the offender, on sentence.
	
	
	I intend to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence and I am required in those circumstances to state indicative sentences for each of the individual offences.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the indicative sentence is two years. In respect of the offence of use offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful detention, the indicative sentence is three years six months. In respect of the offence of aggravated detain for advantage, the aggravation being actual bodily harm, the indicative sentence is four years and six months.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of cause GBH with intent to cause GBH, and taking into account the Form 1 offence, the indicative sentence is seven years, it being a standard non-parole period offence, the indicative non-parole period is one of five years, that is, three months less than the statutory relationship, as, if I were imposing separate sentences, I would have needed to take into account a degree of accumulation between each of the individual four offences and the totality of the sentence, and also the fact that the offender is currently serving a sentence in respect of which he has already served the 18 months non-parole period provided. That is the sole basis for finding special circumstances.
	
	
	In determining the aggregate sentence, I have had regard to the fact that the offender is already serving a sentence. In R v Callaghan, [2006] NSWCCA 58, Simpson J indicated that in circumstances such as this, the Court has a discretion to backdate sentences to be imposed where there is already an imposed sentence to be entirely concurrent, partially concurrent or entirely accumulated on the past sentence imposed.
	
	
	In this matter, I will backdate the aggregate sentence to be imposed to commence one year after the commencement of the sentence he received for the offence of reckless wounding.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence is seven years and nine months.
	
	
	The non-parole period will be five years and six months, commencing on 19 August 2014. He will be eligible for parole on 18 February 2020.
	
	
	For the benefit of the parties I will indicate that that represents a reduction to the statutory relationship of some three months and 23 days of the overall sentence, taken into account with the sentence that he is already serving.
	
	
	The balance of the sentence is two years and three months, commencing on 19 February 2020, it will expire on 18 May 2022.
	


Has anyone missed any dates, or want a repetition?

Mr Barlow, that means that you will be first eligible for parole now on 18 February 2020. Whether you are released on that date will entirely depend on your conduct while in custody. As you would be aware from your previous history/ if, when released on parole at whatever time, you fail to abide by the conditions of parole you will no doubt be returned to custody.

For the benefit of counsel, I will just indicate to you that taking into account the time at which he commenced to serve the sentence for the reckless wounding, the total term is one of some eight years and nine months; that is, the seven years and nine months added to the one year of that sentence, and the non-parole period would accordingly be six years and six months of that total term, although the period for these offences is five years and six months.

There is, I think, something in the vicinity of a 21 day reduction from the statutory relationship to provide for what is in effect, including the previous sentence, eight years and nine months with a six year and six months non-parole period. If you do not follow, I will happily explain it.

TUCKEY: I follow, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, are there any matters that I have omitted or misstated?

BRYAN: Yes, your Honour, there is on the s 166 certificate an offence of contravene Apprehended Domestic Violence Order.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

BRYAN: That’s the first matter, your Honour, and in relation to the second matter--

HIS HONOUR: Well, I haven’t misstated that because it’s on the s166 certificate.

BRYAN: Yes, your Honour, I understood from--

HIS HONOUR: I could refer it back to the Local Court. However I’ll deal with it, yes.

BRYAN: Thank you, your Honour, and just while your Honour is doing that, there is just a brief second matter. I notice that there are some people up at the back of the court taking notes. I just seek a non‑publication order in relation to the child, YW.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, certainly.

I will make a non‑publication order in respect of the child, YW.

Madam Crown, it would seem to me that unless I also suppressed the victim and the child’s mother’s names, suppressing his name would have no utility.

BRYAN: Yes, your Honour, I would agree with that.

TUCKEY: No objection.

HIS HONOUR: I will also suppress the publication of the names of Mrs TW and Ms TW.


	
	In respect of the offence contained on the s166 certificate, being contravening an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order, noting that he has a number of previous convictions in respect of such offences, I will indicate a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 19 August 2014.
	


SENTENCE CORRECTION 17 APRIL 2015


	
	I apologise to the parties and to Mr Barlow for having to bring him back. The reason for returning to the matter today is that on the last occasion I was not delivering my reasons from a prewritten document, and there were a number of matters I had intended to advert to but did not in fact advert to. I am uncertain as to whether I referred - when indicating the indicative sentence for the offence of cause grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Mrs TW- as to whether I stated I had taken into account the offence on the Form 1 of intentionally damage property. For the record, I make it clear that I had in fact done so, so that automatically as a result of that, it was taken into account in relation to the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Secondly, I did not address the issue of remorse and contrition. In that regard, the offender did not give evidence on sentence. All that is before me, in effect, from which any conclusion can be drawn, is the report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, and the report of Mr Patrick Sheehan, psychologist. I am unable to detect in the report of Dr Nielssen, dated 21 September 2013, any significant indication of remorse or contrition. I note however that is entirely unsurprising since the report that was prepared by Dr  Nielssen was prepared for the purpose of determining whether the offender was fit for trial or not. In those circumstances, it is not surprising there is no clear mention of remorse or contrition having been expressed during Dr Nielssen’s consultation with him.
	
	
	In the psychological report, the following is recorded on p 10:
	


“Mr Barlow stated that when he read the facts, he felt bad. He didn’t know that he was capable of such actions. He stated that he was sorry. He said his actions would have devastated everyone involved and hoped that the victim would make a full recovery. Mr Barlow’s current attitude to the offence marks an improvement from those detailed in a previous psychiatric assessment (Nielssen, 21 September 2013) where he seemed to express ongoing anger towards the family and took minimal responsibility.”


	
	There is at least from that passage some indication that the offender regrets and is remorseful for his conduct. I accept that with reflection the offender has expressed remorse for his conduct, involving as it did the victim, Mrs TW, the grandmother of his child, and also his autistic son.
	
	
	Reference was made in Mr Lynch’s submissions on behalf of the offender to the case of Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 and the principles that arise from that case. This offender was not raised in some isolated community but largely in the township of Moree. He informed the psychologist that his grandfather, with whom he had lived for a period, did not drink alcohol and tried to set some boundaries. There is no acceptable evidence the offender’s grandfather engaged in regular violent conduct during the offender’s formative years. He at least attended school until Year 8, and in relation to the remainder of his family, that is his siblings, they were raised in substantially different circumstances and had apparently not engaged in any criminal conduct. The evidence before the Court does not make this a case in which one can say clearly the Fernando principles apply. I accept his childhood and adolescence were characterised by misfortune and the lack of a stable home. The significant contributing factor to his adolescence was his separation from his parents when he was an infant, that is, initially from his father and then subsequently from his mother.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen opines that the offender has suffered from a conduct disorder, which he states:
	


“… would appear to be the effect of a particularly severe form of intergenerational neglect and substance use which led to the separation of his parents when he was an infant, the separation from his mother soon afterwards, being fostered by substance using grandparents, his mother’s extended family, and being effectively homeless and having to care for himself from early adolescence.”


	
	I have already noted what is said in the psychologist’s report as to his grandfather, which appears to be somewhat in conflict with what Dr Nielssen was informed.
	
	
	The psychologist found he satisfied the criteria for substance use disorder and also for antisocial personality disorder, which he opined was:
	


“To a large extent the development of his personality pathology would appear to be attributable to his disadvantaged childhood environment where he described a collective acceptance of this approach to life was considered normative and inevitable.”


	
	Even though I have said I do not find the principles referred to in Fernando to apply, there is however a significantly disadvantaged upbringing, as referred to in those reports. I accept that is a matter that must be reflected by the sentence and I have in fact reflected those reports in determining the sentences already indicated.
	
	
	The other matter I omitted to refer to was the question of rehabilitation and the prospect of reoffending. The offender has a significant ongoing criminal history commencing as a juvenile and continuing on a regular basis up until committing these offences. He has regularly been called up for breaches of orders made in the past. Although orders have been made requiring some form of assistance in the community, there is no evidence of any improvement at any time in the offender’s general conduct.
	
	
	As to rehabilitation, the psychological report of Mr Sheehan states as follows under the heading, “Summary Opinion and Recommendations”:
	


“Until Mr Barlow develops some sort of vision and belief, and is living a more functional life, interventions and punishment may have limited effect in altering his behaviour.”


	
	In the light of his past offending and the serious nature of these offences it cannot be accepted there is a good prospect of rehabilitation. That is not to say there is no prospect of rehabilitation, and in that regard I particularly take note of the offender now being 24 years of age, and he is now to serve a significant sentence, a period of custody which may well assist him in taking stock of his life and making a determination to take the advantage of any interventions in the future, and to live what is referred to by the psychologist as “a more functional life”.
	
	
	I have previously referred to special circumstances in imposing in particular the aggregate sentence, as having taken into account as a special circumstance the total period of custody including the period he was already sentenced to serve in respect of an earlier offence. The non-parole period in respect of the aggregate sentence, taking into account the earlier sentence, was reduced to make the overall sentence more accord with the statutory relationship.
	
	
	I have already indicated I did not otherwise find special circumstances applicable in this matter. I particularly take into account the length of the parole period I have already specified, being some two years and three months. That is a substantial period of parole, and to have further reduced the non‑parole period provided in the aggregate sentence would have been to fail to reflect the seriousness of these offences.
	
	
	I should also indicate that Mr Lynch, on behalf of the offender, argued the Court should accept the purpose of the offender’s attendance at the premises was to recover his child, if “recover” is the right word. It may indeed be the original cause for his attending at the premises but it is evident that shortly thereafter his attendance became for the purpose of seeking some form of retribution in respect of the victim, Mrs TW, through violence. His degree of hatred for her was clearly indicated not just by his physical conduct but by some of the statements he made during the course of the offending behaviour, such as, “The bitch is dead”, “This cunt’s going to die”, “She fucked my life”, and similar comments. Whatever may have been the original trigger for his attendance and contravention of the Apprehended Violence Order, his continued attendance at the premises was, as I have said, in my view, to obtain some form of retribution in respect of the victim, Mrs TW, who he appears to have blamed for what had gone wrong in his life in recent times.

Smythe v. The King, [1941] SCR 17

Date: 1940-11-04

Gordon C. Smythe

Appellant;

And

His Majesty The King

Respondent.

1940: Oct. 28. Nov. 4.

Present:-Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket,
Davis, Kerwin, Hudson and Tasehereau JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Trial-Murder—Plea of insanity—Charge to
Jury-Evidence—""Beyond all reasonable doubt"" or ""to the
reasonable satisfaction of the jury.""

On a trial for murder, where a plea of insanity is advanced,
the law does not require the accused, in order to succeed upon that issue, to
satisfy the jury that insanity has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt; it
is sufficient in point of law if insanity is proved to the reasonable
satisfaction of the jury.

Clark v. The King (61 Can. S.C.R. 608) approved.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal
side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant on an
indictment for murder.

The appellant, being put on
trial, pleaded that he was insane when the crime was committed. Subject to this
defence, the crime was proved.

The trial judge, in
charging the jury, instructed them in the following terms: ""The whole
burden of proving insanity rests upon the defence, just as the whole burden of
proving guilt rests upon the Crown. Every man is presumed to be sane and
responsible for his acts until he, in defence of himself, proves the
contrary.""

D. Gillmor K.C. for the appellant. 

J. W. Long K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—It was
settled by the decision of this Court in Clark v. The King[1], that where a plea
of insanity is advanced on a trial for murder the law does not require the
accused, in order to succeed upon that issue, to satisfy the jury that insanity
has been proved beyond

[Page 18]

all reasonable doubt; it is
sufficient in point of law if insanity is proved to the reasonable satisfaction
of the jury.

The law, for reasons of
policy which are well understood, draws a distinction as to the sufficiency of
the evidence required to establish the
affirmative of the issue of guilt or innocence in criminal proceedings, and
that which is generally required as the basis of decision in civil cases. Mr.
Best in his instructive work (as it is described by Willes J., in Cooper v.
Slade[2],
12th ed.) says at p. 82:— 

There is a strong and marked difference as to the effect of
evidence in civil and criminal proceedings. In the former, a mere preponderance
of probability, due regard being had to the burden of proof, is a sufficient
basis of decision; but in the Latter, especially when the offence charged
amounts to treason or felony, a much higher degree of assurance is required.
The serious consequences of an erroneous condemnation, both to the accused and
society, the immeasurably greater evils which flow from it than from an
erroneous acquittal, have induced the laws of every wise and civilized nation
to lay down the principle, though often lost sight of in practice, that the
persuasion of guilt ought to amount to a moral certainty; or as an eminent
judge (Parke, B.) expressed it, ""Such a moral certainty as
convinces the minds of the tribunal, as reasonable men, beyond all reasonable
doubt.""

It is the rule that prevails
generally in civil cases, as this Court decided in the case above mentioned,
which governs the jury in determining the issue raised by a plea of insanity.

The learned trial judge in
charging the jury used language which, with the greatest possible respect, I
think was calculated to confuse them as to this important point of the
sufficiency of evidence in relation to the issue of insanity. They may very
well have got the impression that the existence of insanity must be
demonstrated in the sense in which the guilt of an accused must be established
beyond reasonable doubt.

Such being the case, the
verdict ought not to be permitted to stand and there should be a new trial.

Appeal allowed and a new
trial ordered.

on appeal from the court of appeal for new brunswick

                    Criminal
law — Interim release — Appeals — Appeal judge dismissing application for
release pending appeal because applicant failed to establish that detention
“not necessary in the public interest” under s. 679(3) (c) of Criminal Code 
— Principles and policy considerations by which appellate courts should be
guided in deciding whether someone convicted of serious crime and sentenced to
lengthy term of imprisonment should be released on bail pending determination
of appeal — Proper interpretation and application of s. 679(3) (c) of
Criminal Code  — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 679(3) (c).

                    Criminal
law — Interim release — Review hearing — Standard of review — Appeal judge
dismissing application for release pending appeal — Chief Justice of Court of
Appeal directing review of dismissal decision by three‑judge panel under s. 680(1) 
of Criminal Code  — Test to be applied by Chief Justice in deciding whether to
direct panel review — Standard of review to be applied by reviewing panel —
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 680(1) .

                    Appeals
— Mootness — Application for release pending appeal dismissed — Appeal against
conviction subsequently allowed and new trial ordered — Accused released
pending re‑trial — Appeal from decision refusing bail pending
determination of appeal rendered moot — Whether Court should exercise
discretion to hear appeal.

                    O
applied for release pending the determination of his appeal against conviction
on a charge of second degree murder involving the death of his father. His application
was denied under the third criterion set out in s. 679(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code , which requires the applicant to establish that “his detention is not
necessary in the public interest”. While public safety was not in issue in this
case, the appeal judge was not persuaded that public confidence would be
maintained if O were to be released. Accordingly, he dismissed O’s application.
A review of that decision by a three‑judge panel, as directed by the
Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal under s. 680(1)  of the Criminal
Code , was unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal later allowed O’s appeal
from conviction and ordered a new trial. Because he was then released
pending his re‑trial, O’s appeal of the review panel’s decision to this
Court was rendered moot. However, in accordance with Borowski v. Canada
(Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, the Court determined that it would
proceed to hear the appeal on its merits because of the unanimous position
taken by the parties and interveners that guidance was needed to resolve
conflicting jurisprudence on the issue of bail pending appeal, which is otherwise
evasive of appellate review. 

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed.

                    Following
R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32, the public interest criterion
of s. 679(3) (c) of the Criminal Code  consists of two components:
public safety and public confidence in the administration of justice. The public
confidence component involves the weighing of two competing interests: enforceability
and reviewability. While the Farinacci framework has withstood the test
of time and remains good law, appellate judges continue to have difficulty
resolving the tension between enforceability and reviewability, especially in
cases like the present one, where they are faced with a serious crime on the
one hand, and a strong candidate for bail pending appeal on the other. 

                    In section 679(3)(c)
of the Criminal Code , Parliament has not provided appellate judges with
any direction as to how a bail pending appeal order is likely to affect public
confidence in the administration of justice. Fortunately, it has done so in s. 515(10) (c)
for the admittedly different but related context of bail pending trial. With
appropriate modifications, the s. 515(10) (c) factors are also instructive
in the appellate context. 

                    In
assessing public confidence under s. 515(10)(c) in the pre‑trial context,
the seriousness of the crime for which a person has been convicted plays an
important role and is determined by three factors: the gravity of the offence;
the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence; and the potential
length of imprisonment. In considering the public confidence component under s. 679(3)(c),
the seriousness of the crime should play an equal role in assessing the
enforceability interest. The remaining factor that Parliament has identified as
informing public confidence under s. 515(10)(c) is the strength of the
prosecution’s case. In the appellate context, this translates into the strength
of the grounds of appeal, which informs the reviewability interest. For this
assessment, appellate judges should examine the grounds of appeal for their
general legal plausibility and their foundation in the record to determine
whether they clearly surpass the minimal standard required to meet the “not frivolous”
criterion. 

                    When
conducting the final balancing of the factors that inform public confidence,
including the strength of the grounds of appeal, the seriousness of the
offence, public safety and flight risks, appellate judges should keep in mind
that public confidence is to be measured through the eyes of a reasonable
member of the public. This person is someone who is thoughtful, dispassionate,
informed of the circumstances of the case and respectful of society’s
fundamental values. There is no precise formula that can be applied to resolve
the balance between enforceability and reviewability. A qualitative and
contextual approach is required. Where the applicant has been convicted of
murder or some other very serious crime, the public interest in enforceability
will be high and will often outweigh the reviewability interest, particularly
where there are lingering public safety or flight concerns and/or the grounds
of appeal appear to be weak. On the other hand, where public safety or flight
concerns are negligible, and where the grounds of appeal clearly surpass the
“not frivolous” criterion, the public interest in reviewability may well
overshadow the enforceability interest, even in the case of murder or other
very serious offences.

                    A
panel review under s. 680(1)  of the Criminal Code  should be guided
by the following three principles. First, absent palpable and overriding error,
the panel must show deference to the judge’s findings of fact. Second, the panel
may intervene and substitute its decision for that of the judge where it is
satisfied that the judge erred in law or in principle, and the error was
material to the outcome. Third, in the absence of legal error, the panel may
intervene and substitute its decision for that of the judge where it concludes
that the decision was clearly unwarranted. It follows that the Chief Justice
should consider directing a review under s. 680(1)  where it is arguable
that the judge committed material errors of fact or law in arriving at the impugned
decision, or that the decision was clearly unwarranted in the circumstances.

                    In
this case, the appeal judge was satisfied that there were no appreciable public
safety or flight risk concerns and the grounds of appeal were “clearly
arguable” — meaning that they clearly surpassed the “not frivolous” criterion.
In addition, as found by the trial judge, O’s crime gravitated more toward the
offence of manslaughter than to first degree murder, which attenuated the
seriousness of the crime and hence the enforceability interest. The cumulative effect
of these considerations made O’s detention clearly unwarranted. The appeal
judge erred in law by looking for grounds of appeal that would have virtually
assured a new trial or an acquittal. The review panel erred in failing to
intervene.

I.              
Overview

[1]                             
This appeal provides the Court with an
opportunity to consider and clarify the statutory regime in the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which governs bail pending appeal. In
particular, we are concerned with the principles and policy considerations by
which appellate courts should be guided in deciding whether a person, like the
appellant Dennis James Oland, who has been convicted of a serious crime and
sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment, should be released on bail pending
the determination of his appeal against conviction. 

[2]                             
The debate in this appeal focuses on the
interpretation and application of two relatively brief provisions of the Code
— s. 679(3)  and s. 680(1) . They read as follows: 

679 . . . 

 

(3) In the case of an appeal [against conviction], the judge of the
court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the
determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that

 

(a) the appeal . . . is not frivolous;

 

(b) he will surrender himself into
custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and

 

(c) his detention is not necessary in
the public interest.

 

. . . 

 

680 (1) A decision made by a judge under section . . . 679 may, on the
direction of the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal,
be reviewed by that court and that court may, if it does not confirm the
decision,

 

(a) vary the decision; or

 

(b) substitute such other decision as, in its opinion, should have
been made.

[3]                             
In the present case, Mr. Oland applied for bail
pending appeal following his conviction on a charge of second degree murder
involving the death of his father. His application was denied under the public
interest criterion set out in s. 679(3) (c). While public safety was not in
issue, the appeal judge was not persuaded that public confidence in the
administration of justice would be maintained if Mr. Oland were to be released.
A review of that order directed by the Chief Justice of New Brunswick under s.
680(1)  proved unsuccessful. In the opinion of the three-judge review panel, the
decision of the appeal judge to detain Mr. Oland was “neither unreasonable nor
the product of any material error of fact, law or mixed law and fact” (2016
NBCA 15, 446 N.B.R. (2d) 325, at para. 15). 

[4]                             
For the reasons that follow, I am respectfully
of the view that detaining Mr. Oland on the public interest criterion was
clearly unwarranted in the circumstances. Moreover, in his reasons, the learned
appeal judge made a material legal error that affected the outcome. It follows,
in my respectful view, that the review panel erred in failing to intervene. 

[5]                             
As it turns out, prior to Mr. Oland’s appeal
being argued in this Court, the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick heard and
allowed his appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial. In consequence, Mr.
Oland was released on bail pending his re-trial. Accordingly, his appeal to
this Court from the order of the review panel upholding his detention order was
rendered moot. However, for reasons which I will explain, we chose to hear the
appeal on its merits — and having done so, we would allow the appeal but make
no further order.

II.           
Factual Background

[6]                             
On July 7, 2011, Mr. Oland’s father, Richard
Oland, was found bludgeoned to death at his office in Saint John, New
Brunswick. During the ensuing police investigation, Mr. Oland became the
primary suspect. He was eventually arrested and charged with second degree
murder on November 12, 2013. 

[7]                             
On November 18, 2013, following a contested
hearing, Mr. Oland was released on bail pending trial upon entering into a
surety recognizance in the amount of $50,000, with conditions. On December 19,
2015, after a three-month trial by judge and jury, he was convicted of second
degree murder. On February 11, 2016, the trial judge sentenced him to life
imprisonment with no chance of parole for 10 years. 

[8]                             
In his sentencing reasons, the trial judge found
that apart from the offence for which he now stood convicted, Mr. Oland was “a well-educated
47 year old husband and devoted father without a criminal past”, and “a
loving/caring man; a man at the heart of his family and a contributing member
of his community” (2016 NBQB 43, 447 N.B.R. (2d) 7, at paras. 14 and 18). In
the opinion of the trial judge, Mr. Oland posed no realistic risk of future
dangerousness and his prospect of successfully reintegrating into society after
serving his sentence was excellent. As for the offence, the trial judge
characterized it as “brutal”, noting approximately 40 blunt and sharp force
injuries inflicted to the deceased’s head. On the other hand, the crime
involved a spontaneous outburst that was the product of a long-standing
dysfunctional family dynamic and immense stress. For this reason, the trial
judge found that it fell at the “lower end” on the continuum of moral
culpability for second degree murder, closer to manslaughter than to first
degree murder. 

[9]                             
On January 20, 2016, Mr. Oland filed a notice of
appeal from conviction with the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick. He advanced
numerous grounds of appeal relating to three principal areas: errors in the
jury charge; errors in admitting certain evidence; and the reasonableness of
the verdict. At the same time, he applied under s. 679(3) of the Code for
bail pending the determination of his appeal. The outcome of that application
is the focus of this appeal. 

III.         
Decisions Below

A.           
Decision of the Appeal Judge, 2016 CanLII 7428
(Richard J.A.)

[10]                         
Mr. Oland’s application for release pending
appeal proceeded before a single judge of the Court of Appeal. In support of
his application, Mr. Oland filed numerous affidavits attesting to his good
character, past compliance with release conditions, and his roots in the
community. In addition, he filed affidavits from two family members who were
prepared to act as sureties and risk substantial sums of money should he breach
the terms of his release order. Finally, he submitted excerpts from the trial
transcripts pertinent to his grounds of appeal.

[11]                         
In ruling on the application, the appeal judge
found that Mr. Oland had discharged his onus on the first two criteria for
release under s. 679(3)(a) and (b) of the Code, namely: his appeal was
not frivolous and he would surrender into custody as required. The appeal judge
then considered the public interest criterion under s. 679(3) (c), dividing it into
two parts — public safety and public confidence in the administration of
justice. 

[12]                         
Commencing with public safety, the appeal judge
was satisfied that Mr. Oland posed “no danger to the public at large” (para.
15). In this regard, he adopted the findings of the sentencing judge that Mr.
Oland was a man of prior good behaviour, without criminal record, and that the
offence was largely the product of unique relational and situation-specific
difficulties existing between him and his father.

[13]                         
Turning to public confidence, the appeal judge
found that the gravity and brutality of the offence weighed in favour of Mr.
Oland’s detention. And while the grounds of appeal put forward by him were
“clearly arguable”, they were not of such unique strength as to “virtually assure
a new trial or an acquittal” (paras. 30 and 32). On balance, the appeal judge
was not persuaded that public confidence in the administration of justice would
be maintained if Mr. Oland were to be released. Accordingly, he dismissed the
application for release pending appeal. 

B.           
Decision of the Review Panel, 2016 NBCA 15, 446
N.B.R. (2d) 325 (Drapeau C.J. and Larlee and Quigg JJ.A.)

[14]                         
On application by Mr. Oland under s. 680(1) of
the Code, the Chief Justice of New Brunswick directed a review of his
detention order before a three-judge panel of the court. 

[15]                         
In arriving at its decision, the panel adopted a
deferential approach to the review, characterizing the appeal judge’s decision
to detain Mr. Oland as a “judgment call”. While the panel recognized that the
grounds of appeal put forward by Mr. Oland were “serious”, he nonetheless stood
convicted of a brutal murder for which he had received a mandatory life
sentence. In the circumstances, denying him bail would not render his appeal
pointless. Of primary significance, Mr. Oland had failed to show any error in
the reasons of the appeal judge that would warrant interference; nor had he persuaded
the panel that his detention in the circumstances was clearly unreasonable.
Accordingly, the application for review was dismissed.

IV.        
Analysis

A.           
Mootness

[16]                         
On October 24, 2016, the Court of Appeal of New
Brunswick allowed Mr. Oland’s appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial.
On October 25, 2016, he was granted bail pending his re-trial. In view of these
events, the parties were alerted that they should be prepared to address the
issue of mootness. 

[17]                         
At the commencement of the hearing, the Court
raised the issue of mootness and we were urged by the parties and interveners
to hear the appeal on its merits. Mr. Oland and the respondent Crown submitted
that this Court’s decision was potentially of significance to them, as Mr.
Oland might find himself in the same situation following his re-trial. In
addition, all concerned submitted that guidance was needed from this Court to
resolve inconsistent approaches to bail taken by appellate courts across the
country. And as bail pending appeal was, by its temporary nature, evasive of
appellate review, this was an appropriate case to resolve the conflicting
jurisprudence: see Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989]
1 S.C.R. 342; R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at para. 2.

[18]                         
In view of the unanimous position taken by the
parties and interveners, and considering that the appeal meets the criteria
established in Borowski, the Court determined that it would proceed to
hear the appeal on its merits. 

B.           
Bail Pending Appeal Under Section 679(3) of the
Criminal Code 

(1)          
The Three Statutory Criteria

[19]                         
The three statutory criteria for bail pending
appeal are found in s. 679(3) of the Code:

679 . . .

 

(3) In the case of an appeal [against conviction], the judge of the
court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the
determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that

 

(a) the appeal . . . is not frivolous;

 

(b) he will surrender himself into
custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and

 

(c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest.

The applicant seeking bail bears
the burden of establishing that each criterion is met on a balance of
probabilities: R. v. Ponak, [1972] 4 W.W.R. 316 (B.C.C.A.), at pp.
317-18; R. v. Iyer, 2016 ABCA 407, at para. 7 (CanLII); R. v. D’Amico,
2016 QCCA 183, at para. 10 (CanLII); R. v. Gill, 2015 SKCA 96, 465 Sask.
R. 253, at para. 14.

[20]                         
The first criterion requires the appeal judge to
examine the grounds of appeal with a view to ensuring that they are not “not
frivolous” (s. 679(3)(a)). Courts have used different language to describe this
standard. While not in issue on this appeal, the “not frivolous” test is widely
recognized as being a very low bar: see R. v. Xanthoudakis, 2016 QCCA
1809, at paras. 4-7 (CanLII); R. v. Manasseri, 2013 ONCA 647, 312 C.C.C.
(3d) 132, at para. 38; R. v. Passey, 1997 ABCA 343, 121 C.C.C. (3d) 444,
at paras. 6-8; G. T. Trotter, The Law of Bail in Canada (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)),
at pp. 10-13 to 10-15.

[21]                         
The second criterion requires the applicant to
show that “he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms
of the [release] order” (s. 679(3)(b)). The appeal judge must be satisfied that
the applicant will not flee the jurisdiction and will surrender into custody as
required. 

[22]                         
The third criterion requires the applicant to
establish that “his detention is not necessary in the public interest” (s.
679(3)(c)). It is upon this criterion that Mr. Oland’s bid for bail pending
appeal failed — and it is on this criterion that guidance from the Court is
sought. In particular, the parties ask this Court for guidance on how the
strength of the grounds of appeal from a conviction should be considered in
determining whether detention is necessary in the public interest.

(2)          
The Farinacci Approach to the Public
Interest Criterion

[23]                         
In R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d)
32 (Ont. C.A.), Arbour J.A. (as she then was) considered the meaning of the
words “public interest” in the context of s. 679(3)(c). In the course of her
careful analysis, she determined that the public interest criterion consisted
of two components: public safety and public confidence in the administration of
justice (pp. 47-48).

[24]                         
Justice Arbour did not delve into the public
safety component. She found that it related to the protection and safety of the
public and essentially tracked the familiar requirements of the so-called
“secondary ground” governing an accused’s release pending trial (pp. 45 and
47-48). The public confidence component, on the other hand, was more nuanced
and required elaboration. It involved the weighing of two competing interests:
enforceability and reviewability. 

[25]                         
According to Arbour J.A., the enforceability
interest reflected the need to respect the general rule of the immediate
enforceability of judgments. Reviewability, on the other hand, reflected
society’s acknowledgement that our justice system is not infallible and that
persons who challenge the legality of their convictions should be entitled to a
meaningful review process — one which did not require them to serve all or a
significant part of a custodial sentence only to find out on appeal that the
conviction upon which it was based was unlawful (pp. 47-49).

[26]                         
Almost a quarter of a century has passed since Farinacci
was decided. The public interest framework which it established has withstood
the test of time. It has been universally endorsed by appellate courts across
the country: see, e.g., R. v. Matteo, 2016 QCCA 2046, at para. 20
(CanLII); R. v. Sidhu, 2015 ABCA 308, 607 A.R. 395, at paras. 5-6; R.
v. Porisky, 2012 BCCA 467, 293 C.C.C. (3d) 100, at paras. 8 and 14-15; R.
v. Parsons (1994), 117 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 69 (C.A.), at paras. 30-34.
Moreover, all of the parties and interveners in this appeal are content with
the Farinacci framework. None has spoken against it; none has asked us
to revisit it — and I see no reason to do so. Farinacci remains good law
in my view. 

[27]                         
In so concluding, I should not be taken to mean —
nor do I understand Farinacci to have said — that the public safety component
and the public confidence component are to be treated as silos. To be sure,
there will be cases where public safety considerations alone are sufficient to
warrant a detention order in the public interest. However, as I will explain,
where the public safety threshold has been met by an applicant seeking bail
pending appeal, residual public safety concerns or the absence of any public
safety concerns remain relevant and should be considered in the public
confidence analysis. 

[28]                         
The challenge with Farinacci arises not
from its framework, but from its application in cases where the public
confidence component is raised. Appellate judges continue to have difficulty
resolving the tension between enforceability and reviewability, especially in
cases like the present one, where they are faced with a serious crime on the
one hand, and a strong candidate for bail pending appeal on the other. 

[29]                         
Fortunately, cases like this tend to be more the
exception than the rule. Appellate judges across the country deal with applications
for bail pending appeal on a regular basis. Of those, only a fraction are
likely to involve the public confidence component. Rarely does this component
play a role, much less a central role, in the decision to grant or deny bail
pending appeal. As Donald J.A. observed in Porisky, at para. 47:

Not every offence is serious enough to
engage an assessment of the merits. There is no need to go beyond the frivolous
threshold in cases unlikely to arouse a concern about public confidence. . . .
[W]e should expect Crown counsel to recognize that the continuum runs from
petty theft to first degree murder and to exercise good judgment in raising
public confidence only in those cases where the offence is at the serious end
of the scale.

[30]                         
That said, difficult cases do occasionally arise
in which the public confidence component is raised. In the hope of assisting
appellate judges, I propose to elaborate somewhat on the competing interests of
enforceability and reviewability identified in Farinacci. In particular,
I will point out some of the key factors that inform these interests and
provide appellate judges with guidance as to how to weigh them in any given
case. 

(3)          
Section 515(10) (c) of the Criminal Code 
Identifies Factors That Inform the Public Confidence Analysis

(a)          
The Rationales for Considering Section
515(10)(c)

[31]                         
In section 679(3)(c) of the Code,
Parliament has not provided appellate judges with any direction as to how a
release pending appeal order is likely to affect public confidence in the
administration of justice. Fortunately, it has done so in the admittedly
different but related context of bail pending trial. Under s. 515(10)(c),
Parliament has identified four factors that judges may consider in assessing
whether a detention order is necessary to maintain public confidence in the
administration of justice: 

515 . . .

 

(10) For the purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in
custody is justified only on one or more of the following grounds:

 

. . . 

 

(c) if the detention is necessary to
maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the
circumstances, including

 

(i) the apparent strength of the
prosecution’s case,

 

(ii) the gravity of the offence,

 

(iii) the circumstances surrounding the
commission of the offence, including whether a firearm was used, and

 

(iv) the fact that the accused is liable, on conviction, for a
potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in the case of an offence that
involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a minimum punishment of
imprisonment for a term of three years or more.

[32]                         
While these factors are tailored to the
pre-trial context, a corollary form of the interest underlying each exists in
the appellate context. In my view, these same factors — with appropriate
modifications to reflect the post-conviction context — should be accounted for
in considering how, if at all, a release pending appeal order is likely to
affect public confidence in the administration of justice. 

[33]                         
Approaching the matter this way advances an
important policy consideration. It has the virtue of
promoting consistency and harmony between the trial and appellate contexts so
that, together, they may be seen as providing a cohesive and comprehensive statement
of the law governing bail in Canada. Importantly, it accords with the basic
principle that, in general, bail should not be more readily accessible for
someone who has been convicted of a crime than for someone who is awaiting
trial and is presumed innocent. Approaching the two contexts in that fashion
can only serve to foster the goals of fairness and coherence and enhance
society’s confidence in the administration of justice.

[34]                         
Greater accessibility to bail pending trial is
rooted in the presumption of innocence. Accused persons charged with an offence
in Canada are presumed to be innocent, and they remain so unless and until
their guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. With this in mind, the framers
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  saw fit to include in s.
11 (e) the right of every person charged with an offence “not to be
denied reasonable bail without just cause”: R. v. Hall, 2002 SCC 64,
[2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 13.

[35]                         
By contrast, once a conviction is entered, the
presumption of innocence is displaced and s. 11 (e) of the Charter  no
longer applies. This is reflected in the shift in onus which occurs when a
person who has been convicted and sentenced applies for bail pending appeal.
Unlike the pre-trial context, where by and large the onus rests on the Crown to
establish that an accused should be detained in custody, for appeal purposes,
Parliament has seen fit to reverse the onus onto the applicant in all cases.[1] 

[36]                         
With these thoughts in mind, I turn to the
enforceability and reviewability interests to explain how, with appropriate
modifications, the public confidence factors listed in s. 515(10)(c) are
instructive in identifying the factors that make up the public confidence
component in s. 679(3)(c). 

(b)          
The Enforceability Interest

[37]                         
In assessing whether public confidence concerns
support a pre-trial detention order under s. 515(10)(c), the seriousness of the
crime plays an important role. The more serious the crime, the greater the risk
that public confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined if
the accused is released on bail pending trial. So too for bail pending appeal.
In considering the public confidence component under s. 679(3)(c), I see no
reason why the seriousness of the crime for which a person has been convicted
should not play an equal role in assessing the enforceability interest.

[38]                         
With that in mind, I return to s. 515(10)(c),
where Parliament has set out three factors by which the seriousness of a crime
may be determined: the gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding
the commission of the offence, and the potential length of imprisonment (s.
515(10)(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv)). In my view, these factors are readily
transferable to s. 679(3)(c) — the only difference being that, unlike the
pre-trial context, an appeal judge will generally have the trial judge’s
reasons for sentence in which the three factors going to the seriousness of the
crime will have been addressed. As a rule, the appeal judge need not repeat
this exercise.  

[39]                         
I pause here to note that while the seriousness
of the crime for which the offender has been convicted will play an important
role in assessing the enforceability interest, other factors should also be
taken into account where appropriate. For example, public safety concerns that
fall short of the substantial risk mark — which would preclude a release order —
will remain relevant under the public confidence component and can, in some
cases, tip the scale in favour of detention: R. v. Rhyason, 2006 ABCA
120, 208 C.C.C. (3d) 193, at para. 15; R. v. Roussin, 2011 MBCA
103, 275 Man. R. (2d) 46, at para. 34. The same holds true for lingering flight
risks that do not rise to the substantial risk level under s. 679(3)(b). By the
same token, the absence of flight or public safety risks will attenuate the
enforceability interest. 

(c)          
The Reviewability Interest 

[40]                         
The remaining factor that Parliament has
identified as informing public confidence under s. 515(10)(c) is the strength
of the prosecution’s case (s. 515(10)(c)(i)). In the appellate context, this
translates into the strength of the grounds of appeal — and, as I will explain,
in assessing the reviewability interest, the strength of an appeal plays a
central role. I say this mindful of the fact that some authorities have
expressed concerns about assessing the merits of an appeal beyond the s.
679(3)(a) “not frivolous” criterion: see R. v. Allen, 2001 NFCA 44, 158
C.C.C. (3d) 225, at paras. 31-52; Parsons, at paras. 55-59. With
respect, I do not see this as a problem. 

[41]                         
In my view, allowing a more pointed
consideration of the strength of an appeal for purposes of assessing the
reviewability interest does not render the “not frivolous” criterion in s.
679(3)(a) meaningless. On the contrary, the “not frivolous” criterion operates
as an initial hurdle that produces a categorical “yes” or “no” answer, allowing
for the immediate rejection of a release order in the face of a baseless
appeal.[2]

[42]                         
Justice Donald put the matter succinctly, and in
my view correctly, in Porisky, at para. 37: 

     The express mention of “not
frivolous” in s. 679(3)(a) and “sufficient merit” in s. 679(4) (a) does not, in
my view, foreclose consideration of the merits for a purpose other than a
threshold test. Once over the threshold, the applicant faces the question of
the public interest, a phrase not defined in the legislation but which had to
be given some limits if it was to survive constitutional scrutiny. That is what
Farinacci did. In setting boundaries for the public interest criterion,
in particular the public confidence element, Farinacci employed the
merits assessment for a purpose different from the threshold test. So I see no
redundancy; nor do I doubt our authority to consider the merits as part of the
public confidence question. 

See also: R. v. Delisle,
2012 QCCA 1250, at paras. 4 and 52 (CanLII).

[43]                         
Gary T. Trotter, now a Justice of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, reached a similar conclusion in his article “Bail Pending
Appeal: The Strength of the Appeal and the Public Interest Criterion” (2001),
45 C.R. (5th) 267, where he explained:

. . . realistically, most cases do not
raise strong claims regarding the public interest, at least not beyond the
general concern that all criminal judgments ought to be enforced. . . .
However, when an offence is serious, as with murder cases, such that public
concern about enforceability is ignited, there should be a more probing inquiry
into the chances of success on appeal. It is in this context that the balancing
required by Farinacci requires some assessment of the merits, separate
from the question of whether the appeal is frivolous or not. [Footnotes
omitted; p. 270.]

[44]                         
In conducting a more pointed assessment of the
strength of an appeal, appellate judges will examine the grounds identified in
the notice of appeal with an eye to their general legal plausibility and their
foundation in the record. For purposes of this assessment, they will look to
see if the grounds of appeal clearly surpass the minimal standard required to
meet the “not frivolous” criterion. In my view, categories and grading schemes
should be avoided. Phrases such as “a prospect of success”, “a moderate
prospect of success”, or “a realistic prospect of success” are generally not
helpful. Often, they amount to little more than wordsmithing. Worse yet, they
are liable to devolve into a set of complex rules that appellate judges will be
obliged to apply in assessing the category into which a particular appeal
falls. 

[45]                         
In the end, appellate judges can be counted on
to form their own “preliminary assessment” of the strength of an appeal based
upon their knowledge and experience. This assessment, it should be emphasized,
is not a matter of guesswork. It will generally be based on material that
counsel have provided, including aspects of the record that are pertinent to
the grounds of appeal raised, along with relevant authorities. In undertaking
this exercise, appellate judges will of course remain mindful that our justice
system is not infallible and that a meaningful review process is essential to
maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Thus, there is a
broader public interest in reviewability that transcends an individual’s
interest in any given case. 

[46]                         
As a final matter, I note that the remedy sought
on appeal may also inform the reviewability interest. For example, if a
successful appeal can result only in a murder conviction being reduced to
manslaughter, this will lessen the interest in reviewability, even if the
grounds of appeal appear to be strong: R. v. Meda (1981), 23 C.R. (3d)
174 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Olsen (1996), 94 O.A.C. 62, at para. 5; R. v.
Roe, 2008 BCCA 253, 256 B.C.A.C. 308, at para. 14; R. v. Lees, 1999
BCCA 441, 127 B.C.A.C. 280, at paras. 4-5.

(d)          
The Final Balancing

[47]                         
Appellate judges are undoubtedly required to
draw on their legal expertise and experience in evaluating the factors that
inform public confidence, including the strength of the grounds of appeal, the
seriousness of the offence, public safety and flight risks. However, when
conducting the final balancing of these factors, appellate judges should keep
in mind that public confidence is to be measured through the eyes of a
reasonable member of the public. This person is someone who is thoughtful,
dispassionate, informed of the circumstances of the case and respectful of
society’s fundamental values: R. v. St-Cloud, 2015 SCC 27, [2015] 2
S.C.R. 328, at paras. 74-80. In that sense, public confidence in the
administration of justice must be distinguished from uninformed public opinion
about the case, which has no role to play in the decision to grant bail or not.

[48]                         
In balancing the tension between enforceability
and reviewability, appellate judges should also be mindful of the anticipated
delay in deciding an appeal, relative to the length of the sentence: R. v.
Baltovich (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 761 (C.A.), at paras. 41-42. Where it
appears that all, or a significant portion, of a sentence will be served before
the appeal can be heard and decided, bail takes on greater significance if the
reviewability interest is to remain meaningful. In such circumstances, however,
where a bail order is out of the question, appellate judges should consider
ordering the appeal expedited under s. 679(10) of the Code. While this
may not be a perfect solution, it provides a means of preserving the
reviewability interest at least to some extent.

[49]                         
In the final analysis, there is no precise
formula that can be applied to resolve the balance between enforceability and
reviewability. A qualitative and contextual assessment is required. In this
regard, I would reject a categorical approach to murder or other serious
offences, as proposed by certain interveners. Instead, the principles that I
have discussed should be applied uniformly. 

[50]                         
That said, where the applicant has been
convicted of murder or some other very serious crime, the public interest in
enforceability will be high and will often outweigh the reviewability interest,
particularly where there are lingering public safety or flight concerns and/or
the grounds of appeal appear to be weak: R. v. Mapara, 2001 BCCA 508, 158
C.C.C. (3d) 312, at para. 38; Baltovich, at para. 20; Parsons, at
para. 44. 

[51]                         
On the other hand, where public safety or flight
concerns are negligible, and where the grounds of appeal clearly surpass the
“not frivolous” criterion, the public interest in reviewability may well
overshadow the enforceability interest, even in the case of murder or other
very serious offences. 

[52]                         
Before applying these principles to the case at
hand, I propose to address the principles that govern a review hearing under s.
680(1) of the Code.

C.           
The Review Hearing Under Section 680(1) of the
Criminal Code 

[53]                         
In this case, s. 680(1) of the Code
operates as a review mechanism for an order of a single judge of the Court of
Appeal made under s. 679(3). I note, however, that the provision applies as
well to certain pre-trial bail orders made by superior court judges for various
offences, including murder. For convenience, s. 680(1) is reproduced below:

680 (1) A decision made by a judge under section 522 or subsection
524(4) or (5) or a decision made by a judge of the court of appeal under
section 261 or 679 may, on the direction of the chief justice or acting chief
justice of the court of appeal, be reviewed by that court and that court may,
if it does not confirm the decision,

 

(a) vary the decision; or

 

(b) substitute such other decision as, in its opinion, should have
been made.

[54]                         
As the provision makes clear, the review process
consists of two stages: first, an initial vetting by the chief justice; and
second, a review by the court, if directed by the chief justice. In practice,
the review will generally be conducted by a panel of three judges, as it was in
this case. 

[55]                         
The nature of the review and the standard to be
applied by the panel in deciding whether to interfere with the impugned order
are factors that the chief justice is likely to take into account in carrying
out his or her initial screening function. Accordingly, I find it useful to
address the review panel’s mandate before addressing the chief justice’s
screening function.

(1)          
Panel Review

[56]                         
The parties disagree on the principles governing
a s. 680(1) panel review. Mr. Oland and the intervener Criminal Lawyers’
Association (Ontario) (“CLA”) submit that a standard of correctness should
apply, meaning that the panel should engage in a robust review of the record
and come to its own independent determination, irrespective of whether
the single judge’s decision was tainted by legal error. The respondent Crown and
the Attorneys General of Ontario and Alberta submit that a more deferential standard
is appropriate — one in which an error of law or principle must be found before
intervention will be warranted. 

[57]                         
In support of their position, Mr. Oland and the
CLA make two main submissions. First, they point to ss. 520 and 521 of the Code
— the bail review provisions that apply at the trial stage. Unlike s. 680(1),
those provisions require the applicant to “show cause” to succeed on a bail
review. In St-Cloud, this Court observed that the words “show cause”
signal a less interventionist, more deferential approach to bail reviews at the
trial stage. In doing so, the Court noted the absence of similar language in s.
680(1) (paras. 97-104). Hence, it is argued that s. 680(1) should be
interpreted as invoking a less deferential standard than the standard
applicable at trial. 

[58]                         
I would not give effect to this argument. While
the words “show cause” are not found in s. 680(1), I am not convinced that
their absence is as significant as Mr. Oland and the CLA suggest. In the
context of a review provision, I would have expected more explicit language
than the language used in s. 680(1), if Parliament intended the review to be a
process in which the panel could, without more, simply substitute its opinion
for that of the judge. In so concluding, I note that in St-Cloud, at
para. 104, Wagner J. for the Court stated that his comments were not
determinative of the type of review contemplated by s. 680(1).

[59]                         
Second, Mr. Oland and the CLA submit that the
constitutionality of s. 679(3)(c) hinges on the existence of a robust
correctness review. They base this submission on an excerpt from Farinacci,
where Arbour J.A. stated, at p. 47:

Although its application is often not
free from difficulty, and although judges may differ in its application, it is
a standard against which the correctness of individual decisions can be
assessed. In contrast, a standardless sweep would preclude any debate regarding
the correctness of a decision made under its authority as it would
authorize judges to pursue their own personal predilections. [Emphasis added.]

[60]                         
I do not find this reference to be persuasive.
In Farinacci, the Court of Appeal was focused on the constitutionality
of s. 679(3)(c), a matter that does not concern us in this appeal. Moreover,
the argument assumes that correctness is the only form of meaningful review
which can protect against vagueness. While the availability of review may have
been important to the Court of Appeal in considering the constitutionality of
s. 679(3)(c), it does not follow that the nature of that review must invoke a
correctness standard along the lines suggested by Mr. Oland and the CLA. In any
event, in the absence of a constitutional challenge, I do not consider it
necessary to decide this issue beyond concluding that the comments of the Court
of Appeal are not dispositive in settling the nature of review contemplated
under s. 680(1).

[61]                         
Ultimately, in my view, a panel reviewing a
decision of a single judge under s. 680(1) should be guided by the following
three principles. First, absent palpable and overriding error, the review panel
must show deference to the judge’s findings of fact. Second, the review panel
may intervene and substitute its decision for that of the judge where it is
satisfied that the judge erred in law or in principle, and the error was
material to the outcome. Third, in the absence of legal error, the review panel
may intervene and substitute its decision for that of the judge where it
concludes that the decision was clearly unwarranted. 

[62]                         
This approach allows for meaningful review while
extending a measure of deference to the judge’s decision. It also achieves
symmetry with the review process at the trial stage, save for those offences
identified in s. 469 of the Code, for which the review process is
governed by s. 680(1). This symmetry is important because, as Gary T. Trotter
explains in The Law of Bail in Canada, it avoids an anomaly that would
otherwise result:

     Focusing on the review of
pre-trial bail orders, endorsing a correctness standard in the application of
s. 680 creates differential standards of review for s. 469  vs. non-469
offences. It will allow a more generous scope of review in respect of the most
serious offences in the Criminal Code . . . . There is no principled
reason that supports a situation where someone detained on a murder charge
enjoys a broader scope of review under s. 680  when compared to a person charged
with manslaughter or attempted murder (both non-s. 469  offences) who is dealt
with under the narrower s. 520 . [p. 8-31]

(2)          
The Chief Justice’s Discretion to Direct a
Review

[63]                         
There is no formal procedure in the Code governing
the chief justice’s decision to direct a panel review. We are told that courts
of appeal have adopted different approaches and levels of formality. The
procedural aspects of the gatekeeping function are not before us and I do not
propose to address them. Some guidance can, however, be given as to the test a chief
justice should apply in deciding whether to direct a panel review.

[64]                         
The test, as I see it, should be relatively
straightforward in its application. It flows from the principles the panel is
required to apply when conducting a review. In short, the chief justice should
consider directing a review where it is arguable that the judge committed
material errors of fact or law in arriving at the impugned decision, or that
the impugned decision was clearly unwarranted in the circumstances. 

V.           
Application to This Case

[65]                         
By all accounts, aside from the seriousness of
the offence for which Mr. Oland was convicted, he presented as an ideal
candidate for bail. The notoriety of this case, which stemmed largely from his
prominence in the community, and any uninformed public opinion about it, were
rightly ignored by the appeal judge. Mr. Oland, I emphasize, was entitled to
the same treatment as someone less prominent. 

[66]                         
In the circumstances, there is considerable
merit to Mr. Oland’s submission that if he did not qualify for release,
no one convicted of a similarly serious offence would ever be released, absent
a showing of unique or exceptionally strong grounds of appeal. That cannot be
right. Parliament did not restrict the availability of bail pending appeal for
persons convicted of murder or any other serious crime and courts should
respect this. Thus, for the purposes of s. 679(3)(c), even in the case of very
serious offences, where there are no public safety or flight concerns and the
grounds of appeal clearly surpass the “not frivolous” criterion, a court may
well conclude that the reviewability interest overshadows the enforceability
interest such that detention will not be necessary in the public interest. 

[67]                         
Every case is different and there may be
operative factors in other cases, such as a prior criminal record, public
safety and flight risk concerns, or a weaker release plan, which could raise
concerns warranting detention. Emphatically, a contextual analysis that can
account for these differences is required. 

[68]                         
In this case, the appeal judge was satisfied
that there were no appreciable public safety or flight risk concerns and the
grounds of appeal were “clearly arguable” — which I take to mean that they
clearly surpassed the “not frivolous” criterion. Those findings are not
challenged on appeal. In addition, the appeal judge overlooked what I consider
to be an important finding made by the trial judge, namely, that in the
circumstances, Mr. Oland’s crime gravitated more toward the offence of
manslaughter than to first degree murder. This finding was important because it
served to lessen Mr. Oland’s degree of moral blameworthiness, thereby
attenuating the seriousness of the crime and hence the enforceability interest.
In my view, the cumulative effect of these considerations ought to have tipped
the scale in favour of release. In other words, Mr. Oland’s detention was
clearly unwarranted and the Court of Appeal erred in failing to intervene.

[69]                         
While that is sufficient to dispose of this
appeal, I feel obliged to identify a legal error that the appeal judge made in
his analysis. In particular, his reasons indicate that he did not apply the
correct test in assessing the strength of Mr. Oland’s appeal and the
implications flowing from it. Much as he was satisfied that Mr. Oland had
raised “clearly arguable” grounds of appeal, this was not enough. As the
following excerpt from his reasons shows, he required more, something in the
nature of unique circumstances that would have virtually assured a new trial or
an acquittal:

In the end, the reasonable member of
the public, looking at this dispassionately, would balance the fact that the
offence for which Mr. Oland was convicted ranks among the most serious in the Criminal
Code , as well as the brutality with which the offence was committed and the
trial judge’s imposition of a life sentence, against the other factors that
weigh in favour of Mr. Oland’s release. In my respectful view, that reasonable
member of the public would find that, although the grounds of appeal may be
clearly arguable, none fall in the category of the unique circumstances that
would virtually assure a new trial or an acquittal. In the end, I am forced
to conclude that knowing all this, should Mr. Oland be released in these
circumstances, the confidence of the reasonable member of the public in the
administration of criminal justice would be undermined. [Emphasis added; para.
32.]

Respectfully, he erred in
this regard. That Mr. Oland’s grounds were “clearly arguable” was enough to
establish that they clearly surpassed the “not frivolous” criterion.

[70]                         
In the result, had intervening events not
rendered the appeal moot, I would have set aside Mr. Oland’s detention order
and ordered his release pending appeal. However, because the appeal is moot, I
would simply allow the appeal and make no further order.

4402074,CHZ v Children’s Guardian [2017] NSWCATAD 120,"REASONS FOR DECISION

Introduction


	
	The applicant, who will be referred to as CHZ, requires a Working With Children Check clearance to work as a driving instructor. CHZ has two teenaged children with whom he has regular contact.
	
	
	He applied for a Working With Children Check clearance on 1 April 2014. On 13 November 2015, the Children’s Guardian refused to grant him a clearance on the basis of his criminal history, the relatively recent nature of his offending and the absence of information that would serve to mitigate the risks associated with his criminal record.
	
	
	The applicant applied for a review of this decision on 10 December 2015. A hearing was held in this Tribunal (‘the Tribunal’) on 20 September 2016.
	


Legal principles


	
	The Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012 (‘the Act’) provides that a worker must not engage in child-related work unless he or she holds a Working With Children Check clearance. (section 8 of the Act).
	
	
	The Children’s Guardian has the power to undertake a risk assessment under s15 of the Act. Section 18(2) of the Act provides that the Children’s Guardian must grant a Working With Children Check clearance to a person who is subject to a risk assessment unless the Children’s Guardian is satisfied that the person poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	Under section 27 of the Act, the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (‘the Tribunal’) has the power to review a decision of the Children’s Guardian to refuse a Working With Children Check clearance. The role of the Tribunal is to make the correct and preferable decision having regard to the material before it. (see section 63 Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.)
	
	
	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 27 of the Act is protective and not punitive in nature: AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69 at [34]; Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111, per Young JA at [61] and R v Commission for Children and Young People [2002] NSWIRComm 101 at [130].
	
	
	In considering whether an applicant poses a risk to children, the test to be applied is whether the risk is ""a real and appreciable risk"": see BYR v Children's Guardian [2013] NSWADT 310, at [38], [39]; AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 9, at [37], [38]; Commission for Children and Young People v V [2002] NSWSC 949; 56 NSWLR 476, at [42] per Young CJ in Eq (as he then was).
	
	
	That test has been held to be applicable in this Tribunal: see AHV v NSW Commission for Children and Young People [2012] NSWADT 263; AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian (supra).
	
	
	In order to confirm that the meaning of a provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision, regard may be given to extrinsic material such as the second reading speech for the Bill that became the Act in question: section 32 (2) (f) of the Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	On 13 June 2012, the second reading speech for the Bill, which became the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012, was given by Mr Dominello, Minister for Citizenship and Communities, and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. In part it reads as follows:
	


All adults can present a risk to children. The Bill does not propose that all adults be barred from working with children because of a hidden potential for risk. Rather, the Bill proposes that to bar a person from working with children the risk must be significant.


	
	While the Bill sets out the factors to be considered in an assessment and a review, the weighting given to these factors is not prescribed and is a matter of expert judgment. Expert judgment will consider the significance of the harm having been realised, whether the behaviour was beyond reasonable community norms, whether the behaviour was planned, whether the behaviour is part of the pattern of ongoing or escalating events, whether the behaviour is recent, and whether the behaviour, if repeated, would do significant harm. Expert judgment will be applied to mitigating factors such as significant and sustained positive socialisation since the behaviour occurred, recurrence or cessation of concerning behaviour over a significant period, and genuine and sustained effort to remedy the conduct and past behaviour. Remorse on its own is not considered to be a factor that mitigates risk.
	
	
	The Minister noted that:
	


Any assessment trigger, whether a criminal matter or a disciplinary matter, must be able to sustain an appealable bar against working with children. There are two conditions that need to be met to achieve this. First, the investigation of the conduct must be sound and must have taken into account the principles of natural justice; and, second, the conduct must be of a serious nature and must have actually occurred. Unsustainable allegations will not sustain an appealable bar. Only employers whose investigation practice meets the first condition will be reporting bodies that report disciplinary matters. They will be obliged to do so by law….Only sexual assaults, sexual misconduct and serious physical assaults have been identified to date as meeting the second part of this requirement. The range of matters to be reported may be extended by regulation.


	
	Due to the sensitive nature of these proceedings, an order was made, under subsection 64(1) of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013,that the name of the applicant was not to be published without the leave of the Tribunal. For this purpose the pseudonym CHZ has been used for the applicant's name.
	


evidence


	
	In considering this application for review, the Tribunal had considered all the material before it, relevant parts of which are set out below.
	


Risk Assessment report


	
	Following his application for a Working With Children Check clearance, the Children’s Guardian conducted a risk assessment for the applicant in accordance with clause 1(6) of Schedule 1 to the Act, which provides for a assessment requirement trigger where a person has been convicted of, or proceedings have been commenced against a person for, offences involving violence or sexual misconduct sufficient to indicate a pattern of behaviour that warrants investigation as to whether it may cause a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	In the applicant’s case, the pattern trigger offences are as follows:
	



	
	his 1998 conviction for the common assault of his former de facto partner and the subsequent contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (for which he was placed on good behaviour bonds);
	
	
	his 2007 conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm to his ex-wife and the contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order (for which he received a sentence of eight months, suspended upon entering into a good behaviour bond);
	
	
	his 2009 convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm to his ex-wife (for which he was placed on a good behaviour bond) and for stalking her with intent to cause fear or physical or mental harm (for which he received 200 hours of community service).
	


Criminal record


	
	The applicant has the following convictions:
	



	
	January 1998 – assault;
	
	
	June 1998 – contravene Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (‘ADVO’) & destroy or damage property;
	
	
	January 2007 –contravene ADVO & assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	November 2007 – contravene ADVO;
	
	
	December 2009 – stalk/ intimidate intend fear of physical/mental harm & assault occasioning actual bodily harm & enter enclosed land without lawful excuse. The applicant was convicted of stalking his ex-wife and punching her in the face.
	



	
	For each conviction, either a fine, a good behaviour bond or a community service order was imposed.
	
	
	The applicant was also the defendant in twelve Apprehended Violence/Domestic Violence Orders between 21 January 1998 and 27 October 2009.
	
	
	A police incident report created in May 2014 states that following their break up, the applicant sent 200 text messages to his ex-girlfriend and that he rang her 27 times in one night.
	


CHZ


	
	CHZ gave oral evidence before the Tribunal. He told the Tribunal that he was a 39-year-old Aboriginal man with a strong cultural identity. Between 2012 and 2014, he had engaged in hotel work for which he held a certificate for the responsible service of alcohol. Since 2014, he had been employed by an Aboriginal organisation where he does reception and administrative work.
	
	
	He has two teenaged children who have lived with him for two to three nights a week for the past seven years. This arrangement was reached following mediation with his ex-wife. He told the Tribunal that his children are going well and that his daughter has ambitions of becoming a teacher when she leaves school.
	
	
	CHZ confirmed that he had had a close bond with his late mother, who had been a foster carer for many children.
	
	
	He agreed that when he entered his first relationship, he had been 19 years old. He agreed that he had been convicted for two offences of domestic violence while in this relationship. He agreed that he had been intoxicated on both occasions.
	
	
	He told the Tribunal that his relationship with the mother of his children (‘the ex-wife’) had commenced in 1998 or 1999. He agreed that there had been incidents of domestic violence within this relationship when he had been intoxicated. He confirmed that his children had never witnessed this and that it had never been discussed with them. He doesn’t believe that the children are aware of these incidents. He told the Tribunal that he was disgusted by his behaviour and regretted it. His ex-wife has never told him that she believed his behaviour had any impact upon their children.
	
	
	When cross-examined about the effect of his behaviour on his children, he maintained that the children had never witnessed any domestic violence against their mother. He agreed that he had punched his ex-wife.
	
	
	Medical reports dated September 2006 noted that the applicant would binge drink once a week for a period of 10 years. These reports also recommended anger management treatment for the applicant and noted that he had, in 2006, poor impulse control disorder exacerbated by alcohol intake and unresolved relationship issues. The reports describe some history of depression for the applicant but note his good insight into his depression stating that he ‘has insight into changes in mood, willing to seek help’.
	
	
	In oral evidence before the Tribunal, the applicant agreed that he had had counselling in 2006 but has never taken medication for any mental health issues.
	
	
	He agreed that he had been a binge drinker from 1996 to 2006. He agreed that even after he had been charged with assaulting his ex-wife in 2006, he had continued to drink. He denied ever threatening to kill his ex-wife or telling her that he would burn the house down and drive the kids into water or that she would never see the children again. He confirmed that his ex-wife had never denied him contact with the children. He described his relationship with his ex-wife as ‘pretty good... a hundred times better than in 2006.’
	
	
	CHZ told the Tribunal that he ‘was great with the kids’ and is teaching them to drive. He said that ‘there are not enough hours in the day to spend time with them’ and that the longest period of time he goes without seeing the children is two days.
	
	
	When asked what steps he has taken to ensure he abstains from domestic violence, CHZ told the Tribunal that he has educated himself on the effects of domestic violence and has lowered his drinking. He has also become more family orientated. Since the death of his mother, he has had more responsibility for his children who have become more dependent upon him.
	
	
	He agreed that he had been in a two-year relationship that had recently ended and that his ex-girlfriend had alleged that CHZ had sent 200 text messages to her after their relationship had collapsed.
	
	
	He explained the circumstances behind the ending of their relationship:
	


We went down to [a town in NSW] and had an argument. She left. Two days later, I came home to find my furniture gone and $40,000 of debt. I went to the consumer tribunal, I wrote to Fair Trading to try to get my bond money back. She worked in a real estate office. Twenty text messages were about the bond. The police told me to stop harassing her and I said yes. I had to contact her when her daughter’s school rang up and I passed the message on.


	
	In cross-examination, he denied that the text messages sent to his former girlfriend were threatening but did not seek to excuse them.
	
	
	Documents contained on file confirm that the applicant had been approved for a foster placement in 2012.
	
	
	In oral evidence before the Tribunal, the applicant said that he had been approached by police in relation to a 15-year-old girl [‘the foster child’] who had been fostered by CHZ’s mother from the time she was a year old. After CHZ’s mother died, the foster child had been ‘shopped around.’ CHZ told the police that she could stay with him for the weekend. The Department of Family and Community Services then told CHZ that he’d ‘be okay to have her’ and conducted a risk assessment for him before approving him as a foster carer. The foster child then stayed with him for 5 months.
	
	
	The placement ended due to the foster child’s behavioural problems. On one occasion, she had friends over to drink alcohol at CHZ’s house and on another occasion she ‘smashed up the house’, took CHZ’s last photographs of his mother and took the spare key to the car. When further damage was done to his house, CHZ rang the Department of Family and Community Services and the police to say that he could no longer care for the foster child.
	
	
	According to CHZ, the Department of Family and Community Services tried to convince him to continue to care for the foster child. According to CHZ, it was ‘suggested that I could forgive her. I said once yes, twice no.’
	
	
	CHZ told the Tribunal that he still speaks to the foster child. He describes her as having been born alcohol dependent and as having a learning disability. His mother had also fostered her older brother and sister. CHZ described himself as having been disappointed in the foster child. But when he saw her after the placement had not continued, he said sorry to her ‘because I didn’t think I’d done a good job. It was the hardest thing telling her she couldn’t come back.’
	


CHZ’s ex-wife


	
	CHZ’s ex-wife, who is also the mother of his children, provided the following character reference in support of CHZ’s application for a Working With Children Check clearance:
	


[CHZ] is the father of our children. CHZ and I separated back in 2003. Since 2006 when his mother passed CHZ has been nothing but helpful and hasn’t caused any issues to me since. CHZ has always put his children first. CHZ is a responsible adult and has matured a lot over the last 10 years. CHZ picks them up from school and runs them around for example sporting or work commitments and brings them home, he also picks them up from their house…He also has [our son] one night every week. To conclude I recommend CHZ is a mature adult who is great with children. He is a very caring and responsible father to [our son and our daughter] and their friends and other children in the family.


	
	In her reference CHZ’s ex-wife provided her contact details and wrote that she was happy to answer any further enquiries. At hearing, the Children’s Guardian did not require her for cross-examination.
	


Material from the Department of Family and Community Services


	
	Material contained on file from the Department of Family and Community Services includes a 2012 assessment record for the kinship foster placement of a fifteen-year-old girl (‘the foster child’) with the applicant.
	
	
	Interview notes with the applicant in relation to the foster placement include the following:
	


CHZ lived with [the foster child] (his mother and other foster children in the household) for about 12 years at which time he moved out. CHZ stated that he reached the decision to care for [the foster child] when...the caseworker...called him to ask if he would be interested in this role. CHZ stated that his door is ‘always open to anyone’ who needed help. CHZ expressed that he really did not want [the foster child] to end up in a group home and that he would like to see her get a part time job.

When CHZ was talking about [the foster child] and the quirks of her personality his affection for her was apparent. He described [her] as ‘a ball of fun’ and told a story about when they went to the shops and she did random things such as showing him how to put coins in a slot machine and buying prawn chips and then cooking them for him. CHZ described [her] personality in a very caring manner and he said that he was learning things from her.


	
	The interview notes also contain the following comments about the applicant’s relationship with his own children:
	


He sees [the children] most days after school…[CHZ] described [his son] as a ‘very musical’ person who enjoys playing drums and guitar. [CHZ] has held some concerns for [his son’s] academic abilities as he did not appear to be functioning at the same level as many of his peers..[CHZ] stated he believed [he] is now ‘doing better’ at school…CHZ described [his daughter] as smart...very smart. …[The foster child] has a good relationship with [CHZ’s] children and spends time with them at CHZ’s ex wife’s house when [he] is working.


	
	When asked during the interview how he reacted to other people if they made him angry, CHZ told the interviewers that in the past he had struck out, but that since working at a hotel, he had been able to control this and that this ‘has been displayed through his regular interaction with intoxicated patrons without incident.’
	
	
	CHZ explained his parenting style to the interviewers stating that:
	


If his children misbehaved he would speak to them in a stern voice to get them to stop what they were doing or withdraw some privileges. CHZ believes that his mother has influenced his parenting style by teaching him the importance of love and providing for your children’s basic needs.


	
	The applicant told the interviewers that he was still in regular contact with his ex-wife and that there had previously been violence in their relationship but that ‘the violence had never occurred in the presence of the children.’ He told the interviewers that he had given up drinking and had seen a counsellor to address his anger issues. He told the interviewers that ‘he had found the process beneficial and that he had continued to attend counselling past the date required by the court orders.’
	
	
	He told the interviewers that ‘whilst the [foster child] has self placed with CHZ she has spent time with [his ex-wife] who has indicated to CHZ that she would be willing to help look after [the foster child] when CHZ works on the weekends. CHZ said that he now deals with disagreements with [his ex-wife] by speaking with her about the problem.’
	


Material from the telephone company


	
	Material received from the applicant’s telephone company included:
	



	
	tax invoices for May and June 2014
	
	
	details of voice calls made from the applicant’s mobile number between 5 April 2014 and 3 June 2014
	


Ms Hare


	
	The forensic psychologist, Ms Hare, prepared a forensic psychological risk assessment report for the applicant and gave evidence by telephone at these proceedings.
	
	
	It is not disputed that the applicant was raised by a single mother, who also fostered children for both long and short-term placements. It is also not disputed that since leaving school, the applicant has been in employment and has also completed further educational programs.
	
	
	It is not disputed that the applicant was the subject of apprehended domestic violence orders against the mother of his children. According to Ms Hare:
	


[CHZ] denied that his children had been witness to any incidents of aggressive discord between himself and [their mother], citing that they were oftentimes in the care of extended family members when arguments erupted. He also denied that his children are aware of his past convictions for incidents of violence against their mother. [CHZ] described maintaining a supportive relationship with [the mother of his children] at the time of writing, noting that she had accompanied him on the journey to Sydney for the present assessment.


	
	According to Ms Hare,
	


CHZ identified his mother as a primary influence in the attitudes and beliefs that he developed, and he reflected his disappointment with himself for having ever ‘laid a hand on anyone.’ He agreed that there is no place for aggression and violence within intimate relationships, and he did not present as holding misogynistic beliefs. Indeed, he identified his sister and a female ex-work colleague as amongst his closest supports. [CHZ] also reported his brother and a male work colleague as part of his social support network. He described these individuals as unanimously prosocial, and he maintains weekly contact with them. CHZ denied maintaining antisocial acquaintances currently, although he reported that historically (aged 18 to 25) he had maintained some antisocial peers. He advised that after reflecting on his life in his mid-twenties, he had recognised that he needed to make some changes, particularly in relation to his social group, and over time he had distanced himself from these individuals. CHZ identified a number of prosocial leisure interests, including playing masters rugby league, attending live music events, watching rugby league with his friends, and historically engaging in activities to maintain physical fitness.


	
	CHZ agreed that he was more likely to act out aggressively when intoxicated. According to Ms Hare:
	


Indeed, he reflected that at the time of each of the recorded incidents of domestic abuse, he had been intoxicated on alcohol. As he has matured and reflected on past mistakes, and also after having attended AOD counselling as part of the Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment, [he] described having made changes to his alcohol use.


	
	According to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, CHZ scored towards the lower end of the range for medium level of alcohol programs that are most appropriate for simple advice focused on the reduction of hazardous drinking. According to Ms Hare, scores at this level are not considered suggestive of alcohol dependence, although some reduction would be advised.
	
	
	In terms of CHZ’s ability to manage his anger, Mr Hare stated that:
	


During the past seven or eight years, CHZ advised that he has achieved adequate management of his anger, identifying that he rarely becomes enraged. He reported awareness of warning signs that he is becoming angry, including: angry rumination, increased alcohol use as a means of coping; telling himself ‘comfortable stories’ to convince himself he is right, and physical symptoms comprising racing heart and pacing. In terms of coping mechanisms, CHZ reported if he noted the presence of aforementioned warning signs, he would talk to his brother or a close friend, walk his dog, spend time with his children as a form of distraction, and/or walk away and engage in positive self-talk, for example, telling himself to ‘be the better person.’ Thus CHZ was able to outline both cognitive and behavioural strategies to manage his anger, and overall, he presented with a good level of insight… [A]t the time we met, CHZ appeared to present with psychological resilience. He further reported improved feelings of self-worth during the past couple of years since successfully completing… educational courses, and engaging in his current employment, which provides a sense of meaning and purpose.


	
	According to Ms Hare, CHZ presents a low to moderate risk of engaging in violence towards an intimate partner in the future. This risk would be reduced to low if the 2014 allegation (in relation to calls and texts to his ex-girlfriend) were rejected. According to Ms Hare, CHZ presents a low risk of engaging in violence towards others (including children). As CHZ is not currently engaged in an intimate relationship, it is Ms Hare’s opinion that any risk of CHZ engaging in violence towards a partner is not imminent at this time.
	
	
	Ms Hare gave the following assessment of CHZ:
	


CHZ presents with good insight into his past difficulties, and he is aware of the ways in which repeating his actions could harm children. He has alleviated the key dynamic risk enhancing factors from his past and is able to provide examples of appropriate coping mechanisms that he uses currently. Whilst I acknowledge that his history constitutes a pattern of harmful behaviour, and this means that a conclusion of ‘no risk’ cannot be offered, I believe the risk of harm he poses to children is reduced and highly specific, that is, confined to psychological risk to children residing with the context of a familial unit consisting of CHZ and a partner. This situation would largely not be managed by refusal of a [Working With Children Check clearance]. Thus, I am unable to offer any reasons from a psychological risk assessment perspective why CHZ should not be granted a [Working With Children Check clearance.


	
	Ms Hare gave oral evidence at hearing. She told the Tribunal that she was not aware that the applicant had any underlying or ongoing mental health problems. She confirmed her view that the applicant was mindful of his intake of alcohol and had a good level of insight. By insight, she meant that the applicant can identify behavioural and cognitive strategies to assist himself. She told the Tribunal that he had good extended family support.
	
	
	She agreed with the proposition that there was no evidence that the applicant has ever presented a risk to children outside of the home. The only risk he might pose to children inside the home would be the observation or impact of their mother being a victim of domestic violence.
	
	
	She agreed that by drinking seven and a half standard drinks on a Saturday night, the applicant was in a ‘hazardous’ level according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and confirmed that he had scored in the moderate level for the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.
	
	
	Ms Hare told the Tribunal that she was of the opinion that the applicant did have some insight into the effect of domestic violence on victims. She agreed that the applicant did not seem to have as developed an awareness of the effect of domestic violence on children and seemed to have some lack of consideration that they would not be impacted simply because they didn’t see it happen. She noted, however, that in their interview, the applicant had agreed that the children may have been ‘mentally impacted’ by the domestic violence although he maintained that the children had never witnessed any violence.
	
	
	In agreeing that the applicant had been approved to be a foster carer in 2012, Ms Hare noted that the applicant’s last incident of domestic violence had been in 2009 and that there had been no subsequent reports of domestic violence.
	
	
	In relation to the allegations that in 2014, the applicant had sent 200 texts to his ex-girlfriend, Ms Hare told the Tribunal that when she had challenged the applicant about this he had provided the context for the messages and had denied harassing her.

finding and reasons


	
	The Tribunal ""must consider"" those factors set out in section 30 (1) of the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act in determining an application under Part 4 of the Act, which includes this application.
	


The seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused an assessment and a refusal of a clearance or imposition of an interim bar – s30(1)(a)


	
	The applicant is not a disqualified person. The trigger offences that caused an assessment and a refusal of a Working With Children Check clearance were the applicant’s history of domestic violence offences against two of his former partners. The offences, which were committed in 1997, 2006 and 2009, were serious.
	
	
	On the evidence before it, the Tribunal accepts that the circumstances of the first 1997 offence involved the applicant grabbing the sleeve of his ex-girlfriend’s shirt to pull her down to talk to him, grabbing hold of her necklace until it had broken and slapping her on the ear. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant subsequently breached the Apprehended Violence Order made against him as a result of this earlier offence.
	
	
	In relation to the 2006 offence, the Tribunal notes that the file contains a fact sheet alleging that the applicant threw an empty bottle at his ex-wife, missing her head, and punched her in the face. There is no record of interview contained on file for this offence nor did the respondent put to the applicant in cross-examination that this had occurred. In the absence of further information, the Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant physically assaulted his former wife such that he was able to be convicted not simply of common assault but rather of the most serious offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In relation to the 2009 offence, a facts sheet is contained on file alleging that the applicant followed his ex-wife to her home and punched her with a closed fist. The applicant was not cross-examined about the circumstances of the offence nor was it put to him that the information in the fact sheet was correct. For this reason, the Tribunal gives limited weight to the material in the fact sheet. The Tribunal does accept, however, that the behaviour of the applicant on this occasion was such to found convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stalk/intimidate intend fear of physical/mental harm and enter enclosed land without lawful excuse, for which he was sentenced to 200 hours of community service.
	


The period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred - s30 (1)(b)


	
	The applicant’s last offence was in 2009.
	
	
	In 2014, the applicant’s ex-girlfriend complained that the applicant had ‘received about 200 text messages from him.’ She declined to make a police statement in relation to the complaint.
	
	
	The applicant agreed that he had sent messages to his ex-girlfriend. He agreed that some were nasty but told the Tribunal that none were threatening. He gave evidence that some of the messages had been sent in an attempt to get back his bond from his former apartment. When approached by the police, he had agreed not to harass his ex-girlfriend.
	
	
	On the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that in sending his ex-girlfriend the relevant text messages he was engaging in stalking or intimidating behaviour. The Tribunal accepts the submission by the applicant’s solicitor, Mr Madden, that there did not appear to be a substantial increase in text messages sent by the applicant during the period in question, when compared to the previous billing period. The Tribunal also accepts that the evidence does not show that the applicant sent 200 text messages to his ex-girlfriend in the period from the time of their break up until 16 May, including 27 phone calls in one evening. The ex-girlfriend did not provide a statement to clarify the complaint nor did she give evidence before the Tribunal. The evidence contained in the material received by the telephone company is that the applicant made only eight calls to the ex-girlfriend’s number that evening. On the evidence before it, the Tribunal is unable to give any weight to the submission that in telephoning his ex-girlfriend following their break-up in 2014, including during the early hours of the morning, the applicant was engaging in stalking or intimidatory behaviour.
	
	
	There is no dispute that in 2012, the applicant was approved as a kinship carer for a fifteen-year-old girl (‘the foster child’). Whilst the foster placement lasted only five months, no criticism of the applicant is made about this. Indeed, the applicant’s evidence to the Tribunal that is that in the course of the placement, the foster child drank alcohol with friends while the applicant was away from his house and that, on two occasions, the foster child had caused substantial damage to his house. After the first occasion, CHZ gave her another chance but on the second occasion, he decided he couldn’t continue with the placement.
	
	
	CHZ’s evidence is undisputed that he still speaks to the foster child, that he had apologised to her because he didn’t think he had ‘done a good job’ and that it had been the hardest thing for him to ‘tell her she couldn’t come back.’
	
	
	CHZ’s account of the foster placement, which was not disputed, impressed the Tribunal. It demonstrated CHZ’s relatively recent ability to manage, without resorting to anger or violence, the aftermath of the destruction of his house and property within it. For the Tribunal, it carries great weight in an assessment of CHZ’s personal development in recent years and his success in anger management.
	
	
	In recent years, the applicant has completed a Certificate IV in Community Services. He was placed in an indigenous organisation where he has continued to work and where he is seen as a loyal and dedicated employee.
	


Section 30(1)(c) The age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred


	
	The applicant was born in 1976 and is now 40 years old. The first offences occurred in 1997 when the applicant was 20 years old and the last offence occurred in 2009 when the applicant was 32 years old.
	


The age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim-s30 (1)(d)


	
	The two victims were the former partners of the applicant. Their ages are unknown.
	


The difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person -s30 (1)(e)


	
	The difference in ages is unknown and, the Tribunal accepts, irrelevant to the determination of this application for review.
	


Whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known that the victim was a child-s30 (1)(f)


	
	The victims were not children. There is nothing before the Tribunal to dispute the applicant’s evidence that his children were never present when the applicant was violent towards their mother and were not aware of their father’s violent behaviour towards their mother.
	
	
	The Tribunal accepts, however, that it is likely that their father’s violence towards their mother has had an impact upon the children.
	


The person's present age - s30 (1)(g)


	
	The applicant is now 40 years old.
	


The seriousness of the person's total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the offences occurred -s30 (1)(h)


	
	The Tribunal accepts that that the applicant has a serious record of domestic violence against two of his intimate partners, which has resulted in several criminal convictions, as outlined above, and numerous apprehended domestic violence orders.
	
	
	As outlined above and on the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal has given no weight to the submission that his telephone calls and texts to his ex-girlfriend in 2014 amounted to stalking behaviour by the applicant.
	
	
	The Tribunal similarly gives no weight to the allegations that in 2005, the applicant threatened to burn his ex-wife’s house down, to hurt himself and his children by driving his car into a tree and by threatening his ex-wife that she wouldn’t see the children again. CHZ denied ever having said this and although his ex-wife had provided a reference in support of CHZ in these proceedings, in which she gave her telephone number and offered to answer any further queries, she was not required for cross-examination by the Children’s Guardian.
	
	
	The Tribunal gives weight to the glowing endorsement of the applicant by his employer who had assessed him as a ‘low risk’ and who describes him as a loyal and committed employee.
	
	
	The Tribunal also gives weight to the fact that in 2012, the applicant was approved by the Department of Family and Community Services as a kinship placement. Although the placement ceased after 5 months, the Tribunal was impressed by the way in which the applicant explained how he dealt with the damage sustained to his house by the foster child. From his evidence, the Tribunal was satisfied that in recent years, the applicant has learnt and applied strategies to manage his anger. The Tribunal was also impressed by the steps that he has taken to lower his alcohol input and to improve his relationship with his ex-wife, such that they are able to successfully co-parent their children.
	


The likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition -s30 (1)(i)


	
	On the evidence before it, and given that the Tribunal has given no weight to the allegations that the applicant engaged in stalking or intimidating behaviour in 2014, the Tribunal accepts the opinion of Ms Hare that the applicant has a low risk of the applicant engaging in violence towards an intimate partner in the future and does not present an imminent risk of this. The Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant has lowered his alcohol intake and now only drinks one evening a week, generally on a Saturday night.
	
	
	The Tribunal accepts that when drinking, the applicant may drink up to seven standard drinks - or more, on exceptional occasions – and accepts the evidence that this reflects a binge pattern of alcohol use at a volume that is outside recommended healthy limits. The Tribunal also accepts that on the basis of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test administered by Ms Hare, the applicant’s drinking falls in the lower end on the scale of hazardous drinking. The Tribunal accepts that were the applicant to engage in any violence against an intimate partner, his children might well be impacted by this.
	
	
	The Tribunal accepts, however, that the applicant now has insight into his past behaviour and has made significant progress with his education, the reduction of his alcohol intake, his employment and his ongoing relationship with the mother of his children.
	
	
	In 2012, he was approved by the Department of Family and Community Services as a foster carer and there is nothing before the Tribunal to indicate that any concerns about him were raised during the foster placement.
	
	
	His last conviction was 2009 and since this time, the evidence is that he has worked hard to establish a working and co-operative relationship with the mother of his children and that he has gained the respect and praise of his employer.
	
	
	His evidence and that of his ex-wife is that he is a devoted and supportive father to his children. There is nothing before the Tribunal to dispute this.
	


Any information given by the applicant in, or in relation to the application – s30 (1)(j)


	
	The applicant submitted that weight should be given to the fact that:
	



	
	he has never physically disciplined his children; and
	
	
	his academic results have been impressive;
	
	
	his employer assessed him to be a ‘low risk.’;
	
	
	he is ambitious in his work and wishes to be promoted to a training role with his current employer;
	
	
	he has taken steps to reduce his alcohol intake;
	
	
	in 2012, he was assessed by the Department of Family and Community Services to be a suitable foster carer. In making this assessment the Department of Family and Community Services was using similar criteria to that to be applied by this Tribunal; and
	
	
	Ms Hare assessed the applicant as being ‘nil risk to children outside the family.’
	



	
	On the evidence before it and having given consideration to those issues highlighted by the applicant, the Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant has a positive and interactive relationship with his children and has taken steps to address his earlier offending behaviour.
	


Any other matters that the Children's Guardian considers necessary –s30 (1)(k)


	
	It is the submission of the Children’s Guardian that when considered as a whole, CHZ’s conduct amounts to a real and appreciable risk to children.
	
	
	The Children’s Guardian submitted that weight should be given to:
	



	
	his history of domestic violence against intimate partners and the risk that he will re-offend towards anyone who angers him;
	
	
	the fact that he still drinks to a ‘moderate level of hazardous drinking’;
	
	
	the allegation that he sent 200 text messages to his ex-girlfriend in 2014;
	
	
	the lack of insight displayed by the applicant in relation to the effect of harm caused to children by the application of domestic violence to their mother.
	



	
	In consideration each of these submissions, the Tribunal accepts that weight should be given to the seriousness of the applicant’s criminal record and that in considering the risk that he will re-offend, his alcohol consumption should be taken into account.
	
	
	The Tribunal is mindful that its jurisdiction in this application is protective and not punitive in nature. On the evidence before it, the Tribunal accepts that the applicant’s history of violence against intimate partners is poor. The Tribunal is also satisfied that the applicant’s last conviction was in 2009 and that since this time, the applicant has undertaken further study and has successfully found further employment following the closure of the company where he had been previously employed. The evidence of both the applicant and his ex-wife is that he is a committed and loving father to his children. Although a complaint was made to the police by the applicant’s ex-girlfriend about texts sent to her and calls made to her after their break-up, the ex-girlfriend declined to make a statement or an application for an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order. The evidence before the Tribunal is that numerous calls were made to settle a dispute involving a rental bond paid by the applicant. In the absence of evidence from the ex-girlfriend to clarify the nature of the calls or further evidence of action taken in relation to them, the Tribunal has not given any weight to these allegations.
	


Conclusion


	
	In this case, a Working With Children Check clearance must be granted to the applicant unless the Tribunal is satisfied that he poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	As set out above, the evidence before the Tribunal is that, whilst the applicant has a criminal record involving violence towards two intimate partners, it is now eight years since his last offence. Since this time, the Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant has established an amiable and constructive relationship with the mother of his children, who has provided a letter in support of the applicant’s application for a Working With Children Check clearance.
	
	
	On the evidence before it, the Tribunal accepts that the applicant was approved by the Department of Family and Community Services as a foster carer and is a committed and loving father to his children.
	
	
	For the reasons set out above, no weight has been given to the 2014 complaint made by the applicant’s ex-girlfriend. On this basis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant has a low risk of engaging in violence against an intimate partner and does not pose a real and appreciate risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, and taking into account the matters set out in s30(1) and s15(4) of the Act, the Tribunal considers that the preferable decision is that the applicant does not pose a risk to the safety of children and should therefore receive a Working With Children Check clearance.
	


Order


	
	The decision of the Children’s Guardian dated 13 November 2015 to refuse the applicant’s Working With Children Check clearance is set aside.
	
	
	In substitution for that decision, the following decision is made: The applicant is granted a Working With Children Check clearance.

He is due to be removed from Perth to Beirut in Lebanon, at some time tomorrow.  By proceedings urgently commenced in this Court last week, he and his mother now seek urgent relief to restrain the Commonwealth from deporting him.  For the reasons which follow, that application for an injunction should be refused.2    The Second Applicant, Ms Alia Hamade, and the First Applicant, Mr Said Hamade, arrived in Australia on 21 March 1974 from Lebanon.  Mr Hamade is the son of Ms Hamade.  At the time of their arrival in 1974, he was 14 months old.  He is now 43 years old.  Ms Hamade, some years after her arrival, made an application for Australian citizenship which was dated 22 September 1980.  On the application form which she completed, Ms Hamade also applied for citizenship on behalf of three of her children, including Mr Hamade, who was, at the time that the application was made, seven years old.3    Before dealing with the remaining facts, it is useful to note some aspects of the legal regime surrounding the grant of citizenship as at the time Ms Hamade made the application in September 1980.  At that time, citizenship was regulated by the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (Cth) (now repealed) (‘the Act’).  As at 1980, insofar as the present topic is concerned, it contained provisions which were relevant to her application as follows.4    First, s 13 of the Act authorised a person who met the relevant eligibility to apply to the Minister for a grant of citizenship.  The provisions of s 13 are not pertinent to the present debate except insofar as they concern one matter, to which I will return later in these reasons.  More significant are those provisions which dealt with the making of citizenship applications on behalf of persons under the age of 16.  Relevantly, s 14(9) provided that:‘The Minister may, upon application in the approved form, include in a certificate of Australian citizenship, either at the time of the granting the certificate or by later amending the certificate, the name of a child who has not attained the age of sixteen years, and of whom the grantee is the responsible parent or guardian.’5    The expression ‘responsible parent’ was in turn defined in s 5(1) of the Act to mean:‘…in relation to a child, means the father of that child or, where the father is dead or the mother has been given the custody of the child by order of a court, or the child was born out of wedlock and resides with the mother, means the mother of that child.’6    Also relevant to the present discussion are ss 15(1)(b) and 15(4).  Section 15(1)(b) provided:‘A person to whom a certificate of Australian citizenship has been granted under this Division shall be an Australian citizen –…(b)     in the case of a person who has not attained the age of sixteen years or a person to whom sub-section (2) of section 14 applies – as from the date upon which the certificate is granted.’7    Subsection (4) provided:‘A person whose name is, under sub-section (9) of section 14, included in a certificate of Australian citizenship shall, if not already an Australian citizen, be an Australian citizen as from the date upon which his name is so included or the date upon which the grantee of the certificate of Australian citizenship becomes an Australian citizen, whichever is the later.’8    Those provisions, it will be seen, at this stage created a regime under which a person applying for Australian citizenship could include upon their application their children, but only if the parent in question was either the father or the mother having obtained a relevant custody order.9    I now turn to some matters which are controversial between the parties.  Having made the application for citizenship on 22 September 1980, Ms Hamade was eventually summoned for an interview with a reviewing officer.  This interview took place on 13 November 1980.  As a result of that interview, a document was completed which consisted of an interview report.  The interview report had two non-citizen children listed upon it which appear to have been deleted by handwriting.  It appears that Ms Hamade has signed the document, certifying the information on it to be correct.  Then there are some comments at the end of the document which the Respondent  submits say:‘Ppt [passport] verified, wants application [sic] proceed without children.’10    It is also relevant to note that the person conducting the interview has ticked the box marked ‘yes’ next to question 15, which was:‘Can the applicant carry on a general conversation in English?’11    One reading of this document might be that because Ms Hamade was the mother of the children, and because s 5(1) of the Act did not define a ‘responsible parent’ to include, for the purposes of a citizenship application, the mother – that during the course of the interview, the inability of Ms Hamade to include the children upon her citizenship application was brought to her attention, and with her agreement, the children were removed from it.  However, this is controversial, as I have said, between the parties.12    In an affidavit filed in these proceedings, Ms Hamade gave evidence about what she says took place at that meeting.  She says that she utilised the services of an interpreter in the course of the process and that she made it clear that she wished her children to be included in the application.  She says that she was not told that her children would not obtain citizenship, and she believed at the end of the process that her children were included in the application.  13    Plainly there is a contradiction between what can be inferred from the form and the evidence of Ms Hamade.  Indeed, there is an anterior dispute as to whether the handwriting on the form is, in fact, to be interpreted as the Minister suggests or whether it might have some other meaning.  It is an aspect also of Ms Hamade’s account that she did not remove the names of her children from her application form, with the further implication, one would think, that this was done by someone else without her approval.14    In the circumstances, I propose to assume that it is reasonably arguable that the evidence of Ms Hamade could establish at trial that her children were not removed from the application by her, and that she was not told at any stage that they were not included in her application form.  To put that matter another way, I propose to assume that in relation to this factual controversy between the Minister and the Applicants – that the Applicants have a triable case.15    Now, the effect of section 5(1) and the definition of ‘responsible parent’ was, as I have already indicated, to have the effect that Ms Hamade was unable to apply, as she had on 22 September 1980, to include the children on her citizenship application.  This is because at that time, she did not fall within the definition of a ‘responsible parent’, not being the father of the child and not being a mother who had obtained custody of the child by a court order.16    On 16 February 1981, however, Ms Hamade was granted custody of her children by a Court of Petty Sessions sitting at Campsie.  This was not a matter which she drew to the Minister’s attention.  On 28 April 1981, the relevant Departmental official certified that Ms Hamade’s application for citizenship was now ready for ministerial approval.  Of course, by the time that had occurred, Ms Hamade had obtained custody of her children and was therefore within the definition of a ‘responsible parent’ under s 5(1) of the Act.  Consequently, had this matter been drawn to the attention of the Minister, and having regard to the text of s 14(9), it is possible that the Minister could have included on any certificate of citizenship issued by him to Ms Hamade, her children; that is to say, it would have been within his authority to do so.  17    On 13 May 1981, the Minister in fact granted approval for Ms Hamade’s grant of citizenship;  and on 8 October 1981, the Minister granted Ms Hamade citizenship by means of a certificate.  The certificate does not have the names of Ms Hamade’s children upon it.  This is consistent, I suppose, with the deletion of her children from the application form.  It remains, however, a significant factual matter at the heart of the present application.  18    It’s now useful at least in the first instance, to outline the Applicants’ argument for an injunction.  19    First, it is submitted that Ms Hamade had not withdrawn her children from the application made on 22 September 1980.  To the extent that the children appear to have been deleted from the form which had been signed by her, I have accepted as a triable issue whether that is in fact so or whether instead the children were deleted from the form by someone without her authority.  20    Secondly, it is said that at the time the Minister approved her citizenship application on 13 May 1981, the fact was that, by reason of the custody orders having been obtained before that date, she was a ‘responsible parent’ within the meaning of s 5.  Therefore, it followed that the Minister had jurisdiction under s 14(9) to include her children on the eventual grant of a certificate of citizenship.  The Applicants went further than this, however, and submitted that where in s 14(9) the word ‘may’ appeared, in fact it was to be interpreted as meaning ‘must’.  21    The effect of this was that because Ms Hamade satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of s 14(9) by reason of being a ‘responsible parent’, and because the duty which arose on the satisfaction of that condition precedent was mandatory in terms, Ms Hamade had been entitled, as a matter of law, to have her children included in her certificate when it was eventually issued to her.  The Applicants put the legal defects which arose from this state of affairs on two different bases.  First of all, it was said that the issue of the certificate of citizenship without the children being present upon it amounted to a refusal of an application to include the children upon it.  It was then said this decision should be quashed, and it was said that mandamus should issue to require the Minister now to comply with the imperative duty under s 14(9) to include the children upon the application.  22    Secondly, it was said that it was unreasonable in the legal sense for the Minister to proceed, as he had, because Ms Hamade had been told at the time of the interview, on 13 November 1980, that her citizenship would automatically transfer to her children or that she had not been told that they had been removed from the application form.  This was also said to give rise to a right to quash the refusal decision and to mandamus.  The Applicants also submitted they were entitled to declaratory relief which would put them in the same position they would have been in if the application had included the children on it originally.23     It is now necessary to mention a few other facts.  Ms Hamade received her citizenship certificate on 8 October 1981, but as I have already noted, it did not have her children on it at that time.  I am prepared to infer that this must have been obvious to her, and she would have been aware from October 1981 that her children had not been included upon her citizenship certificate.24    The evidence shows that following that, she did not seek to take any steps that would have fixed that situation.  In particular, she did not correspond with the Department, suggesting that the children she believed had been included on her application had been left off.  Nor did she apply under s 14(9), as she easily could have, to have her citizenship certificate amended so that the children were included upon it.  Throughout the remainder of Mr Hamade’s childhood therefore, it appears that no steps were taken to vindicate what Ms Hamade now says was the case in relation to her application in 1980.  No real explanation has been put before me as to why that is so.  It is also necessary to note that on 6 February 1991 Mr Hamade applied for Australian citizenship.  One can infer from that, that at the time, he must have been aware that he was not an Australian citizen.  That application was refused on 17 September 1991 due to an undeclared adverse police record.25    It seems to me that Mr Hamade has been aware for a number of years, including up to 1991, that he was not of Australian citizenship.  He applied for example, for a Return Resident Visa in 1997 and, at that time, travelled on a Lebanese passport, relying on that visa to re-enter Australia on a number of occasions.  The point of those observations is to underscore that Mr Hamade has been aware for  many years of his citizenship status, and yet, has never taken any steps to bring the argument advanced today forward for resolution until  very recently last year.  It is also relevant to note that, commencing in 1991, Mr Hamade began upon a series of criminal activities which resulted in his conviction for various offences.  His most recent conviction was in June 2010, as a result of which he was sentenced to nine years' and five years' imprisonment respectively in relation to two different charges.  The charges were of a serious nature.  26    The fact that he was imprisoned for periods in excess of 12 months brought him within the scope of the operation of s 501(3A) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which provides for the cancellation of visas of non-citizens who have failed what is termed ‘the character test’.  In this case, as a result of the operation of that provision and the exercise of a ministerial consideration, his visa was cancelled with effect from 19 December 2014.  He sought revocation of that decision on 20 January 2015, but on 18 August 2015, the Minister decided not to revoke that cancellation.  Thereafter, Mr Hamade applied for a protection visa which was refused and that refusal was confirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 30 September 2016.  It will follow from the account I have just given, that Mr Hamade has been in immigration detention since 15 January 2015 when he was released from prison.  27    As I have said, I propose to refuse the application for an injunction.  If Mr Hamade is right in all of his submissions in relation to the operation of the law and in relation to the factual contentions involving what occurred at the interview with his mother in November 1981, it seems to me that it would follow that Ms Hamade’s application to have her two children included upon her certificate of Australian citizenship would effectively remain unresolved.  Left in a vacuum, it would appear that an obligation would arise to have the Minister consider that application.  The 1948 Act has now been repealed and replaced by the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (Cth).  Schedule 3 to the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 (Cth) contains transitional provisions designed to regulate, inter alia, the status of applications made under the now repealed 1948 Act.  Subitem 7(2) of schedule 3 provides:‘If a person’s application (the old application) made under section 13 … of the old Act had not been decided immediately before the commencement day, the old application is, on and from the commencement day, taken to be an application (a new application) to become an Australian citizen made under section 21 of the new Act.’28    I mentioned earlier in these reasons, without setting out its full text, s 13 which is referred to in this subitem.  As I said then, s 13 was the provision which authorised a person under the 1948 Act to apply for citizenship.  The effect, therefore, of subitem 7(2) is that Ms Hamade’s application under s 13 of the Act (and with it the operation of section 14(9)) is therefore taken to be an application now under the 2007 statute.  29    Section 21 of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (Cth) deals with applications for citizenship.  Section 21(2) provides:‘21  Application and eligibility for citizenship…(2)    A person is eligible to become an Australian citizen if the Minister is satisfied that the person:(a)    is aged 18 or over at the time the person made the application; and(b)    is a permanent resident:(i)    at the time the person made the application; and(ii)    at the time of the Minister’s decision on the application; and(c)    satisfies the general residence requirement (see section 22)    or the special residence requirement (see section 22A or 22B), or satisfies the defence service requirement (see section 23), at the time the person made the application; and(d)    understands the nature of an application under subsection (1); and(e)    possesses a basic knowledge of the English language; and(f)    has an adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship; and(g)    is likely to reside, or to continue to reside, in Australia or to maintain a close and continuing association with Australia if the application were to be approved; and(h)    is of good character at the time of the Minister’s decision on the application.’…30    It will be seen from subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) that it is an eligibility requirement that at the time the Minister determines the application, that the person involved should be a permanent resident.  In this case, as things presently stand, because Mr Hamade’s visa has been revoked, he is not a permanent resident.  It follows that he is not eligible under s 21 for citizenship and that, accordingly, even assuming that the word ‘may’ in s 14(9) of the 1948 Act means ‘must’, it is nevertheless, legally impossible for the Minister to grant Mr Hamade citizenship because he is not eligible, not being resident.  This seems to me to be a complete answer to the main thrust of the Applicants’ submissions in this Court.  However, one possible answer to that problem, which was explored during the course of argument, was either that this Court should order the Minister to comply with his duty under s 14(9) with retrospective effect from 1981 or, if that was thought to be inappropriate, this Court should declare that the names of the children had, in fact, been included on the certificate.  31    This last step was said to be appropriate because it would be simply a vindication of the situation which ought to have occurred if, on the Applicants’ arguments, the legal duties which they contended existed, had been complied with.  It is useful, I think, to examine these related submissions separately.  32    Insofar as a retrospective mandamus or corresponding order under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (‘the AD(JR) Act’) is concerned, there may well be arguments that such a remedy is not known, either at common law or under statute.  So far as the common law is concerned, there is very little learning about whether it is possible to grant mandamus having a retrospective effect: but cf. Save Our Suburbs (SOS) NSW Inc v Electoral Commissioner of New South Wales [2002] NSWSC 785; (2002) 55 NSWLR 642 at 657-58 [41]-[44] per Burchett AJ.  Likewise, the text of s 16 of the AD(JR) Act does not necessarily indicate any ability of the Court to grant an order that something should be done with retrospective effect.  33    There may be some rather difficult issues involved in a consideration of that question.  I think for present purposes, however, they do not arise.  In this case, it would be impossible for the Minister to comply with a retrospective order, whether by way of prerogative writ or under the AD(JR) Act.  If the Court were to order the Minister to take the step of including the names of the children on the application for citizenship in 1980, or 1981 when the certificate was issued, this is simply not something the Minister can do; because although the powers of the Minister under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) are broad indeed, they are not so broad as to allow for time travel.  The fact is that the certificate which was issued does not have the names upon it and it did not have the names of the children upon it in 1981 when it was issued.  There is, subject to the issue of a declaration, nothing that the Minister can do about that state of affairs and, consequently, there is nothing this Court could order the Minister to do about that state of affairs.34    Perhaps as a backstop against that difficulty, Mr Ahmad, who appeared for the Applicants and put their case with concision and force, submitted that the same result might be achieved by means of a declaration.  Here the argument was that, although the Court might not order the Minister to take those steps in 1981, nevertheless, it might declare that the names of the children had been included on the certificate as at that date.  Again, however, I do not think that it would be possible for the Court to declare something factually to be the case at a particular time which is simply factually not the case.  It is a fact that the names of the children were not on the certificate in 1981.  This Court cannot declare something which did not happen to have happened.  I would accept that the Court could probably declare, if it accepted every other aspect of Mr Ahmad’s argument, that the names of the children ought to have been included upon the certificate, but that is a different declaration and it would not be enough, for present purposes, so far as the injunction application is concerned.  35    If the only declaration which were made were one that the children ought to have been included on the application form, then that would not be an answer to the Minister’s present contention that the children are not included on the certificate.  So I do not accept that either the retrospective mandamus or declaration alternative arguments are sufficient to avoid the impact of the transitional provisions.  That is sufficient to dispose of the Applicants’ argument.  36    I would say, however, that I would not have accepted, had it been necessary to consider it, a critical part in that argument.  That aspect was the submission that the word ‘may’ in s 14(9) of the Act meant ‘must’.  There are, of course, cases where the word ‘may’ has been interpreted to mean ‘must’.  In every case, it becomes necessary to examine the particular statutory regime under consideration.  Here, it seems to me, the statutory regime of the Act clearly evinced an intention that, in this case, ‘may’ confers a discretion.  There are three reasons why that seems to me to be clear.37    The first is that a consideration of the terms of the legislation shows that the Act evinces a significant intention that the granting of citizenship is an act of high formality.  Thus, in the case of adults who are granted citizenship, it’s not only necessary that the Minister must accede to the application, but it is necessary also that the applicant take an oath before an appropriate person.  So too, where the position of minors is concerned, the Act seems to me to place considerable emphasis upon the need for a certificate which is appropriately endorsed.  So one sees, for example, in  ss 14(9), 15(1)(b) and 15(4).  38    Secondly, consideration of the subject matter, purpose and scope of the Act shows that to construe the word ‘may’ as meaning ‘must’ in s 14(9) could have most undesirable consequences.  From time to time, applications for citizenship are refused on character grounds and sometimes on national security grounds.  It would be surprising if the Minister was ever placed in a situation where he or she was legally obliged to grant citizenship.  It would mean, for example, under s 14(9), that the Minister would not be able to refuse to include a child upon a responsible parent’s application where the Minister had reason to believe that the child failed the character test or was a threat to national security. That would be a surprising interpretation of the legislation.  39    Thirdly, although it did not deal directly with the current provision, effectively a very similar argument was rejected by this Court in Andary v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1380 at [21] to [22] per Kiefel J, as her Honour then was.  At [22] her Honour said:‘In the present case, one assumes that the applicant’s father was not, at the time he took citizenship, the ‘responsible parent’.  Whilst it was obviously intended that in many cases children were to automatically acquire the status of a citizen on a grant of it to their parent, the inclusion of their name was a matter of discretion for the Minister.  In this statutory context it is not possible to imply an intention that every child was, automatically, to become a citizen.  In the applicant’s case his status, as the holder of an entry permit for an indefinite term, was maintained until his mother, as the responsible parent during his minority, obtained citizenship, and the Minister included his name on her certificate, or until he was in a positon to apply for citizenship himself.’40    Although her Honour was not directly dealing with s 14(9), that reasoning is consistent with the conclusion I otherwise would reach in relation to the statutory provisions.  Consequently, I do not accept what seems to me to be a pivotal part of Mr Ahmad’s argument that the word ‘may’ means ‘must’, so that upon satisfying the Court of the other matters in their application, the Applicants were entitled for orders to compel the inclusion of Mr Hamade’s name on the certificate.  For those reasons, I am not satisfied that there is a reasonably arguable case that the Applicants would succeed on at trial.  41    It is then useful just to note some discretionary and balance of convenience issues.  Even if I had been satisfied that there was a reasonably arguable case for a trial, I would still have refused to grant injunctive relief as a matter of discretion.  In this case, Mr Hamade has been well aware of his citizenship difficulties since at least 1991.  We know this because he applied for citizenship in 1991 and he has subsequently applied for visas.  The time to ventilate the current debate was many years ago and is not the day before he is being deported from the country.  42    That would have been a sufficient reason in itself to refuse the application.  I do not consider that the seriousness of the offences in respect of which he was convicted would constitute a reason for refusing relief.  I have not set out the nature of those offences which are serious.  The reason I do not think their seriousness relates to a relevant discretionary matter is because the nature of the Applicants’ argument, if accepted, will render irrelevant any consideration of his character.  The way their argument has been framed, they do not seek to have the Minister exercise any discretion in their favour.  Their argument rises as high as a contention that the Minister must declare Mr Hamade to be a citizen with effect from 1981, when his mother was made a citizen.  In that situation, the question of the character test, were that argument accepted, would not arise.  It seems to me, therefore, that those offences are not relevant to the exercise of my discretion.  43    However, another reason I would have rejected the application is because there is no reason that Mr Hamade cannot pursue this application from Lebanon if he is so advised.  As Ms Watson for the Minister very pointedly submitted, this is perhaps unlike a normal deportation case which happens at the end of protection visa proceedings.  In this case, because the legal right which is sought to be vindicated by the Applicants is, in fact, a right of citizenship for Mr Hamade, it would be possible for him to pursue these proceedings once he has returned to Lebanon.  If he is ultimately successful in them, he will be an Australian citizen and he will have a right to return to this country, as such.  Therefore, even if I had thought that the other matters could be addressed, I would nevertheless have refused relief on a balance of convenience basis.  Therefore, I refuse the injunction application.  44    I refuse it because I am not satisfied there is a reasonably arguable case, because there has been unexplained delay in the bringing of the application, and because the balance of convenience does not require the issuing of the injunction, since Mr Hamade can pursue these proceedings from overseas.  Accordingly, I refuse the application with costs.I certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Perram.Associate:    Dated:    24 April 2017",2017-04-18 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

The Minister recorded that the applicant had made representations about revocation of the visa cancellation decision in accordance with the invitation given under s 501CA(3)(b) and the Minister was not satisfied that the applicant passed the character test. Nor was the Minister satisfied that there was another reason why the original decision should be revoked. It is this condition of revocation which is the subject of the present judicial review proceedings: see s 501CA(4), set out at [4] below.The legislation4    The relevant provisions of the Migration Act were as follows:501CA    Cancellation of visa—revocation of decision under subsection 501(3A) (person serving sentence of imprisonment)(1)    This section applies if the Minister makes a decision (the original decision) under subsection 501(3A) (person serving sentence of imprisonment) to cancel a visa that has been granted to a person.(2)    For the purposes of this section, relevant information is information (other than non-disclosable information) that the Minister considers:(a)    would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for making the original decision; and(b)    is specifically about the person or another person and is not just about a class of persons of which the person or other person is a member.(3)    As soon as practicable after making the original decision, the Minister must:(a)    give the person, in the way that the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances:(i)    a written notice that sets out the original decision; and(ii)    particulars of the relevant information; and(b)    invite the person to make representations to the Minister, within the period and in the manner ascertained in accordance with the regulations, about revocation of the original decision.(4)    The Minister may revoke the original decision if:(a)    the person makes representations in accordance with the invitation; and(b)    the Minister is satisfied:(i)    that the person passes the character test (as defined by section 501); or(ii)    that there is another reason why the original decision should be revoked.(5)    If the Minister revokes the original decision, the original decision is taken not to have been made.(6)    Any detention of the person that occurred during any part of the period:(a)    beginning when the original decision was made; and(b)    ending at the time of the revocation of the original decision;is lawful and the person is not entitled to make any claim against the Commonwealth, an officer or any other person because of the detention.(7)    A decision not to exercise the power conferred by subsection (4) is not reviewable under Part 5 or 7.Note:    For notification of decisions under subsection (4) to not revoke, see section 501G.The Minister’s reasons for decision 5    The Minister provided a statement of reasons of 92 paragraphs for his decision not to revoke the decision to cancel the applicant’s visa. In substance, the Minister was not satisfied that the applicant passed the character test as defined by s 501 with the result that s 501CA(4)(b)(i) was not met, and the Minister was not satisfied that there was “another reason” why the original decision should be revoked. In summary, those reasons were as follows.6    At [12], the Minister set out reasons submitted by the applicant as to why the original decision should be revoked, which included some 15 matters. These 15 matters were: the applicant’s children in Australia who were minors; his minor grandchild; his relationship with his current partner; the maintenance of his important relationship with his father and his father’s family; his criminal history not being high in the scale of seriousness; that he grew up in a physically abusive home with his mother and was a ward of the state from 10-15 years of age; he was manipulated by older adolescents to begin offending in New Zealand; he had always accepted his mistakes and tried to address his problems; alcohol and marijuana had been key factors leading to his offending, however he had not smoked marijuana or consumed alcohol since 2012 and he completed two drug and alcohol programs while imprisoned; regarding his domestic violence offence: he was in the process of separating from his partner, drinking excessively, and smoking a lot of marijuana at the time; as to his driving while disqualified offences, he was trying to work additional hours before the birth of his son and thus made the decision to drive while disqualified; he had now sold his car to eliminate access to a vehicle – he had employment on release from detention and had organised lifts to work.7    The Minister concluded, at [13] that it was in the best interest of the applicant’s children in Australia for the visa cancellation decision to be revoked. The applicant has three minor children in Australia, two from a previous relationship and a child from his current relationship. The Minister also found, at [24] that revocation of the visa cancellation would be in the best interests of the applicant’s one grandchild in Australia.8    The Minister had regard to the strength, nature and duration of the applicant’s ties to Australia. He said that the applicant had resided in Australia for 16 years, having commenced residence as an adult of 26 years. The applicant was convicted of his first offences one year and four months after his arrival.9    At [30], the Minister accepted that non-revocation would impose serious emotional and probably financial hardship on the applicant’s partner if she remained in Australia, noting that the available information did not include any statement from her that she would not be prepared to move to New Zealand with the applicant.10    The Minister had regard to the impediments that the applicant would face if removed from Australia to his home country of New Zealand in establishing himself and maintaining basic living standards.11    At [39], the Minister took into account that the applicant referred to having two children in New Zealand who would now be adults. The applicant described his relationship with them as positive, saying they understand his reasons for leaving New Zealand and they have since visited him in Australia. The Minister found, at [39], that the applicant has ongoing positive relationships with his adult children in New Zealand and that they would be a source of some support.12    At [40], the Minister said he had had regard to the consideration of the protection of the Australian community, noting in particular the applicant’s claims he did not pose an unacceptable risk of reoffending and was rehabilitated. The Minister said he considered the Government’s commitment to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity by non-citizens.13    In the context of his consideration of protecting the Australian community, the Minister considered the applicant’s offences and did so from [41]-[57] of his reasons. The Minister said the applicant had more than 40 convictions in New Zealand and over 60 convictions in Australia. The Minister agreed with the view of the courts that the applicant’s criminal history was a very extensive record and not one that would entitle him to any leniency at all.14    The Minister stated that the applicant had a record of multiple violent offences, including domestic violence assault resulting in bodily harm and assault of police officers. The Minister said that he was of the view that violent offences must generally be considered very serious. The Minister also referred to the applicant’s other criminal history, including assault, dishonesty, drug possession and supply, and driving offences which, he said, should be taken as serious offences.15    The Minister referred to an assault in respect of which the applicant was convicted in 2010, the victim of the assault being the applicant’s partner at the time, and found that that was a very serious offence. The Minister also referred to the applicant’s multiple convictions for assaulting police.16    At [56], the Minister found the cumulative effect of the applicant’s offending further increased the seriousness of his offences, and he took into consideration the considerable burden this placed on Australian legal and law enforcement institutions and accompanying financial cost.17    The Minister therefore formed the opinion that the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s offending was very serious. The Minister noted that the applicant had been previously warned that further criminal offences may result in his visa being cancelled and he continued to re-offend following that warning. At [60], the Minister noted the applicant was convicted of another 10 offences after being formally warned by the Department in 2011 that any further criminal convictions could result in his visa being cancelled in the future.18    The Minister then considered the issue of risk to the Australian community. 19    At [58] and following, the Minister referred to the applicant’s reference to a dysfunctional upbringing and how being made a ward of the state and subsequently falling under the influence of older youths, lead to his initial offending. The Minister accepted that this background contributed to the applicant’s early offending but agreed with the remarks of a judge in 2010 who said “there has to come a time when you stop blaming other things that have happened in your life for your own behaviour and that has to come about now”.20    The Minister found, at [59], on the basis of the applicant’s criminal record, that he displayed an ongoing disregard for Australian law and this is been a consistent feature through his offending history. Courts in both Australia and New Zealand had given the applicant repeated opportunities in the almost 28 years he had been offending, including supervision orders, suspended sentences, periodic detention, fines, and bonds, but he had continued to offend.21    At [72], after reciting evidence as to the applicant’s alcohol and marijuana use, the Minister found that the applicant minimised the seriousness of, and his responsibility for, his offending. He made that finding based on the applicant repeatedly attributing blame for his offences to external factors. The Minister also expressed the view that the applicant may continue offending as he did not consider his offending serious or take responsibility for his own actions.22    The Minister, at [73], noted the applicant’s submission that he was extremely remorseful and will not repeat the mistakes of his past. However, the Minister noted at [74], in each submission the applicant framed his remorse within the context of how his imprisonment and/or detention had impacted on his relationships with his partner and children, rather than considering Australian law, the impact on the community, or the victims of his assaults. The Minister considered that the applicant expressed very similar sentiments in 2011 in his submission in response to his Notice of Intent to Consider Cancellation. The Minister therefore found that the applicant’s remorse did not reflect remorse for his crimes or victims thereof.23    At [80], the Minister found the applicant demonstrated an ongoing disregard and disrespect for Australian law, including court outcomes. The Minister expressed the view that the applicant had been given multiple opportunities by the courts to rehabilitate and address his drug and alcohol issues and he had not complied with the majority of those orders.24    On the basis of the evidence before him, the Minister found, at [82], there was a likelihood the applicant will reoffend and he considered further offending of a violent nature, or further unlicensed or other driving offences by the applicant, could result in physical harm to members of the Australian community.25    The Minister stated his conclusion at [83]-[92]. At [91], the Minister said the following:In reaching my decision about whether I am satisfied that there is another reason why the original decision should be revoked, I concluded that Mr JAMES represents an unacceptable risk of harm to the Australian community and that the protection of the Australian community outweighed the best interests of his children and family members, as a primary consideration, and any other considerations as described above. These include the 16 years he has lived in Australia, having worked for approximately three years, an employment opportunity if released, his bond to his family and Australia, and the hardship Mr JAMES, his family and social networks will endure in the event the original decision is not revoked.The application for judicial review26    The grounds of the application are as follows (emphasis in original):Ground 1The Respondent failed to consider properly how the Applicant’s deprived and disadvantaged background was relevant to assessing the Applicant’s criminality and sentences passed upon the Applicant.Particularsa.    Once a decision-maker selects a particular matter for consideration, he or she is bound to consider that matter properly.b.    The Respondent decided to have regard to the Applicant’s dysfunctional and disadvantaged background (as a child and teenager) in assessing the Applicant’s criminality (para [58]).c.    In having regard to the Applicant’s dysfunctional and disadvantaged background in assessing the Applicant’s criminality, the Respondent erroneously applied an incorrect legal principle; namely, that with the passage of time, the extent to which social deprivation and disadvantage in a person’s youth and background can be taken into account (as related to that person’s criminality) must diminish (para [58]).d.    To consider this matter properly, the Respondent was required to have regard to the correct legal principle; namely, profound deprivation and disadvantage of an offender (as a whole and/or teenager) does not necessarily diminish over time and must be given full weight in considering the offender’s sentence and criminality in every case.Grounds 2-3The making of the proposed decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which the decision was proposed to be made.The exercise of power by the Respondent was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power.Particularsa.    The Respondent misconstrued the mandatory consideration of “risk of harm to the Australian community” under s 501CA(4) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).b.    The Applicant repeats particulars in Ground 1 (c)-(d) above.Ground 4The decision by the Respondent that he had regard to the impediments that the Applicant would face if deported to New Zealand (in establishing himself and maintaining basic living standards) was illogical, irrational, or determined on findings or inferences of fact not supported by logical grounds:Particularsa.    The Respondent found that he had regard to the impediments to the Applicant would face if removed from Australia to New Zealand (para [37]).b.    The Respondent made no finding as to the extent of impediments the Applicant would face if he was deported to New Zealand.c.    Unlike other considerations, the Respondent did not outline what weight he accorded to the consideration of the extent of impediments the Applicant would face if deported (i.e. significant, moderate or limited weight).d.    Accordingly, the balancing process of weighing the “protection of the Australian community” consideration against the “other considerations” (para [91]) lacked a legally defensible foundation in logic.e.    The inference or conclusion drawn by the Respondent that the Applicant’s adult children in New Zealand “would be a source of some support” (para [39]) to the Applicant if he were deported lacks a legally defensible foundation in factual material and/or logic:-    Merely because A has a “positive relationship” with B does not mean B will be a “source of support” to A (para [39]); and-    The nature of the support to be provided by the adult children to the Applicant was not made clear (i.e. financial, emotional or otherwise).Ground 5The Respondent denied the Applicant natural justice or procedural fairness in making the decision:Particularsa.    The Respondent found that the “cumulative effect” of the Applicant’s criminality placed a considerable burden on the Australian legal and law-enforcement institutions and brought about company financial cost (para [56]);b.    The Respondent should have informed the Applicant of the consideration taking into account in Ground 3(a) in advance of making the decision; andc.    Consequently, the Applicant was not given an opportunity to address the adverse conclusion outlined in Ground 3(a).The submissions to this Court27    The applicant did not file written submissions. In oral submissions the applicant said that the effect of the Minister’s decision was to tear him and his family apart. He said he had not seen his children in New Zealand for many years. His family was here. He had paid his debt by doing jail time. If removed to New Zealand, he would not be able to see his infant son.28    In response to the applicant’s oral submissions, counsel for the respondent Minister submitted that the Minister’s statement of reasons showed that the Minister took into account the best interests of the applicant’s minor children, his grandchild, his nieces and nephews and the two children in respect of whom he had been asked to be their godfather. The Minister also took into account the hardship on the applicant’s partner if she remained in Australia. 29    The respondent submitted, as to ground 1, that the premise that the Minister was bound to consider the applicant’s background in assessing his criminality, and the sentences passed upon him, in a particular way was incorrect. Further, the Minister’s consideration of the applicant’s criminality was not deficient in the alleged respect.30    As to ground 2, the Minister submitted that his decision did not involve an improper exercise of the power on the claimed basis that by reason of the error pleaded in ground 1 he misconstrued the mandatory consideration of “risk of harm to the Australian community”.31    As to ground 4, the Minister submitted that in having regard to the impediments the applicant would face if removed to New Zealand his decision was not illogical or irrational.32    As to ground 5, the Minister submitted that he was not required to give the applicant an opportunity to comment on his conclusion that the cumulative effect of his criminality placed considerable burden on Australian legal and law enforcement institutions and accompanying financial cost.ConsiderationGround 133    By this ground, in my opinion, the applicant seeks impermissibly in judicial review proceedings to convert mere fact-finding and discretionary evaluation into legal principle. This may be seen in the proposition in paragraph a. of the particulars: “Once a decision-maker selects a particular matter for consideration, he or she is bound to consider that matter properly.” There is then a reference in particular d. to the respondent being required to have regard to the correct legal principle which is said to be that profound deprivation and disadvantage of an offender as a child/or teenager does not necessarily diminish over time. 34    This may be an attempt to import a mandatory relevant consideration into the discretion in s 501CA(4), but no legal basis for so doing is disclosed. In my opinion, the principle is not a mandatory relevant consideration in the exercise of the broad discretionary power in s 501CA(4).35    The Minister was not here purporting to apply any legal principle from criminal sentencing and was not required to do so. In my opinion, the Minister was making a judgment as to whether the adverse effect of the applicant’s upbringing excused him from responsibility for, or diminished his responsibility for, his actions as an adult. The Minister was considering risk to the Australian community. Part of that consideration was whether the applicant tended to minimise his responsibility for his offending. That in turn was a basis for the Minister’s conclusion at [72] that the applicant may continue offending. The Minister was not engaged in criminal sentencing.36    This ground does not demonstrate legal error on the part of the Minister.Grounds 2 and 337    By these grounds the applicant seeks to give an alternative legal characterisation to the consequence of the Minister’s failure to have regard to the “correct legal principle” alleged in ground 1. It appears that legal unreasonableness is raised and, perhaps, a misconstruction of the expression “risk of harm to the Australian community”.38    As to the former, I see no basis on which it could be said that the process of reasoning did not fall within the broad discretion conferred by s 501CA(4) or as legally unreasonable within the principles in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18; 249 CLR 332. As I have said in relation to ground 1, the Minister was considering risk to the Australian community and, in that context, whether the applicant may continue offending.39    As to the latter, the “risk of harm to the Australian community” is a mandatory consideration: Moana v Minister for Immigration and Border Control [2015] FCAFC 54; 230 FCR 367, but it is not a statutory expression so as ordinarily to found a claim that misconstruction would demonstrate relevant legal error.40    These grounds do not demonstrate legal error.Ground 441    Again, the applicant seeks impermissibly in judicial review proceedings to convert mere fact-finding and discretionary evaluation into legal principle.42    In my opinion, there was no legal obligation on the Minister to make findings as to the extent of the impediments the applicant would face if removed from Australia to New Zealand. The background is that the applicant did not himself raise the issue of impediments that he would face in New Zealand and it followed that there was limited information before the Minister in that respect. The Minister referred to impediments the applicant would face in establishing himself and maintaining basic living standards in New Zealand. No quantitative approach was required. Neither was it legally necessary for the respondent Minister to outline the weight he accorded to the impediments. The use of the metaphor “balancing process” should not be taken to suggest a quantitative approach was involved or required. In my view it cannot be said to be illogical to reason that impediments which a person may face if a visa cancellation decision is not revoked may be alleviated by the relationship that person has, on his own account, with two of his children who live in his country of nationality, New Zealand. It is to be recalled that the Minister had found, at [39], that the applicant had ongoing, positive relationships with his adult children in New Zealand. It was in that context that the Minister observed that they would be a source of some support.43    This ground discloses no legal error.Ground 544    In my opinion the Minister did not deny procedural fairness to the applicant in taking into consideration, at [56], the considerable burden, the Minister stated, that the cumulative effect of the applicant’s offending placed on Australian legal and law-enforcement institutions, together with the accompanying financial cost.45    The Minister had extensive information relating to the applicant’s offence history and the applicant had had the opportunity to comment on it, that opportunity having been given by letters reproduced at pages 193 (apparently undated), 203 (17 October 2016) and 207 (24 May 2016) of the Court Book.46    The burden on Australian legal and law enforcement institutions, and accompanying financial cost, of the cumulative effect of the applicant’s offending was not, in my opinion, a matter personal to him in the sense of the information involved in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81; 159 CLR 550. It was also an obvious inference from the material. To say that it was obvious does not mean that every decision-maker would have drawn that inference but that it was obvious that a decision-maker may draw that inference. The Minister’s consideration was an obvious and natural evaluation of the material known to the applicant or a conclusion obviously open on the known material: Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074; 49 FCR 576 at 591-592.47    This ground discloses no legal error.A procedural question48    There is a proceeding pending in the High Court of Australia, Falzon v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, No S31 of 2017, challenging the validity of s 501(3A) of the Migration Act on the basis that it confers non-judicial power on the Minister contrary to Ch III of the Constitution. Arguably, a decision under s 501CA(4) in a case such as the present is dependent upon s 501(3A). I granted the applicant, who is self-represented, leave to amend to add such a ground if so advised, and an extension of time to do so. I made an order referring the applicant to a lawyer for legal assistance under r 4.12 of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth). I proposed procedural orders, noting that counsel for the Minister did not have instructions to consent to that course.Conclusion 49    The application as presently framed is dismissed, with costs.I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Robertson.Associate: Dated:    20 April 2017",2017-04-20 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia
4402165,Bushter v R (Commonwealth) [2017] NSWDC 87,"Judgment


	
	Mohammad Bushter was convicted in the Local Court of four offences. Two of those offences involved contraventions of s.233A of the Migration Act 1958 (Commonwealth). The other two offences involved contraventions of s.37(1) of the Australian Passport Act 2005 (Commonwealth).
	
	
	He has appealed to this Court in relation to the penalties imposed by the Local Court.
	
	
	The facts surrounding the offences can be very briefly stated.
	
	
	Mr Bushter married his first wife I March 1995. That lady travelled to Australia on a Student Visa in 1995 and became an Australian Citizen in 1998. In 1997 the Offender came to Australia on a Spousal Visa and became an Australian Citizen in 2000. A child was born to their marriage in 2003.
	
	
	In 2011 the Offender frequently travelled to Tehran.
	
	
	According to him, he had been, by that stage, unemployed for six years and living off Centrelink - he apparently was receiving a Carer’s Pension.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that he was receiving money from the Australian taxpayer to look after his wife, the offender spent long periods of time out of the country not caring for his wife. He would have the Court believe that he left a severely mentally ill woman in the care of his four children who were aged between six and eleven years. According to him he did this on many occasions between 2011 and 2016.
	
	
	He was in Iran for the purpose of finding himself another wife. And in 2011 he again married – whilst still married to his first wife. Whether or not that was lawful in Iran, it is not lawful in Australia.
	
	
	In 2014 the Offender left Australia with the passport of his real wife and the passport of one of his children. He did so with the deliberate intention of smuggling into Australia his second “wife” from Iran and her child. This is correctly described as “people smuggling.”
	
	
	His criminal activities were discovered in the Middle East. And that lady and that child have never come to this country.
	
	
	It was the intention of the Offender to smuggle them into this country in breach of Australia’s well known migration laws.
	
	
	The Local Court imposed lenient sentences on the Offender, which sentences were totally consistent with precedent. (Indeed the Offender can consider himself lucky to have been prosecuted in the Local Court where the maximum penalty is only two years in prison. The maximum penalty in this Court is ten.)
	
	
	For the two offences of attempting to people smuggle, the offender received the maximum penalty in the Local Court of two years, both of which were totally concurrent, even though two different persons were sought to be smuggled into the country. It might have been thought appropriate for there to have been partial accumulation rather than total concurrency.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate found that he was to be released by way of a reconnaissance after serving half of that sentence, namely twelve months.
	
	
	In relation to the passport offences, the maximum penalty again in the Local Court is two years. (And in this Court ten years).
	
	
	For each of those offences, the Offender was sentenced to six months imprisonment totally concurrent - not only with each other, but with the people smuggling offences.
	
	
	The only ground advanced on the appeal was the only ground that could possibly have been argued - and that was that there would be exceptional hardship to the offender’s first (now former) wife – with whom the Offender still lives.
	
	
	That ground of appeal fails. If the Offender’s evidence is to be believed, his former wife was capable of being looked after previously by children between the ages of six and eleven. They are now thirteen, fifteen and eighteen. Their capacity to look after their mother is therefore significantly improved.
	
	
	The Court does, however, have some residual suspicion about some of the activities of the Offender, but, in the context of these appeals, they are not taken into account adversely to him. How it was that he was able to raise and look after a number of adults and adolescents on Centrelink benefits and still find $200 to $400 a month to send to Iran and to find the money for the air fares to travel many times to and from Iran was never explained.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in concluding that the appellant has failed to prove “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of the law.
	
	
	The appeals are dismissed.
	
	
	The orders of the Local Court are confirmed.
	
	
	The Offender will now go into custody.

		24 April 2017",2017-03-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4443794,New South Wales Crime Commission v Acharya [2017] NSWSC 443,"Judgment


	
	By summons which I granted leave to file, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in certain property of the defendant, Shyam Acharya, also known as Sarang Chitale.
	
	
	Other orders under ss 12(1), and 28A of the Act were also there sought. The orders pressed were for restraining orders under s 10A, as well as orders under ss 10B and 12(1) and orders for substituted service under rule 10.14 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 19 April 2017 by Katie Elaine Bourne, the Commission’s Director, Assessments and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	The property sought to be restrained is identified in a schedule to the Summons as real property located at North Ryde, and Townsville registered in the name of Sarang Prakash Chitale and Pratibha Tokachichu, understood to be Shyam Acharya’s spouse, as joint tenants; as well as funds held in Commonwealth Bank accounts in the name Sarang Chitale.
	
	
	Ms Bourne deposed that she suspected that Shyam Acharya had engaged in “serious crime related activity” as defined in s 6 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, namely, obtaining financial advantage by knowingly asking a false or misleading statement contrary to the former s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); using a false instrument with intent, contrary to s 300 of the Crimes Act; dealing with identification information contrary to s 182J of the Crimes Act and using false documents to obtain financial advantage, contrary to s 254 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Ms Bourne there also gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which she came to hold that suspicion. That rested on a consideration of:
	



	
	Documents provided by Mr Fletcher, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, which had commenced criminal proceedings against Shyam Acharya, alleging that he had assumed the identity of Dr Sarang Prakash Chitale. They included a statement provided for the purpose of that prosecution by Dr Sarang Prakash Chitale;
	
	
	Documents provided by detective Constable Berenger in relation to the investigation of the alleged fraud offences, including applications for search warrants;
	
	
	Documents provided by the Registrar of the Criminal Registry at the Downing Centre Local Court, including a court attendance notice, statement of facts and record of Shyam Acharya’s conviction;
	
	
	Documents obtained by employees of the Commission, including searches conducted of the records held in the Equifax and LPI databases and records provided by the CBA;
	
	
	NSWPF search warrant information, a statement of an Australian Border Force supervisor and information provided by the Operational intelligence unit of the Australian Border Force, which suggests that Shyam Acharya last departed Australia on 26 January 2016, although he may have returned briefly on a false passport in February 2012.
	



	
	Ms Bourne deposed to her experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate and to withdraw funds from bank accounts very quickly, in order to defeat the operation of the Act.
	
	
	She also deposed to her view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Shyam Acharya is apparently involved, that notice should not be given of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Ms Bourne has deposed.
	
	
	In this case, I am satisfied that the material relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Ms Bourne has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation, the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I have concluded that it is also appropriate to make the other orders sought, including the order for substituted service upon Pratibha Tokachichu, now residing at an address known to her solicitor.
	
	
	On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I have regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permits an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days’ notice.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, as well as ordering that the Commission serve a copy of this judgment on Shyam Acharya and Pratibha Tokachichu.

4443801,New South Wales Crime Commission v Redshaw [2017] NSWSC 444,"Judgment


	
	By summons which I granted leave to file, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex-parte, seeking restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) in relation to the interest in certain property of the defendant, David John Redshaw. Other orders under ss 12(1), 10B, 22, 22AA and 28A of the Act were also sought. The orders pressed were for restraining orders under s 10A, as well as orders under ss 10B and 12(1).
	
	
	The application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 18 April 2017 by Katie Elaine Bourne, the Commission’s Director, Assessments and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	The property sought to be restrained is identified in a schedule to the summons as real property located at Moorebank and Townsville registered in the name of Mr Redshaw and Alicia Ann Jenkins as joint tenants; as well as vehicles registered in Mr Redshaw’s name; funds held in Commonwealth Bank accounts in his name; and cash of some $43,950 seized on the execution of a search warrant at the Moorebank address.
	
	
	Ms Bourne deposed that she suspected that Mr Redshaw had engaged in serious crime related activity within the definition of a “serious crime related activity” in s 6 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, namely, supplying prohibited drugs contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	Ms Bourne there also gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which she came to hold that suspicion. That rested on a consideration of documents obtained by employees of the Commission, including a Facts Sheet created by Detective Turnbull; questions which Ms Bourne posed to the detective and responses which he gave; as well as searches conducted of the records held in the COPS database, which showed that on 23 March 2017, Mr Redshaw had been charged with the offence specified in the Facts Sheet, which was annexed to the affidavit.
	
	
	Ms Bourne also had regard to information obtained as the result of searches conducted of the LPI, Veda, DERM and, RMS databases in relation to the property of Mr Redshaw.
	
	
	Ms Bourne deposed to her experience that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages in relation to real estate very quickly and to dispose of motor vehicles or backdate forms notifying the RMS of disposal of such vehicles, in order to defeat the operation of the Act.
	
	
	She also deposed to her view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Redshaw is apparently involved, that notice should not be given of this application. That is a course available under the Act, although s 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Ms Bourne has deposed.
	
	
	In this case, I am satisfied that the material relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Ms Bourne has deposed and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation, the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I have concluded that it was also appropriate to make the other orders sought.
	
	
	I have reached those conclusions after consideration of the material relied on, including what was disclosed in the Facts Sheet, as to which Ms Bourne deposed that she believed in the truth of its contents.
	
	
	That document revealed that Mr Redshaw, a former police officer, was arrested and charged following a strike force investigation into a money laundering operation during which, after the execution of various warrants, he was identified to be a member of an organised crime group. Electronic and physical surveillance had also revealed that the group and Mr Renshaw were involved in the laundering of large quantities of Australian currency, derived through the supply of cocaine, as well as also dealing with cocaine.
	
	
	All of these matters, I am satisfied, provide a proper basis for the making of the orders sought.
	
	
	On the evidence, I am also satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application to Mr Redshaw and that it should be dealt with ex-parte. In coming to that view, I had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permits an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside, as well as the liberty granted in the order to the parties to apply to the Court on three days’ notice.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, as well as ordering that the Commission serve a copy of this judgment on Mr Redshaw and Ms Jenkins.

4443803,Duffy v R [2017] NSWCCA 77,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: In April and May 2014, the applicant, Michael John Duffy, was tried on a charge of murder and a separate charge of break, enter and steal from the premises in which the murder took place. He was acquitted of murder, but found guilty of manslaughter. He was also acquitted of the break and enter charge, but had already entered a plea to stealing in a dwelling house. On 18 September 2015 he was sentenced by Davies J on both charges. [1]  With respect to the stealing offence, he was given a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing on the date of his arrest, namely 1 June 2012. For the manslaughter offence, he was convicted and sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years, commencing on 1 March 2013 and expiring on 28 February 2021, with an additional term of 4 years.
	
	
	The applicant sought leave to appeal against both his conviction for manslaughter and the sentence imposed for that offence. The ground of the latter challenge related to the judge’s finding as to the manner of the offender’s participation in the killing of the deceased.
	


Background circumstances and issues


	
	The deceased, Colleen Deborah Ayers met Rachael Evans at a pub in Campbelltown on Tuesday 8 May 2012, the day before her death. Ms Evans was primarily responsible for the murder of Ms Ayers, by strangling her with a belt.
	
	
	In the course of the evening of 8 May, Evans and Ayers were joined by the applicant, Duffy, and Ms Evans’ sister (who will be referred to as “XY” because she was then under 18 years of age and subject to a statutory requirement that her name not be published in a way that connects her with the criminal proceedings [2] ). The applicant and the three women spent the evening at a hotel in Picton. On the following morning, Wednesday 9 May 2012, the group returned to Campbelltown where XY met her friend, Scott Derbridge, who joined the group. They were also joined at some stage by another young man, Marc Carran (known variously as “Kiwi” and “Nozzy”). Having acquired drugs and alcohol in Campbelltown, the group, now six persons, travelled to Picton and thence by taxi to the home of the deceased’s parents at Lakesland. The deceased’s parents were away and the house was otherwise empty.
	
	
	For much of the evening, the group appears to have been sitting around a fire between the main house and a guest house. They consumed methamphetamine, speed, marijuana and alcohol in significant quantities. Later in the evening, the applicant and Ms Ayers went to one of the bedrooms and had sex. While they were both in bed, Ms Evans and XY came into the bedroom. It appears that XY harboured a grudge against Ms Ayers and enlisted her elder sister in her cause. When they entered, the applicant jumped off the bed. There was no dispute that Ms Evans put a belt around Ms Ayers’ neck while she was lying on the bed, pulling it tight and holding it until Ms Ayers went limp, dying of asphyxiation.
	
	
	Beyond those bare events, which explained the death of Ms Ayers, precisely who was present and what role each played was a matter of controversy, with few common elements amongst the accounts given by the participants. For example, there was evidence that at some point XY hit Ms Ayers on the head with a bottle, although a post-mortem examination could find no evidence to suggest that Ms Ayers suffered any injury as a result of a blow to the head.
	
	
	It was, however, common ground that the applicant was in the room throughout the brief time it took to kill Ms Ayers, but took no steps to assist Ms Ayers during the assault, nor did he seek medical help when she went limp, or show any concern as to her state. Rather, he and Derbridge set about digging a shallow grave to bury her body. Apart from Carran, who appears to have been asleep throughout these events, the others were involved in digging the grave, carrying the body and burying the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant expressed a willingness to plead to a charge of being an accessory after the fact to the killing of the deceased, but denied involvement in the events leading to her death. The offer to plead was not accepted by the prosecution.
	
	
	The primary case for the prosecution was that the applicant himself had put the belt around Ms Ayers’ neck, which accorded with Ms Evans’ account. The alternative basis upon which the applicant was said to be liable for murder involved his participation in a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Evans, which involved causing serious bodily harm to Ms Ayers, or killing her. The verdict of manslaughter involved a rejection of the prosecution case on both these bases.
	
	
	The case with respect to manslaughter was also put on two bases. The first was that the applicant at one stage held the belt around the deceased’s neck. If the jury were satisfied that that was an unlawful and dangerous act, and that the applicant intended to do the act, he was guilty of manslaughter, although he did not intend to cause serious bodily harm. In the alternative, it was put that even if he did not himself pull on the belt around the neck of the deceased, he was part of a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Evans which included that unlawful and dangerous act and was guilty of manslaughter on that basis.
	
	
	Clearly, and unsurprisingly, the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the pulling of a belt around the neck of the deceased was an unlawful and dangerous act. If the applicant himself undertook that task, he intended it. If he did not undertake that task, it must have been part of the criminal enterprise on which he was engaged with Ms Evans. Which of these alternatives the jury accepted is not known.
	
	
	Neither the written directions which set the various options before the jury, nor a separate document in the form of a “question trail”, was challenged by the accused in the course of the trial. However, various phrases used in the question trail, including the phrase “joint criminal enterprise”, were the subject of explicit directions by the trial judge in the course of his summing up. The principal ground (ground 1) on which permission to appeal was sought involved a challenge to those directions, in the following terms:
	


“His Honour erred in his directions to the jury concerning what constituted a joint criminal enterprise, such that there was a miscarriage of justice namely, in failing to adequately direct the jury that both an agreement and the [Applicant’s] participation in that agreement were required to be found beyond a reasonable doubt and that mere presence or indifference was not sufficient to establish participation”.


	
	No objection to the directions having been raised in the course of the trial, leave to rely on this ground was required under the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), r 4. To address that application, it will be necessary to identify the relevant passages in the summing up to which exception was taken.
	
	
	The second ground was not pressed, so that the alternative basis of appeal against conviction was raised in ground 3, which read:
	


“His Honour erred in leaving the case to the jury on the basis that they could convict the Applicant of the offences charged even if they rejected the evidence of Rachel Evans as any such verdict was unsafe and unable to be supported having regard to the nature and quality of the evidence.”


	
	As counsel for the Director pointed out, there was a difficulty in the formulation of this ground. Pursuant to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), this Court may set aside a verdict of guilty on the ground that it is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”. (This is commonly referred to as the first limb of s 6(1).) It is not correct to say that the trial judge is required to form some preliminary view about that matter and withdraw a particular charge from the jury if the judge considered that the verdict could be so characterised. As the High Court explained in Doney v The Queen: [3] 
	


“It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.”


	
	Further, although ground 3 was not precise in this respect, the submissions clarified that the critical evidence of Ms Evans was the claim that the applicant had put the belt around the neck of Ms Ayers, or had, at one stage, pulled on the belt when Ms Evans was knocked off balance by Ms Ayers’ struggle to free herself. As noted above, one basis upon which manslaughter was left to the jury was that the applicant did not pull the belt around Ms Ayers’ neck, but was nevertheless party to a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Evans, who on that approach held on to the belt at all stages.
	


Directions with respect to joint criminal enterprise


	
	It is convenient to start by noting the principles regarding joint criminal enterprise, as stated in McAuliffe v The Queen [4]  and repeated by the majority in Miller v The Queen: [5] 
	


“The law, as stated in McAuliffe, is that a joint criminal enterprise comes into being when two or more persons agree to commit a crime. The existence of the agreement need not be express and may be an inference from the parties' conduct. If the crime that is the object of the enterprise is committed while the agreement remains on foot, all the parties to the agreement are equally guilty, regardless of the part that each has played in the conduct that constitutes the actus reus. [6]  Each party is also guilty of any other crime (‘the incidental crime’) committed by a co-venturer that is within the scope of the agreement (‘joint criminal enterprise’ liability). An incidental crime is within the scope of the agreement if the parties contemplate its commission as a possible incident of the execution of their agreement. Moreover, a party to a joint criminal enterprise who foresees, but does not agree to, the commission of the incidental crime in the course of carrying out the agreement and who, with that awareness, continues to participate in the enterprise is liable for the incidental offence (‘extended joint criminal enterprise’ liability).”


	
	The judge directed the jury, in terms which were not challenged, with respect to the concept of a “joint criminal enterprise”. [7]  The applicant’s criticism focused on what was described as the “inadequacy” of his explanation of what may constitute participating in the criminal enterprise. In that regard the judge stated: [8] 
	


“A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the crime charged itself or, knowing that the crime is being or is about to be committed, by intentionally assisting or encouraging another party to the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid, if required, is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participants in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime.

Now, you will remember that [counsel for the accused] said that simply standing by while a crime is committed does not mean you are taking part in a joint criminal enterprise, and that is right, provided that there was not an arrangement in place before that time to commit the crime. Merely being present when a crime is committed does not make you guilty of the crime, if there is nothing else.”


	
	The trial judge then gave some examples, including examples of crimes committed on the spur of the moment and crimes where one person did not leave the car, but waited in the driver’s seat with the engine running whilst two others undertook a break and enter. The written direction to the jury with respect to a number of matters included the meaning of “joint criminal enterprise”. Importantly for present purposes, the case was not left to the jury on the basis of an “extended joint criminal enterprise”; that meant that the third element in the description set out from Miller above, was not engaged.
	
	
	The direction with respect to manslaughter covered an act causing the death of the deceased, where the act was intentional, “unlawful” and “dangerous”. The judge defined “unlawful” as an act involving “a deliberate application of force to another person without that person’s consent”; and “dangerous” as an act where “a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that … the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable or significant risk of serious injury.” No challenge was made to those directions.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the case, whatever else needed to be said was said in the course of summing up the circumstances revealed by the evidence. If the jury accepted Ms Evans’ evidence, it was open to them to conclude that the accused was forewarned that there was going to be an attack on Ms Ayers. It was open to them to conclude, further, that the accused participated in the attack. If the jury did not accept at least some key aspects of Ms Evans’ evidence, then the question of participation became critical. The latter possibility was the subject of ground 3. However, on Ms Evans’ evidence, there was no difficulty in understanding what was said to involve participation. For example, her evidence was that after her sister had hit Ms Ayers on the head with a bottle, the applicant said, “Get the belt”. Ms Evans also stated that she was knocked off balance after she had placed the belt around Ms Ayers’ neck and it was the applicant who took hold of the belt and pulled on it while XY held Ms Ayers’ legs down. (XY denied being in the room while Ms Ayers was strangled.)
	
	
	There was also evidence from all the persons involved (except the applicant) that Ms Ayers had called out, “Please stop”, or words to that effect. Accepting that evidence, the applicant’s failure to respond to that cry would have been capable of supporting the case that he was a participant in the attack by the two women, or just Ms Evans.
	
	
	It is therefore apparent that the challenge in this Court to the directions as to participation could only arise on the basis that the jury did not accept Ms Evans’ evidence. Otherwise, the failure to seek a further direction could readily be explained by awareness that it would be futile and unwarranted. That is because any active involvement of the applicant would constitute participation, in accordance with the unchallenged directions.
	
	
	There was a tendency in the applicant’s submissions to confuse the mental state of the accused and his conduct. On the other hand, there was the suggestion that it was “circular” to allow a finding that the accused’s presence established an agreement to the unfolding attack and established participation in the agreed events. However, it is not false reasoning to draw from conduct, including presence, an inference as to connivance in the attack and also an inference of willingness to assist, if required.
	
	
	The difficulty for the jury arises from the addition of a layer of agreement (joint enterprise) as a condition of the imposition of legal responsibility on a person who does not do the “act” which constitutes the crime. But some act is required. Sending a text message indicating agreement with a planned assault, and indeed conveying encouragement, will not render the sender of the message jointly liable with the assailant. Presence at the scene will be sufficient, if pursuant to a common purpose, because willingness to assist if necessary may be inferred. Mere presence, absent a common purpose, will not suffice.
	
	
	However, a common purpose may arise by way of a tacit understanding, immediately prior to the crime being committed. That was one available approach on the prosecution case.
	
	
	The scope of the liability of the non-active participant will depend on his or her state of mind. That may also be defined as the scope of the agreement. Thus, in the present case, the question was what the applicant’s expectation and assent covered. If it were only the assault, not intended to cause really serious bodily harm, or death, which was objectively probable, the offence was manslaughter, not murder.
	
	
	Subject to the related matters dealt with under ground 3, and the manner in which the jury directions dealt with critical aspects of the evidence, the jury directions as to legal principles relating to joint criminal enterprise were not inadequate. The absence of any request for further directions was, in the circumstances of the case, understandable. The application, pursuant to r 4, for leave to rely upon ground 1 should be refused.
	


Rejection of Ms Evans’ evidence – ground 3


	
	This ground underwent a degree of transformation in the course of the proceedings. Putting to one side the suggestion that the judge erred in “leaving the case to the jury” on a conditional basis, namely acceptance of Ms Evans’ evidence, there remained a submission that the verdict of manslaughter was unreasonable and could not be supported on the evidence, if the jury did not accept the evidence of Ms Evans. In the written submissions, this ground was addressed as a misdirection as to the circumstantial evidence, on the basis that, without Ms Evans’ evidence as to what happened in the bedroom, the case was entirely circumstantial. The submissions also raised an issue (not developed in oral argument) that the prosecution had relied upon lies told by the applicant after the death, without any clear direction as to how the lies might have implicated the applicant, beyond establishing that “he knew that he did something wrong”, which could have merely involved the burying of the body after the event.
	


(a)   further directions


	
	Insofar as the question of further directions was raised, the applicant accepted that he again required leave under r 4. No further proposed directions were formulated. That is a matter of some importance because the trial judge gave clear and unchallenged directions as to what constitutes “circumstantial evidence” and how it was relied upon by the prosecution. [9]  Those directions were given in the context of the primary prosecution case, being that the applicant was involved in the murder of Ms Ayers, but applied equally to the alternative verdict. The judge then identified eight particular matters which were relied upon in support of the prosecution case. [10]  The eight matters were identified in the following terms (using the first names of the individuals):
	


“(1)   The accused was physically very close to the deceased when [Ms Evans] and [XY] came into the room. The accused's evidence was that he jumped off the bed on to the floor on the side away from the sliding door. The Crown says that you would infer that this was to assist [Ms Evans] in the attack because if he had stayed where he was, it would have been difficult to continue the attack. Mr Trevallion [counsel for the accused at trial] says that there is no evidence, if you reject [Ms Evans’] evidence, of any readiness of the accused to participate or assist.

(2)   The Crown says there is no rational explanation why, if the accused was an innocent by-stander, he did nothing to assist [Ms Ayers] particularly where, contrary to his own evidence, [Ms Evans], [XY] and Derbridge all say that they heard [Ms Ayers] call out to stop. The Crown pointed to what he said to the police, that is the accused, that he made no enquiry as to how she was. He also gave that evidence. Mr Trevallion submitted that his failure to enquire was because the accused knew she was dead.

(3)   The accused did not call the police, which the Crown said he had a legal duty to do. Nor did he call the ambulance, saying first that he had no credit left on his phone but subsequently saying he had no intention of calling the ambulance.

(4)   The accused said that he then went with Kiwi to the fire to have a drink without knowing whether [Ms Ayers] was alive or dead. The Crown says that that is not believable in the circumstances and says [Ms Evans’] evidence about she and Duffy discussing what was to be done with [Ms Ayers’] body should be accepted.

(5)   The accused's evidence was that after burying [Ms Ayers], he and Derbridge then went looking for the guns. They found where they were, broke into the gunsafe and took them. To do that, the Crown says, not worrying whether [Ms Ayers] was dead or not in the bedroom, is irrational if you are not involved in the killing.

(6)   The accused's demeanour in the taxi on the trip to Picton and the fact that the accused feels the need to answer the taxi driver when he claims that [Ms Evans] did the killing and he was not involved. You will recall that the taxi driver asked, ‘Where's the other one?’ and the accused admitted that he said, ‘She passed out about 20 minutes after we got home’. In relation to this, Mr Trevallion says that you will need to look at the DVD of the taxi trip, [two exhibits, being extracts from the DVD and the DVD of the full journey], and remember that the accused was heavily intoxicated with drugs. …That goes particularly, Mr Trevallion says, to his demeanour in the taxi.

(7)   The accused spends the next few days with [Ms Evans] buying drugs and trying to sell the guns.

(8)   The accused's continuing association with [Ms Evans], including letting her sleep over at his place some days later, as well as going with her to court to support [XY]. Mr Trevallion said that the meetings with [Ms Evans] were fortuitous and that the accused was trying to stay away from her.”


	
	The judge’s directions then turned to the question of lies told by the applicant, which formed part of the prosecution case. Just as there was no criticism of the directions with respect to circumstantial evidence, there was no criticism of the directions with respect to lies, beyond one raised at trial by counsel for the accused after the jury retired, which resulted in a further direction. It is convenient to set out the discussion in that regard, because it illustrates the need for care in considering the form of any further direction. [11] 
	


“TREVALLION: …

The other matter was in respect to lies, I would ask your Honour to direct them specifically in respect to the lies in the second interview where the accused has denied being involved in the disposal of the body; that an explanation for his lies, other than concealing his guilt for the murder, would be concealing his guilt for the disposal of the body and that's a good example of the way they should assess and look at the issue of lies.

HIS HONOUR: I think there's something in that, Madam Crown.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I don't have a difficulty with that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I think you're right, Mr Trevallion.

TREVALLION: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Except this, in carrying the body down the stairs, he was already an accessory.

TREVALLION: That is true, your Honour, and I considered that but he then moves away from that, tries to distance himself from that position.

HIS HONOUR: You say an inference could be that he was trying to distance himself as being found as an accessory after the fact and not anything to do with being found guilty of murder?

TREVALLION: Whether it's expressed ‘accessory after the fact’ or simply for his guilt in the disposal of the body, I have no difficulty with it being expressed either way. I simply think it's whether he's already partially made some admissions to that.

HIS HONOUR: I think I will re-direct them about that.”


	
	The further direction was given in terms which were accepted by counsel as appropriate and not the subject of complaint on the appeal. [12] 
	
	
	As the lies were relied upon as part of the prosecution case, to be evaluated below, it is appropriate to set out the matters relevant in this regard from the summing up. [13] 
	


“In this case the Crown has identified certain lies told by the accused and certain things that the accused did which the Crown says demonstrate a consciousness of guilt. They are these:

1.   The time at which the accused had sexual intercourse with [Ms Ayers] at Rockbarton Road. In his first record of interview the accused said that after sexual intercourse with [Ms Ayers] in the granny flat he and the deceased went down to the fire. He then had a drink with Kiwi and then rang a taxi. He also said he told [Ms Evans] he wanted to leave. He and Kiwi went to get a taxi. This account left the deceased unharmed at the property when the accused left. In Court he admitted that [Ms Ayers] was murdered after he had sex with her in the granny flat.

2.   This is somewhat related to the first. In the first interview the accused said that he left the property because [Ms Evans] told him that she wanted to break into the house and to keep Marlboro – as he called her there – down at the fire. In his second interview he said that he and Kiwi had a drink by the fire and then he rang a taxi. He agreed in cross-examination that that was a lie.

3.   In his first interview he said that while he was at the property the deceased was ‘fine’ and not unconscious. He agreed in cross-examination that that was a lie.

4.   In his second interview the accused said that when [Ms Evans] and [XY] came into the room and [XY] hit the deceased on the head with a bottle he, the accused, realised what was happening and split down to the fire. He admitted in cross-examination that he was trying to distance himself from what was happening.

5.   In his second interview the accused repeatedly said, and the Crown Prosecutor gave you all the references, repeatedly said that he only carried the deceased's body down the stairs but not to the grave site. He then walked Kiwi away from the area so he would not see anything. In cross-examination he admitted that he carried the body to the grave and he agreed that he had not told the truth in that regard in his interview.

6.   In the taxi, when the driver asked about [Ms Ayers], the accused said that she passed out 20 minutes or so after they got to the place.”


	
	The directions given to the jury with respect to circumstantial evidence and with respect to the use of lies which may have been told by the accused were sound in all respects, including the ways in which the directions were linked to the evidence in the case. Counsel for the accused, who demonstrated a fine appreciation of the way in which the case was put and the ways in which the evidence could be used advantageously to his client, sought an appropriate redirection, which was provided in terms acceptable to him. There was, in these circumstances, no reason to consider that further directions should have been given. Leave to rely on this aspect of ground 3 must be refused.
	


(b)   unreasonable verdict


	
	This aspect of ground 3 was articulated was in the following manner: [14] 
	


“The question raised by this ground is whether, having made an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, this Court considers that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the Applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt if the jury rejected [Ms Evans’] evidence. [15]  The question is whether the jury must, as distinct from might, reasonably have entertained a doubt about the applicant’s guilt. [16] ”


	
	A submission formulated in these terms encounters two difficulties, one factual and one legal. They are interrelated.
	
	
	The legal difficulty is to formulate, in terms applicable to the particular case, the exercise required of an appellate court asked to review a jury verdict of guilty. How that function is articulated will affect any factual assumptions which are required to be made. However, it is convenient to note first the factual difficulty inherent in the submission.
	
	
	The submission invites the Court to accept or assume the proposition that the jury rejected Ms Evans’ evidence. That raises two questions, namely (i) what precisely was rejected and (ii) why should the assumption be made? If by “reject” the submission adopted the position of the accused at trial, namely that Ms Evans was a liar who simply could not be believed, that proposition cannot be accepted. Significant aspects of Ms Evans’ evidence were uncontradicted, including that she came into the room where the applicant and Ms Ayers were in or on the bed, and that Ms Evans put a belt around Ms Ayers’ neck and pulled it tight. If a more limited meaning were intended, perhaps that Ms Evans could not be believed in respect of any aspect of her evidence which inculpated the accused, that might be more plausible, although the exercise of isolating those parts of the evidence and explaining how they were dealt with in cross-examination was not undertaken.
	
	
	In relation to the second issue, it is not clear why the Court should assume that the jury “rejected” Ms Evans’ evidence, if by that it is meant that the jury found that she lied. A proper reading of the jury verdict, acquitting the accused of murder but convicting him of manslaughter, must have involved a critical finding as to the accused’s state of mind, namely that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had the necessary state of mind for murder. Ms Evans could not have given evidence directly as to his state of mind. Further, the fact that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to some aspect of her evidence did not mean that they “rejected” her evidence, nor that they accepted the accused’s assertion that she was a liar.
	
	
	In short, it is not possible for this Court to assess the evidence given at trial by making assumptions as to how the jury must have reasoned, in circumstances where there were alternative courses available to them which permitted a verdict of manslaughter.
	
	
	The legal difficulty encountered in addressing this ground arises from different formulations of the function of the Court as articulated by the High Court. Unsurprisingly, the language used in a particular case is apt for the circumstances raised in that case, but may not be readily applied in other circumstances. Thus, as the majority made clear in M v The Queen, the first limb of s 6(1), namely that the verdict is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”, does not confine the power of the court to set aside a verdict which is unsafe or unsatisfactory for some other reason, and may, therefore, constitute a miscarriage of justice within the third limb. [17]  In other words, it is open to the appeal court to overturn a jury verdict, despite the constitutional function of the jury to determine questions of fact, in exceptional cases, in order to prevent what appears to be a potential miscarriage of justice, should the verdict stand. The possibilities of a miscarriage are not limited to the first limb. [18] 
	
	
	Secondly, the Court has explained that, “[w]here, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” [19]  The difference between the question of law and the question of fact required to be addressed by the appeal court is that questions of reliability and credibility may need to be addressed in the latter (factual) assessment, but not the former. However, at that point a qualification is added, namely that “[i]t is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.” [20]  In order to be satisfied that there is “a significant possibility” that the accused was not guilty, the court must act upon a record which “contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force”. In principle, where such weaknesses do not lead the appeal court to entertain a doubt, the assessment of reliability and credibility should be left to the jury.
	
	
	Application of these principles in a particular case will involve a determination as to what margin for error may properly be left to a jury. It is difficult, from reading a transcript, to know whether a particular witness appeared credible and reliable, or otherwise. Indeed, a transcript may suggest that a particular witness was lying, whereas in the immediacy of the trial, the jury might have obtained quite a different perspective.
	
	
	The submissions for the applicant in the present case sought to formulate alternative inferences based on the circumstantial evidence and the lies. Most of the matters were raised expressly in submissions for the accused at trial. There is no reason to suppose that the case for the accused was not competently and thoroughly presented. To reiterate such matters on appeal is not to demonstrate that the verdict was unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence, or that it otherwise involved a miscarriage of justice. Rather, it tended to emphasise the matters which the jury should be taken to have rejected.
	
	
	Briefly stated, the circumstances supporting a conviction, disregarding particular aspects of Ms Evans’ evidence, were as follows:
	



	
	Ms Ayers was assaulted and strangled whilst lying on a bed;
	
	
	the assault and the principal acts of strangulation were undertaken by the applicant’s girlfriend and her younger sister;
	
	
	the applicant, having been in bed with Ms Ayers, jumped out and stood beside the bed whilst these events took place;
	
	
	the victim cried out ‘Please stop’, which must have been heard by the applicant;
	
	
	the applicant’s claim that he was ‘freaking out’ while the assaults took place was consistent with him understanding the seriousness of the assaults;
	
	
	inconsistent with him ‘freaking out’, but consistent with his willingness to participate, was his continued presence in the room, whether or not he provided active assistance, and his conduct immediately after the victim went limp.
	



	
	To these elements must be added the other circumstantial evidence and the lies, all of which were required to be evaluated in context and some of which were more persuasive than other aspects of the evidence.
	
	
	Without repeating the whole of the material left to the jury in the summing up, and recognising that it was the function of the jury to assess the emphatic challenges to the veracity of Ms Evans and to the veracity of the accused, there was simply no basis for saying that the jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, ground 3 must be rejected, to the extent that it did not require leave pursuant to r 4.
	


Sentence appeal – ground 4


	
	The ground of appeal with respect to sentence for the offence of manslaughter was in the following terms (ground 4):
	


“His Honour erred in finding that the offender’s participation in the killing of the deceased was to kneel over or next to the deceased and put pressure on her back and/or her arms to hold her down.”

The applicant needed leave to appeal against sentence, pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act.


	
	The manner in which the trial judge dealt with the sentencing is revealed by the judgment on sentence, R v Duffy (No 7). [21]  Those reasons commenced by setting out the background with respect to the trial and the circumstances up to the point at which Ms Ayers was assaulted in the bedroom. The judge referred to the evidence of XY that she was not in the bedroom at the time Ms Ayers was killed, evidence which he rejected. [22]  The judge then stated: [23] 
	


“It is necessary for me to make findings consistent with the jury’s verdict. Any findings adverse to the offender must be beyond reasonable doubt. However, I am not obliged to make the findings that are most favourable to the offender.”


	
	That approach was consistent with well-established authority as to questions of onus and standards of proof. [24]  There was no suggestion that the judge did not apply these principles.
	
	
	The judgment then set out the account given by Ms Evans and that given by the offender. [25]  The judge rejected various aspects of his evidence, [26]  and continued: [27] 
	


“In the light of what the offender undoubtedly did after [Ms Ayers] was killed (the failure to assist her himself, the failure to call for any assistance, the burying of her body by him in a grave dug by him, the stealing of the guns, his demeanour and behaviour in the taxi afterwards, and his ongoing dealings with [Ms Evans] that day and thereafter) I reject his evidence that he was not involved in her killing and that he simply stood by shocked and ‘freaking out’ as he described it.”


	
	The critical findings as to the death of the deceased were set out in the following passage:
	


“[24]   What I find happened in the bedroom is this. The offender and [Ms Ayers] were having sex on the bed. [Ms Evans] and XY entered the room with the intention at that stage, at least of hurting [Ms Ayers], principally because of the bad blood that had developed during the night between XY and [Ms Ayers], resulting in two arguments where, at one stage, they had to be physically separated. Whether or not [Ms Evans] whispered to the offender that they were going to bash her I cannot say, but it soon became clear to the offender, who knew of the discord between XY and [Ms Ayers], that [Ms Evans] and XY intended at least to assault [Ms Ayers]. XY hit [Ms Ayers] with a bottle. [Ms Evans] then put a belt around [Ms Ayers’] neck.

[25]   When [Ms Evans] put the belt around [Ms Ayers’] neck [Ms Ayers] was face down on the bed – that was the way her body was seen by [Ms Evans], XY and Derbridge after she had been killed. I reject the offender’s evidence that [Ms Ayers] was lying on her back when she was attacked. The offender was kneeling over or next to [Ms Ayers] and put pressure on her back and/or her arms to hold her down. Evidence in the post-mortem report identified bruising on the right lower back, the back of the upper right arm and the back of the right wrist all of which occurred before death. The offender did not know that [Ms Evans] intended to inflict grievous bodily harm nor intended to kill [Ms Ayers], nor did he intend that [Ms Evans’] actions would produce such results. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender himself pulled on the belt. I am, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender assisted [Ms Evans] to do an act which was an unlawful and dangerous act. [Emphasis added.]

…

[27]   I accept the evidence of [Ms Evans], XY and Derbridge that [Ms Ayers] cried out whilst she was being assaulted. She said either ‘please, no’ or ‘please stop’ or ‘please don’t’. I reject the offender’s evidence that [Ms Ayers] said nothing. The offender must have known that what was being done to [Ms Ayers] was unwelcome and was being resisted by her. He did not, however, cease his assistance to [Ms Evans] even though he did not intend to cause [Ms Ayers] really serious injury or worse.”


	
	The ground of appeal challenged the finding of fact at [25] (emphasised by italics) that the applicant was actively involved in that he was “kneeling over or next to [Ms Ayers] and put pressure on her back and/or her arms to hold her down.” The applicant further challenged the suggestion that the post-mortem report gave support to that finding.
	
	
	The latter complaint was that there was no “post-mortem report” but only the oral evidence of Dr Brouwer, given before the jury in the course of the trial.
	
	
	It was clear from that evidence that Dr Brouwer had prepared a post-mortem report and gave her evidence by reference to it. Further, a bundle of photographs, which formed part of the report, were admitted without objection and became Ex V. [28]  There is no doubt that the judge was referring to this material. His description of the bruising reflected the evidence of Dr Brouwer and Ex V. The complaint is without substance.
	
	
	Secondly, the applicant complained that the only witness to give evidence that he had been holding Ms Ayers down was Ms Evans, who demonstrated to the police that the applicant had his legs on the back of her shoulders and was applying pressure in the middle of her spine, between her shoulder blades. [29]  It was true that the judge’s finding did not reflect that evidence, although it is by no means clear whether that constituted part of the account which involved the applicant pulling on the belt, a matter as to which the judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It was, nevertheless, open to the judge to accept evidence that the applicant had assisted in holding Ms Ayers down. Ms Evans gave evidence to that effect and that Ms Ayers was struggling. It was certainly open to the judge to conclude that Ms Evans required some assistance to overcome Ms Ayers’ struggles. The bruising identified by Dr Brouwer was consistent with the applicant playing such a role.
	
	
	In written submissions prepared before the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor contended: [30] 
	


“The Crown submits that the offence could not have been committed without the physical involvement of the offender Duffy. On his evidence, Evans managed to strangle the deceased without any physical assistance with the exception of a hit on the head to the deceased by [XY]. [XY] denies hitting the deceased. There was no evidence that the deceased cried out in pain having been hit on the head. There is no medical or other forensic evidence of such a hit; suggesting either that it did not occur or that if it did, it was not severe enough to subdue the deceased. The evidence of both offenders was that the deceased struggled when attacked by Evans. The demonstration and description given by the offender Duffy in evidence of the offender Evans being able to strangle the deceased to death by herself without the deceased’s arms or legs being restrained is not believable. The Crown submits that the evidence of Evans that the offender Duffy participated in the assault should be accepted.

Alternatively, there is corroborative evidence that the deceased had bruising on her back. This is consistent with the offender Duffy participating to the extent of sitting on the deceased’s back to restrain her while Evans tightened the belt around her neck. On Duffy’s evidence, [XY] did not take part in restraining the deceased while the attack with the belt took place. The Crown submits that the Court should find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender Duffy physically joined in the attack on the deceased initiated by Evans.”


	
	This issue was squarely raised in submissions by counsel for the offender in the course of the sentencing hearing. [31]  The discussion extended to the assault with the bottle by XY, the placing of the belt around the neck of Ms Ayers and holding Ms Ayers down. With respect to the use of the belt, counsel for the offender submitted that if the jury had found that he was party to an agreement to use the belt, they would have convicted him of murder, not manslaughter. [32]  The judge suggested that that conclusion also depended on a finding as to his intention; counsel maintained his submission that use of the belt would have resulted in a conviction for murder. [33]  There followed an exchange as to physical assistance: [34] 
	


“HIS HONOUR: What do you say about the Crown's submissions that without his physical assistance by holding Ms Ayers down, [Ms Evans] couldn't have successfully achieved what happened[?]

TREVALLION: That is pure speculation. My friend referred to a bruise on the lower back of the deceased, but there was no evidence at the trial as to when that was caused or how it was caused. This relies on the evidence of [Ms Evans], which was obviously rejected by the jury. The evidence is that the offender was putting pressure on the upper part of the deceased's back, not the lower part. Whatever bruises were at the lower part of the back, there is no evidence of them being connected in any way to the actual killing of [Ms Ayers]. …

HIS HONOUR: It is difficult to see how, if she wasn't being held down, how she could have been strangled so quickly or even at all.

…

TREVALLION: Once the pressure was put around the neck.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, but before the pressure was put around, Miss Evans had to put the belt round and loop it through.

TREVALLION: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: If Miss Ayers was not being held down at that time, it is very unlikely that she would have been killed so quickly.”


	
	It was undoubtedly true that the finding of physical assistance could not be justified by reference to the precise terms of any particular evidence. Nevertheless, the finding could not be described as speculative. It was based on an understanding of various parts of the evidence and the drawing of inferences, some of which found support in circumstantial evidence. There can be no suggestion that the judge mistook the facts, nor that the inferences drawn were not reasonably open. He expressly identified the relevant standard of proof, as had the senior Crown prosecutor in her submissions. The finding under challenge is not one which should be rejected by this Court.
	
	
	That being the only basis on which the sentence was challenged, the applicant should have leave to appeal against sentence, but the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	With respect to the application for leave to appeal against conviction:

4443890,"R v McGlone, Richard;; R v McKell, Jason Troy [2016] NSWDC 418","SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Jason Troy McKell and Richard McGlone appear for sentence in respect of a number of offences of which they were found guilty by a jury on 21 July 2016. The trial proceedings commenced with applications before Judge Baly on 6 and 7 June 2016 and the matter commenced before me on 8 June 2016. With a jury empanelled, the matter started on 9 June 2016.
	
	
	Each of the offenders was found guilty by the jury in respect of an offence that on 20 May 2013, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did import a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity. The quantity was 63,177.1 grams of pure pseudoephedrine. Such an offence is contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	The maximum penalty provided is 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $850,000. In respect of that offence, Mr McKell asks the Court to take into account a further offence pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), being an offence contrary to s 33(1) of the Customs Act 1901.  I note in respect of the additional matter to be taken into account that the penalty includes no term of imprisonment but simply a maximum pecuniary penalty of $85,000.
	
	
	That offence is intentionally moving customs goods, namely an air freight consignment with the airway bill number 176-3978 5955, the said goods being the subject of the control of customs and the movement not being authorised by the Customs Act 1901. As will be referred to later, that offence relates to conduct in respect of what is later referred to as Consignment 1.
	
	
	Each of the offenders was also found guilty of a charge that between about 13 May 2013 and about 20 May 2013, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, and elsewhere, did conspire with each other and divers others to import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity.
	
	
	The quantity was 5,698.6 grams of pure methamphetamine. Such an offence is contrary to s 307.1(1) and s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty provided is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $1,275,000.
	
	
	Jason McKell was also found guilty by the jury in respect of a charge that he on 20 May 2013 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, dealt with money or property that was, and that he believed to be, proceeds of crime, and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $100,000 or more. The actual amount was $400,150. Such an offence is contrary to s 400.6(1) of the Criminal Code and the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $204,000.
	
	
	Richard McGlone was also found guilty of an offence that he on 20 May 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales dealt with money or property that was and that he believed to be proceeds of crime, and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or property was $10,000 or more. The actual amount was $42,550. Such an offence is contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty provided is 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $102,000.
	
	
	The facts relating to the offences are as follows.
	


SUMMARY: 

1. These matters involve Richard McGlone (McGlone) and Jason Troy McKell (McKell) and their role in the importation into Australia of three consignments via air freight.

The first consignment was not intercepted by authorities and there is no evidence that it contained any prohibited substance. It was relevant to the Crown case as evidence of the system used to effect deceit of the authorities.

The second consignment contained a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor, namely 63,177.1 grams of pure pseudoephedrine sent from Dhaka, Bangladesh, concealed in pails purporting to contain an adhesive, with the gross weight of approximately 77.7 kilograms.

Concealed within talcum powder bottles in the third consignment was 9.96 kilograms of a crystalline substance comprising 5,698.6 grams of pure methamphetamine.

2. The money laundering offences relate to money located in each of the accused’s residences following their arrest.

$400,150 in Australian currency was located in McKell's bedroom at his unit in Waterloo. $42,550 was located in a walk-in wardrobe, ($4000) and secreted in the structure of a day seat ($38,550) in McGlone's bedroom at his house at Bronte.

3. McKell has been further charged with intentionally interfering with customs goods in relation to Consignment 1 to be dealt with pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914, when being sentenced in respect of the offence of importing the border controlled precursor, pseudoephedrine.

BACKGROUND

4. In January 2013, Joint Task Force Operation Polaris commenced an investigation into the alleged criminal activities of McGlone.

5. On 11 May 2013, the AFP commenced the interception of a telecommunications service, being a mobile telephone used by McGlone exclusively to contact McKell on another mobile phone used exclusively by McKell to contact McGlone from 11 May 2013. Each of the mobile phones was subscribed in a false name and address, or at least to unidentifiable persons who did not reside at the given address. Both mobiles were with Vodafone and activated on 6 March 2012.

6. At the time of the offences, McKell was employed as the Movements Manager at Wymap Group Propriety Limited, a company providing under bond air freight forwarding and goods handling services. McKell resided at Unit 512/12 Broome Street, Waterloo.

7. At the time of the offences, McGlone was a personal trainer, residing with his wife and children at 24 Evans Street, Bronte.

FACTS

Sunday 12 May 2013

8. On Sunday 12 May 2013, using these mobiles, McKell and McGlone arranged by text to meet for a coffee the following morning at 8am, without any reference in the text as to where.

Monday 13 May 2013

9. The following morning, further text messages were exchanged between McKell and McGlone as McGlone was going to be late.

10. At 8.47am, McKell, using his work mobile, sent a text message to Andrew Neate (Neate), the Unit Allocator at Wymap who worked under McKell's supervision, asking Neate to make enquiries regarding the arrival of three consignments by air and providing to Neate the airway bill numbers (AWB).

11. Neate then made a number of enquiries and responded to McKell via text message, indicating that two of the AWB's did not exist.

12. Neate then made further enquiries with Menzies Aviation, an air freight logistics company, with respect to one of the AWB's and sent a further text message at 9.51am to McKell indicating that none of them existed.

13. Between 11.02am and 6.14pm, further text messages were exchanged between McKell and McGlone. McKell informed McGlone that Consignment 1 was due Wednesday night or Thursday morning and that he was not sure when the others would arrive, using horse racing code ""Not sure when trialling"". They also arranged to meet the following morning without reference to where.

Tuesday 14 May 2013

14. The following morning, McKell sent further text messages to Neate between 7.11am and 7.53am seeking his assistance to check the AWB's.

15. At about 8am, McGlone met with McKell at Cafe Two Baristas (Cafe) in Crystal Street, Waterloo. During this meeting, McKell showed McGlone an iPad screen. A short time later, McKell was observed departing the cafe and entering his residential premises, a building in Broome Street, Waterloo.

16. At around this time, Neate had been making further enquiries with Toll about the three airway bills as requested by McKell and at 8.15am informed McKell that they did not exist at Toll.

17. At 10am, McKell entered a blue Holden utility vehicle with New South Wales registration BHC37W (the blue utility). The blue utility was a Wymap vehicle.

18. At about 10.30am, the blue utility entered the security gate at the QANTAS Limited Freight Terminal, Link Road, Mascot, and continued out of sight.

19. At around this time, Neate had a face to face conversation with McKell at the airport. Neate asked McKell why he had been asking him to chase the airway bills because it was something McKell could do himself. McKell told Neate that he thought Toll was playing games because on the Malaysian Airlines website it was showing that the freight had been booked. He did not explain why he had Neate doing the checks.

20. From 5.13pm, text messages were exchanged between McKell and McGlone arranging to meet at 8.15pm. McGlone was late. There was no reference to where they would meet, except McKell indicating at 8.15 that he was in ""C"" (Cafe).

21. Later that evening at 11.37pm, McKell sent a further text message to Neate requesting a further check on the AWB's.

Wednesday 15 May 2013

22. The following day at 8.15am, Neate responded to McKell indicating that he had not been able to obtain any further information from Toll or Menzies.

23. Later that day at 10:55 pm, McKell sent McGlone a coded message ""Not trialling yet, not sure why, maybe U can ask when"".

Thursday 16 May 2013

24. At 6.32am, McKell used his iPad to track the first and second consignments online. Over the course of the day from 8.14am to 3.22pm, a number of text messages were exchanged between McKell and McGlone regarding enquiries as to what was happening with the AWB's, and arrangements were made to meet at 8pm. At 8.14pm, McGlone by text indicated he would ""Find out today what's happening"" and at 8.27pm, McKell asked ""Thanks, and what's trialling from where"".

25. At 5.25pm, McKell had again used his iPad to track the first and second consignments online.

26. Between 8.08pm and 8.23pm, text messages were exchanged as to McKell being late.

27. At 8.25pm, McGlone and McKell met on a bench seat outside Coles Supermarket, located in Crescent Street, Waterloo. During this meeting, McKell showed McGlone an iPad screen. McGlone and McKell departed at about 8.35pm.

28. Between 9.06pm and 9.49pm they exchanged further text messages; McGlone stating that ""My friend spoke to them out there today and they said what you said and tried to stall trials. Should be next few days"". McKell asked ""Is that for both or just 22?"" and McGlone replied ""22"". Consignment 2 was to consist of 22 cartons.

29. At about 10.05pm, Consignment 1 arrived in Sydney on Emirates flight EK414. The details on the consignment were as follows:

30. Between 10.52pm and 11.02pm, McKell used his iPad to track the first and second consignments online.

31. At 11.06pm, McKell, using his work phone, sent a text message to Savo Miljevic, a truck driver for Wymap. The text message read ""Savo, please get 176-39785955 - keep on your truck, I will pick up off you, ok"".

Friday 17 May 2013

32. At 4.47am, McKell used his iPad to track the first consignment online. At 5.31am, McKell sent a text message to Miljevic ""Savo, do you have????""

33. At 5.32pm, Miljevic rang McKell. In the call McKell directed Miljevic to

""... just keep it on the truck, don't put it in the PDA cause I gotta transfer it, okay?

SM: Just call me when you want, I'm here (indistinct) what time do you want, what you wanna, I give it to you, I bring it to you.

JM: Yeah, okay, um.

SM: Half an hour, one hour.

JM: Yeah probably, what time are you going DHL?

SM: Ah, I’m here already.

JM: Okay keep it on your truck and then, where you going to next?

SM: Ah I'm going to (indistinct) because I couldn't (indistinct) I'm back going to Toll T2.

JM: Okay you'll be there for a while will ya?

SM: No, no, not really, I'll be maybe one hour. I have to pick up second run. I'm going to DHL O'Riordan Street. That's in, I have to do with 7 o'clock DHL O'Riordan Street.

JM: Yeah I'll probably see you after that.

SM: Okay no problem.

JM: So if they ask you, just say no it’s not for you, okay. I've gotta transfer it, okay?

SM: No problem, no problem.

JM: How many pieces?

SM: Ah, five pieces.

JM: Yeah ok, thanks man.

SM: No worries man, bye.”

34. At 8.06am, McGlone sent a text (SMS) to McKell ""Should we aim for lunch time?""

35. At around this time, Miljevic collected Consignment 1 from Toll Dnata at Coward Street, Mascot. The consignment comprised five rectangular cardboard boxes and each was wrapped with plastic.

36. At 8.36am, Miljevic arrived at the DB Schenker freight depot, located in Bourke Road, Alexandria. At about 8.41am, McKell rang Miljevic and after establishing the truck was in Bourke Road, directed Miljevic, ""Oh yeah, hang there, I'll be there in about ten minutes okay"".

37. At 8.53am, McKell responded to McGlone's text message, enquiring whether they should ""Aim for lunchtime"" by text message ""No now"" and McGlone confirmed at 8.59am “Ok"".

38. At 8.59am, McKell, driving the blue utility, entered the secure area of the DB Schenker freight depot and parked next to the Wymap truck. McKell exited the blue utility and opened the cover on the rear tray. McKell then removed five brown cardboard boxes comprising Consignment 1 from the Wymap truck and placed them in the rear tray of the blue utility and closed the cover.

39. At 9.02am, McKell departed the depot driving the blue utility. At about the same time, a white Holden utility vehicle (registration CIP11D; the ""white Holden utility"") being driven by McGlone drove into the underground car park at McKell's unit building in Broome Street, Waterloo. A number of cardboard boxes were in the front passenger seat of the vehicle.

40. The white utility was registered to Juan Fratti of 2 Autumn Leaf Place, St Clair, NSW. Mr Fratti, a personal trainer, gave evidence that he sold the vehicle for cash to an unknown person in early March 2013 in parkland somewhere in Auburn.

41. At 9.05am, McKell again rang Miljevic. The conversation proceeded as follows,

“SM: Hello chief.

JM: Yeah sorry, you didn't put in a PDA did you?

SM: No, no, no.

JM: No that's all right, because I'll put it on the manual. That's good, all good, thank you.

SM: Oh, okay, okay bye.

JM: Thank you, bye.""

42. At 9.10am, McKell, driving the blue utility, entered the underground car park at 12 Broome Street and parked in the vicinity of the elevators. At about 9.30am, the white Holden utility being driven by McGlone drove out of the underground car park.

43. At 9.53am, CCTV footage recorded the blue utility arriving at Menzies depot located at Sydney Domestic Airport, Mascot.

44. At 10.08am, CCTV footage recorded McKell and Miljevic inside the office area of the Menzies depot. Miljevic was informed by McKell that it was a mistake, that the shipment he took was wrong.

45. About 10am, CCTV footage recorded McKell and Miljevic unloading the five boxes comprising Consignment 1 from the blue utility into the Wymap truck.

46. McKell left Menzies after they had put the boxes back in the truck. Miljevic continued collecting deliveries from Menzies that were going to be transported to DHL Global Forwarding in Coward Street, Mascot. Miljevic noticed that all five boxes had been opened, as they had been resealed with brown packing tape, including over the DHL sticker that had the airway bill number on it.

47. At 11.12am, Miljevic sent a text message to McKell ""This boxes is open. Where is damage report"".

48. At about 11.15am, Miljevic rang McKell and was directed to lie about the condition in which they had been received if anyone noticed when delivered. The conversation proceeded as follows,

“JM: Savo.

SM: Hey chief.

JM: Yeah mate.

SM: G'day mate (indistinct) I'm still here at the Menzies, I start to unloading in my truck.

JM: Yep.

SM: And then I found that the boxes was opened. There is different sticky tape around her.

JM: What?

SM: Sticky tape is different and is not original box like it used to be.

JM: Mm.

SM: What are you going to do now?

JM: What do you mean? What are you talking about?

SM: I'm talking about five boxes, my friend.

JM: Oh the five, yeah.

SM: Yeah.

JM: Don't worry about it, cause they were the wrong ones so it's all good.

SM: You reckon?

JM: Yeah mate, yeah, 100%.

SM: Okay chief, no problem.

JM: It doesn't - they're not open are they?

SM: Ah no, I can see mate, they put someone's sticker around her.

JM: I think that was that Direct Courier, that was Direct Couriers.

SM: All right because some of the boxes is put in sticky tape and easy to take off. It wasn't like that when I pick up this morning.

JM: It was shrink-wrapped, wasn't it?

SM: No, no.

JM: It came out on the skid?

SM: Yeah sticky tape, sticky tape, all around the boxes. He put it someone, I don't know who it does but it's much different.

JM: I didn't mate. To tell you the truth, I didn't even see that or check that, sorry, so it doesn't matter, just I'll, I'll - it's all good, I'll - I got you, okay, so don't worry about it, just here it is, that's how it came out if anyone asks, all right?

SM: Okay, no problem chief.

JM: Okay thank you, bye.

SM: Okay, bye.”

49. At 11.38am, McKell rang Miljevic and denied knowledge of the resealing and again directed Miljevic to lie while endeavouring to placate him. The conversation proceeded as follows,

“SM: Hello, Savo speaking.

JM: Yeah Savo, you okay?

SM: Ah yeah (indistinct).

JM: (indistinct)

SM: Someone put stickers there around the DHL stickers, it can't be like that.

JM: Ah mate, I don't know, I took the boxes.

SM: (Over talk)

JM: Listen to me, listen to me, I dropped it off at Direct. They rang me up, don't worry about it.

SM: Okay.

JM: Just drop it off, just put it all amongst everything else and go “here's your pieces’, they'll take it, they'll do whatever they want with it. Just say that's how it came out, okay?

SM: Okay

JM: Just say you collected it this morning and that's how it came out, otherwise if we start saying that we've got stickers on it, I will get in trouble, and I took the wrong boxes, so I'll get in trouble, okay?

SM: Okay.

JM: All right, so say it came out like that, all right?

SM: Okay, you know it's very dangerous, ah, chief, don't worry about putting sticky tape around the DHL stickers, mate, it can't be like that, all the stickers over is going around the sticky tape. No sticky tape around the DHL boxes.

JM: Well, I didn't know mate, I don't know, don't worry about it.

SM: (Over talk)

JM: Just say that you don't know, that's how it came out, okay.

SM: Okay chief, no problems.

JM: Okay thank you, bye bye.

SM: Bye.”

50. At 12.45pm, customs officers attended at DHL in Coward Street, Mascot, and seized the five cardboard boxes comprising Consignment 1. It was observed that the boxes were sealed with brown packing tape. Forensic examination of the boxes identified the fingerprints of McKell on both the underside and top side of the brown packing tape used to re-seal them.

51. The evidence demonstrates that McKell had unlawfully removed Consignment 1 from an under bond transport, met with McGlone at 12 Broome Street, Waterloo, and provided McGlone access to Consignment 1. Consignment 1 was re-sealed and returned to the Wymap truck for transport to the DHL freight depot in Coward Street, Mascot.

52. At about 2.22pm, McKell used his iPad to track the second consignment online.

53. At about 5.42 and 5.54pm McGlone and McKell exchanged text messages arranging to meet the following morning. At 5.42pm, McGlone stated ""Hey brekkie in the morning, can explain"".

Saturday 14 May 2013

62. At 8.18am, McKell met with McGlone outside the Cafe Two Baristas in Waterloo. A listening device recorded the conversation as they spoke about, the flights and route of Consignment 2 and queried whether they had the wrong AWB for Consignment 3. Analysis of McKell's iPad reveals that at the time of the meeting, it was used to access cargo arrival information for the AWB of Consignment 2 and attempting to access the cargo arrival information for the incorrect AWB they had for Consignment 3.

“RM: Anything yet?

JM: Um (indecipherable, background noise). (Indecipherable) it's reported five minutes ago (indecipherable)

64. Also said was ""It's reported five minutes ago"" being a reference to Consignment 2 which had arrived at approximately 8am on 20 May 2013, on board Malaysian Airlines flight number MH123.

65. At 8.22am, McKell and McGlone concluded their meeting. McGlone walked to Crescent Street, Waterloo and entered a silver Toyota Hilux, (Registration BMH07C – ‘silver Toyota Hilux”) and drove away. McKell was observed on CCTV footage entering the Danks Street shopping centre.

66. At about 8.29am, McGlone attended the Kennards Self Storage Facility, located in O'Dea Avenue, Waterloo (“Kennards”). McGlone entered the customer service area and purchased a number of flat pack cardboard boxes and two rolls of clear packing tape.

67. McGlone then attempted to load the flat pack cardboard boxes into the silver Toyota Hilux. At 8.39am, McKell sent McGlone a text message: ""Don't forget to tape the trial"".

68. At the time McGlone looked at his mobile phone.

69. At about 8.42am, McGlone returned flat pack cardboard boxes to the customer service area and at 8.45am, departed Kennards in the silver Toyota Hilux.

70. At 8.51am, McKell used his iPad to track Consignment 2 online.

77. At about 12.52pm, McKell used his iPad to track the second consignment online.

78. At 12.53pm, Miljevic received a call from McKell. The conversation was as follows:

“SM: Hello Savo speaking.

JM: Hello Savo, how are you?

SM: All right, thank you chief.

JM: Yeah where are you buddy?

SM: I'm here at Toll, Toll TP.

JM: For DHL?

SM: Yes correct.

JM: All right, remember that one last week, it's the wrong one, now I've got the real one. Can I, can I give you an airway bill for you to check?

SM: Ah okay mate, okay chief (indistinct) (the “indistinct” was words to the effect of “hold a sec, I want use piece of paper.”)

JM: Yeah thank you.

SM: I'm ready.

JM: Okay 232.

SM: 232.

JM: Yeah, 8501.

SM: 8501.

JM: Okay so if you can just get that and then, and put it on and then I'll come um, and meet you at your next port, okay?

SM: Okay and I'll just check it out now and let you know

JM: Yes please.

SM: Okay I'll let you know, okay bye.

JM: Thank you, thank you bye.

79. At about 12.59pm, Miljevic rang McKell and told McKell he had already put the consignment in his PDA. McKell told Miljevic to cancel it and to leave the consignment on the truck. McKell then spoke about meeting with Miljevic at a later time.

80. At 13.02pm, McKell attempted to track Consignment 3 online using his iPad.

81. At 13.20pm, Miljevic again rang McKell. Miljevic told McKell that he had the consignment on his truck. McKell told Miljevic ""Stay five, I'll meet you somewhere, I'll meet you okay"".

82. At 13.26, Miljevic sent a text message to McKell ""I am rady (sic) to go"".

83. At about 1.30pm, McKell rang Miljevic. During this call, McKell told Miljevic to pull out of Toll and park near “Hellman” or somewhere in front of the building.

84. At about 1.33pm, McKell parked the blue utility next to the Wymap Truck parked on Coward Street Alexandria. The location was directly outside Hellman Worldwide Logistics. McKell exited the blue utility and met with Miljevic. Both McKell and Miljevic unloaded a number of boxes from the rear of the Wymap truck and placed them into the blue utility. McKell entered the blue utility and drove away.

85. At 1.42pm, police stopped the blue utility near the intersection of Kent Street and Coward Street and arrested McKell with Consignment 2.

86. Following McKell's arrest and caution, the following conversation between McKell and police was recorded.

“Detective Glenzendorf: So Jason, did this bloke ask you personally to go and collect them?

JM: Yeah.

Detective: Or is this something you normally do?

JM: I have done it before for other clients. He asked me, he said 'there's an airway bill'. An airway bill is something that comes through on the client. He said 'Can you get these for me, they're DVD's. If they get ... if I get in trouble ... if they found, find out I'm importing DVD's I'll get in trouble. I don't know, like, I guess on a DVD it says pirating or something like that.

Detective: Like do not duplicate and things like that?

McKell: Yeah yeah, shit like that and I thought fuck.

Detective: So have these gone through customs inspection yet or you don't know?

McKell: Yeah, actually I don't know, well I assume so because they have come through the CTO. You know, they have to, they've got to get cleared off the plane, so they go from the plane, stop there, they're at Link Road, transported over to here and then we transport it from here to wherever it has to go

Detective: To wherever the customer is.

McKell: Yeah.

Detective: And what was the delivery address for these ones?

McKell: He just said I'll meet you at your place and pick them up.

Detective: Okay, what time?

McKell: Whatever time I said.

Detective: Have you said yet or not?

McKell: No.

Detective: Okay, but you said you had to phone him, is that right?

McKell: Yeah I'll text him and say I'll see you soon.

Detective: Okay.

McKell: And he will come to my house or he might say I'll meet you at wherever.

Detective: Did you speak to this -

McKell: Guy? No.

Detective: What's his name?

McKell: Rick.

Detective: Rick. Did you speak to him before you picked up the goods?

McKell: No

87. Examination of Consignment 2 revealed that of the 22 boxes, 15 were found to each contain five plastic pails, a total of 75 pails. The pails were labelled ""Printing transfer adhesive"" and ""Made in Bangladesh"" and each contained a fine white powder. The gross weight of the powder was approximately 77.7 kilograms.

88. Forensic analysis of Consignment 2 by the National Measurements Institute calculated the purities ranging between 80.7% and 81.9% with an average of 81.3%. The weight of pure pseudoephedrine was calculated to be 63,177.1 grams.

89. A black apple iPhone mobile telephone handset and a black Nokia C5-00 mobile telephone handset were located within the blue utility.

90. The Nokia C5-00 mobile telephone handset seized from the blue utility contained a Vodafone SIM card associated with telecommunications service 0450130655, the telecommunication service used exclusively by McKell for communication with McGlone on 0450134687, which was also used exclusively for communication with McKell from 11 May 2013.

91. Analysis of the Nokia C5-00 handset revealed that the contact numbers for a number of Wymap and DHL employees were saved in the contacts, including McKell. Further, incoming text messages from telecommunications service 0450134687 (McGlone) dating back to 5 December 2012 were recorded in the handset's memory.

92. Analysis of the Vodafone SIM card also revealed incoming text messages from telecommunications service 0450134687 (McGlone) dating back to 2 August 2012.

93. Analysis of the Apple iPhone mobile telephone handset revealed an electronic note entry dated 17 May 2013 containing the following details: the notation ""AWB 232-58019362"" which referred to the AWB of Consignment 2; and the notation ""125-90383701 - no record"" which referred to the consignment with AWB 125-93083701 (Consignment 3) with the numbers 3 and 0 incorrectly transposed.

ARREST OF McGLONE

94. At 2.52pm, McGlone exited 24 Evans Street and entered the white Holden utility and drove to Surrey Hills.

95. Pursuant to a Controlled Operations Authority, police took control of telecommunications service 0450130655 and moved the blue utility which substituted boxes purporting to be the complete consignment to the underground car park located at McKell's unit building in Broome Street, Waterloo.

96. At 2.53pm, McGlone sent a text message to McKell asking ""What time?""

97. At 3.11pm, police using the 0450130655 service responded ""Running a bit behind time, be there just after 5"" to which McGlone responded ""Okay"". At 4.44pm, the officers sent ""Here"" and at 4.49 ""Down in a sec"".

98. At about 4.45pm, McGlone drove the white Holden utility into the underground car park at Broome Street, Waterloo. He opened the cover of the vehicle and exposed a number of brown cardboard boxes in the rear. He then walked over to the blue utility and lifted the cover and looked inside the rear tray. Police then arrested and cautioned McGlone.

99. McGlone was searched and located in his pocket was a grey Nokia dual SIM mobile telephone handset containing one Vodafone SIM card.

100. Analysis of the Nokia dual SIM mobile telephone handset seized from McGlone, revealed the handset was identified by two separate IME numbers, and that the Vodafone SIM card was for service 0450134687.

101. Analysis of the Vodafone SIM card revealed incoming text messages from telecommunications service 0450130655 (McKell) dating back to 17 May 2013.

102. As police were inspecting the tray of the white Holden utility, McGlone stated (after his arrest and caution) that the cardboard boxes located in the rear contained 75 pails of ""substitute"".

“McGlone: The five big ones have got 12 in them.

Detective: Sorry, what was that?

McGlone: The five big ones have 12, and the three small ones have five.

Detective: 12, what do you mean by 12?

McGlone: 12 of the substitute, 12 of the substitute.

Detective: Okay so 12 tubs?

McGlone: Yes.

Detective: Okay, what's the powder in there?

McGlone: Honestly, I don't know.

Detective: You don't know?”

103. McGlone intended to remove the 75 pails containing pseudoephedrine from Consignment 2 and substitute them with the 75 pails of inert substance from the rear of the white Holden utility.

104. The only rational inference is that the intention was to reseal the cardboard boxes, and return them with the substitute to the under bond transport system and deliver them to DHL, hence the pseudoephedrine would have been removed from the possibility of detection and its importation completed.

SEARCH OF McKELL RESIDENCE - Broome Street, Waterloo

105. On the evening of 20 May 2013, police executed a search warrant on McKell's residential unit in Broome Street, Waterloo. During the search, police located $400,150 in Australian currency in McKell's bedroom. The money was secured within a silver lock box. Located on the bedside table in his bedroom was a handwritten note detailing the number ""125-90383701"".

VALUE OF THE IMPORTS

117. The wholesale value of the pseudoephedrine if sold in a pure form on the black market is between $6.16 million and $6.93 million. If the pseudoephedrine was used to manufacture methamphetamine, the practical yield would be 58.88 kilograms of pure methamphetamine with a value, if sold on a per kilo basis, of between $11.6 million and $15.08 million.

118. The wholesale value of the methamphetamine if sold in crystal form on the black market is between $1.99 and $2.5 million and between $3.43 and $5.39 million in powder form.

OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS


	
	The evidence before the Court demonstrates a very sophisticated and well-resourced criminal enterprise to import substantial quantities of border controlled precursor and drug into Australia. The enterprise required the establishment of a system to abuse customs procedures, requiring not simply a knowledge of the procedures, but the participation of a person in authority who was able to direct other persons to comply with breaches of the under bond customs transport system to enable removal of the substances from the system. Such a system must, as a matter of common sense, have been arranged prior to the investment of substantial funds to allow the purchase of the substances overseas and air transport. The quantities involved were substantial, as referred to above. The consignments originated from a number of different countries.
	


Consignment 1 – Chile;

Consignment 2 – Bangladesh;

Consignment 3 - Abidjan.


	
	This alone discloses a truly sophisticated international criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Consignment 2 involved the pre-arrangement of a significant quantity of substitute in identical pails to those in Consignment 2. There is no evidence as to when or how the substitute pails were imported, but the inevitable inference is that they had been imported from Bangladesh prior to the arrival of Consignment 2 in order to facilitate the removal of the pseudoephedrine while under bond and replacement with the substitute to ensure that the system would not be discovered and could continue to operate.
	
	
	While not crucial, it also involved investment in the white utility for transport after removal of the imports, with at least the prospect that in the absence of the vehicle being stopped while occupied in the offences, any subsequent identification by the authorities of its involvement and enquiries as to its registered owner would lead nowhere.
	
	
	Communications between McGlone and McKell were coded and on mobile phones used exclusively for communications between them relating to the importations with false subscriber details to hinder any possible discovery by the authorities.
	
	
	McGlone on a number of occasions undertook to McKell to obtain further information, and subsequently responded with updates.
	
	
	Despite the very high level of physical and electronic surveillance, the authorities were unable to identify the involvement of any other participant in the enterprise, nor were they able to identify any link between McGlone and/or McKell to the ordering, payment or arrangements for any of the consignments. This again indicates a sophisticated criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The wholesale value of the importations has already been referred to. They were of very substantial value on the black market, being in the millions of dollars. While the legislation distinguishes between border controlled drugs and border controlled precursors on the basis of their nature, and within the separate categories on the basis of differing quantity thresholds relevant to commercial quantities, the quantity of any particular drug or pre-cursor remains an important consideration, although not the only consideration in respect of any assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence.
	
	
	Pseudoephedrine is a precursor that can be converted to methamphetamine. Methamphetamine in recent years has become a very serious concern to the community because of the frequently publicised and known adverse consequences for users. It has penetrated all levels of society and all geographical locations. There is no urban or rural setting, large or small where it is now not available, and its harm to the community is legion. Those who participate in supplying the black market with methamphetamine or its precursor do so knowingly as to its pernicious effects, and in total disregard for the community and the law.
	
	
	In respect of pseudoephedrine, the commercial quantity threshold is 1.2 kilograms or more of pure substance. 63,177 grams is more than 52 times the threshold.
	
	
	In respect of methamphetamine, the commercial threshold is 750 grams or more pure substance. 5,698 grams is more than seven and a half times the threshold.
	
	
	The extent to which a border controlled precursor or drug exceeds the commercial threshold is clearly a relevant matter to be taken into account in establishing the objective seriousness of the offence. In each case, the quantities were substantially in excess of the legislated threshold.
	
	
	While I will subsequently deal with the respective role and participation of each of the offenders, I note that there is no evidence of a hierarchy in the enterprise, as opposed to whether the management and control was a flat structure where the various persons involved, including any potential co‑offenders, were of equal status but with different functions. Nor is there any evidence that would permit distinction between the offenders and any other possible co-offender on the basis of reward received or anticipated. Neither of the accused has provided any illumination on these issues at any time, either on arrest, at trial or on sentence.
	
	
	An offender who wishes to be perceived as having a lesser role or participation than another must demonstrate that on the balance of probabilities. Of course, it is necessary for the Court, before taking any matter adverse to an accused into account on sentence to find facts consistent with the jury verdicts as well as find such facts beyond reasonable doubt. R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199CLR 270.
	
	
	In that light, the offences in respect of the importation Count 1 and conspiracy to import, Count 2, must be regarded as objectively very serious instances of such offences.
	
	
	As to the respective offences relating to the proceeds of crime, I accept that the only rational inference consistent with the jury verdicts and the circumstances as to the possession of each of the offenders of the money, is that the money in their respective possession was as a result of, or as pre‑payment for, involvement in drug activity, and that the offenders were each cognisant of that fact. Each of the offenders was a principal in the possession. The particular circumstances of each possession have already been referred to.
	
	
	In respect of McKell, the jury clearly rejected his evidence that the $400,150 in cash was the unrecorded cash winnings from his “on course” betting over a number of years. Such a rejection by the jury was inevitable in the circumstances of the evidence of his recorded betting with Tabcorp between 28 February 2012 and 29 August 2013, showing a loss of $117,934.88, and his William Hill account showing a loss between December 2006 and May 2013 of $136,177.73, giving a total loss between the two accounts of $254,112.61.
	
	
	In respect of McGlone, who did not give or call evidence except as to character, the $43,150 was entirely inconsistent with his and his wife's tax returns and their outgoings in respect of lifestyle, rent and vehicle lease fees. That is, the evidence demonstrated a lifestyle not supported by income, and in circumstances of traces of cocaine being found on kitchen scales and eighteen 1 gram deal bags in the matrimonial walk-in wardrobe.
	
	
	In those circumstances, in each case each particular offence is an objectively serious offence within the range of objective seriousness for such an offence.
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS - Jason McKell


	
	Mr McKell gave evidence in the trial but not on sentence. Material in respect of subjective matters is sourced from the following:
	
	
	The report of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 28 September 2016, and references from Maureen McKell, the mother of the offender, Debbie McKell, sister of the offender, Shaun Willey, brother-in-law, Corey Adams, Station Commander Balmain Fire Station And Vice President of the Cudgee JRLFC. John Dignan, financial accountant, Wymap Group, Anthony Demetrios, treasurer of Cudgee JRLFC, Keryl Byrne, a senior manager in banking and financial services and qualified lawyer, Scott Murray, Geoff Tunk, Richard Allen, Trent Collins, Dean Johnson, Brendan Prouse, all being football associates and friends of longstanding of the offender; Reverend Peter Baines, chaplain at Long Bay Correctional Centre as to the offender’s regular attendance at church and being a ""normal inmate"".
	
	
	The offender is 45 years of age and has only one past conviction, being for stealing as a clerk or servant in August 1999. He is the eldest of two children to his parents’ union. Born in Queensland, he lived in New South Wales when young and in Penang, Malaysia, for several years before returning to Queensland. He and his younger sister spent two years residing with an aunt and uncle in Gladstone as teenagers. He completed the HSC in 1989 in Bundaburg, obtaining a score that would have allowed university admission. After high school, he worked in spare parts at an uncle's car yard before working casually in New South Wales while playing country rugby league.
	
	
	In 1995, he moved to Sydney and worked in bars and clubs while pursuing his football career. He worked as a surveyor’s assistant for two to three years before commencing work as a truck driver with Wymap Group in 2002. At Wymap, he progressed to being the Transport and Movements Manager in charge of 50 to 60 drivers and 20 trucks.
	
	
	In this position he describes himself as ""managing everything"". He has obtained a Certificate III in Business Management and partially completed Certificate IV at TAFE to improve his understanding of management.
	
	
	The offender’s father, now deceased, was in the air force and did not work after leaving that service due to alcohol problems. He was abusive and occasionally violent to the offender, but not his wife. As a result, the offender only drinks socially and does not consume any prohibited drugs. He claims to have an anti-drug reputation in rugby league circles, and that assertion is supported by a number of the referees.
	
	
	He is currently single, although he has had a number of relationships of some years. There is one son of a short term relationship and although he has paid child support, he has no relationship with the now 18 year old. He has given a lot of his time over the years to coaching and mentoring young rugby league teams and players. Many of his referees are persons whose friendship has commenced because of his association with football. His career as a player resulted in a number of injuries and operations which have left him with residual discomfort, dealt with by consuming anti-inflammatory medications, particularly for joint pain.
	
	
	Mr McKell does not suffer from any mental or intellectual deficits, although he has suffered periods of despondency on the breakdown of past relationships, and has been anxious and depressed since being charged and has required an anti-depressant medication, PrIstiq. He saw a psychiatrist on one occasion and a counsellor on 12 to 14 occasions. Depression and anxiety are frequent consequences of being charged. He is said to be in partial remission, the anti-depressant being provided while in custody since trial.
	
	
	He gave evidence in the trial and the Crown produced financial records of his recorded gambling accounts. He also called evidence as to his success at “on course” betting. He had part owned four racehorses and has had some very successful race days, but his recorded bets on races demonstrated a substantial loss for the years produced.
	
	
	His family and friends view him in a highly favourable light and have expressed their ongoing support, and disbelief that he committed the offences. He has a very good reputation as a coach and football/life mentor to his teams which have endured substantial success. The community has benefited from his involvement in football.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen opines that he ""would appear to have a good prognosis and prospect for rehabilitation, from his age and current maturity, the absence of any pattern of anti-social behaviour or recurrent substantial use disorder, which are the main predictors of recidivism. There is also a history of continuous employment in a responsible role, which suggests that he would be able to return to full time employment at a similar level.”
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS - Richard McGlone


	
	Subjective matters are sourced from: the report of Ms Andrea Davidson, psychologist, dated 6 October 2016, Jody McGlone, wife of the offender, Paige Dowd, ex-defacto partner of the offender, Anthony Reilly, co-ordinator of the First Nations program at St Ignatius College, Riverview, John Restuccia, a director of Surf Life Saving NSW, Leigh Rockman, personal training client, a medical report by Dr Laura Gavson, psychiatry registrar, The Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Victoria, in respect of Ms Dowd, and printouts from the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services in relation to the offender’s participation in a number of programs including Visual Arts, Health Survival Tips, Work Readiness, and a single page, also from New South Wales Department of Corrective Services, relating to the offender’s work assignments, indicating work while in custody for a period of approximately a week in 2016 as an accommodation cleaner.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence in the trial, or on sentence. He is 40 years of age, was approximately 37 at the time. The offender has no previous criminal convictions. He was born in New Zealand, the second of three children, and is of Maori descent. With his parents, he migrated to Australia when he was four years of age. His parents separated in 2011 and he experienced an unsettled childhood characterised by a disconnected family life, absent close attachment and nurturing guidance. Although he displayed challenging social behaviour at primary school and was regularly disciplined for disruptive behaviour between Years 1-5, he found his interest in sports, being a successful rugby player, playing in representative sides from 12 years of age and his behavioural concerns had resolved by Year 7.
	
	
	He completed the High School Certificate with average grades and embarked on a career as a professional rugby league player. Serious injuries, however, forced him to cease football in 1997, shortly after commencing his adult career. He subsequently worked as an airport baggage handler for five years before completing a certificate in personal training and commencing a business as a personal trainer. In 2008, he invested in a restaurant with his brother, which failed within two years, creating significant financial stress and causing the sale of his house to meet debt.
	
	
	His interests and friendships have been orientated around his interest in sport and personal training. After high school, he commenced a relationship with Ms Paige Dowd. The union lasted approximately ten years, and there are three boys of the union, aged 19, 18 and 16. The eldest and youngest are already participants in the work force and their middle son was due to sit the recent High School Certificate. In 2005, he commenced a new relationship and married in 2006. There are three daughters of the union, aged nine, eight and approximately six months. The youngest child must of course have been conceived while the offender was at liberty awaiting trial, with potential significant consequences to his family circumstances being obvious.
	
	
	He reported no history of problematic substance use, drinking alcohol occasionally and only using cocaine regularly when he was operating the restaurant. He briefly experimented with ecstasy in his twenties. The sporting injuries have left him with chronic pain in the hips and lower back, and although he has suffered intermittent mood disturbances since adolescence, they have never required treatment, either psychological or pharmacological, and he has no other mental health difficulties. He has had a relatively stable and functional adult life.
	
	
	Ms Davidson, psychologist, opines that he does not have an entrenched pattern of conduct disordered behaviour during childhood or an anti-social personality, and that his strong intellectual, vocational, and social resources provide for a favourable prognosis, provided that there is management of his mood disturbance and counselling to assist him in dealing with his childhood experience of emotional abuse and the fractured relationship with his father.
	
	
	The references from the persons that I have previously referred to demonstrate that the offender is highly regarded by the referees as a very supportive parent and partner who has a close and caring relationship with all of his children, as well as his wife and ex-partner. As a result, he continues to enjoy a high level of support, which can be expected to continue. He has contributed to the community through his support of youth engaged in sport.
	
	
	There can be no doubt that his conviction in respect of these offences has created financial and emotional problems for his families, and that such problems will continue while he is incarcerated. However, these are the ordinary and expected consequences of committing serious criminal offences. It is very regrettable the offender did not give greater regard to the potential adverse consequences for his loved ones, if not himself, before embarking on this offending.
	


ROLE OF THE OFFENDERS


	
	The critical consideration for the Court is to determine what each of the offenders did in participating in the drug importation offences.
	
	
	The Court must have regard to the role played by an offender in the particular activities undertaken in performing that role. Care must be taken to ensure that a shorthand description of the offender's role does not obscure the assessment of what the offender actually did.  The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19].
	


McGlone


	
	In relation to the importation of Consignments 2 and 3, McGlone did the following:
	



	
	Used the 0450134687 phone service subscribed in false details exclusively to contact McKell. A code was employed in the communications dealing with the consignments.
	
	
	Obtained the AWB numbers for the three consignments and provided them to McKell.
	
	
	On at least six occasions over the course of a week, meet with McKell to discuss and make arrangements in relation to the three consignments.
	
	
	Obtained the correct airway bill number from Consignment 3 from an unknown third party also involved in the importation at some time on 20 May 2013, making a handwritten note of the number.
	
	
	Used a utility registered in the name of a third party, Carlos Fratti, in connection with Consignment 2.
	
	
	Obtained pails and stickers identical to those within Consignment 2 filled with an inert substance in order to substitute them for the precursor in Consignment 2 and return the consignment to an under bond warehouse without being detected.
	
	
	Purchased packing tape, implements and boxes to facilitate the substitution of Consignment 2.
	
	
	Drove to McKell's basement car park with the substitute boxes and pails with the intention of taking possession of the contents of Consignment 2.
	
	
	With respect to Consignment 3, entered into an agreement with McKell to import methamphetamine into Australia.
	



	
	The agreed drug importation venture involved an agreement that McGlone and McKell would deal with the methamphetamine by:
	



	
	One or both of them taking possession of the consignment after it arrived into Australia, and/or
	
	
	Arranging for the release of the consignment after it arrived into Australia, such that it could be collected by or delivered to another participant in the conspiracy.
	


McKell


	
	In relation to the importation of Consignments 2 and 3, McKell did the following:
	



	
	Used the 0450130655 mobile subscribed in false details exclusively to contact McGlone. A code was employed in the communications dealing with the consignment.
	
	
	On at least six occasions over the course of a week, met with McGlone to discuss and make arrangements in relation to the three consignments.
	
	
	Instructed Andrew Neate, a Wymap employee, to make enquiries in relation to the airway bill numbers for all three consignments.
	
	
	Used his iPad on numerous occasions to track the progress of the three consignments.
	
	
	Reported back to McGlone about the enquiries he had made.
	
	
	Made a note on his iPhone of the incorrect airway bill number he had at that time for Consignment 3.
	
	
	Instructed an employee of Wymap under his direction, Savo Miljevic, to collect Consignment 2 and deliver it to him despite the fact that it was under bond freight and he knew this to be the case.
	
	
	He instructed this employee to cancel the delivery of Consignment 2 from his electronic run sheet to avoid detection.
	
	
	Took delivery of Consignment 2 from Miljevic with the intention of delivering it to McGlone in his basement car park.
	
	
	Used his position of trust within Wymap and the under bond system to circumvent customs control of Consignment 2.
	
	
	In respect of Consignment 3, entered into an agreement with McGlone to import methamphetamine into Australia.
	



	
	The agreed drug importation venture involved an agreement that McGlone and McKell would deal with the methamphetamine by:
	



	
	One or both of them taking possession of the consignment after it arrived into Australia and/or
	
	
	Arranging for the release of the consignment after it arrived in Australia such that it could be collected by or delivered to another participant in the conspiracy.
	



	
	The foregoing demonstrates that McGlone also played an essential role in the importation of the Count 1 and Count 2 consignments. He provided the airway bill numbers to McKell with a view to taking possession of the consignments, or making them available to the ultimate intended recipients. He was in contact with other members of the group and was to execute the substitution of the pseudoephedrine in Consignment 2 before it was to be returned to the freight forwarders. McGlone acted as the sole contact point between McKell and the organisers of the importation.
	
	
	In relation to Consignment 2, the role played by McKell was vital to the success of the importation. His access to inside information and ability to access the consignment itself was premised on his role as “Movements Manager” within the Wymap Group. He was in a position to, and did, direct innocent employees of the business to assist him in gaining access to the consignments so as to make it available to McGlone. The importation of Consignment 2 could only have been put into effect with McKell's insider knowledge of the under bond freight system and the intricacies of the day to day operations of freight forwarders operating in and around Sydney airports.
	
	
	McKell's role in relation to Consignment 3 was to track its progress and provide this information to McGlone with a view to taking possession of it himself or making it available to the ultimate intended recipients. As the receiver of the crucial consignment details, McGlone was in a position closer to those who had organised the importations than McKell, and may be viewed in that circumstance as more senior; however, the unique position occupied by McKell to facilitate the importations, and what he actually did in relation to the importations, places each of them on an equal footing in terms of their criminality.
	


AMOUNT OF THE DRUG


	
	Despite the criticism expressed by the High Court in Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 the weight of the drug remains a relevant factor which the Court must have regard to in determining the seriousness of the offence. This is particularly so where there is limited evidence before the Court as to the extent of any drug organisation behind the importation. The weight of the drug will have increased significance where the offender has knowledge of the amount of the drug and/or the precursor to be imported. R v Nguyen and Ors (2005) 157 A Crim R 80 at [110].
	
	
	With respect to Consignment 2, McGlone was aware of the quantity to be imported. This was demonstrated by his possession of the substitute pails. This was also demonstrated by McGlone having a line of communication with those organising the importation as evidenced by him obtaining the airway bill numbers initially and then obtaining the correct airway bill number for Consignment 3 some time on 20 May 2013. McGlone's contact with other unknown persons in respect of the third consignment and his necessarily detailed knowledge of the second strongly suggest he knew the approximate amount of drug concealed within Consignment 3, or at least that it would contain a substantial quantity to warrant the organisation and personal risk.
	
	
	While there is no direct evidence to suggest that McKell was aware of the exact quantity of drugs or precursors to be imported in each consignment, the evidence does suggest that he knew that they contained a significant quantity with a not insignificant value. This includes:
	



	
	The length McKell went to in terms of time and effort expended to effect the consignments and conceal his direct involvement;
	
	
	The fairly sophisticated methodology employed to retrieve Consignment 2;
	
	
	The amount of money possessed in his home, subject to the proceeds of crimes offence, the inference being that it is either accumulated wealth from previous activity or pre-payment for his involvement in the importation of the consignment;
	
	
	The willingness of McKell to involve himself in this activity, in particular abusing his position of trust within his company, the inference being that he would only do this if he sought to gain considerably on a financial level;
	
	
	He knew the size and the weight of at least Consignments 1 and 2 through his online tracking of the consignments, and had arrangements in place for the pick-up of the consignments via truck in the utility vehicle.
	



	
	While there is no specific evidence to suggest that the offenders would receive any financial reward for their respective roles in the offences, the obvious motivation for each offender’s involvement is the common sense inference that the offenders were involved for profit. There is no evidence to the contrary. R v Kaldor (2004) 158 A Crim R 271 at [104].
	
	
	Given the value of the drugs, the offenders’ important roles in the importation enterprise and the cash money located at each of the offender’s homes, I infer that each offender was to receive a very significant financial reward for his involvement in the importation offences.
	


DETERRENCE


	
	The principle of general deterrence is a relevant factor that must be taken into account when sentencing an offender under the Crimes Act for a Commonwealth offence. DPP (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377. It is a fundamental consideration when sentencing an offender for a drug importation offence. R v Riddell (2009) NSWCCA 96 at [55] – [58]. Sentences imposed on offenders in relation to offences such as these must be of such a severity as to deter others from engaging in illicit drug activities of this nature, and must signal to would-be traffickers that the potential financial rewards to be gained from such activities are neutralised by the risk of severe punishment. R v Cheung Wai Man and Ors (NSWSC, 22 March 1991, unreported, per Sully J) and as cited in subsequent cases including R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355 at [114].
	
	
	Involvement at any level in a drug importation offence must attract a significant sentence otherwise the interests of general deterrence are not served. R v Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474 at 476. In relation to proceeds of crime offences, general deterrence is also of particular importance. Proceeds of crime charges by their nature tend to be difficult to detect, investigate and to prosecute. This type of offence critically involves the possession (or disposition) of funds used or gained from illegal activities, without confidence in which the original crimes would be unlikely to be committed in the first place.
	
	
	In relation to specific deterrence, the offences before the Court were not an uncharacteristic aberration for the offenders. The cash seized in each of the offender's residence, and the drugs and scales (contaminated with traces of cocaine) located at McGlone's residence indicate that both offenders have been engaged in the drug trade over a period of time, although neither is being sentenced except in respect of the current offences.
	
	
	Accordingly, there is a strong need for specific deterrence in this instance. Objectively viewed, the offender's criminality is very high, and a substantial period of full time imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence in the circumstances to have an adequate deterrent effect on these offenders and to reflect general deterrence.
	
	
	As previously referred to, the trial with the offenders commenced before me on 8 June 2016, and continued for some 25 days. The jury returned their verdicts on 21 July 2016.
	
	
	McKell gave evidence at trial, as he was entitled to. He mounted a positive defence case that he believed that Consignments 1 and 2 were direct freight and not subject to customs control, and that he did not believe or suspect that Consignments 2 and 3 contained either a border controlled precursor or a border controlled drug, respectively. He denied any involvement in the drug trade and gave evidence that the money located in his bedroom was the proceeds of gambling activity that stretched back over a number of years.
	
	
	The manner in which he conducted his defence is not an aggravating feature, but it does establish a lack of entitlement to any discount for contrition or remorse.
	
	
	As at 13 September 2016, when consulting with Dr Nielssen, he continued with his complete denial of having committed the offences and maintained his funds were from a legitimate source. He continues to demonstrate by that a lack of insight into his offending.
	
	
	Neither of the offenders has demonstrated any contrition or remorse for their offending.
	
	
	Mr McKell has a previous conviction, preceding these offences by approximately 14 years, involving a breach of his employer’s trust but he had managed since that time to reach a position of authority with Wymap. That is a period of relative good character subsequent to the 1999 offence. I previously referred to the high regard he is held in by his associates.
	
	
	Mr McGlone of course has no prior convictions. It is, however, a well-established principle that for offences of this nature, prior good character is generally of less weight as a mitigating factor. Onuorah (2009) NSWCCA 238 at (49). 
	
	
	Neither Mr McKell or Mr McGlone is entitled to any leniency that might otherwise be afforded to first time offenders in circumstances where it is clear that their involvement in these matters was not an isolated event, but part of an ongoing involvement in the drug trade, as demonstrated by:
	



	
	The large amount of cash located at each of their premises
	
	
	The high patterns of personal spending above their legitimately earned income. In the case of McKell, represented by gambling losses, and in respect of McGlone, car, holiday and housing expenses.
	
	
	The cocaine pills and scales contaminated with traces of cocaine located at McGlone's residence.
	
	
	The coded communication between the two offenders using phones registered in false names over a period extending potentially up to 12 months before their arrest.
	



	
	I have previously referred in particular to the hardship to the family of Mr McGlone, however hardship to an offender’s family will only operate as a mitigating factor where it is sufficiently extreme - that is, beyond the sort of hardship which inevitably results to a family when a parent is incarcerated. It does, however, remain as a relevant factor to take into account as part of an offender’s ""general mix"" of subjective features, and I have done so.
	
	
	It has been submitted by Mr Smith on behalf of the offender McGlone that, in some aspects, although not specifically identified by Mr Smith, there was some cooperation with the Crown during the course of the trial.
	
	
	One of the first exhibits was in fact the Agreed Facts in relation to the actual importations, that is, the circumstances, and there was further cooperation during the course of the trial in relation to the compilation of a number of summary schedules, which I have no doubt would have made it easier for the jury to follow the evidence. It was, however, in the interest of all parties not to unnecessarily prolong the matter. Either way, Mr Smith SC's submission was in effect that the trial was not as protracted as it might have been. I will, however, as part of the instinctive synthesis, take into account that there was some reasonable level of cooperation. That applies to both offenders, even though the submission was only made by Mr Smith.
	
	
	Proceedings were commenced in the Supreme Court against each of the accused in respect of the respective sums of money found on their premises and in respect of which they were convicted. Each of the offenders consented to the forfeiture of the funds, the subject of the proceeds of crime charges. That, in the circumstances, is a matter of assistance that can be taken into account on sentence. However, in relation to the forfeiture order and cooperation during the trial, while taking them into account as part of the instinctive synthesis of establishing an appropriate sentence, they are not such as to result in some calculated discount for the sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	In respect of Mr McKell, there was some assistance also provided by him at the time of his arrest in relation to indicating where, in accordance with his false story, the DVD's were to be transported. That, in the circumstances known to the authorities at the time, even though given for the purpose of supporting the false story, was of assistance, as it enabled the police to continue the anticipated delivery to Mr McGlone and obtain further relevant evidence to support what could otherwise be inferred from the significant level of physical and electronic surveillance that had already been carried out. Again, I will take that assistance into account as part of the instinctive synthesis.
	
	
	I have been provided with references to a number of cases by the Crown and by Mr Smith SC, as well as relevant statistics. In particular, Mr Smith has relied on the matter of De La Rosa (2010) NSWCCA 194 and the attachment to that judgment of the schedule as provided by McClellan CJ at CL. I note in respect of that case that McClellan J, subsequent to that decision, pointed out that De La Rosa was not a guideline judgment but simply a collection of cases placed in various categories as his Honour saw fit. I have referred to the schedule and the cases contained in it on a general basis. I have also referred to the other cases to which I have been referred by the Crown and by the parties, as well as the statistics themselves.
	
	
	In relation to the statistics available through JIRS, I have also taken the opportunity, as is now available, to drill down through the individual entries in order to find individual cases, particularly where the statistics are linked to the report of the case, as the statistics on their own, in the absence of such information as to quantity, in particular, and other matters such as assistance, are a very blunt tool, as has frequently been observed by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. At the end of the day, the Court must take into account the matters that are listed in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 together with common law principles and must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances as required by s 16A(1) of the Act.
	
	
	Of course, of significance is the seriousness with which such offences are regarded, as is indicated by the maximum sentences provided by the legislature. In particular, the conspiracy offence to import methamphetamine has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and in respect of the offence of importing a border controlled precursor, pseudoephedrine, the maximum sentence is at the second highest level of seriousness provided in respect of any Commonwealth offence, that is, 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The Court must also take into account there are a number of offences. Although the importation and conspiracy to import offences occurred as an actual event within a narrow timeframe, they are separate offences and each is significant. The Court must take into account the need to reflect, in any sentence imposed, the seriousness of the different offences, and the fact that they are separate offences. The methamphetamine and precursor offences are both legally and factually discrete, and have a different gravamen. The proceeds of crime offences are also different offences to the importation offences.
	
	
	Accordingly, there is a need for accumulation in respect of each of the offences for each of the offenders. However, in determining the actual sentence, the Court must have regard to the principle of totality as referred to in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610.
	
	
	Despite the lack of contrition or remorse, I am of the view that considering each of the offender’s relative good character and the lack of other offending by Mr McGlone, and at least for a period of approximately 14 years for Mr McKell, that there is a reasonable prospect that neither of them would reoffend in the future.
	
	
	There can be no issue in respect of this matter, the significant seriousness of the offences and the roles of the offenders, that there can be any alternative in each case to a term of full time imprisonment, and no such submission has been made on behalf of either of the offenders by their counsel in recognition of the common sense inevitability of a prison term.
	
	
	Mr McKell, would you please stand?
	
	
	I have taken into account all of the matters that I have referred to, and if I did not say it at the conclusion of the trial, you are convicted in relation to each of the three counts relating to you contained on the indictment. I refused bail on 21 July 2016 and you have been in custody since that time, solely in relation to these matters. You were arrested on 20 May 2013 and released on 21 May 2013. Accordingly, the sentence will be backdated by two days from 21 July 2016.
	
	
	I will deal first with the sentence in respect of the proceeds of crime matter, contrary to s 400.4(1). The sentence is a term of imprisonment for two years and six months. Having been backdated from the date of your refusal of bail, that sentence commences on 19 July 2016 and will expire on 18 January 2019.
	
	
	In respect of the offence being the conspiracy to import methamphetamine, contrary to s 307.1(1) and pursuant to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years. That will commence six months after the commencement of the last imposed sentence. That is, it commences on 19 January 2017 and will expire on 18 January 2027.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of importing the border controlled precursor pseudoephedrine, contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code, the sentence is one of 16 years. It will commence two years subsequent to the commencement of the last imposed sentence. That is, it will commence on 19 January 2019. That means that the total length of the sentences imposed is a term of 18 years and 6 months commencing on 19 July 2016. The total term will expire on 18 January 2035.
	
	
	In dealing with the offence of importing the border controlled precursor, I have also taken into account the offence contained on the s 16BA certificate, noting of course that the maximum penalty that could be provided in respect of that offence, relating to Consignment 1, had only a pecuniary penalty available.
	
	
	I am required to set a non-parole period in relation to that total sentence, and the non-parole period will be 11 years and 9 months, with a balance of six years and nine months. The non-parole period will expire on 18 April 2028 and I order that you be released on parole on 18 April 2028. Thank you, you can sit down.
	
	
	Mr McGlone, would you please stand?
	
	
	You are, if I did not say it at the conclusion of the trial, convicted in respect of each of the three offences. Again, I have taken into account all of the matters that I have previously referred to. You were in custody from 20 May 2013, being the date of your arrest, until being released on bail on 8 November 2013. That is a period of 173 days. At the conclusion of the trial, I revoked your bail on 21 July 2016. I deal firstly with the offence contrary to s 400.6(1) being the proceeds of crime matter. The term of the sentence is five years imprisonment, taking into account the period of time you have been in custody and backdating to accommodating the earlier period of custody. That sentence commenced on 30 January 2016 and will expire on 29 January 2021.
	
	
	In respect of the offence relating to the conspiracy to import methamphetamine, contrary to s 307.1(1) and 11.5(1), the sentence is one of ten years imprisonment. It will commence one year after the commencement of the last imposed sentence. That is, it will commence on 30 January 2017 and expire on 29 January 2027. In respect of the offence involving the importation of pseudoephedrine, contrary to s 307.11(1) of the Criminal Code, the term of the sentence is 16 years.
	
	
	It will commence two years after the commencement of the last imposed sentence. That is, it commences on 30 January 2019 and will expire on 29 January 2035. That with accumulation means a total sentence of 19 years commencing on 30 January 2016 and expiring on 29 January 2035. I am required to provide a non-parole period in respect of that period, and the non‑parole period will be 12 years. The non-parole period will expire on 29 January 2028, so I order that you be released on parole on the expiry of the non-parole period. Thank you, you can sit down.

4574904,Hallman v Commissioner for Fair Trading and Commissioner of Police [2017] NSWCATAD 136,"reasons for decision


	
	On 27 October 2016 the Commissioner for Fair Trading (Fair Trading) refused an application by Brett Adam Hallman for a tattooist licence under the Tattoo Parlours Act 2012 (the Act). The reason for the refusal was because the Commissioner of Police (the Commissioner) had made an adverse security determination under s 19(2) of the Act. The Commissioner had determined that Mr Hallman is not a fit and proper person to be granted the licence due to his criminal history and it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted because of that history.
	
	
	On 1 December 2016 Mr Hallman sought review of that decision by the Tribunal.
	
	
	Prior to the introduction of the current legislation, Mr Hallman did not need a licence to be a tattooist. When the licensing regime came into being, Mr Hallman was required to apply for a licence if he wished to continue his profession. He made an application on 20 September 2013 and, under the transitional provisions in the new legislation, was permitted to continue to work as a tattooist while his application was being considered.
	
	
	Mr Hallman is also known as Brett Hilton. He explained that he was born Brett Hallman but his mother changed his name to Hilton when he was 3 or 4 years old. He changed his name back to Hallman when he was an adult.
	


Nature of review


	
	A person whose application for a licence under the Act has been refused may apply to this Tribunal for an administrative review of that decision (s 27(1)).
	
	
	In circumstances where, in accordance with s 14 of the Act, Fair Trading has referred a licence application to the Commissioner for an investigation and determination as to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted, and the Commissioner has made an adverse security determination, Fair Trading must refuse to grant the licence.
	
	
	On review, however, the Tribunal is not bound by the security determination and must make a fresh determination, on the basis of the information before it, whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted (Austin v Commissioner for Fair Trading & Commissioner of Police [2016] NSWCATAP 179 at [37]).
	
	
	The issues in this case are therefore whether Mr Hallman is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted. The major factor in determining these issues is Mr Hallman’s past criminal history. There are also issues concerning Mr Hallman’s more recent behaviour in the context of the provisions of the Act.
	


The respondents’ evidence


	
	The Applicant has been provided with the adverse security determination in a redacted form. An unredacted copy of that document has been provided to the Tribunal on a confidential basis and the Commissioner provided information to the Tribunal in the absence of the Applicant. The Applicant is aware that a confidential session took place but he is not aware of the information that was presented.
	
	
	The open evidence provided by the respondent was to the effect that Mr Hallman has a substantial criminal record in New South Wales. Mr Hallman was convicted of nine offences between 1990 and 1997, 12 offences between 2000 and 2003 and five offences between 2007 and 2013. The convictions were primarily in relation to possession of a prohibited drug, stealing, shoplifting, and goods in custody. In 2007 he was convicted of using offensive language and having custody of a knife in a public place. In 2011 he was convicted of driving never licensed and negligent driving. There is also a break and enter with intent to steal offence in 2000 and a conviction in 2003 for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	He has also come to the attention of police on a number of other occasions but no charges have resulted.
	
	
	[Not for publication]
	
	
	At the time he made his application for the licence Mr Hallman had been working as a tattooist at 13Crowns Custom Tattoos in Huskisson since July 2011. Mr Grant Stephens was the operator of that parlour at the relevant time.
	
	
	[Not for publication]
	
	
	[Not for publication]
	
	
	Mr Stevens’ application for an operator licence was refused and he appeared before this Tribunal in May 2016 accompanied by Mr Hallman. His application for a stay of the decision was refused. Mr Stevens was not the holder of an operator licence during the period beginning on 17 August 2016 and ending on 15 March 2017. During that period, the premises in Huskisson occupied by 13Crowns Custom Tattoos were not licensed premises under the Act.
	
	
	Screenshots of posts from the Facebook page of Brett Hilton were provided by the respondent. On 8 September 2016 a post by Brett Hilton states: “Hey guys I am taking bookings again so if you want anything done just msg me cheers”. In response to a question posted the same day Brett Hilton responded: “We are open until we have had enough and wanna go home! lol”.
	
	
	The Facebook page of Brett Hilton was accessed by an officer of the second respondent on 7 March 2017. The “Intro” section on the page states that he is a “tattooer at 13crown custom tattoos”. The Brett Hilton Facebook page gives his date of birth in 1973 which is the same date of birth as Mr Hallman.
	
	
	The officer also accessed the Facebook page of 13Crowns Custom Tattoos on 7 March 2017. A post on 21 August 2016 shows photographs of a bulldog tattoo on an upper arm and states: “We almost finished this bulldog portrait on …today! Cheers to all you guys this arvo can’t wait to finish it!” A post from Jervis on 9 October 2016 states: “Brett is awesome at what he does, previously went to a reputable place in Sydney and probably won’t go back to them. The service from the team was great.”
	
	
	There was a “review” post on 17 January 2017 which stated in part: “he wanted to get a tat to match mine wasn’t big but Brett turned it down”. There was another post on 1 February 2017 from Bill which included the words: “Hi Brett. You have done a couple of tatts for me last year … It is time formy [sic] next”. A reply by 13Crowns Custom Tattoos on 5 February 2017 states: “Hi bill, has brett been in touch with you regarding what you want done?” to which Bill replied, “Not yet. Realise he most prob flat out…”. The reply from 13 Crowns Custom Tattoos was: “He has phone problems and I don’t think he has facebook on his crap phone, I will show him this tomorrow”.
	
	
	The respondent states the posts on Facebook demonstrate that, contrary to the Act, Mr Hallman continued to tattoo after he was refused a licence and carried out tattooing at premises he knew to be unlicensed.
	


Mr Hallman’s evidence


	
	Mr Hallman is 44 years of age. He acknowledges his past criminal history and states his behaviour was due his heroin addiction and homelessness at the time. He states he has not used heroin for 17 years. In 2000 while in prison he was bashed and severely injured. He has frontal lobe damage which affects him to this day and which can lead to poor decision making and minor trouble.
	
	
	Mr Hallman said he has been in a stable relationship with his partner for 16 years and moved to the NSW south coast in 2011. He said he started tattooing in 1998 and has worked professionally for a number of different shops since 2004 but he was hoping the licence would allow him to work independently. He states he is unable to find alternative work and has nothing else to fall back on. Mr Hallman said that he loves fishing and living a quiet life with his partner and two dogs. He no longer drinks and no longer uses drugs.
	
	
	Mr Hallman disputed elements of the Police Facts Sheets in relation to some of his past convictions. He denied that in relation to the 2007 offence of using offensive language he stated to police: “Fuck you cunts, I don’t live by no rules, I just do what I want, I fucking drink when I want, I fucking work when I want”. He denied that he had chased some girls through carriages on a train. He also denied having custody of a knife in a public place stating that they were nail clippers. He also stated that he acted in self defence in relation to his 2003 conviction for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm when he broke the jaw of a 17 year old boy.
	
	
	Mr Hallman did acknowledge when questioned that he has a tendency to react when placed under pressure. He said that this was a result of his brain injury and if he feels threatened, he will act in self defence.
	
	
	Mr Hallman did not deny that in May 2016 he had attended the Tribunal with Mr Stevens who was seeking to overturn the refusal of his operator licence. He said he has known Mr Stevens for some 17 years and sees him every now and again. He said that he went to Thailand with Mr Stevens around 2011 but he didn’t like the place and came back to Australia after about four days. He said he was not employed by Mr Stevens but worked on a percentage basis – 40% of the fee for a tattoo went to the shop and he kept 60%.
	
	
	Mr Hallman said that he has not done tattoos for money since being refused a licence. He said he has done some tattoos on friends for free to keep up his skill level. He said that he has also done some advertising to keep in touch with his clients. He denied having done tattooing from his home.
	
	
	Mr Hallman said that he had done the bulldog tattoo referred to in paragraph 19 above and had written the message on the 13Crowns Custom Tattoos Facebook page. He said he was not aware that he could not perform tattooing in unlicensed premises irrespective of whether he was paid for the work.
	
	
	Mr Hallman provided two character references in support of his application – one from his mother and the other from his partner’s father. Both are aware of his criminal past and state that he has changed since the offences were committed.
	


Consideration

Fit and proper


	
	The expression ‘fit and proper’ is not defined in the Act but is a common statutory term and has been considered by this Tribunal and in other jurisdictions in numerous cases.
	
	
	In Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No.2) (1955) 93 CLR 127 at 156-7 the High Court said:
	


The expression 'fit and proper' is of course familiar enough as traditional words when used with reference to offices and perhaps vocation. But their very purpose is to give the widest scope for judgment and indeed for rejection. 'Fit' (or 'idoneus') with respect to an office is said to involve three things, honesty, knowledge and ability ... When the question was whether a man was a fit and proper person to hold a licence for the sale of liquor it was considered that it ought not to be confined to an inquiry into his character and that it would be unwise to attempt any definition of the matters which may legitimately be inquired into; each case must depend upon its own circumstances.


	
	These sentiments have been echoed in cases before the Tribunal and it is generally accepted that what is fit and proper needs to be determined by reference to the activities in issue and is to be gauged in light of the nature and purpose of the activities that the person will undertake (AJO v Director-General of Transport [2012] NSWADT 101 at [26]; Austin v Commissioner for Fair Trading & Commissioner of Police [2016] NSWCATAP 179 at [82]).
	
	
	In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 380 Toohey and Gaudron JJ said:
	


The expression ""fit and proper person"", standing alone, carries no precise meaning. It takes its meaning from its context, from the activities in which the person is or will be engaged and the ends to be served by those activities. The concept of ""fit and proper"" cannot be entirely divorced from the conduct of the person who is or will be engaging in those activities. However, depending on the nature of the activities, the question may be whether improper conduct has occurred, whether it is likely to occur, whether it can be assumed that it will not occur, or whether the general community will have confidence that it will not occur. The list is not exhaustive but it does indicate that, in certain contexts, character (because it provides indication of likely future conduct) or reputation (because it provides indication of public perception as to likely future conduct) may be sufficient to ground a finding that a person is not fit and proper to undertake the activities in question.


	
	They went on to say at 388:
	


The question whether a person is fit and proper is one of value judgment. In that process the seriousness or otherwise of particular conduct is a matter for evaluation by the decision maker. So too is the weight, if any, to be given to matters favouring the person whose fitness and propriety are under consideration.


	
	In Sobey v Commercial and Private Agents Board (1979) 22 SASR 70 Walters J said:
	


In my opinion what is meant by that expression is that the Applicant must show not only that he is possessed of a requisite knowledge of the duties and responsibilities devolving upon him as the holder of a particular licence ... but also that he is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him to be safely accredited to the public ... as a person to be entrusted with the sort of work which the licence entails.


	
	In Smith v Commissioner of Police & Commissioner for Fair Trading [2014] NSWCATAD 184 at [19-20] in the context of the Tattoo Parlours Act, Senior Member Montgomery stated:
	


[19]…There is no ""Principles and Objects"" section within the Act. The Tribunal can look at Hansard and the Minister's speech to ascertain the purpose of the Act - the mischief that the statute was designed to cure. In his second reading speech on the introduction of the Bill to Parliament, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services Mr Gallacher noted that the Act was introduced in response to gang crime in NSW. It aims to break the stranglehold that outlaw motorcycle gangs have over the tattoo industry. It was anticipated that removing bikies from the tattoo industry will reduce the reasons for rival gangs to fight turf wars, because these businesses will no longer be symbols of a gang's territory…

[20] While the second reading speech focused on the involvement of outlaw motorcycle gangs in the tattoo industry, it is clear from the Act that the broader intention is to rid the industry of any criminal or otherwise undesirable element and the avoidance of improper conduct.

Public interest


	
	In general, the concept of the public interest is designed to give the broader interests of the community priority over private interests of individuals. In Smith v Commissioner of Police & Commissioner for Fair Trading [2014] NSWCATAD 184 Senior Member Montgomery set out a number of authorities in which the concept of the public interest has been considered (at [42-47]). In Roberts v Commissioner for Fair Trading [2016] NSWCATAD 218 Senior Member Montgomery said that the authorities referred to in Smith indicated that:
	



	
	The ‘public interest’ is a term embracing matters, among others, of standards of human conduct and of the functioning government and government instrumentalities. The interest is therefore the interest of the public as distinct from the interest of an individual or individuals.
	
	
	The ‘public interest’ is an inherently broad concept giving the appellant the ability to have regard to a wide range of factors in choosing whether to exercise a discretion adversely to an individual.
	
	
	An applicant’s personal interests in retaining his licence cannot outweigh the public interest in having full confidence in the professionalism of people involved in the security industry.
	
	
	The “public interest” allows for issues going beyond the character of the applicant to be taken into account. These may include concerns in relation to public protection, public safety and public confidence in the administration of the licensing system.
	



	
	He went onto say:
	


Public confidence in the scheme and regulatory requirements under the Act is a public interest consideration. In the Second Reading Speech, Mr Roberts stated that the public interest test under the Act “is designed to address the criminal matters currently surrounding the industry, such as ... personal violence"". The scheme has as one its objectives the exclusion of persons with criminal tendencies from the tattooing industry, with a view to protecting public safety.


	
	The Tribunal’s task is to place itself in the position of a member of the public knowing Mr Hallman’s record and consider whether that person would object to Mr Hallman possessing a tattooist licence (Naziry v Director-General, Ministry of Transport [2004] NSWADT 40 at [55]).
	
	
	The respondent’s case that Mr Hallman is not a fit and proper person rests on his past criminal history and possible breaches of the Act in recent times.
	
	
	Mr Hallman was last convicted of an offence in 2013. Many of the convictions sought to be relied upon by the respondent occurred many years ago, a fact acknowledged by the respondent at the hearing. Mr Hallman’s evidence is that his criminal past was associated with drugs and homelessness. He states he gave up using heroin in 2000 whilst in jail, but it is apparent that he had several convictions after that involving alcohol and drugs.
	
	
	A number of the offences involving Mr Hallman demonstrated aggression to varying degrees. I do not accept his denials and statements that the police account is wrong in relation to a number of events as outlined above. He himself acknowledged that he can be quick to react and stated that this is a result of the damage caused to his frontal lobe when he was bashed in prison.
	
	
	A number of the offences also demonstrate a lack of respect for authority and the law such as driving unlicensed, particularly where Mr Hallman has never held a licence. His taunts to police while intoxicated demonstrate an attitude of disrespect for rules and accepted norms.
	
	
	His referees say that he is a reformed character and, if his past offences were all that was before the Tribunal, I may have been inclined to agree. However, other material indicates that his attitude to the law has not in fact changed.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Hallman is that he was tattooing at 13Crowns Custom Tattoos on 21 August 2016. The post of 8 September by Brett Hilton – who I accept is in fact Brett Hallman – that he is taking bookings again and his subsequent reply to a query about opening hours that “We are open until we have had enough and wanna go home!”, indicates that he was working from the premises with others. The post of 9 October 2016 on the 13Crowns Custom Tattoos Facebook page by Jervis would indicate that, around that date, Mr Hallman was performing work at 13Crowns Custom Tattoos. Mr Hallman has not stated that he worked anywhere other than 13Crowns Custom Tattoos during this time and I am satisfied that he was working at the premises of 13Crowns Custom Tattoos in Huskisson.
	
	
	At this time the premises of 13Crowns Custom Tattoos in Huskisson was unlicensed. This was a fact which was known or ought to have been known by Mr Hallman. He, after all, had accompanied Mr Stevens to a hearing before the Tribunal in May 2016 when Mr Stevens was seeking review of the decision to refuse him an operator licence. At the hearing before me, Mr Hallman sought to downplay his association with Mr Stevens but it was apparent he had known him for many years, had worked at 13Crowns Custom Tattoos since 2011 and had even travelled to Thailand with Mr Stevens. This further strengthens my view that Mr Hallman was aware the premises were unlicensed or, at the very least, was wilfully blind to that fact.
	
	
	[Not for publication]
	
	
	The posts on the 13Crowns Custom Tattoos Facebook page from January and February 2017 demonstrate that Mr Hallman was still associated with 13Crowns Custom Tattoos after his application for a tattooist licence had been refused on 27 October 2016. While there is no direct evidence that he continued to tattoo at the unlicensed premises after that time, there is circumstantial evidence that he did so. The statements on the 13Crowns Custom Tattoos Facebook page on 5 February 2017 in relation to the inquiry from Bill certainly suggest that Mr Hallman was working and available for work. When combined with the statements by Mr Hallman that tattooing is the only work he can do and he did not look for other work after his licence was refused, there is a very clear indication he was undertaking tattooing work at this time.
	
	
	Mr Hallman states that he was not paid for any tattooing work after his application for the licence was refused. However, his own statements that this was the only work he could do when combined with the various Facebook posts referred to above, cast considerable doubt on that statement. Mr Hallman said that he had carried out some tattoo work on friends for free but the Facebook posts would indicate that he was being permitted to perform work for reward on clients who made contact through the 13Crowns Custom Tattoos Facebook page and, presumably, through other more traditional means. In addition, Mr Hallman became evasive during the hearing when questioned in detail about his role at the tattoo parlour. On balance, I am satisfied that, contrary to the provisions of the Act, Mr Hallman performed tattooing work for reward after he was refused a licence.
	
	
	While Mr Hallman may no longer be engaged in the same sort of criminal activity as was the case up to 2013, he has, in relation to his role as a tattooist, demonstrated a continuing attitude of disregard and disrespect for the law as was apparent throughout his earlier life. He has shown that he is willing to breach the provisions of the Act if it suits his personal interests. I cannot be satisfied that he would adhere to all the requirements of the licensing scheme.
	
	
	After considering all the evidence, I am of the view that Mr Hallman is not a fit and proper person to hold a tattooist licence. In such circumstances, where the public must have faith in the integrity of the licensing scheme, neither would it be in the public interest for Mr Hallman to be granted a licence.

4574905,Owen v Commissioner for Fair Trading [2017] NSWCATAD 137,"reasons for decision


	
	On 19 October 2016 the Commissioner for Fair Trading (Fair Trading) refused an application by Michael James Owen for a tattooist licence under the Tattoo Parlours Act 2012 (the Act). The reason for the refusal was because the Commissioner of Police (the Commissioner) had made an adverse security determination under s 19(2) of the Act. The Commissioner had determined that Mr Owen is not a fit and proper person to be granted the licence due to his criminal history and it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted because of that history.
	
	
	On 4 November 2016 Mr Owen sought review of that decision by the Tribunal.
	


Nature of review


	
	A person whose application for a licence under the Act has been refused may apply to this Tribunal for an administrative review of that decision (s 27(1)).
	
	
	In circumstances where, in accordance with s 14 of the Act, Fair Trading has referred a licence application to the Commissioner for an investigation and determination as to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted, and the Commissioner has made an adverse security determination, Fair Trading must refuse to grant the licence.
	
	
	On review, however, the Tribunal is not bound by the security determination and must make a fresh determination, on the basis of the information before it, whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted (Austin v Commissioner for Fair Trading & Commissioner of Police [2016] NSWCATAP 179 at [37]).
	
	
	The issues in this case are therefore whether Mr Owen is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted. The major factor in determining these issues is Mr Owen’s past criminal history.
	


The respondents’ evidence


	
	The Applicant has been provided with the adverse security determination in a redacted form. An unredacted copy of that document has been provided to the Tribunal on a confidential basis and the Commissioner provided information to the Tribunal in the absence of the Applicant. The Applicant is aware that a confidential session took place but he is not aware of the information that was presented.
	
	
	The confidential evidence is not extensive and, given the candid admissions made by Mr Owen during the hearing, it is not necessary to refer explicitly to that evidence in these reasons.
	
	
	The open evidence provided by the respondent was to the effect that Mr Owen has a substantial criminal record in New South Wales and one conviction in Queensland. In brief, the convictions are:
	



	
	13 June 2001: assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which Mr Owen received a 200 hour community service order. According to the Police Facts Sheet, on 8 December 2000 Mr Owen was a passenger in a car. He got out of the car and punched the victim once in the head. The victim’s head hit a steel pole and he fell to the ground unconscious. Mr Owen got back into the vehicle which drove off. The community service order was revoked in 2002 and Mr Owen received a four month suspended prison sentence.
	
	
	12 February 2003: convictions for negligent driving (not occasioning death or grievous bodily harm) (fined $250) and drive with high range PCA (fined $750 and disqualified from driving for 12 months). The incident out of which the convictions arose occurred in December 2002.
	
	
	6 June 2005: convictions for resisting an officer in the execution of duty (fined $400) and for assaulting an officer in the execution of duty (fined $750). The convictions arose out of an incident in April 2005 where police attended a fight between about 25 people who were attending a birthday party. According to the Police Facts Sheet, Mr Owen was verbally abusive towards police, refused to move away, threw his arms about and pushed a police officer in the chest.
	
	
	6 June 2005: a conviction for causing fear to three people (fined $500). This conviction arose out of the same factual circumstances in (b) above. The applicant was a driver of a vehicle with three passengers. The police activated warning lights to indicate to the driver to pull over. Mr Owen lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a small tree causing moderate damage to the vehicle. Two of the passengers got out of the vehicle and argued with Mr Owen. A third was found slumped in the back seat and was not breathing. Police were able to resuscitate him before the ambulance arrived.
	
	
	15 January 2014: two convictions for possession of a prohibited drug (fined $300 for each conviction). The applicant was a passenger in a vehicle stopped by police. The police smelled a strong odour of cannabis in the vehicle. They searched Mr Owen and found one tab of MDMA. Police also found a glass jar of cannabis belonging to Mr Owen in a backpack in the vehicle.
	
	
	10 March 2016: a conviction for behaving in an offensive manner in a public place (fined $200). On 9 February 2016 Mr Owen had been refused service at a hotel because he was intoxicated. He did not leave the area when requested by security to do so and took a beer from another patron and began to drink it. He walked away but returned and then began to dance around the security guard in a boxer’s stance asking the guard: You want to swing. You want to box?
	



	
	Mr Owen also appeared in Warwick Magistrates Court in Queensland on 12 November 2014 charged with possession of a dangerous drug and contravene a direction. He was fined $400 and no conviction was recorded in relation to all charges. He has also come to the attention of police in NSW on a number of other occasions, predominantly in relation to suspected illicit drug use, but no charges have resulted.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Owen has been issued with 27 transport infringements since 2001, primarily for not having a valid train ticket. The most recent infringements for this reason occurred in January, February and July 2016.
	


Mr Owen’s evidence


	
	Mr Owen agreed with the evidence presented by the respondent with respect to his criminal history with one or two exceptions. In relation to item (c) above at paragraph 9, he denied he hit a police officer. He said he pled guilty because his lawyer told him that it would be difficult to prove he didn’t hit the officer and he might get a jail sentence. Mr Owen clarified that the injured man in the car referred to in (d) above was not injured in the accident but had been bashed at a party and Mr Owen was getting him away. He acknowledged he was drunk at the time.
	
	
	Mr Owen said he developed a drug dependency in his late teens. He said his behaviour was largely self destructive and involved the use of drugs and alcohol. This reached its height when he was in his early 20s and using marijuana daily. He said that by the time he was 26 or 27, he was not using marijuana daily but would smoke joints socially. He was, however, drinking heavily and his alcohol consumption reached its heights in about 2012 when he drank large amounts of spirits daily.
	
	
	Mr Owen said that in 2013 he began his current relationship with a woman who does not drink or consume drugs. His alcohol consumption reduced at this time but he would binge drink at social events. He states he has been drug free since New Year’s Eve 2014 and has consumed alcohol on two occasions since then.
	
	
	In relation to those two occasions, Mr Owen said that the first time in February 2016 was on his birthday. He said he had been sober for 14 months and thought it would be alright to have a couple of drinks. Instead, he drank to excess and got into trouble with police (item (f) above). He said he was disappointed with himself and regretted his behaviour. He said he also had a beer with a friend for his friend’s birthday in September 2016. He did not drink to excess and was the designated driver.
	
	
	In relation to his recent infringement notices for travelling or attempting to travel without a ticket, Mr Owen said that one related to the charges against him in February 2016. He said he was released from Surry Hills Police Station and had no money to get home and he tried to take the train. On the more recent occasion in July 2016, his Opal card ran out of credit.
	
	
	Ironically, Mr Owen was a youth worker and then a drug and alcohol support worker at a youth rehabilitation centre from 2005 to 2014. He lost his job because of the drug possession charges in 2014. He was also a member of a music band for about 10 years but left the band in 2014.
	
	
	He returned to painting and visual art, an activity he had engaged in since he was a child, and in 2015 was accepted into the National Art School. At the time he was receiving counselling for severe anxiety and depression following a nervous breakdown and was on medication. He received high distinctions in his course but was unable to continue as he could not afford it. Mr Owen said he had a lot of accumulated debts and declared bankruptcy in mid 2016.
	
	
	Mr Owen said he became interested in tattoo art and spent a year as an unpaid apprentice at a private tattoo studio, Bright Lights Tattoo Studio, in Balmain. The studio has offered him employment if he obtains a licence. Mr Owen states that he is now 35, is in a stable relationship and is a father. He lives with his elderly mother and looks after his 7 year old daughter from a previous relationship every fortnight. He said he spends most of his time with his family and his partner of three years.
	
	
	Mr Owen states he is ashamed of his past behaviour. He states he is determined to remain drug and alcohol free and keeps away from places where he could drink. He admitted that if he were to relapse and drink or take drugs to excess, he would most likely engage in criminal activity.
	
	
	Mr Owen is still on medication for anxiety and depression and sees his doctor every month. He also sees a psychologist regularly and practices mindfulness and breathing exercises. He has a mental health plan and is able to see the psychologist six times a year on Medicare. He said he also has access to services at Campbelltown Mental Health Community Service. Mr Owen said he also sees a personal trainer and a nutritionist to help him stay focussed on a healthy lifestyle.
	
	
	Mr Owen has provided a copy of his mental health plan and a letter dated 29 January 2017 from his psychologist who states that Mr Owen is drug free and is dedicated to changing his life. He also states that he now attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings twice a week and that he is committed to sobriety.
	
	
	Mr Owen has proposed that he would abide by any conditions placed on his licence and proposes several possible conditions, including continuing to see his doctor and psychologist, attending AA meetings and undergoing regular urine tests. Mr Owen has also provided letters from the Australian Tattooists Guild in which the Vice President of the Guild states that members of the Guild committee would put in place a support program for Mr Owen for a period of two years.
	
	
	Mr Owen also provided a considerable number of character references in support of his application. The majority are aware of his past criminal convictions and state they have witnessed a change in his behaviour and believe he will not reoffend. All speak highly of him.
	


Consideration

Fit and proper


	
	The expression ‘fit and proper’ is a common statutory term and has been considered by this Tribunal and in other jurisdictions in numerous cases.
	
	
	In Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No.2) (1955) 93 CLR 127 at 156-7 the High Court said:
	


The expression 'fit and proper' is of course familiar enough as traditional words when used with reference to offices and perhaps vocation. But their very purpose is to give the widest scope for judgment and indeed for rejection. 'Fit' (or 'idoneus') with respect to an office is said to involve three things, honesty, knowledge and ability ... When the question was whether a man was a fit and proper person to hold a licence for the sale of liquor it was considered that it ought not to be confined to an inquiry into his character and that it would be unwise to attempt any definition of the matters which may legitimately be inquired into; each case must depend upon its own circumstances.


	
	These sentiments have been echoed in cases before the Tribunal and it is generally accepted that what is fit and proper needs to be determined by reference to the activities in issue and is to be gauged in light of the nature and purpose of the activities that the person will undertake (AJO v Director-General of Transport [2012] NSWADT 101 at [26]; Austin v Commissioner for Fair Trading & Commissioner of Police [2016] NSWCATAP 179 at [82]).
	
	
	In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 380 Toohey and Gaudron JJ said:
	


The expression ""fit and proper person"", standing alone, carries no precise meaning. It takes its meaning from its context, from the activities in which the person is or will be engaged and the ends to be served by those activities. The concept of ""fit and proper"" cannot be entirely divorced from the conduct of the person who is or will be engaging in those activities. However, depending on the nature of the activities, the question may be whether improper conduct has occurred, whether it is likely to occur, whether it can be assumed that it will not occur, or whether the general community will have confidence that it will not occur. The list is not exhaustive but it does indicate that, in certain contexts, character (because it provides indication of likely future conduct) or reputation (because it provides indication of public perception as to likely future conduct) may be sufficient to ground a finding that a person is not fit and proper to undertake the activities in question.


	
	They went on to say at 388:
	


The question whether a person is fit and proper is one of value judgment. In that process the seriousness or otherwise of particular conduct is a matter for evaluation by the decision maker. So too is the weight, if any, to be given to matters favouring the person whose fitness and propriety are under consideration.


	
	In Sobey v Commercial and Private Agents Board (1979) 22 SASR 70 Walters J said:
	


In my opinion what is meant by that expression is that the Applicant must show not only that he is possessed of a requisite knowledge of the duties and responsibilities devolving upon him as the holder of a particular licence ... but also that he is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him to be safely accredited to the public ... as a person to be entrusted with the sort of work which the licence entails.


	
	In Smith v Commissioner of Police & Commissioner for Fair Trading [2014] NSWCATAD 184 at [19-20] in the context of the Tattoo Parlours Act, Senior Member Montgomery stated:
	


[19]…There is no ""Principles and Objects"" section within the Act. The Tribunal can look at Hansard and the Minister's speech to ascertain the purpose of the Act - the mischief that the statute was designed to cure. In his second reading speech on the introduction of the Bill to Parliament, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services Mr Gallacher noted that the Act was introduced in response to gang crime in NSW. It aims to break the stranglehold that outlaw motorcycle gangs have over the tattoo industry. It was anticipated that removing bikies from the tattoo industry will reduce the reasons for rival gangs to fight turf wars, because these businesses will no longer be symbols of a gang's territory…

[20] While the second reading speech focused on the involvement of outlaw motorcycle gangs in the tattoo industry, it is clear from the Act that the broader intention is to rid the industry of any criminal or otherwise undesirable element and the avoidance of improper conduct.


	
	In Allen v Commissioner for Fair Trading and Commissioner for Police [2015] NCWCATAD 273 at [49] the Tribunal stated that, in the context of the Act, “unfitness can be indicated by criminal associations, habitual recidivism, formal or informal links with OMCGs, failure to implement proper tattooing practices and general disregard for the law”.
	
	
	The respondent’s case that Mr Owen is not a fit and proper person rests on his criminal history.
	
	
	In Saadieh v Director-General, Department of Transport [1999] NSWADT 68 at [17], in the context of a taxi licence, the Tribunal identified factors relevant to fitness and propriety as including:
	



	
	the nature, seriousness and frequency of any criminal offences for which the applicant has been arrested or convicted;
	
	
	the applicant’s reputation in the community; and
	
	
	the likelihood that the applicant will reoffend, be the subject of further complaints or commit further offences.
	



	
	There is no doubt that Mr Owen’s criminal history is lengthy. He has a conviction for assault in 2001 and, while he denies that he actually assaulted a police officer in 2005, that conviction stands. By his own admission he used illicit drugs for a lengthy period and has several convictions related to that drug use. In addition, his evidence to the Tribunal was that he had associated with people who consumed drugs during a significant part of his life.
	
	
	Mr Owen gave very open and candid evidence to the Tribunal. His evidence is that between his late teens and mid-twenties he took drugs, particularly marijuana, regularly and, for periods, daily. He also consumed alcohol to excess. His criminal record reflects his addictions.
	
	
	Mr Owen states that he has not consumed drugs since New Years’ Eve 2014. There is nothing in the material before the Tribunal to suggest this statement is untrue, and I accept it. He also states he also stopped drinking on that day and maintained his sobriety for 14 months. Again, there is nothing to suggest that this is not true.
	
	
	Of concern are the incidents in 2016 – the conviction for behaving in an offensive manner in a public place and the three transport infringements in that year. The conviction was the result of a relapse on Mr Owen’s part where he consumed an excessive amount of alcohol on his birthday and ended up in trouble with police. With nothing more, these incidents, as the respondent states, indicate that insufficient time has passed for the Tribunal to be satisfied that Mr Owen is rehabilitated and is fit and proper to be granted a licence.
	
	
	The respondent is critical of the lack of independent expert evidence to substantiate Mr Owen’s claims of sobriety and future treatment. Mr Owen is not legally represented and has limited financial resources. He has provided a range of material, including letters from his treating psychologist, a mental health assessment and mental health plan review form. While this material is not comprehensive or in the form of expert opinion, it does demonstrate that Mr Owen is obtaining professional help.
	
	
	It is apparent from the evidence that Mr Owen is determined to make a new life for himself. He has distanced himself from his former life and states he no longer associates with people who sell drugs. I am satisfied that he is intent on maintaining his sobriety and, while it can never be said that there is no risk he will lapse, I consider that risk to be small. He has the support of his partner, mother, intended workplace and the Australian Tattooists Guild. Being able to pursue his chosen career will also give him the confidence to deal with personal issues.
	
	
	I note that the respondent has asked that I place little weight on the references submitted by Mr Owen. I agree that the references cannot be accorded great weight, but they do show that Mr Owen has a good deal of genuine support.
	
	
	After considering all the evidence, I am of the view that Mr Owen is a fit and proper person to hold a tattoo parlour operator licence. I do not intend to impose conditions on the licence.
	


Public interest


	
	In general, the concept of the public interest is designed to give the broader interests of the community priority over private interests of individuals. In Smith v Commissioner of Police & Commissioner for Fair Trading [2014] NSWCATAD 184 Senior Member Montgomery set out a number of authorities in which the concept of the public interest has been considered (at [42-47]). In Roberts v Commissioner for Fair Trading [2016] NSWCATAD 218 Senior Member Montgomery said that the authorities referred to in Smith indicated that:
	



	
	The ‘public interest’ is a term embracing matters, among others, of standards of human conduct and of the functioning government and government instrumentalities. The interest is therefore the interest of the public as distinct from the interest of an individual or individuals.
	
	
	The ‘public interest’ is an inherently broad concept giving the appellant the ability to have regard to a wide range of factors in choosing whether to exercise a discretion adversely to an individual.
	
	
	An applicant’s personal interests in retaining his licence cannot outweigh the public interest in having full confidence in the professionalism of people involved in the security industry.
	
	
	The “public interest” allows for issues going beyond the character of the applicant to be taken into account. These may include concerns in relation to public protection, public safety and public confidence in the administration of the licensing system.
	



	
	He went onto say:
	


Public confidence in the scheme and regulatory requirements under the Act is a public interest consideration. In the Second Reading Speech, Mr Roberts stated that the public interest test under the Act “is designed to address the criminal matters currently surrounding the industry, such as ... personal violence"". The scheme has as one its objectives the exclusion of persons with criminal tendencies from the tattooing industry, with a view to protecting public safety.


	
	The Tribunal’s task is to place itself in the position of a member of the public knowing Mr Owen’s record and consider whether that person would object to Mr Owen having a tattoo licence (Naziry v Director-General, Ministry of Transport [2004] NSWADT 40 at [55]).
	
	
	The respondent argues that, given Mr Owen’s history of criminal behaviour and substance abuse, the Tribunal should find that he has associated with criminal elements and there is the potential for criminal elements to gain influence over the tattoo business that Mr Owen is likely to be employed in if he is granted a licence. No evidence, however, has been provide by the respondent that Mr Owen has had any association with criminals other than others with whom he consumed drugs or that he purchased drugs. As noted above, Mr Owen has distanced himself from his former life and states he no longer associates with people who sell drugs. There is no suggestion that Mr Owen has, at any time, been involved in any enterprise associated with the sale of drugs. Nor has any evidence been provide that the Bright Lights Tattoo Studio has come to the attention of police.
	
	
	In my view, the respondent is drawing an extremely long bow between Mr Owen’s previous drug use and offending and the influence of criminal elements in the tattoo industry.
	
	
	In the circumstances I am not satisfied that there are public interest considerations that should prevent Mr Owens from obtaining the licence that he is seeking. The correct and preferable decision is to set aside the Commissioner’s determinations and in their place the decision should be made to grant the licence.
	


Orders

1.   The decision under review is set aside.

2.   The decision is made that the licence is granted.

4574913,Mol v R [2017] NSWCCA 76,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Mol was found guilty by a jury of six counts of indecent assault and five counts of sexual intercourse without consent in relation to three separate complainants, HS, KC and AY.

Mr Mol contacted the complainants via advertisements they had placed on the website known as “Gumtree”, which stated they were seeking casual work. He recruited them to work for him as artist’s models and invited them to his “professional art studio” where they were each subjected to unwanted sexual contact.

Mr Mol was sentenced to an aggregate non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment with a balance of term of 4 years imprisonment. Mr Mol filed an application for leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence.

The appeal raised the following issues:

(i)    whether the probative value of tendency evidence to have a particular state of mind (recklessness as to consent) was outweighed by its prejudicial effect, namely the risk the jury might use the evidence in the determination of issues not confined to recklessness as to consent despite directions to the contrary;

(ii)    whether a miscarriage of justice resulted from withdrawing a direction to the jury and providing a re-direction regarding the issue of consent;

(iii)    whether the jury were given adequate written directions in relation to a question they asked about the complainants’ state of mind regarding consent;

(iv)    whether the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the complainants transcended the duty of care to one of trust, and whether a breach of such trust could operate as an aggravating factor in the offences;

(v)   whether a finding that the applicant abused his professional position to commit the offences could warrant less weight being given for prior good character; and

(vi)    whether post-offence conduct of destroying a memory card could be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences.

In relation to issue (i), per Payne JA (Johnson J and Fullerton J agreeing)

(1)    tendency evidence about the applicant’s state of mind was highly probative in respect to the issue of recklessness as to the complainants’ consent: [60]

IMM v R (2016) 257 CLR 300; [2016] HCA 14 at [44], [46] and [51]; R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700; [2003] NSWCCA 319 at [91]-[97] applied.

(2)    the primary judge’s directions given to the jury with respect to how they might use the tendency evidence were sufficiently clear to eliminate or significantly ameliorate any risk of the prejudice identified: [61]

DAO v The Queen (2011) 81 NSWLR 568; [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [171]; R v Ngatikaura (2006) 161 A Crim R 329; [2006] NSWCCA 161 at [32]; BC v R [2015] NSWCCA 327 at [105]-[110] applied.

In relation to (ii), per Payne JA (Johnson J and Fullerton J agreeing)

(3)   the re-direction given by the primary judge was sufficient and no further re-direction was necessary: [80]

In relation to (iii), per Payne JA (Johnson J and Fullerton J agreeing)

(4)   the primary judge’s response to the note adequately addressed the subject matter of the note: [87]-[88]

In relation to (iv), per Fullerton J (Payne JA and Johnson J agreeing)

(5)   the relationship between the applicant, who had represented himself as a professional artist, and the complainants, who had agreed to pose nude or partially nude constituted a relationship of trust, which the applicant breached and this was a relevant aggravating factor: [108]

      Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 70 at [22] applied.

In relation to (v), per Fullerton J (Payne JA and Johnson J agreeing)

(6)   such a finding is consistent with established authority: [116]

KAB v R [2015] NSWCCA 55 at [48]; R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 at [21] applied.

In relation to (vi), per Fullerton J (Payne JA and Johnson J agreeing)

(7)   the post-offence conduct was relevant in the context where consent to sexual intercourse was at issue: [102]

Judgment


	
	PAYNE JA: On 4 August 2015, following a trial before a jury, Mr Pierre Mol, the applicant, was found guilty of 6 counts of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and 5 counts of having sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. He was found not guilty of a further 6 counts contained in the indictment of a similar nature (being 4 counts of having sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, 1 count of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act, and 1 count of committing an act of indecency with or towards a person 16 years or over, contrary to s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	The charges on the indictment related to sexual contact between the applicant and three complainants, whose names were anonymised pursuant to s 578A of the Crimes Act as HS, KC and AY. The applicant had pleaded not guilty to all charges.
	
	
	On 9 October 2015, the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment (to commence on 4 August 2015) with a balance of term of 4 years imprisonment. Accordingly, the applicant will be eligible to be considered for release on parole on 3 August 2025.
	
	
	On 1 September 2016, the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal against both his conviction and sentence. The Crown did not object to an extension of time being granted.
	


Relevant facts


	
	The Crown case was that the applicant committed the offences after employing the three women as artist’s models. The women were each recruited via advertisements they had placed on a website known as “Gumtree”, seeking casual work.
	


HS


	
	On 30 April 2013, HS placed an advertisement on Gumtree seeking babysitting work. She was 19 years old at the time. The applicant responded to her advertisement, offering her $45 per hour to work as an artist’s model. He attached a link to his webpage with examples of his artwork and provided his phone number. HS contacted the applicant and the two subsequently met in the city. The applicant showed HS photographs he had taken on his phone of some of his drawings and told her that he had a professional art studio.
	
	
	A few days later, likely on 4 May 2013, the applicant sent HS a text message containing his address. HS went to the applicant’s flat. The applicant took HS into a room which contained a bed, a light and a painting easel. The applicant asked HS to take off her top and bra. The applicant asked if she needed help and she said “no”. While HS was taking off her bra, the applicant approached her, squeezed and licked her breasts and said he liked “pointy breasts”.
	
	
	The applicant then instructed HS to take off her pants. HS said “no” and told him that she had changed her mind. When she went to pick up her top the applicant kicked her shirt away and told her to take her pants off. HS took off her pants as she was scared. The applicant told her to get on the bed. HS was crying. The applicant told her to take off her underwear, before taking off her underwear himself.
	
	
	The applicant then put his head between HS’s legs and inserted his tongue into her vagina for above five minutes. The applicant then drew HS. He told her to open her legs, but she did not do so. He then pulled apart her legs. HS was still crying. The applicant approached her again and inserted his fingers into her vagina. When he did this he said that he was trying to make her vagina a focus of his drawing such that he needed it to “swell”. HS alleged that the applicant also inserted his tongue into her vagina at this time, however the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in relation to this charge.
	
	
	HS was curled into a ball, with her legs to her chest. While standing facing her, the applicant took down his pants and began to masturbate himself. He then took HS’s hand, placed it on his penis and moved her hand up and down. HS made further allegations, including that the applicant forced her to fellate him, again licked and digitally penetrated her and then masturbated himself, however the jury also returned verdicts of not guilty to these charges.
	
	
	The applicant left the room and returned with a paper towel. He wiped HS’s eyes before taking a series of photographs of her. He then showed HS a drawing, gave her $120 and said he would like to work with her again. HS left the applicant’s flat, but then stopped a few streets away and cried.
	
	
	Sometime later HS told a friend what had happened. She was upset and distressed. HS did not go to the police at that time. She was ashamed because she had taken money from the applicant. At some point HS told her boyfriend what had happened.
	
	
	In August 2014, HS placed another advertisement on Gumtree, seeking babysitting work in the same terms as her first advertisement. She received a response from “Pierre” who asked if she would be interested in doing work as an artist’s model. HS realised that this was the applicant. On 22 August 2014 she reported what had happened to her to the police and made a statement on 16 October 2014.
	
	
	The defence case was that there was consensual sexual activity between the applicant and HS. The applicant agreed that he briefly performed cunnilingus on HS after he asked if he could “go down” on her and she said it was okay. He accepted he may have touched her breasts during their encounter. He denied the other alleged sexual acts and claimed she did not cry during the sexual activity.
	


KC and AY


	
	KC and AY were teenage Canadian tourists in Australia on a working holiday. KC placed an advertisement on Gumtree seeking casual work for her and AY. The applicant sent KC a message offering them both work as artist’s models for $45 per hour and sent a link to a webpage with examples of his artwork.
	
	
	On 12 May 2013, KC and AY met the applicant in the city, before he drove them to his flat. He took them into the bedroom and told them to take off their clothes. AY took off her top and bra, but refused to take off her pants. KC removed all her clothes except for her underpants.
	
	
	The applicant posed KC and AY on the bed and took a photograph of them. He then approached KC and tried to take her underwear off. KC said she could take off her own underwear and did so. The applicant then started touching and pulling each of KC and AY’s nipples saying he wanted them to be harder.
	
	
	The applicant then repositioned the women and told KC he wanted to open up her vagina. KC said she could do it herself, but the applicant persisted and pulled at the outside of her vagina. He took a photo of AY’s face and sketched them both. KC alleged that the applicant touched her vagina again; however the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to this charge. The women then took photos of his sketches and the applicant gave them money. He asked them to come to his studio again separately in the following days.
	
	
	On 14 May 2013, AY met the applicant in the city and travelled with him to his studio. Once inside the applicant began taking off his clothes. AY left the room and sent an electronic message to KC about what was happening. The applicant then took AY to the bedroom and removed her top and jeans. He pushed her to the side of the bed and grabbed her underwear. AY tried to keep hold of her underwear, but panicked and put her hands over her face. The applicant was then able to take off her underwear. He inserted his finger into her vagina and moved it in and out. AY had a tampon in her vagina and was crying and looking at the ceiling. The applicant then removed his finger, put his head between her legs and put his tongue in her vagina. The applicant put AY’s hand on his pants over his erect penis. AY moved her hand and the applicant took off his pants. He tried to get AY to masturbate him while his tongue remained in her vagina.
	
	
	The applicant left the room and returned with a baby wipe. He took out AY’s tampon, knelt between her legs and inserted his penis into her vagina. AY was crying and in pain. The applicant was thrusting his penis into her vagina, before stopping.
	
	
	The applicant sat on the stool and sketched AY, asking if she was mad at him, scared or angry and what she would say to KC. AY dressed and the applicant showed her the drawing. He gave her $100 and drove her back to the train station. AY was still crying. AY told KC what had happened and together they decided to go to the police and make a report.
	
	
	The defence case was that in the 12 May 2013 modelling session, the applicant touched KC and AY with their consent, or at least with the belief in their consent. The applicant admitted that he touched KC and AY’s breasts and that he touched KC’s vagina once.
	
	
	In respect to the 14 May 2013 modelling session, the defence case was that there was consensual sexual activity between the applicant and AY. He admitted that he inserted his finger in her vagina and he performed cunnilingus on her. He did not admit that he attempted to get AY to masturbate him. The applicant maintained that AY removed her tampon. He asserted that he inserted his penis into her vagina, but quickly withdrew it when she appeared uncomfortable. He maintained that she only cried after the sexual activity.
	


Police search


	
	The police phoned the applicant on 15 May 2013 to inform him that they would attend his home shortly.
	
	
	Police searched the applicant’s home and found sketches of HS, KC and AY. The applicant initially told the police that he had taken a memory card out of his camera and must have left it somewhere else. He then told the police that he had destroyed the card immediately before they arrived. Police found fragments of the memory card in parts in the garden and over the fence. The applicant told police he had panicked about the contents of the memory card.
	
	
	The defence case was that the applicant destroyed the memory card in a panic because he was aware that AY was upset after the sexual activity occurred.
	


The application for leave to appeal against conviction


	
	The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal against his conviction:
	


Ground 1: The judge erred in permitting the use of tendency evidence.

Ground 2: The judge erred in refusing to order separate trials for the counts relating to complainant HS and the counts relating to complainants KC and AY.

Ground 3: A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of withdrawing a direction to the jury regarding the issue of consent.

Ground 4: The judge erred in failing adequately to direct the jury in response to a question.

Leave to appeal


	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant required leave to appeal against his conviction as each of his grounds involve mixed questions of law and fact: s 5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	With regards to grounds 3 and 4, the Crown submitted that leave was also required under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules which provides:
	


No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.

Grounds 1 and 2 – tendency evidence and separate trials

Relevant law


	
	Section 97(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) provides:
	


(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.


	
	In Gardiner v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 233; [2006] NSWCCA 190 at [124], Simpson J said:
	


[124] Underlying s97 is an unstated but obvious premise. That is that proving that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind in some way bears upon the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. The fact in issue is the conduct, or state of mind, on a particular occasion relevant to the issues in the proceedings, of the person whose tendency is the subject of the evidence tendered. That is, evidence that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind is not tendered in a vacuum. It is tendered for the purpose of further proving (or contributing to proving) that, on a particular occasion, that person acted in that way or had that state of mind. Proof of the tendency is no more than a step on the way to proving (usually by inference) that the person acted in that way, or had that state of mind, on the relevant occasion.


	
	In Elomar v R (2014) 316 ALR 206; [2014] NSWCCA 303 at [359]-[360] the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (comprised of Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Simpson JA) held:
	


[359] …Tendency evidence is evidence that provides the foundation for an inference. The inference is that, because the person had the relevant tendency, it is more likely that he or she acted in the way asserted by the tendering party, or had the state of mind asserted by the tendering party on an occasion the subject of the proceedings. Tendency evidence is a stepping stone. It is indirect evidence. It allows for a form of syllogistic reasoning.

[360] …Tendency evidence is a means of proving, by a process of deduction, that a person acted in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind, on a relevant occasion, when there is no, or inadequate, direct evidence of that conduct or that state of mind on that occasion.


	
	The requirements of s 97(1) were recently considered by the High Court in IMM v R (2016) 257 CLR 300; [2016] HCA 14. The plurality (French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) at [44], [46] and [51] observed (footnotes omitted):
	


[44] The assessment of “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” requires that the possible use to which the evidence might be put, which is to say how it might be used, be taken at its highest. The definition must be read in the context of the provision to which it is applied. For the purposes of s 97(1)(b), the enquiry is whether the probative value of the evidence may be regarded as “significant”.

…

[46] Cross on Evidence suggests…a “significant” probative value is a probative value which is “important” or “of consequence”. The significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence under s 97(1)(b) must depend on the nature of the facts in issue to which the evidence is relevant and the significance or importance which that evidence may have in establishing those facts. So understood, the evidence must be influential in the context of fact-finding.

…

[51] At a practical level, it could not be intended that a trial judge undertake an assessment of the actual probative value of the evidence at the point of admissibility. As Simpson J pointed out in R v XY, the evidence will usually be tendered before the full picture can be seen. A determination of the weight to be given to the evidence, such as by reference to its credibility or reliability, will depend not only on its place in the evidence as a whole, but on an assessment of witnesses after examination and cross-examination and after weighing the account of each witness against each other.


	
	Tendency evidence may only be admitted in criminal proceedings if it also passes the test in s 101(2) of the Evidence Act which provides:
	


(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.


	
	In R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700; [2003] NSWCCA 319, Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreed) said at [91]-[97]:
	


[91] I find the following reasoning of McHugh J in Pfennig at 516 compelling:

“If evidence revealing criminal propensity is not admissible unless the evidence is consistent only with the guilt of the accused, the requirement that the probative value ‘outweigh’ or ‘transcend’ the prejudicial effect is superfluous. The evidence either meets the no rational explanation test or it does not. There is nothing to be weighed – at all events by the trial judge. The law has already done the weighing. This means that, even in cases where the risk of prejudice is very small, the prosecution cannot use the evidence unless it satisfies the stringent no rational explanation test. It cannot use the evidence even though in a practical sense its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.”

[92] His Honour’s judgment was a dissent. Nevertheless, this reasoning is directly apposite to the issue now before the Court, which is an issue of statutory construction.

[93] It is one thing to determine that a common law test requiring balancing between different, indeed incommensurable, considerations, should be conducted in a particular way. It is quite another thing to say that statutory words should be given a construction which they are not capable of bearing.

[94] The words “substantially outweigh” in a statute cannot, in my opinion, be construed to have the meaning which the majority in Pfennig determined was the way in which the common law balancing exercise should be conducted. The “no rational explanation” test may result in a trial judge failing to give adequate consideration to the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh.

[95] Section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion. (See R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at [20] per Sheller JA; F Bennion “Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion” [2000] Public Law 368.) The “no rational explanation” test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced – by requiring a high test of probative value – thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe s101(2) to that effect.

[96] My conclusion in relation to the construction of s101(2) should not be understood to suggest that the stringency of the approach, culminating in the Pfennig test, is never appropriate when the judgment for which the section calls has to be made. There may well be cases where, on the facts, it would not be open to conclude that the probative value of particular evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, unless the “no rational explanation” test were satisfied.

[97] There are conflicting authorities in this Court. Nevertheless, the preponderance of authority is in favour of applying the Pfennig test by way of explication of the statutory formulation. That line of authority was, however, established before the High Court in Papakosmas clarified the correct approach to determining the relationship between the Evidence Act 1995 and the pre-existing common law.


	
	In determining the prejudicial effect that evidence may have on a defendant, it is legitimate and appropriate for the judge to take into account the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be available to reduce the prejudicial effect: DAO v The Queen (2011) 81 NSWLR 568; [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [171]; R v Ngatikaura (2006) 161 A Crim R 329; [2006] NSWCCA 161 at [32]; Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330 at [192]. In BC v R [2015] NSWCCA 327 Beech-Jones J (with whom Simpson JA agreed) emphasised at [105]-[110] the critical importance of the specific identification of the prejudice to a defendant in conducting the weighing exercise required by s 101 and the importance of the consideration of directions which can be given in the particular case which could eliminate or ameliorate the identified prejudice.
	
	
	Finally, while s 101(2) requires the court to make an evaluative judgement rather than exercise a discretion, in an appellate review of determinations made under this section, the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 governing appellate review of discretionary decisions apply: see generally Saoud v R (2014) 87 NSWLR 481; [2014] NSWCCA 136 at [6] per Basten JA (with whom Fullerton and RA Hulme JJ agreed) and DAO v The Queen (2011) 81 NSWLR 568; [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [170] (although the question addressed in that case arose in the case of an interlocutory appeal to the Court).
	


The tendency notices


	
	The Crown served three tendency notices ahead of the trial. The tendencies the Crown sought to rely upon were:
	



	
	A tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely to be reckless as to whether or not the young women who he engaged to model for him were consenting to sexual contact with him.
	
	
	A tendency to act in a particular way, namely to engage in sexual activity with the young women engaged by him as artistic models.
	
	
	A tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely to be reckless as to whether or not the young women (namely the complainants [HS, AY and KC]) who he engaged to model for him were consenting to sexual contact with him. The following circumstances were relied upon:
	



	
	the sexual contact commenced with the accused touching the complainants’ breasts without warning; and
	
	
	in relation to the complainants HS and AY, the accused persisted in sexual contact with them despite their visible distress.
	



	
	It was common ground that the third notice effectively subsumed the first and that the evidence relied upon was the tendency to act in a particular way described in the second notice and the tendency to have a particular state of mind described in the third notice.
	


Applicant’s submissions – tendency to act in a particular way


	
	The primary judge permitted the Crown to rely upon the asserted tendency to act in a particular way (to engage in sexual activity with young women acting as artists’ models) to prove the disputed acts relating to HS (charges 3 – 9).
	
	
	Mr Gartelmann SC, in the course of his thorough and helpful submissions for the applicant, conceded that the primary judge was correct to permit the evidence relating to tendency to act in a particular way to go to the jury. Although a document had been handed up for the purposes of a voir dire indicating informal agreement by the defence to the proposition that sexual activity had taken place with HS, subject to various qualifications, that question remained in issue before the jury.
	
	
	That concession was correctly made. The case has a number of similarities with the tendency evidence addressed by this Court in Saoud at [49]-[53] regarding the significant probative value of modus operandi tendency evidence of the kind here engaged.
	
	
	The disputed acts in relation to HS were in contest before the jury. The primary judge was correct to permit the Crown to rely upon the asserted tendency to act in a particular way (to engage in sexual activity with young women acting as artists’ models) to prove the disputed acts relating to HS. That evidence had significant probative value within the meaning of s 97 and the probative value of that evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect within the meaning of s 101.
	


Applicant’s submissions – tendency to have a particular state of mind


	
	The primary judge permitted the Crown to lead evidence from HS, AY and KC to prove that the applicant had a tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely to be reckless as to whether or not the young women who he engaged to model for him were consenting to sexual contact with him.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that the tendency evidence which was admitted about the applicant’s state of mind met the threshold of admissibility in s 97(1)(b) of the Evidence Act as having “significant probative value”.
	
	
	It was submitted, however, that her Honour erred in failing to find that the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant within the meaning of s 101(2) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The prejudice identified by the applicant was that the jury may be confused about the use which could be made of the tendency evidence in dealing with the two different types of offences charged. The applicant submitted:
	


The difference in the mental elements applicable to the two kinds of offences was subtle but important in the context of the issues in the trial. The directions permitted use of tendency without distinction and gave rise to the risk that the jury would conflate the differing issues applicable in determining the mental elements of the offences.


	
	Whilst it was common ground before this Court that the mental element required to establish indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act was different to that required to establish sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, it was also common ground that recklessness as to consent was an element of each offence.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted that directions limiting the use of evidence of the tendency would be “somewhat difficult” but not that they would be “impossible to follow” or “susceptible to misuse by a jury”. The judge therefore concluded that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was significant because of the risk the jury might use it in the determination of issues not confined to recklessness as to consent, despite directions to the contrary. Phillips v The Queen (2006) 225 CLR 303; [2006] HCA 4 at [44]-[45] was relied upon. It was submitted that even if evidence of such a tendency had significant probative value, it was not such as to outweigh its prejudicial effect for the purposes of s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. 
	


Decision of the primary judge about tendency to have a particular state of mind


	
	In the judgment of 14 July 2015 her Honour dealt with this issue:
	


Accordingly, I accept that the evidence sought to be led by the Crown as tendency is relevant to whether the Crown can prove that the accused was reckless as to whether the complainants consented or not. In this respect, it must be noted that the requirements of proof as between indecent assault and sexual intercourse without consent on the issue of consent are different. Section 61HA(3) of the Crimes Act does not apply to indecent assault. However, and significantly, a reckless state of mind on the part of an accused is a guilty state of mind when it comes to both indecent assaults and sexual intercourse without consent. When it comes to recklessness, there is no distinction. A guilty state of mind exists if the Crown can prove that the accused simply failed to consider whether the complainant was consenting and just went ahead, even though the risk that she was not consenting would have been obvious to a sober person with the accused’s mental capacity, or that he realised the possibility that she was not consenting but went ahead regardless of whether she was consenting or not.


	
	In addressing the critical balancing exercise required by s 101 of the Evidence Act, her Honour later said that:
	


I must then undertake a balancing exercise under s 101. I accept that the evidence does bring with it prejudice; that prejudice is, in my view, somewhat lessened or lowered by the fact that the accused admits most of the acts of misconduct. Nevertheless, I accept that there is prejudice.

Before I allow the evidence, the Crown must satisfy me that the probative value substantially outweighs its prejudice effect [sic].

Ms Francis [counsel for the applicant at trial] has argued that not only does the evidence lack significant probative value, it is in effect impossible to intelligibly limit the use of this evidence in the way contended for by the Crown. She argues that the Crown is endeavouring to prove both the state of mind of the accused but also the absence of consent on the part of the complainants, and that it is, in effect, impossible to compartmentalise the evidence.

I do not accept that submission. The Crown must prove that each complainant did not consent to each of the acts under consideration, and each act must be considered separately. The tendency evidence does not, and cannot, have any bearing upon this element that the Crown must prove. And the Crown has been careful not to conflate the two. It is only if the Crown has satisfied this element, without the use of tendency evidence, that the jury will turn to the next essential element; that is, the element that the accused knew or was reckless as to whether the complainants consented. Here again, the Crown seeks to limit the use of tendency evidence to recklessness and not to actual knowledge. I accept that once one gets to this element, directions limiting use of the evidence become somewhat difficult, but I am not of the view that the directions will be impossible to follow or that the evidence is susceptible to misuse by a jury.

Clear and concise directions will instruct the jury that they cannot use the evidence on the issue of whether the Crown has proven that the accused actually knew that the complainant was not consenting, but it is only if and when they are considering the alternate basis of recklessness that they may use the evidence. With the benefit of clear directions, I am satisfied that the evidence does substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, I allow the evidence referred to by the Crown in its first and third tendency notices to be led as tendency evidence.

The primary judge’s summing up


	
	An important feature of the present appeal is that no ground of appeal asserted that her Honour erred in any part of the summing up and it was no part of the applicant’s case that any part of the summing up itself revealed error. In her summing up, the primary judge addressed this aspect of the tendency evidence as follows:
	


I have also told you that the Crown can rely upon a reckless state of mind on the part of the accused. If, and only if, you come to considering whether the Crown has proven a reckless state of mind on the part of the accused, you can use the tendency evidence. On this issue, the Crown case is that the accused had a tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely, he had a tendency to be reckless as to whether or not the complainant, whom he engaged to model for him, was consenting to sexual contact with him.


	
	Her Honour’s summing up continued:
	


In seeking to prove that he had this tendency, the Crown relies on some circumstances which it submits apply in respect of each complainant. They are that the sexual contact commenced with the accused touching the complainants’ breasts without warning, and in relation to the complainants HS and AY, the Crown asserts that the accused persisted in sexual contact with them despite their visible distress. The evidence suggesting that the accused had that tendency can only be used by you in the way the Crown asks you to use it, if you make two findings beyond reasonable doubt. The first finding is that you conclude beyond reasonable doubt that, in relation to one or more of the acts alleged, that the accused was, in fact, reckless as to consent. So before you can use any of the other counts, you must make a finding that the Crown has, in fact, proven that the accused is guilty of that count, and proven it on the basis that the accused was reckless as to the issue of consent on the part of the complainant. This involves, whether or not you do find that the sexual contact commenced, in relation to any of the complainants, with the accused touching the complainants’ breasts without warning, and whether, in relation to HS and or AY, the accused did persist in sexual contact with them, despite their visible distress. If, and only if, you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of the counts has been proven by the Crown, on the basis that the accused was reckless as to lack of consent on the part of the complainant, then you must go on to consider the second finding.

Consideration of grounds 1 and 2


	
	In this Court the applicant accepted that the tendency evidence relied upon to demonstrate the applicant had a particular state of mind had significant probative value within the meaning of s 97. When examined against the critical issues in the case, that concession was correctly made.
	
	
	A critical issue at trial was whether the Crown had proved that the applicant had the required mental state in committing the acts alleged, many of which the applicant did not dispute. In determining whether the applicant was reckless as to whether the complainants consented to his sexual approaches, it was highly probative that the evidence, taken at its highest, showed that:
	



	
	the sexual contact commenced with the accused touching the complainants’ breasts without warning; and
	
	
	in relation to the complainants HS and AY, the accused persisted in sexual contact with them despite their visible distress.
	



	
	The question that arises is whether, within the meaning of s 101, the primary judge erred in weighing the competing considerations and concluding, assuming that clear directions would be given to the jury about the issue, that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed the prejudice identified, namely the risk the jury might use the tendency evidence in the determination of issues not confined to recklessness as to consent, despite being given directions to the contrary.
	
	
	In this regard, the applicant made no specific complaint about the directions actually given by the primary judge, but relied upon those directions only to demonstrate that the risk identified was made patent or materialised.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the Crown case included the following features:
	



	
	all of the complainants were recruited having placed an advertisement on a website seeking casual work;
	
	
	all were aged in their late teens;
	
	
	all were invited to an artist’s “studio” by the applicant;
	
	
	the offences occurred when no other persons were present;
	
	
	each of the complainants was subjected to unwanted and inappropriate touching by the applicant, including a clear sexual interest;
	
	
	the sexual contact commenced in each case with the applicant touching the complainants’ breasts without warning; and
	
	
	the applicant persisted in sexual contact with HS and AY despite both young women crying during that sexual contact.
	



	
	The last two matters (6) and (7), being the relevant tendency evidence about the applicant’s state of mind, were in context highly probative. The jury were entitled to conclude that the fact that the applicant touched the complainants’ breasts without warning was significant to the issue of whether the applicant had a tendency to be reckless as to whether or not the complainants, whom he engaged to model for him, were consenting to sexual contact with him. The jury were also entitled to conclude, in relation to the complainants HS and AY, that the fact that the applicant persisted in sexual contact with them despite their obvious and visible distress was significant, again limited to the issue of whether the applicant had a tendency to be reckless as to whether or not these two complainants, whom he engaged to model for him, were consenting to sexual contact with him.
	
	
	The prejudice identified, the risk the jury might use the tendency evidence in the determination of issues not confined to recklessness as to consent, despite directions to the contrary, was relatively slight. Her Honour was entitled to conclude that clear directions could be given to the jury on this topic and to take that matter into account in the balancing test required by s 101(2). The absence of any ground of appeal or specific complaint about those directions is telling. While accepting that the tendency evidence may have a prejudicial effect, the primary judge’s directions given to the jury, set out at [53]-[54] were sufficiently clear to eliminate or significantly ameliorate the identified risk. The applicant did not show, or attempt to show, that the directions actually given were incorrect or insufficient in all the circumstances of the case. The applicant failed to demonstrate that the risk identified was made patent or materialised by those directions. Certainly, the applicant did not show any House v The King error in the way her Honour weighed the competing considerations and reached her conclusion about s 101.
	
	
	Before leaving ground 1, I should note that contrary to the written submissions of the applicant, nothing in the decisions of the High Court in Phillips v The Queen (2006) 225 CLR 303; [2006] HCA 4 at [44]-[45] or Stubley v Western Australia (2011) 242 CLR 374; [2011] HCA 7 prohibited the use of tendency evidence to establish a reckless state of mind on the part of the applicant and her Honour was correct to so conclude:
	



	
	Phillips v The Queen did not address the presently relevant question. That case was not concerned with the statutory test in s 101. Moreover, in the passages relied upon, the plurality was addressing the state of mind of the victim and not the relevant question addressed here by her Honour, being the state of mind of the applicant. 
	
	
	Stubley was a case addressing a different issue under a different statutory regime for admissibility. In that case the prosecution had to negative the appellant’s honest and reasonable but mistaken belief in consent (the appellant was the psychiatrist treating the complainants).  In the High Court, the Crown did not advance any basis upon which the evidence of the three complainants might have tended towards negativing the asserted honest and reasonable but mistaken belief in consent save by recourse to the contention that the evidence of these witnesses demonstrated the appellant’s psychological ascendency over his patients.  Absent any feature of the evidence tending to demonstrate the appellant’s awareness that his manipulation of his patients had not succeeded in procuring their assent to his predatory advances, proof of the imbalance of power did not rationally bear on the issues raised by the defence: see [83] in the judgment of the plurality in Stubley. The case is clearly distinguishable from the present.
	



	
	For these reasons, ground 1 should be dismissed.
	
	
	So far as ground 2 is concerned, the complaint about separate trials was parasitic upon ground 1. It was submitted only that if the use of tendency evidence was wrongly permitted for the reasons advanced under ground 1, the primary judge erred in refusing the separate trial application.
	
	
	As ground 1 should be dismissed, it follows that ground 2 should also be dismissed.
	


Conclusion on grounds 1 and 2


	
	I would grant an extension of time to file the notice of appeal. As the applicant has raised an issue sufficiently important to warrant consideration by this Court, I would grant leave to appeal on grounds 1 and 2 but dismiss the appeal on these grounds.
	


Ground 3 – miscarriage of justice as a result of withdrawing a direction to the jury 


	
	The applicant submitted that a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of withdrawing a direction to the jury regarding the issue of consent. The issue arose in an unusual way.
	
	
	Her Honour provided a draft of her directions to the jury (MFI 17) to counsel. MFI 17 provided that “[c]onsents have to be free and voluntary”. In dealing with the element of “without the consent of the complainant” the document distinguished in part between the sexual intercourse without consent offences and the indecent assaults. In respect of both, however, it was noted that “consent obtained by persuasion is still consent”.
	
	
	In her closing address, counsel then appearing for the applicant told the jury, in terms derived from the Western Australian case Holman v The Queen [1970] WAR 2 at 6:
	


… her Honour will give you directions on the topic of consent, but suffice to say consent can be reluctant, it can be begrudging, it can even be teary. But if it is obtained, as was the case here, the accused is entitled to an acquittal.


	
	In summing up, her Honour, in summarising the arguments of counsel for the applicant, told the jury “[counsel for the applicant] reminds you that consent can be reluctant, can be begrudging, and she submits, can be teary”.
	
	
	At the next break counsel for the applicant asked her Honour to re-direct the jury to the effect that it was not just a submission on behalf of the applicant that consent “can be teary” but that it was so as a matter of law; referring to Stubley at [70], which in turn referred to the relevant passage in Holman. Her Honour indicated she would do so. When the jury returned her Honour gave the jury “…two further directions. The first direction is that I direct you that at law consent can be reluctant, it can be given grudgingly and it can be given tearfully”.  
	
	
	Later that day the Crown raised the issue with her Honour and asked that the re-direction be withdrawn. Written and oral submissions were made by the parties. Her Honour determined to withdraw the direction and re-directed the jury as follows:
	


Good morning. I brought you in this morning to redirect you, because when I gave my oral directions to you earlier this week I did make an error. This was not an error made in written directions, but this was a direction that I gave you toward the end of my summing up. I said to you, in relation to the issue of the complainant’s consent, that consent can be given hesitantly, grudging, or tearfully. That direction was an error. It was, in fact, a misdirection, and I now direct you not to follow that direction. As I say, it was an error on my part and I direct you to ignore it. I apologise to you for making that error and I invite you to now continue your deliberations.


	
	The applicant does not in this Court submit that such a direction was correct in law. That concession was correctly made. Having regard to the statutory definition of consent under s 61HA(2) of the Crimes Act, being, “[a] person ""consents"" to sexual intercourse if the person freely and voluntarily agrees to the sexual intercourse”, the submission made by trial counsel for the applicant that a direction based on Holman should be given was incorrect. Rather, the applicant submitted in this Court that the withdrawal of the direction at a late stage of the trial caused significant practical unfairness.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant in this Court accepted that trial counsel did not seek a re-direction following the direction that was ultimately given in answer to the jury’s question. What was sought was a redirection about implied consent. It was common ground in this Court that a redirection about implied consent should not have been given. Mr Gartelmann SC initially submitted that her Honour should not have withdrawn the re-direction or should have discharged the jury. Neither application was made to the primary judge. He relied, by way of analogy, upon the decision of this Court in Robinson v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 88; [2006] NSWCCA 192 at [145]-[146]. Mr Gartelmann SC ultimately submitted that underlying the request for a re-direction about implied consent was a request for some guidance to the jury about the knowledge of the accused in respect of the consent of the complainant. He submitted that:
	


… although it’s conceded that the requested direction was not appropriate there was at least a request for a direction which would have involved some guidance in respect of what appeared to be the question troubling the jury, that is at least in part a question about the knowledge on the part of the accused regarding the complainant’s consent. So in my submission r 4 need not be applied to this ground of appeal.

Consideration of ground 3


	
	Whist it would have been preferable if her Honour had not given a re-direction based on Holman, she was led into that course by counsel for the applicant at trial. As soon as the error was pointed out her Honour corrected the error. It was incumbent upon her Honour to do so. The jury could not have been allowed to deliberate in this case on the basis of directions about consent drawn from Holman. Those directions were clearly wrong, as is now accepted. The applicant’s submission in this Court that the trial judge, faced with the error into which she had been led in the initial re-direction, “ought to have done nothing” must be rejected.
	
	
	The decision in Robinson involved a very different case where the trial judge had raised a new case in summing up which had not been advanced by the Crown or touched upon by either party in closing address. That case provides no assistance, even by way of loose analogy, to the present applicant.
	
	
	In the ultimate re-direction which was given, her Honour took complete responsibility for misdirecting the jury. No blame was attached to counsel for the applicant. Counsel then appearing for the applicant asked for a further re-direction in terms of implied consent. It is now common ground that her Honour was correct to reject that application. Any more general additional direction about consent of the kind suggested in this Court was not advanced before the primary judge.
	
	
	There would have been dangers in any additional attention being given to this issue before the jury. Any additional explanation from her Honour about why she had given the original direction based on Holman and why it was now being withdrawn would, in my view, have been likely to have drawn unwarranted attention to the issue and may itself have led to prejudice to the applicant.
	
	
	This question of additional directions was quintessentially a matter for determination at the trial in the atmosphere that the parties, including counsel for the applicant, were immersed. No re-direction of the kind now suggested was sought by trial counsel. A different, and incorrect, re-direction about implied consent was sought. No application to discharge the jury was made at the trial based on this issue.
	
	
	This is not a case where there was any arguable miscarriage of justice in failing to give a further direction about consent or in failing to discharge the jury. The primary judge quickly and accurately corrected an error into which her Honour had been led by counsel for the applicant. The terms of that correction accepted the blame for the error rather than sheeting home responsibility to the applicant’s counsel. No error has been shown in failing to give a further direction or in failing to discharge the jury. No such direction or discharge was sought at the time by experienced trial counsel.
	
	
	I would refuse leave to the applicant to rely upon ground 3 under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


Ground 4 – asserted error in directions addressing a note from the jury


	
	The applicant submitted that the primary judge erred in directions given when addressing a note from the jury. After retiring to consider its verdict, the jury sent a note with the following question:
	


May consent be a mindset? If touching was not expected, but it is [sic] complied to [sic] due to any reason, it is still considered as consent if the complainant’s mind could only be determined after the touchings?


	
	The primary judge provided the jury with the following written directions in response to that question:
	


CONSENT

The accused does not have to prove that the complainant consented.

It is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent.

When you are considering whether the Crown has proven that the complainant did not consent, you are considering the state of mind of the complainant at the time the act took place.

Sexual intercourse counts

The complainant consents to sexual intercourse if she freely and voluntarily agrees to engage in sexual intercourse with the accused.

Consent is a positive thing – it requires the complainant to freely and voluntarily decide, in her own mind that she will consent to sexual intercourse with the accused.

If you find that the Crown have proven, beyond reasonable doubt that the intercourse took place without the complainant freely and voluntarily deciding in her own mind that she will agree to engage in sexual intercourse with the accused then the Crown have proven that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse.

Indecent assault counts 

In order to establish that the touching was unlawful and therefore an assault the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused touched the complainant without her consent.

Consent involves conscious and voluntary permission by the complainant to touch the complainant’s body in the manner that he did.

Consent is a positive thing – it requires the complainant to consciously and voluntarily decide in her own mind that she will permit the accused to touch her body in the manner that he did.

If you find that the Crown have proven, beyond reasonable doubt that the touching took place without the complainant consciously and voluntarily deciding in her own mind that she will permit the accused to touch her body in the way he did then the Crown have proven that the complainant did not consent to the touching.

If you accept that the complainant did not have the opportunity to consider the issue of consent because she was touched without warning and so did not know she was going to be touched until after she was touched, then as a matter of law, the Crown have proven that she did not consent.


	
	The primary judge also gave the jury oral directions in accordance with the above written directions.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant at trial requested that the primary judge give the jury a direction about implied consent based on the case of R v DMC (2002) 137 A Crim R 246; [2002] NSWCCA 513. Counsel for the applicant in this Court accepted that her Honour was correct to refuse to give such a direction.
	
	
	It was submitted in this Court that in response to the question different directions to the jury ought to have been given. Those additional directions, it was submitted, should have made it clear that it was not necessary that the complainant communicate consent to the applicant. It was submitted that the direction that consent was a “positive thing” was capable of being understood as suggesting the contrary. The applicant also submitted in this Court that the directions to the jury in response to the question ought to have made clear that it remained necessary for the Crown to prove in respect of each of the indecent assault counts that the applicant did not have an honest but unreasonable belief as to the complainants’ consent.
	


Consideration of ground 4


	
	The applicant’s submission on this ground rests to a considerable extent on a construction of the note from the jury. Those submissions proceed on the basis that it should be inferred that the jury were seeking guidance about the requirements upon the Crown to prove the applicant’s mental state about the complainants’ consent in respect of each of the indecent assault counts. This interpretation placed on the note by the applicant does not fairly arise on the language of the note. The note is addressing the requirements upon the Crown to prove the complainants’ state of mind, and in particular, consent given only after an unexpected sexual touching.
	
	
	This was the subject the primary judge addressed in her directions to the jury. The jury asked no follow up or additional questions following the direction given by the primary judge from which I infer that that her Honour had addressed the subject raised by the jury in the note.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint that the direction that consent was a positive thing connoted a requirement for communication of consent does also not arise on a reading of the direction as a whole. Her Honour made clear that consent did not involve proof of communication of that consent to the applicant in the following passage:
	


If you find that the Crown have proven, beyond reasonable doubt that the touching took place without the complainant consciously and voluntarily deciding in her own mind that she will permit the accused to touch her body in the way he did then the Crown have proven that the complainant did not consent to the touching. (italics added)


	
	There was no realistic possibility that a failure to direct the jury in the terms now suggested caused the applicant to lose a chance of acquittal. The jury received the assistance that they had sought by her Honour directing the jury specifically about whether a complainant’s state of mind after the event of sexual touching might constitute consent. This was the matter about which they had sought assistance. The suggestion that her Honour’s directions implied that consent must be communicated to the applicant in order to be effective is inconsistent with the clear terms of her Honour’s directions.
	
	
	In the atmosphere of the trial, experienced trial counsel obviously did not read the note in the same way as was advanced on appeal. Nor was any difficulty about consent needing to be communicated discerned. No re-directions of the kind now advanced were sought.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be refused on ground 4 under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


The application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	I agree with the reasons of Fullerton J about the application for leave to appeal against sentence and the order her Honour proposes.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	I propose the following orders be made:
	



	
	Time to file the notice of appeal extended to 1 September 2016.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against conviction on grounds 1 and 2 of the notice of appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal against conviction on grounds 1 and 2 of the notice of appeal dismissed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against conviction on grounds 3 and 4 of the notice of appeal refused under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgments of Payne JA with respect to the conviction appeal and Fullerton J concerning the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  I agree with the reasons and proposed orders as contained in those judgments.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: With respect to the appeal against conviction, I have read the draft judgment of Payne JA and agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed orders.
	
	
	The applicant relied on three grounds of appeal against the aggregate sentence imposed after trial:
	



	
	The judge erred in finding the offences were aggravated because of a breach of a position of trust;
	
	
	The judge erred in finding the applicant abused his professional position to commit the offences so as to warrant less weight being given for prior good character; and
	
	
	The judge erred in taking into account post-offence conduct in assessing the seriousness of the offences.
	



	
	The third ground of appeal concerns a passage in the sentencing remarks where the sentencing judge found that the applicant had destroyed a memory card from his camera as potential evidence during the course of the police investigation.
	
	
	In the filed submissions, the destruction of the memory card was said to be a reference to post-offence conduct erroneously taken into account by the sentencing judge as an objective feature of the offending.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing of the appeal, the applicant’s counsel did not seek to argue against another construction of the same passage which counsel accepted would not constitute error.
	
	
	In the course of detailing various features of the offending conduct which her Honour was satisfied were proved to the criminal standard for sentencing purposes, she said:
	


… Next, I find that the offender must have known and did know that the victims did not consent. HS, early in the event, told him she had changed her mind. HS and AY cried. The offender displayed intimidating and aggressive behaviour and he destroyed potential evidence after the events.

I conclude he did so because he feared the truth. He feared that the photographs of the victims would reveal their true demeanour, unlike his sketches. The offender knew that each of the victims consented to modelling for him and that there would be nudity. I find that it was clear that consent went no further than that. …


	
	Read in context, I am satisfied that her Honour’s reference to the applicant's destruction of the memory card was intended to exemplify that he knew the complainants were not consenting to sexual intercourse, a matter clearly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of those counts where consent was an issue.
	
	
	The third ground of appeal is not made out.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that either of the first or second grounds of appeal against sentence are made out.
	
	
	The first ground of appeal concerns the operation of s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”) which provides that an offence will be aggravated if the offender abuses a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find that the applicant had abused a position of trust or authority relative to any of the complainants since, as young women who had consented to modelling for him naked or semi-naked, he owed them no duty of care. Counsel submitted that it was not enough to invoke the operation of s 21A(2)(k) that the complainants placed their trust in the applicant not to sexually abuse them or to indecently assault them once they had contracted with him to model naked.
	
	
	Consistently with the features of aggravation listed in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act reflecting the common law (see R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186 at [21]), I accept that s 21A(2)(k) was not intended to extend the categories of what might constitute a breach of trust or authority in the commission of an offence at common law where the special relationship between an offender and a victim imposes mutual obligations not to act to the detriment of the other. However, in a given case, the particular nature of the relationship between an offender and a victim may be such that their relationship transcends the duty of care that arises between people otherwise engaged in business or social communion, thereby imposing on them a particular responsibility not to act to the detriment of the other and an obligation the breach of which will operate as a statutory feature of aggravation (Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 70 at [22]).
	
	
	After reviewing the authorities that have considered the nature of a relationship, breach of which will operate to aggravate the offending as provided for in s 21A(2)(k), the sentencing judge regarded the relationship between the applicant, who had represented himself as a professional artist, and the complainants, who had agreed to pose nude or partially nude as models, as constituting a “special or peculiar relationship” of trust which the applicant breached when he sexually and indecently assaulted them.
	
	
	I am satisfied there was no error in the sentencing judge’s analysis of the relationship between the applicant and the complainants as being within that category.
	
	
	To the extent that the second ground of appeal alleges error both in the sentencing judge’s finding that the applicant used his professional position to commit the offences and, having made that finding, to have afforded less weight to the applicant's prior good character in determining the appropriate sentence, neither error is made out.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the applicant “… took each of the victims to his flat on the pretence, or pretext, that he was only interested in them for an artistic purpose” and that he “… used his position as a professional artist in order to convince the victims to come to his flat and remove their clothing”. In that way, her Honour found he had used an aspect of his good character to facilitate the offending. The applicant does not submit that these findings are unsupported by the evidence adduced at trial, rather that they were not reasonably open on the evidence. That submission must be rejected.
	
	
	HS gave evidence that she was contacted by the applicant who represented himself as a figurative artist seeking topless models. She gave evidence that it was after talking with the applicant and seeing samples of his work that she was led to believe she would be modelling for an artist pursuing a legitimate artistic endeavor. She gave evidence that having formed that belief she attended the applicant's studio and complied with his request to remove her top and bra.
	
	
	KC and AY also gave evidence that they attended the applicant's studio and partially removed their clothing on the same basis. AY also gave evidence that when she hesitated in removing her clothes, the applicant sought to reassure her that he was a professional artist, “not a molester or rapist”.
	
	
	It was accepted by the sentencing judge that the applicant had no record of prior convictions and, prior to the commission of the offences for which he was convicted, that he had led an exemplary life as a loving and caring family man who had made a valuable contribution to the community through his work as an art teacher and designer. This was supported by a body of testimonial and oral evidence from family members and from his former colleagues in the arts.
	
	
	The sentencing judge noted that the applicant’s prior good character was a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(f) of the Sentencing Act, as to which she said:
	


… I do intend to give this factor weight, but I do accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that the weight I give to this factor should be limited by virtue of the nature of the offending … [and] because the offender used an aspect of his good character in order to facilitate the offending.


	
	In my view, there is no error in this approach, it being entirely in accordance with settled authority.
	
	
	In KAB v R [2015] NSWCCA 55, Wilson J (with whom Ward JA and Simpson J agreed) stated at [48]:
	


The obligation imposed upon sentencing judges is to “take into account” an offender’s former good character, but the weight to be given to that feature is a matter for the sentencing judge, whose discretion in that regard is wide…


	
	The rationale for good character being given less weight when sentencing for certain offences was discussed by Howie J in R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 at [21] :
	


It is unnecessary for the purposes of determining this appeal to consider the circumstances in which a court may legitimately determine that it will give less weight to prior good character as a mitigating factor. Generally speaking such a situation might arise where general deterrence is important, the particular offence before the court is serious and it is one frequently committed by persons of good character. Another situation may be where the prior good character of the offender has enabled him or her to gain a position where the particular offence can be committed.


	
	I propose that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be dismissed.

4574924,Severino v R [2017] NSWCCA 80,"headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 

On 4 August 2015, a jury found Michael John Severino guilty of aggravated dangerous driving causing death.

The Crown case was that on 9 April 2014, Mr Severino lost control of his car while driving on Mona Vale Road. The car rolled at least twice, during which both Mr Severino and his passenger, Ms Kaleigh Fryer, were thrown from the vehicle. Ms Fryer died at the scene. At the time of the crash, Mr Severino was intoxicated and the car was travelling at 105km/h in a 90km zone.

The sole issue at trial was the identification of the driver. The prosecution relied upon a number of conversations between Mr Severino and police officers, paramedics and members of the public at the scene of the crash to prove that he was the driver. In the course of these conversations Mr Severino said, among other things, “I don’t want to incriminate myself”, “I was the driver” and that “his mates told him he was right to drive”. He also denied that he was the driver of the crashed car. The prosecution also relied on circumstantial evidence in support of its case.

Mr Severino sought leave to appeal against his conviction. Leave was required under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules as none of the points advanced on appeal were raised at trial.

The application raised the following issues:

(1)    were the admissions and representations made by the applicant inadmissible? The relevant arguments made were that:

(a)    the admissions made to police officers inadmissible under s 85 of the Evidence Act; and / or

(b)    the statements made to police officers have been excluded under s 138 of the Evidence Act as they were improperly obtained; and in any event

(c)    even if the evidence was admissible after considering the matters in (a) and (b), the representations have been inadmissible under s 137 due to the danger of unfair prejudice to the applicant outweighing their probative value.

(1A)    was a miscarriage of justice occasioned by inadmissible evidence being admitted at trial where no objection was made by counsel for the defendant?

(2)    did the prosecution misuse this evidence, by using it to prove consciousness of guilt?

(3)    should the trial judge’s summing up have included a direction that this evidence should not be used to prove consciousness of guilt?

The Court held, refusing leave to appeal: 

(1)   Regarding the admissibility of the admissions and representations made by the applicant:

(a)   The circumstances in which admissions were made to the police as a whole demonstrated that it is unlikely that the truth of those admissions was adversely affected. Therefore those admissions were not inadmissible by reason of s 85 of the Evidence Act: [75]

(b)    The applicant was deemed to be under arrest at the time he made representations to the police officers. In this case, however, the desirability of admitting the evidence of the applicant’s representations to police outweighed the undesirability of admitting improperly obtained evidence. Therefore, those representations were not inadmissible by reason of s 138 of the Evidence Act: [90] ‑ [92]

(c)   None of the representations made should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act: [94] –[104]

(1A)    The fact that the representations were admitted into evidence does not show that the applicant has lost a real or fairly open chance of being acquitted at trial: [109].

(2)    The prosecution did not invite the jury to use consciousness of guilt reasoning, nor did it suggest that the applicant was lying. Viewed in context, the prosecution was addressing the reliability of the applicant’s responses in the conversations that occurred in the aftermath of the crash, seeking to show that he was able to understand the questions being put to him and formulate coherent answers to particular questions: [117].

(3)    Given the manner in which the prosecution relied on the representations, no arguable miscarriage of justice arose by reason of the trial judge not giving a direction about lying or consciousness of guilt: [129].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 4 August 2015, following a 7 day trial before Woodburne SC DCJ, the applicant was found guilty by a jury of one count of aggravated dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	On 25 August 2015, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years with a balance of term of two years and nine months, commencing on 17 August 2015. The applicant will therefore be eligible for parole on 16 August 2019. As the applicant does not appeal his sentence it is unnecessary to consider this issue further.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court on conviction. Leave is required under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) as none of the points that are the subject of the grounds of appeal were raised at trial.
	


Background


	
	At about 4.13am on 9 April 2014, the applicant was involved in a motor vehicle crash. The Crown case at trial was that the applicant, who was driving his red Toyota Corolla, lost control of the car while making a slight left-hand turn along Mona Vale Road near Terry Hills. The car rolled at least twice before coming to rest, during which both occupants of the car, the applicant and Ms Kailegh Fryer, were ejected from the vehicle. Ms Fryer died at the scene from the injuries she sustained in the crash.
	
	
	The speed limit on this stretch of Mona Vale Road is 90km per hour. The uncontested evidence at trial was that the car was travelling at 105km per hour when the crash occurred, and 70km per hour when it began to roll.
	
	
	Both the applicant and Ms Fryer were intoxicated at the time of the incident. The applicant’s blood-alcohol concentration at 4.55am on the day of the crash was 0.161 grams per 100 millilitres. It was agreed that the applicant’s blood-alcohol concentration at the time of the crash was likely 0.170 grams per 100 millilitres. The deceased’s blood-alcohol concentration at the time of the crash was likely 0.157 grams per 100 millilitres.
	
	
	The sole issue at trial was whether the applicant was driving the car at the time of the crash.
	


Statements made at the scene of the accident


	
	There were no eye witnesses to the crash. The Crown adduced evidence of a number of conversations and interactions between the applicant and people who attended the scene of the crash. The Crown relied on three of those interactions as admissions by the applicant that he was driving the car.
	


Mr Sharkey


	
	The first person to come across the crashed vehicle was Mr Peter Sharkey who, at about 4.15am, was driving to work and saw the applicant lying across the grass and gutter about 3‑4 metres from the passenger side of the car. Mr Sharkey dialled triple 0. The applicant was face down and appeared to be unconscious. Mr Sharkey pushed or shook the applicant and about 20 or 30 seconds later the applicant responded. Mr Sharkey heard the applicant call out the deceased’s name. He thought the applicant had been drinking; he could smell alcohol on his breath and his speech was slurred. The applicant was also possibly in shock. Mr Sharkey agreed in cross-examination that he did not see the applicant in the car, opening the car door or doing anything near the car.

	The first admission relied upon by the Crown was made by the applicant to Mr Timothy Lala, who was a passenger in a car being driven by Mr Paul Talbot. Mr Lala and Mr Talbot were next to arrive at the scene. Mr Lala gave evidence that he saw the applicant get out of the driver’s side and stumble around the back of the car. Mr Lala asked the applicant what day it was and the applicant responded, “Tuesday night”. Holding up five fingers, he asked the applicant how many fingers he was holding up. The applicant responded, “Five”. Mr Lala then asked the applicant whether there was anyone else in the car with him, and he responded “No”. He asked if the applicant had been drinking and how many drinks he had had. Mr Lala gave evidence that “all he said to me was his mates told him he was right to drive”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mr Lala agreed that he had had four scotch and cokes that night. He agreed that he was shaken and in shock and had difficulty breathing at one stage. Mr Lala suffers from anxiety and the police arranged for a paramedic to examine him at the scene.
	


Mr Talbot


	
	Mr Talbot was driving himself and Mr Lala along Mona Vale Road. When they stopped at the scene, Mr Talbot saw Ms Fryer lying half on the road and half on the gutter. He attended to her and did not speak directly to the applicant. He heard the applicant yelling out Ms Fryer’s name.
	


Constable Doroszuk


	
	Constables Leanne Doroszuk and Clinton Whatman were the first police to arrive at the scene at 4.18am. A minute later Constables Bradley Curle and Matthew Shaw arrived.
	
	
	Constable Doroszuk gave evidence that she saw a woman lying on her back on the side of the road. The applicant was sitting next to the woman and shaking her arm. Constable Curle checked the woman’s pulse.
	
	
	Constable Doroszuk introduced herself to the applicant and asked his name. The applicant responded, “I’m not telling you anything”. She then asked if he was involved in the car crash, and the applicant responded, “No comment”. Constable Doroszuk asked the applicant whether he was ok, and the applicant responded, “I’m not going to say anything. I’m not going to incriminate myself”. The applicant’s breath smelt of alcohol and his speech was slow and slightly slurred. In cross-examination, Constable Doroszuk said that despite this, the applicant “calculated his responses to me”. She agreed that she was concerned that the applicant was a flight risk.
	


Constable Curle


	
	When Constable Curle arrived on the scene, he checked Ms Fryer’s pulse and determined that she had died. He then walked to the applicant, who smelt of alcohol and was walking around. The second admission that the Crown relied upon occurred in a conversation between the applicant and Constable Curle as follows:
	


“Curle:    You were driving?

Applicant:   No

Curle:       You sure?

Applicant:    I don’t know.

Curle:       Were you or not?

Applicant:    Yes

Curle:       Where was she?

Applicant:   I don’t know, she wasn’t in my car.

Curle:       Well where was she then, tell me?

Applicant:    I don’t know.

Curle:       Have you been drinking?

Applicant:    Yes

Curle:       How much?

Applicant:    A fair bit.

Curle:       You are under arrest for blood and urine sample.

Applicant:    Okay.”

Constable Shaw


	
	Constable Shaw spoke with Mr Talbot and Mr Lala. When the applicant had finished speaking with Constable Curle, Constable Shaw approached him and asked, “What happened to her?”, referring to the deceased. The applicant responded, “I know her, I was with her earlier.” Constable Shaw then said, “We need to know what happened to her.” The applicant responded, “I was with her earlier”. Constable Shaw then said, “Mate, look at her. She’s dead. She was either in the car or you hit her with it” and the applicant replied, “I know her. She was with me”.
	
	
	Constable Shaw gave evidence that there was a strong smell of alcohol on the applicant’s breath and that he appeared to be in shock, not grasping the severity of the situation.
	


Brian Joyce


	
	At 4.23am, paramedics Brian Joyce and Daniel Simpson arrived at the scene. Mr Joyce asked the applicant, who was standing with police, if he was involved in the crash or was a bystander. The applicant responded, “I was the driver”. This was the third admission relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	Mr Joyce assessed the applicant, including asking him what day, month and year it was. The applicant was unsure of the date. He scored 14 out of 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, a scale where 15 represents the highest level of consciousness, based on an assessment of motor responses, verbal responses and eye opening. Being affected by alcohol is irrelevant to the scale. Mr Joyce stated that he told police that the applicant seemed to be amnesiac about the event.
	


Cameron Marks   


	
	Mr Cameron Marks is an intensive care paramedic. He attended the scene of the crash, arriving separately to Mr Joyce and Mr Simpson. Shortly after Mr Joyce assessed the applicant, Mr Marks asked him some questions to assess his clinical condition. He gave evidence that the applicant was able to comply with his requests to, e.g., squeeze his hand. He said that the applicant was “a poor historian” and not able to understand what was happening or where he was going once he was put in the ambulance to go to the hospital.
	


Circumstantial evidence         


	
	The Crown relied upon six pieces of circumstantial evidence to support its case:
	



	
	the fact that the applicant was the registered owner of the car;
	
	
	a partial DNA profile matching the applicant was found on the gearstick;
	
	
	the car was found in 5th gear, meaning that it had been taken up through 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears, a matter of significance in light of the deceased’s inability to drive a manual car;
	
	
	the fact that the deceased was only ever licensed to drive an automatic car;
	
	
	the deceased’s blood alcohol content at the time of her death was 0.157 per 100 millilitres. Given her inexperience in driving a manual car, it was unlikely that she would attempt to put a manual car in motion in circumstances where the car was not hers, it was 3 or 4am and at a time when she had drunk so much alcohol as to be in the high range of prescribed concentration of alcohol; and
	
	
	the fact that a woman’s shoe and clutch handbag were found in the footwell of the passenger seat of the vehicle.
	


The defence case


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at trial. The statement he gave to police 30 days after the crash was tendered in which he stated he had no recollection of whether he was the driver of the car on the night of the crash.
	
	
	The defence relied upon three pieces of evidence in particular:
	



	
	that all but one of the applicant’s injuries were to the left (passenger) side of his body;
	
	
	that he was found by Mr Sharkey to be lying on the grass on the passenger side of the vehicle; and
	
	
	that the blood on the interior passenger-side of the windscreen had the same DNA profile as the applicant.
	



	
	Regarding the three admissions said to have been made by the applicant, the defence contended that anything said by him in the immediate aftermath of the crash was unreliable because of the combined effects of his blood-alcohol level, the injuries he suffered as a result of the crash, and shock.
	
	
	Senior Counsel then appearing for the applicant submitted at trial that Mr Lala’s evidence was so unreliable that it could not be accepted. It was also submitted that the inconsistencies in the interactions between the applicant and those attending the scene of the accident made any admission totally unreliable.
	
	
	The defence also relied on the expert evidence of a neurologist, Professor Brew. Professor Brew did not examine the applicant. He expressed the opinion that because of the applicant’s blood-alcohol concentration and his head injury, his memory of the events would have been impaired.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Professor Brew agreed that:
	



	
	although affected by alcohol the applicant may still have been oriented in time and place and “be giving responsive answers to questions”;
	
	
	the use of the word “incriminate” by the applicant in the conversation with Constable Doroszuk shows a particular reasoning process, and that the applicant was thinking about the consequences when answering the question. The applicant was “alive to what he is being asked”’;
	
	
	it was possible that the applicant’s answers of “I don’t know” and “I don’t remember” were calculated to avoid answering the question by the police officer;
	
	
	the applicant’s answer to Mr Joyce that “he was the driver of the vehicle” was responsive to the question asked and “there was no way he was hedging when he gave that one [answer]”.
	


Grounds 1 – 5


	
	Grounds 1 to 5 of the appeal concern the adducing of evidence about various representations made by the applicant. These provided:
	


“1.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecution adducing evidence of representations said to have been made by the Appellant to Constable Doroszuk. The evidence of those representations was inadmissible and/or ought to have been excluded in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion;

2.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecution adducing evidence of representations said to have been made by the Appellant to Constable Curle. The evidence of those representations was inadmissible and/or ought to have been excluded in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion;

3.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecution adducing evidence of representations said to have been made by the Appellant to Constable Shaw. The evidence of those representations was inadmissible and/or ought to have been excluded in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion;

4.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecution adducing evidence of representations said to have been made by the Appellant to Ambulance Officer Joyce. The evidence of those representations was inadmissible and/or ought to have been excluded in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion;

5.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecution adducing evidence of representations said to have been made by the Appellant to Ambulance Officer Marks. The evidence of those representations was inadmissible and/or ought to have been excluded in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion.”

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant advanced three arguments as to why the representations the subject of appeal grounds 1 – 5 were inadmissible.
	
	
	First, the applicant submitted that all of the representations made to the police constitute admissions, and should have been excluded under s 85 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Section 85 provides:
	


(1)    This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:

(a)   to, or in the presence of, an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence, or

(b)    as a result of an act of another person who was, and who the defendant knew or reasonably believed to be, capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

(2)    Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

(3)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:

(a)    any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and

(b)    if the admission was made in response to questioning:

(i)    the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and

(ii)    the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.


	
	The following definitions in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act are also relevant:
	


Admission means a previous representation that is:

(a)    made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and

(b)    adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding.

Previous representation means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced.

Representation includes:

(a)    an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing), or

(b)    a representation to be inferred from conduct, or

(c)   a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or

(d)    a representation that for any reason is not communicated.


	
	The applicant noted that the Crown relied on the representation to Constable Curle as an admission. He submitted that the other representations also constituted admissions for the purpose of s 85, as the Crown argued that the applicant’s denials to Constable Doroszuk and Constable Shaw were deliberate lies to avoid admitting he was the driver and thus adverse to his interest; relying on R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426, which was later applied in R v Kaddour (2005) 156 A Crim R 11; [2005] NSWCCA 303.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that these representations were made in circumstances which made it likely that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected; specifically, that the applicant had been unconscious in the immediate aftermath of the crash, had an apparent head injury, appeared to be in shock, was affected by alcohol, appeared to be disoriented and gave inconsistent answers in a short time frame (including in the course of the conversation giving rise to the admission to Constable Curle). The applicant submitted that the evidence of Professor Brew that the applicant’s mental state was not normal in the course of this conversation also indicates that the admissions are unreliable.
	
	
	The applicant also emphasised that the questions asked by Constable Curle were accusative and that the Constable did not caution the applicant.
	
	
	Secondly, the applicant submitted that if the statements were not inadmissible under s 85, then they should be excluded under s 138(1)(a) as they were improperly obtained. This is because the statements were made by the applicant at a time when, for the purposes of s 139, he was under arrest, and none of the police officers cautioned him in accordance with s 139(1)(c). Section 138 of the Evidence Act provides:
	


(1)    Evidence that was obtained:

(a)    improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b)    in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2)    Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:

(a)    did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

(b)    made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a)    the probative value of the evidence, and

(b)    the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c)    the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d)   the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e)    whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f)    whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

(g)    whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h)    the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.


	
	Section 139 of the Evidence Act provides:
	


(1)    For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:

(a)    the person was under arrest for an offence at the time, and

(b)    the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who was at the time empowered, because of the office that he or she held, to arrest the person, and

(c)    before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.

(2)    For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if:

(a)    the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who did not have the power to arrest the person, and

(b)    the statement was made, or the act was done, after the investigating official formed a belief that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence, and

(c)    the investigating official did not, before the statement was made or the act was done, caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.

(3)    The caution must be given in, or translated into, a language in which the person is able to communicate with reasonable fluency, but need not be given in writing unless the person cannot hear adequately.

(4)    Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not apply so far as any Australian law requires the person to answer questions put by, or do things required by, the investigating official.

(5)    A reference in subsection (1) to a person who is under arrest includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an investigating official for the purpose of being questioned, if:

(a)    the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence that is to be the subject of the questioning, or

(b)    the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished to do so, or

(c)    the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing that the person would not be allowed to leave if he or she wished to do so.

(6)    A person is not treated as being under arrest only because of subsection (5) if:

(a)    the official is performing functions in relation to persons or goods entering or leaving Australia and the official does not believe the person has committed an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or

(b)    the official is exercising a power under an Australian law to detain and search the person or to require the person to provide information or to answer questions.


	
	The applicant submitted that the evidence at trial established that each of the police officers must have either believed there was sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant was criminally involved in the crash (s 139(5)(a)), or would not have allowed him to leave if he wished to do so (s 139(5)(b)). Constable Doroszuk accepted that she was concerned the applicant was a “flight risk”. Constable Curle accepted that he stayed with the applicant before speaking with him, presumably, the applicant submitted, to prevent him from leaving the scene. It was submitted that the nature of Constable Curle’s questions, including the use of questions like “You were driving?”, were accusatory and demonstrated that he believed there was sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant was criminally involved in the crash.
	
	
	The applicant was formally arrested at the conclusion of his conversation with Constable Curle and was therefore under arrest when speaking with Constable Shaw. At no point at the scene was the applicant cautioned or told under what power the police could ask questions of him.
	
	
	On appeal, the Crown identified ss 11 and 14(1) of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW) and s 177 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW), which respectively empower a police officer to request that a person disclose their identity, the identity of a passenger in a car and give the name and address of the driver of a car. 
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the questions asked of him after the crash went beyond the identity of the occupants of the car. Further, it was submitted that the police did not explain the reason for requesting that information (as they are required to do under s 201 of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act).
	
	
	The applicant further submitted that it was improper for the police to question the applicant when he had been observed to be affected by alcohol, he had just minutes prior been involved in the crash and he was confused and disoriented.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the desirability of admitting this evidence did not outweigh the undesirability of admitting the evidence given the way it was obtained, taking into account the prescribed factors in s 138(3):
	



	
	the proceedings involved a very serious offence, with a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment;
	
	
	the probative value of the admission said to be made to Constable Curle was, if accepted as reliable, significant. However, the statements made to Constables Doroszuk and Shaw were not as significant;
	
	
	it is a grave impropriety to fail to caution a person suspected of being involved in a serious criminal offence;
	
	
	there would have been no difficulty in any of the officers cautioning the applicant before asking him questions.
	



	
	On this basis, the applicant submitted that the evidence should have been excluded under s 138.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant submitted that even if the evidence was admissible after a consideration of s 85 and s 138, the representations to Constable Doroszuk, Constable Shaw, and those said to be made to the ambulance officers Mr Marks and Mr Joyce, were inadmissible by reason of s 137, i.e., that the probative value of the admissions was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that there was a real risk that the jury might have used the evidence for an improper purpose, namely to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt on the part of the applicant. Further, this reasoning was forbidden in relation to the applicant’s statements to Constable Doroszuk by reason of s 89 of the Evidence Act, which provides that evidence of silence cannot be used to draw an unfavourable inference.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the risk of unfair prejudice to him regarding the admission said to be made to Mr Joyce was particularly significant given that his evidence was not given in direct speech. This left open the possibility that Mr Joyce had misinterpreted the words said by the applicant, particularly given that Mr Joyce had asked the applicant if he was involved in the accident or a bystander, not whether he was the driver of the car and that Mr Marks, who spoke with the applicant shortly after Mr Joyce, gave evidence that the applicant was confused and a “poor historian”.
	
	
	The applicant did not advance an appeal ground directed to the evidence of Mr Lala. The applicant asserted that this evidence was not relied upon by the Crown at trial. On appeal, the Crown indicated that Mr Lala’s evidence was relied upon as an admission. At the hearing, the applicant indicated that if necessary leave was sought to add a ground in the same terms as grounds 1 to 5 dealing with the representations made to Mr Lala. It was submitted that, while ordinarily evidence is taken at its highest, Mr Lala’s evidence was so incredible that it was not relevant: IMM v The Queen (2016) 257 CLR 300; [2016] HCA 14 per French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ at [54], [58].
	
	
	In oral submissions in this Court, the applicant submitted that the failure of counsel at trial to object to the admissibility of these representations (on any of the grounds identified above) stemmed from the Crown’s failure to articulate which of the statements were admissions, and what use was to be made of the remaining representations.
	
	
	On the hypothesis that the admissions and representations made to the police officers were inadmissible under either s 85 or s 138 and in fact not admitted, it was submitted that the admission made to Mr Joyce should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act, as the jury would not have had the benefit of the other representations to assess the reliability of the admission. It was submitted that there would have been no forensic advantage to the applicant at trial to have allowed evidence of all the representations to be adduced, particularly inadmissible representations, just to illustrate the context of the one admission made to Mr Joyce.
	


Crown submissions


	
	Regarding admissibility under s 85, the Crown accepted that the applicant’s statement made to Constable Curle was an admission, and submitted that it was made in circumstances that were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s statements to Constables Doroszuk and Shaw were not admissions. It has been doubted whether exculpatory statements may properly be classified as admissions within the meaning of the Evidence Act: Kelly v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 216; [2004] HCA 12; The Queen v GH (2000) 105 FCR 419; [2000] FCA 1618.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s statement to Constable Doroszuk was admissible to demonstrate that the applicant was conscious, able to recognise a police officer and apparently capable of cogent thought.
	
	
	As to the s 138 issue, the Crown submitted that none of the statements taken were improperly obtained and therefore they were not liable to be excluded by reason of this section. In particular, the Crown argued that the statements said to have been made to Constables Doroszuk and Curle were not made when the applicant was “under arrest” (s 139(5)) or in the course of “questioning” (s 139(1)). The Crown relied on R v Naa (2009) 76 NSWLR 271; [2009] NSWSC 851, in which Howie J considered the meaning of “questioning” under s 139(1). His Honour said:
	


“[98] The first question is whether the section applies to the situation in which the police were involved. It depends upon whether the police were engaged in “questioning” the accused. The word is not defined in the Act. In general parlance it means “asking questions of someone” or “interrogating”. I do not believe that the word means “a conversation during which questions are asked”. Clearly to my mind the section was aimed at formal or informal interrogation of a suspect by a police officer for the purpose of the officer obtaining information, whether or not at the time of the interrogation the suspect was formally under arrest.”


	
	With regards to Constable Doroszuk, the Crown submitted that her evidence that she thought the applicant was a flight risk did not support the inference that she would not have allowed the applicant to leave, and therefore that he was under arrest. The nature of the conversation between the applicant and Constable Doroszuk was a police officer trying to find out who the applicant was and whether he needed help, not questioning the applicant as a suspect.
	
	
	It was submitted that Constable Curle asked repetitive, but neutral, questions of the applicant, which did not establish that he believed the applicant had committed an offence. This was reflected in the fact that Constable Curle did not arrest the applicant until after he had admitted he was driving.
	
	
	It was submitted that if this Court was persuaded that these statements were improperly obtained, the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting improperly obtained evidence.
	
	
	Regarding the applicant’s s 137 objections to the statements, the Crown submitted that Constable Doroszuk’s evidence had significant probative value as it indicated that the applicant was sufficiently poised and cognitively competent to assert his right to silence. Thus the danger that the jury may have drawn an adverse inference from his exercising his right to silence, particularly since the trial judge gave directions about that, did not outweigh its probative value. Constable Shaw’s evidence was only relied upon to show that the applicant knew what was going on. Since it was not used to support consciousness of guilt reasoning, there was no risk of unfair prejudice to the applicant. The evidence given by Mr Marks demonstrated that the applicant could follow instructions. There was no real danger that the jury would misuse that evidence.
	
	
	As to the admission made to Mr Joyce, the Crown submitted that the reliability of the applicant’s admissions was the main issue at trial, and the jury had the benefit of expert evidence, Senior Counsel’s closing address and the trial judge’s directions. The fact that the evidence was initially given in indirect speech is not relevant. No objection was made to the evidence by experienced counsel. Mr Joyce’s evidence in cross-examination was given in direct speech. There was no danger that his evidence would have been misused in the way asserted by the applicant.
	


Consideration of grounds 1 – 5


	
	None of the evidence the subject of grounds 1-5 of the notice of appeal was objected to by Senior Counsel who appeared for the applicant at trial.
	
	
	Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides:
	


4    No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground of appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.


	
	The applicant’s submission that the Crown was obliged to identify all of the ways under the Evidence Act in which the evidence was admissible should be rejected. A feature of the adversarial criminal justice system is that in a case where both parties are competently represented, absent objection by the defendant or in response to an enquiry from the bench, the Crown is not required to identify the technical basis for the admission of all of its evidence under the Evidence Act at the outset of the trial. Evidence which is “not admissible” under the Evidence Act is to be construed as “not admissible over objection”: Perish v R (2016) 92 NSWLR 161; [2016] NSWCCA 89 at [261]-[271]. The trial judge was, subject of course to ensuring a fair trial according to law (Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 at 117-8), under no obligation to reject evidence where no objection was taken and the defendant was legally represented. This is particularly so where, as here, the applicant was represented by Senior Counsel with long experience in criminal matters. 
	
	
	We will return to this issue in the context of Rule 4 after addressing the objections made on this appeal to the admissibility of those pieces of evidence.
	


Section 85 of the Evidence Act – representations to the police


	
	It was the applicant’s argument that a miscarriage of justice occurred because the representations made by the applicant to Constables Doroszuk, Curle and Shaw were inadmissible by reason of s 85 of the Evidence Act, on the hypothesis that Senior Counsel for the applicant at trial had objected to that evidence.
	
	
	There was little dispute between the parties on the appeal about the relevant principles which govern this issue. Rather, the dispute was about the application of the relevant principles. Section 85 is concerned with two important concepts; the circumstances in which an admission is made and the likely effect of those circumstances upon the truth of the admission.
	
	
	The question posed by s 85 is the unlikelihood, or otherwise, that the circumstances in which the admission was made adversely affected the truth of the admission: R v Douglas [2000] NSWCCA 275 (Mason P, Sully and Sperling JJ agreeing). Whether an admission was in fact made or whether an admission was actually true or untrue are matters for the tribunal of fact (unless the defence raises truth or untruth as an issue): s 189(3), see R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442; (1998) 105 A Crim R 27; R v Ul-Haque (2007) 177 A Crim R 348; [2007] NSWSC 1251 at [102].
	
	
	Section 85(3) makes it clear that the range of circumstances relevant for the purposes of s 85(2) include the physical and mental characteristics of the interviewee: R v Clarke (1997) 123 A Crim R 506; [2001] NSWCCA 494; R v Phan (2001) 35 NSWLR 480; (2001) 123 A Crim R 30; [2001] NSWCCA 29.
	
	
	All three previous representations made to the police contained admissions that, at least in part, were “adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding” and thus s 85(1)(a) was satisfied (there being no dispute about the other elements of s 85(1)(a)).
	
	
	So far as the representations made to Constable Doroszuk was concerned, the following answer amounted to an admission for the purposes of s 85:
	


“I’m not going to say anything. I’m not going to incriminate myself.”


	
	This is because that evidence was a previous representation adverse to the applicant’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding as it was evidence of an implied representation available to the Crown to demonstrate awareness and cogency of the applicant’s state of mind at about the time he made admissions to persons other than the police.
	
	
	So far as Constable Curle is concerned, the following evidence amounts to an admission for the purposes of s 85:
	


“Curle:    You were driving?

Applicant:   No

Curle:       You sure?

Applicant:    I don’t know.

Curle:       Were you or not?

Applicant:    Yes

Curle:       where was she?

Applicant:   I don’t know, she wasn’t in my car.

Curle:       Well where was she then, tell me?

Applicant:    I don’t know.

Curle:       Have you been drinking?

Applicant:    Yes

Curle:       How much?

Applicant:    A fair bit.”


	
	Everything from the second question and answer was plainly adverse to the applicant’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding as it went directly to the critical issue. The admissions (both direct and indirect oral representations) are only understandable in the light of the first question and answer which contained the only evidence available to the applicant of an express denial that he had been the driver.
	
	
	So far as the evidence of Constable Shaw is concerned, the following representations were admissions for the purposes of s 85:
	


“Shaw:    What happened to her?,

Applicant:    I know her, I was with her earlier.

Shaw:    We need to know what happened to her.

Applicant:    I was with her earlier.

Shaw:    Mate, look at her. She’s dead. She was either in the car or you hit her with it

Applicant:    I know her. She was with me.”


	
	That evidence was a previous representation adverse to the applicant’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding as it was evidence of implied representations available to the Crown which tended, at least arguably, to suggest that the applicant was sufficiently aware of his position at the relevant time to give responsive answers to questions. This was a subsidiary but very important issue in the case. A determination that he was responsive in answer to questions was a conclusion adverse to the applicant’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding.
	
	
	On the hypothesis we are addressing (all the other possible preliminary hurdles to a successful objection being satisfied here), the relevant question is whether the Crown proved that the circumstances in which the admissions were made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected within the meaning of s 85(2) as amplified by s 85(3).
	
	
	No miscarriage of justice can be shown so far as admission of these representations under s 85 of the Evidence Act is concerned. While the circumstances to be taken into account included the applicant’s level of intoxication, the evidence of at least one of the ambulance officers of a degree of disorientation, Professor Brew’s initial opinion and the undoubted shock the applicant felt as a result of the crash and its aftermath, the circumstances in which the admissions were made as a whole persuade us that the Crown demonstrated that it is unlikely that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected. That is for these reasons:
	



	
	the relevant events took place over a few minutes in the immediate aftermath of the crash. The answers given by the applicant to the police demonstrated a sufficient degree of awareness in his surroundings and the need to protect his legal interests to make it unlikely that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected;
	
	
	the nature of the police questioning was neither threatening nor persistent. No promises or inducements were held out;
	
	
	the applicant was able to understand and respond to the various other people he spoke to in the few minutes after the crash;
	
	
	some of the applicant’s responses to the police, in particular that he did not wish to incriminate himself, demonstrated a degree of sophisticated reasoning and an understanding of his position. Professor’s Brew’s evidence in cross-examination set out at [28] above, illustrates that this answer in particular, given in this very short time period, tended to demonstrate that the applicant was “alive to what he is being asked”, making it likely that the truth of the admissions was not adversely affected;
	
	
	the applicant was oriented to time and place;
	
	
	the applicant was assessed as stable by the ambulance officers and scored 14 out of 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale; [see above at [20]]
	
	
	the applicant’s admission to Constable Curle is consistent with what he said immediately prior to Mr Lala and immediately after to Mr Joyce.
	



	
	For these reasons the admissions made by the applicant to the police were not inadmissible under s 85 of the Evidence Act.
	


Section 138 of the Evidence Act - representations to the police


	
	As to the second basis on which the applicant challenged the admissibility of representations he made to the police officers, in our view none of the representations should have been excluded by reason of s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	While this issue was not explored at trial (and thus the Crown lost an opportunity to lead evidence directly about the relevant issues under this section and s 139), it is likely, subject to an argument raised by the Crown and not addressed below, that s 139(5)(b) of the Evidence Act was satisfied here. On the evidence that is available, and for the purpose of addressing the hypothesis that a miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the failure of Senior Counsel for the applicant before the trial judge to object to the evidence, we would infer that the police would not have let the applicant leave and he was thus deemed to be under arrest under s 139(5)(b). We do not accept that the applicant was not subject to “questioning” for the purposes of s 139. In this regard what Howie J said in Naa, which was relied upon by the Crown, is distinguishable as the following passage makes clear:
	


“[101] I do not believe that the conversation between officer McCarthy and the accused amounted to “questioning” for the purpose of s 139. The questions asked by McCarthy were completely incidental to what she was trying to achieve: to convince the accused to put down the weapons for the safety of himself and others. She was not seeking information from him. She was seeking to distract him, to mollify him and ultimately to persuade him to disarm. No bystander watching the incident would have considered that the officer was questioning the accused. The section was never intended to apply to a siege situation where the police were involved in negotiation rather than investigation.” (italics added)


	
	We would regard the questions asked by the police here as meeting the description of “questioning” within the meaning of s 139. Thus, subject to the issue raised by the Crown on the appeal addressed immediately below, s 139(5)(b) of the Evidence Act was satisfied here.
	
	
	The issue raised by the Crown on this appeal, adverted to above, concerns the police exercising powers under ss 11 and 14(1) of the Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibilities Act 2002 (NSW) and s 177 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW). Those provisions should be set out in full:
	


Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 

11 Identity may be required to be disclosed

(1)    A police officer may require a person whose identity is unknown to the officer to disclose his or her identity if the officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person may be able to assist in the investigation of an alleged indictable offence because the person was at or near the place where the alleged indictable offence occurred, whether before, when, or soon after it occurred.

(2)    A police officer may require a person whose identity is unknown to the officer to disclose his or her identity if the officer proposes to give a direction to the person in accordance with Part 14 for the person to leave a place.

14 Power of police officer to require disclosure of driver or passenger identity

(1) A police officer who suspects on reasonable grounds that a vehicle is being, or was, or may have been used in or in connection with an indictable offence may do any one or more of the following:

(a)    require the driver of the vehicle to disclose his or her identity and the identity of any driver of, or passenger in or on, the vehicle at or about the time the vehicle was or may have been so used or at or about the time the vehicle last stopped before the requirement was made or a direction was given to stop the vehicle,

(b)    require any passenger in or on the vehicle to disclose his or her identity and the identity of the driver of, or any other passenger in or on, the vehicle at or about the time the vehicle was or may have been so used or at or about the time the vehicle last stopped before the requirement was made or a direction was given to stop the vehicle,

(c)    require any owner of the vehicle (who was or was not the driver or a passenger) to disclose the identity of the driver of, and any passenger in or on, the vehicle at or about the time the vehicle was or may have been so used or at or about the time the vehicle last stopped before the requirement was made or a direction was given to stop the vehicle.

Road Transport Act 2013 

177 Requirement for responsible person to disclose driver identity

(1)    If the driver of a motor vehicle is alleged to have committed an offence against the road transport legislation:

(a)    the responsible person for the vehicle, or the person having the custody of the vehicle, must, when required to do so by an authorised officer, immediately give information (which must, if so required, be given in the form of a written statement signed by the responsible person) as to the name and home address of the driver, and

(b)    any other person must, if required to do so by an authorised officer, give any information that it is in the person’s power to give and that may lead to the identification of the driver.

Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.


	
	It was permissible under these provisions, subject only to the requirements of s 201 of Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act, for all but two of the questions asked by the three police officers here in issue to be asked. Those questions each went to matters specifically addressed by ss 11 and 14(1) of the Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibilities Act 2002 (NSW) and s 177 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW).
	
	
	The sole exception is the following two questions and answers which immediately preceded the applicant’s formal arrest.
	


“Curle:    Have you been drinking?

Applicant:    Yes

Curle:       How much?

Applicant:    A fair bit.

Curle:       You are under arrest for blood and urine sample.

Applicant:    Okay.”


	
	If objection had been taken to these questions and answers, or the admissibility of this limited evidence were controversial on this appeal, difficult questions may arise, however on the appeal it was common ground that the applicant was intoxicated at the time of the accident so nothing turns on these questions being asked prior to arrest in the absence of specific statutory authority.
	
	
	Other than in the respects just addressed, the questions asked by the police of the applicant after the accident did not go beyond seeking to establish the identity of the driver and passenger of the car.
	
	
	Accordingly, by reason of s 139(6) of the Evidence Act, the applicant was not treated as under arrest only by reason of s 139(5) as (subject only to the requirements of s 201 of Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act) the police were at the relevant time exercising a power under an Australian law to require a person to provide information or to answer questions.
	
	
	The extent to which compliance with s 201 of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act as it appeared at the time was a necessary precondition to exercise of the powers in ss 11 and 14 Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act and s 177 of the Road Transport Act, as was submitted by the applicant, was controversial. Section 201 of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act as it appeared at the time provided:
	


201 Supplying police officer’s details and giving warnings

(1)    A police officer must provide the person subject to the exercise of a power referred to in subsection (3) with the following:

(a)    evidence that the police officer is a police officer (unless the police officer is in uniform),

(b)    the name of the police officer and his or her place of duty,

(c)    the reason for the exercise of the power.

(d)     (Repealed)

(2)    A police officer must comply with subsection (1) in relation to a power referred to in subsection (3) (other than subsection (3) (g), (i) or (j)):

(a)    if it is practicable to do so, before or at the time of exercising the power, or

(b)    if it is not practicable to do so before or at that time, as soon as is reasonably practicable after exercising the power.

(2A)    A police officer must comply with subsection (1) in relation to a power referred to in subsection (3) (g), (i) or (j) before exercising the power, except as otherwise provided by subsection (2B).

(2B)    If a police officer is exercising a power to give a direction to a person (as referred to in subsection (3) (i)) by giving the direction to a group of 2 or more persons, the police officer must comply with subsection (1) in relation to the power:

(a)    if it is practicable to do so, before or at the time of exercising the power, or

(b)    if it is not practicable to do so, as soon as is reasonably practicable after exercising the power.

(2C)    If a police officer exercises a power that involves the making of a request or direction that a person is required to comply with by law, the police officer must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after making the request or direction, provide the person the subject of the request or direction with:

(a)    a warning that the person is required by law to comply with the request or direction (unless the person has already complied or is in the process of complying), and

(b)    if the person does not comply with the request or direction after being given that warning, and the police officer believes that the failure to comply by the person is an offence, a warning that the failure to comply with the request or direction is an offence.

(2D)    In addition, if a police officer exercises a power that involves the making of a direction under section 198 on the grounds that a person is intoxicated and disorderly in a public place, the police officer must provide the person the subject of the direction with a warning that it is an offence to be intoxicated and disorderly in that or any other public place at any time within 6 hours after the direction is given.

(3)    This section applies to the exercise of the following powers (whether or not conferred by or under this Act):

(a)    a power to search or arrest a person,

(b)    a power to search a vehicle, vessel or aircraft,

(c)    a power to enter premises (not being a public place),

(d)    a power to search premises (not being a public place),

(e)    a power to seize any property,

(f)    a power to stop or detain a person (other than a power to detain a person under Part 16) or a vehicle, vessel or aircraft,

(g)    a power to request a person to disclose his or her identity or the identity of another person (including a power to require the removal of a face covering for identification purposes),

(h)    a power to establish a crime scene at premises (not being a public place),

(i)    a power to give a direction to a person,

(j)    a power under section 21A to request a person to open his or her mouth or shake or move his or her hair,

(k)    a power under section 26 to request a person to submit to a frisk search or to produce a dangerous implement or metallic object.

(3AA)    Despite subsection (3), this section does not apply to the exercise of a power to enter premises or to search premises or a vehicle, vessel or aircraft that is conferred by a covert search warrant.

(3A)    If a police officer is exercising more than one power to which this section applies on a single occasion, and in relation to the same person, the police officer is required to comply with subsection (1) (a) and (b) in relation to that person only once on that occasion.

(4)    If 2 or more police officers are exercising a power to which this section applies, only one officer present is required to comply with this section.

(5)    However, if a person asks another police officer present for information as to the name of the police officer and his or her place of duty, the police officer must give to the person the information requested.

(6)    This section does not apply to the exercise of a power that is conferred by an Act or regulation specified in Schedule 1.


	
	The obligation in most cases on the police is to “provide the person” with the three matters in s 201(1) “if it is practicable to do so before or at the time of exercising the power”: s 201(2)(a). We accept that the powers under consideration on this appeal meet the description in s 201(3)(g) and thus compliance with s 201(1) was required “before exercising the power”: s 201(2A).
	
	
	Each of these officers was in uniform. Section 201(1)(a) is thus satisfied. The police officers may have had name tags, although there was no specific evidence of this. Section 201(1)(b) may or may not have been satisfied. It seems, before or at the time of exercising the power, the police did not specifically provide the applicant with “the reason” for the exercise of the power. Constable Doroszuk, however, the first officer to interact with the applicant, introduced herself to the applicant asked if he was involved in the car crash. That was the reason for the exercise of the power, although it may be correct that the information was insufficient to “provide” the applicant with the reason for the exercise of the power.
	
	
	With considerable hesitation, given that the issue was not litigated at the trial and the substance of any evidence the Crown may have called relevant to the issue is not known, we have concluded on the assumptions necessary to address grounds of appeal 1-5, that there was a breach of s 201(1) and (2A) of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act, in the police officers seeking to exercise their powers under ss 11 and 14 of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act and s 177 of the Road Transport Act. Thus s 139(6) of the Evidence Act did not affect the operation of the provisions of s 139(5) and the applicant was under arrest at the time the admissions were made to the police officers.
	
	
	We have nonetheless concluded that, on the assumption favourable to the applicant that the admissions made to the police were improperly obtained within the meaning of ss 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act as s 201(1) and (2A) had not been complied with prior to him being asked questions, the correct exercise of discretion under s 138(1)(b) of the Evidence Act would be to permit the evidence to be given.
	
	
	In this case, the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting improperly obtained evidence. This is because:
	



	
	the offence was extremely serious and the relevant evidence was of great significance in the trial, going to the sole issue in dispute: s 139(3)(a)-(c);
	
	
	the three police officers each effectively asked the applicant his name, whether and in what capacity he was involved in the accident and whether he had been drinking. They were entitled to do so under ss 11 and 14 of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act and s 177 of the Road Transport Act, subject only to the requirements of s 201 of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act. The non- compliance with the matters required by s 201(1)(c) and perhaps s 201(1)(b) of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act as it appeared at the time was apparently inadvertent (there being no reason to think that identification of the matters in s 201(1)(c) and s 201(1)(b) of the Law Enforcement Powers and Enforcement Act went beyond what was otherwise completely obvious to the applicant in the circumstances at the scene of the collision on that morning) and, in any event, the improper conduct was very much at the lower end of the scale:  s139(3)(d)-(g).
	



	
	No miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of the admission of these representations, having regard to s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	


Section 137 of the Evidence Act- police evidence


	
	As to the third basis on which the applicant challenged the admissibility of representations he made to the police officers, none of the representations were liable to be excluded by reason of s 137 of the Evidence Act:
	



	
	Constable Doroszuk’s evidence had significant probative value as it indicated that the applicant was sufficiently poised and competent to assert his right to silence. Thus the danger that the jury may have drawn an adverse inference from his exercising his right to silence, particularly since the trial judge gave directions about that, did not outweigh its probative value;
	
	
	Constable Shaw’s evidence was only relied upon to show that the applicant knew what was going on. Since it was not used to support consciousness of guilt reasoning, there was no risk of unfair prejudice to the applicant;
	
	
	Constable Curle’s evidence was highly probative about the critical issue in the case. There was no danger that the jury would misuse that evidence.
	



	
	No miscarriage of justice can be shown so far as admission of these representations under s 137 of the Evidence Act is concerned.
	


Section 137 Evidence Act- Mr Lala’s evidence


	
	In our view, Mr Lala’s evidence was admissible. It was not so lacking in credibility that it could be put to one side: IMM v The Queen.
	
	
	While it was true that there were aspects of the evidence which were inconsistent with the other witnesses, in particular his evidence that he saw the applicant leaving the car via the driver’s side door, whether to accept some or all of Mr Lala’s evidence was a jury issue.
	
	
	Taken at its highest, as it must be for these purposes, Mr Lala’s evidence of his conversation with the applicant was highly probative. There was no significant prejudice which could not be cured by jury direction. Adequate directions were given in this case to ensure that the jury did not misuse the evidence of Mr Lala.
	
	
	No miscarriage of justice can be shown by reason of admission of these representations having regard to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	


Ambulance Officer Joyce’s evidence


	
	Mr Joyce’s evidence was highly significant in the trial. At 4.23am, only a few minutes after the crash, Mr Joyce spoke to the applicant and asked if he was involved in the crash or was a bystander. The applicant responded, “I was the driver”.
	
	
	This was a clear and unequivocal contemporaneous admission made to a person who was not a police officer or an investigator in answer to an open ended question. It was highly probative about the main issue in the case.
	
	
	The applicant’s submission that this evidence would not have been admissible if objection had been taken under s 137 should be rejected. Even if, contrary to this conclusion, the trial judge had been persuaded to reject the evidence of the police officers, it is clear that the admission made to Mr Joyce by the applicant was admissible. There was no realistic prospect of misuse of this evidence by the jury, even in that circumstance. The reliability of the applicant’s admissions was squarely addressed at the trial and the jury had the benefit of expert evidence, Senior Counsel’s closing address and the trial judge’s directions.
	
	
	The fact that the evidence was initially given in indirect speech is also irrelevant as Mr Joyce’s evidence in cross-examination was given in direct speech. Had objection been taken to Mr Joyce’s evidence it would have been admissible.
	
	
	No miscarriage of justice can be shown by reason of the admission of this representation having regard to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	


Application of Rule 4 to grounds 1-5


	
	In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ summarised the relevant authorities regarding the effect of Rule 4 and observed the following at [148]:
	


“… the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4:

The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA  [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The applicant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].”


	
	In the present case, very experienced Senior Counsel did not object at trial to any of the evidence the subject of grounds 1-5. There was a rational basis for that decision. That basis was that the evidence was admissible.
	
	
	Even if, contrary to the conclusions we have reached, in the exercise of discretion, the trial judge could have been convinced to reject some or all of the evidence of the police officers, the evidence of Ambulance Officer Joyce was clearly admissible. Senior Counsel for the applicant at trial made a legitimate forensic choice not to object to any of the representations to attempt to engender, by all of the evidence, a reasonable doubt in the reliability of the applicant’s admission to Ambulance Officer Joyce. Absent the context provided by the police evidence, that would have been an even more forensically challenging exercise for the applicant’s counsel at trial.
	
	
	For the reasons given in relation to each of the separate complaints made about the evidence at the trial, we are of the view that if objection had been taken, each of those pieces of evidence would have been admissible. In any event, it was clearly a legitimate forensic choice open to Senior Counsel for the applicant to conclude that, given that the jury would certainly hear the applicant’s unequivocal admission made to Mr Joyce, the better course was not to object to the police evidence, or that of Mr Lala, and seek to demonstrate to the jury that the applicant was confused and thus an unreliable reporter about the critical issue in the case.
	
	
	We are not satisfied that the applicant has lost either a real chance or a chance fairly open of being acquitted at trial by reason of the matters raised in grounds 1-5. No miscarriage of justice can be shown by reason of the admission of these representations. Accordingly, leave to rely upon grounds 1- 5 under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused.
	


Grounds 6 and 8


	
	Grounds 6 and 8 concern the conduct of the prosecutor in allegedly misusing the representations referred to in grounds 1 to 5, and stated:
	


“6.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecution inviting the jury to reason that the representations said to have been made by the Appellant to Constable Doroszuk (to the effect that he did not wish to say anything and that he would not say that he was the driver of the Corolla or incriminate himself) were evidence of a consciousness of guilt;

…

8.    A miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the prosecutor’s cross-examination of Professor Brew and his closing address which suggested that certain representations said to have been made by the Appellant were calculated to avoid incriminating himself and thereby invited the jury to reason the representations were evidence of a consciousness of guilt.”

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown invited the jury to reason impermissibly from the representations made to Constable Doroszuk and others which denied or prevaricated about whether he was the driver of the vehicle were, in effect, representations made out of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	The applicant drew particular attention to the Crown’s use of the evidence that the applicant had denied or prevaricated about whether he was the driver and the cross-examination of Professor Brew.
	
	
	Particularly regarding the representations made to Constable Doroszuk, the applicant emphasised that the Crown invited the jury to “note these things”, despite the applicant’s exercising of the right to silence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the representations were not capable of being relied on as establishing a consciousness of guilt. This is because a representation can only be relied on for consciousness of guilt reasoning if it is capable of being established to be a lie by some evidence independent of proof of guilt of the offence (Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193; [1993] HCA 63), and that could not be done in this case.
	


Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that when the entirety of the Crown address about the witnesses Constable Doroszuk, Constable Shaw and Mr Marks is considered, it is apparent that the only way in which the Crown sought to rely on their evidence was in relation to the reliability of the applicant’s representations. The Crown submitted that there was no invitation made to the jury to use that evidence as indicating a consciousness of guilt.
	


Consideration of grounds 6 and 8


	
	No complaint was made by Senior Counsel for the applicant at the trial about these matters. Accordingly, leave is required under Rule 4.
	
	
	Having considered the trial transcript referred to by the applicant, including the addresses of the Crown at trial and the cross-examination of Professor Brew, we have reached the conclusion that the only way in which the Crown sought to rely on the evidence of the witnesses Constable Doroszuk, Constable Shaw and Mr Marks and the expert Professor Brew, was in relation to the reliability of the applicant’s representations at the scene of the accident. The Crown did not invite the jury to use that evidence as consciousness of guilt. Rather, what the Crown was seeking to do was to address the reliability of the applicant’s answers by demonstrating that he was able to understand the questions being put to him and formulate coherent answers to particular questions.
	
	
	In considering these grounds, the absence of complaint by Senior Counsel at trial and the absence of any remarks on the subject by the experienced trial judge is significant. If the Crown at trial was relying on the applicant’s assertion of the right to silence as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the applicant’s counsel would have complained and it is also likely that the trial judge would have raised the issue with the parties. The absence of such complaint or suggestion indicates that in the atmosphere of the trial, neither Senior Counsel for the applicant nor the trial judge understood the Crown to be relying on the applicant’s assertion of the right to silence as evidence of consciousness of guilt. This accords with our conclusion having read the available material.
	
	
	We are not satisfied that the applicant has lost either a real chance or a chance fairly open of being acquitted at trial by reason of the matters raised in grounds 6 and 8.
	
	
	Leave to rely on those grounds should be refused under Rule 4.
	


Grounds 7, 9 and 10


	
	Grounds 7, 9 and 10 are a corollary of grounds 6 and 8, addressed to the trial judge’s summing up. No complaint was made by Senior Counsel for the applicant at trial about this aspect of the summing up and, accordingly, leave is required under Rule 4.
	
	
	Grounds 7, 9 and 10 state that the trial judge failed to give appropriate directions in light of the prosecution’s use of the representations said to have been made by the applicant. Those grounds provided:
	


“7.    The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they were not entitled to reason that the Appellant made the Doroszuk representations because of a consciousness of guilt;

…

9.    The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they were not entitled to reason that the Appellant made the Shaw representations or the Marks representations because of a consciousness of guilt;

10.    In the alternative to ground 9, if the prosecution were entitled to rely on those representations as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, the learned trial judge erred in failing to give an Edwards v The Queen (1993) 198 CLR 193 direction (or any direction at all as to lies).”


	
	The applicant identified three paragraphs in the trial judge’s summing up which illustrate, it was submitted, that consciousness of guilt reasoning was referred to by the Crown, but not the subject of specific directions:
	


“Mr Crown submitted to you that whenever the accused said something like, “I don’t know”, or “I don’t remember”, or “I’m not sure”, you have to consider the fact that on the one hand that may be a genuine response but on the other hand it may be a calculated response of his not to answer the question that has been put to him.

…

As to questions about whether he was the driver, the initial answer, “No”, it was submitted, coming as it did, after the conversation with Constable Doroszuk was, it was submitted, you might think simply a follow on from him not wanting to incriminate himself.

…

Mr Crown submitted to you that in dealing with Mr Marks, the accused appeared to understand what he was saying, he was obeying his questioning and doing what he was asking him to do… In relation to his answers about the mechanism of the incident, him saying he could not remember, Mr Crown submitted that that was a long time after, and whether or not [t]he accused at that stage was hedging his bets, or was in fact giving proper answers because at that point he was confused, the Crown could not say.”


	
	The applicant submitted that, given the manner in which the Crown relied on the representations, the absence of appropriate directions as to their use gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	


Consideration of Grounds 7, 9 and 10


	
	As we have earlier found, when the whole of the Crown’s closing address is considered, it is apparent that the Crown did not suggest that the applicant was lying, much less that he lied out of a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	None of the passages pointed to by the applicant, set out above, contain that suggestion. In the first passage, in context, the trial judge is addressing the jury about whether representations made by the applicant were sufficiently reliable to be taken into account. In the second passage, in context, the trial judge is addressing the ability of the applicant to understand and deal with the questions he is being asked. The third passage is, in context, addressing the evidence of Mr Marks, which was important to the case advanced on behalf of the applicant below about the unreliability of the answers he was giving to questions. The trial judge was not required to give an Edwards (or Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234; [2000] HCA 28) direction.
	
	
	Even if the view were taken that a possible reading of the three passages above demonstrated that an Edwards or Zoneff direction could be given, no such direction was sought by experienced trial counsel. There was good reason for Senior Counsel taking that course. Defence counsel’s address to the jury in this case is a powerful and cogent illustration of persuasive jury advocacy. The entire address focussed on the question of the unreliability of the representations made by the applicant and the dangers of too quickly rushing to convict her client. Perhaps the last thing, it may be inferred, that experienced defence counsel would want in the context of such an address is to have the trial judge give the jury a warning about what they must be satisfied of before finding that the applicant had lied and the use they could make of any lies they concluded had been told in reaching their decision. Such a warning, in the context where the Crown had not suggested that the jury should find that the applicant had lied at all, may have had very disadvantageous forensic consequences for the applicant’s case by directing the jury’s attention to the possibility that they should treat certain representations made by the applicant as lies.
	
	
	If the Crown had raised the possibility that the applicant had lied at the scene of the accident, Senior Counsel for the applicant at trial would have addressed that topic in her address, as no doubt would the trial judge. The failure of Senior Counsel to raise the issue seems to have been appropriate or, at the very least, an available forensic choice.
	
	
	Given the manner in which the Crown relied on the representations, the absence of an Edwards or Zoneff direction did not give rise to an arguable miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	We do not consider that leave should be granted to raise this ground of appeal as we are not persuaded that there was such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings.
	
	
	Leave to rely on grounds 7, 9 and10 should be refused.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	None of the matters agitated on this appeal had been the subject of objection or submission by Senior Counsel for the applicant at trial. Accordingly, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules posed a hurdle for those matters being considered on appeal. For the foregoing reasons, we are not satisfied that the applicant lost either a real chance or a chance fairly open of being acquitted at trial by reason of the any of the matters raised in grounds 1-10. No miscarriage of justice can be shown in relation to the admission of these representations.
	
	
	Accordingly, the order of the court is:
	


Leave to appeal refused.

		09 May 2017",2017-04-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
4574940,PH v R [2017] NSWCCA 79,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA:  I agree with Rothman J that this application for leave to appeal against sentence should be refused. I also agree with Button J’s additional comments in relation to proposed ground 3 and make the following further observations in relation to proposed grounds 1 and 2.
	
	
	These grounds complain that the sentencing judge did not make findings as to, and take into account as a mitigating factor, the applicant’s having been subjected to sexual abuse within his own family from when he was very young.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing and, in support of his submission that this matter should be taken into account, relied on a psychological assessment report prepared for the purpose of sentencing. Specifically, it was submitted that the fact of that sexual abuse provided an explanation which was relevant to an assessment of his moral culpability for the offending for which he was being sentenced. In the psychologist’s opinion that abuse “likely distorted his idea and understanding of sex and family relationships, increasing his risk of engaging in child sexual abuse”.
	
	
	In addressing this submission, the sentencing judge expressed concern as to the applicant’s “lack of honesty in his self-report to his psychologist” (ROS p 9). The applicant had not reported to the psychologist the earlier offences with which he had been charged in 1994 concerning his daughter and step-daughters from an earlier relationship. In addition the psychologist separately commented in her report (para 20) that she “questioned whether [PH] was distorting and/or exaggerating his adolescent sexual experiences”. As the sentencing judge also notes (ROS p 9), during the course of the sentencing hearing and when this submission was made, the fact of the applicant’s not having given evidence was raised with his counsel, clearly with reference to there being a concern as to his honesty and reliability in giving his history to the psychologist.
	
	
	Ultimately the sentencing judge did not make findings as to whether that sexual abuse had occurred as reported. Instead her Honour dealt with the applicant’s submission that it reduced his moral culpability on the assumption that the abuse had been as reported to the psychologist.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that PH had also reported to the psychologist that after the commission of the offences with which he was charged in 1994, he “contacted the police and told them that he had prior charges for sexual offending and [that he] was seeking support in managing with his daughters” (Report, para 41). The sentencing judge concluded, the relevant offences having occurred after the 1994 offences and after this acknowledgment by the applicant that he appreciated what he might subsequently do would be seriously wrong, that:
	


… the weight that I might give any connection between sexual offences upon him when he was a very young child would be not significant considering the seriousness of these offences (ROS p 11).


	
	The sentencing judge then proceeded to explain her assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability:
	


The offender’s moral culpability for the commission of these offences is therefore in my view high. The psychologist observes that the offender gave what he considered to be an explanation for the commission of these offences against his children. He told the psychologist that his motives for offending were not based on his need for sexual gratification but that he sexually abused his elder daughter on a regular basis in order, he said and I quote, “To protect her from the harm she may have had by engaging in sex with boys her own age”. The statement to the psychologist that he believed he was keeping his daughter virtuous by his sexual assaults upon her is perhaps evidence of his disordered or distorted thinking but also evidence of a significant abuse of power against this child and the other children. The psychologist confirms that the offender was well aware that his contact with his children was wrong and inappropriate. [PH] reported to the psychologist that he considered his conduct to be, “Hideous, disgusting and disgraceful”. Whether [PH] genuinely believed this to be the case or not the Court certainly concurs with the sentiments so expressed.


	
	The sentencing judge’s immediately following remarks are extracted by Rothman J at [40].
	
	
	In the way the sentencing judge dealt with the applicant’s submissions it was not necessary to make a finding as to the extent of any sexual abuse to which he was subject. Her Honour considered the potential significance of those events as reported in assessing his moral culpability and addressed the argument made on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	Accordingly, ground 2 is not made out and the absence of any finding, which is the foundation for ground 1, assumed no significance in the way the sentencing judge dealt with the applicant’s argument.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: On 12 November 2015, the District Court sentenced the Applicant, PH, to an aggregate non-parole period of 14 years’ imprisonment, commencing on 25 February 2014 and concluding on 24 February 2028, with an aggregate additional term of 4 years and 9 months to commence on 25 February 2028 and to expire on 24 November 2032. The Applicant seeks leave to appeal, and if leave be granted, appeals the sentence imposed.
	
	
	The Applicant was charged with eight offences, being:
	


Sequences 6, 7, 8, 9, 3 and 4: Six counts of aggravated sexual assault (contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900), for which the maximum penalty is 20 years’ imprisonment and there is prescribed a standard non-parole period of 10 years’ imprisonment;

Sequence 11 and Sequence 10: Two counts of aggravated indecent assault (contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act), for which the maximum penalty is 10 years’ imprisonment and there is prescribed a standard non-parole period of 8 years’ imprisonment.


	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty to each of the offences on 3 December 2014 at the Local Court and maintained that guilty plea and was sentenced accordingly. The offences were committed against the Applicant’s three daughters when they were between about 12 or 13 and 16 years of age and the circumstances of aggravation were the fact that the daughters were under the authority of the Applicant at the time of the offences. Each sexual assault offence involves sexual intercourse with the complainants without their consent and knowing that they were not consenting.
	
	
	The sentence occurred on the basis of an agreed set of facts tendered by the Crown. The relationship between the Applicant and the victims is the reason that the identity of the Applicant is suppressed, as it would identify the victims.
	


Facts


	
	It is unnecessary to detail the facts except in broad outline. The sequences have been recounted in the order above because that is the chronological order of the sequences in each set of charges. Sequence 6 occurred in September 2012 during the course of relocating from Queensland to New South Wales. The eldest daughter travelled with the Applicant interstate and on a particular night in September 2012, they stayed overnight in a caravan park in Coffs Harbour. While inside the caravan park, the Applicant “gave [the Victim] a look” (Statement of Agreed Facts), which the Victim took to mean the Applicant was going to have sex with her. Sexual intercourse had taken place between the Applicant and this daughter on prior occasions. The assault was penile/vaginal intercourse with his eldest daughter.
	
	
	Sequence 7 was a representative count, the Applicant agreeing that he would have sexual intercourse with his eldest daughter on a regular basis. The eldest daughter did not want to have sexual intercourse with the Applicant.
	
	
	At the premises, whilst living with the Victim’s grandmother, the Applicant had penile/vaginal intercourse with his eldest daughter while touching her breasts and nipples and kissing her. The Victim, notwithstanding her youth and the position of authority of the Applicant, expressed to the Applicant that she did not want to engage in the conduct.
	
	
	The next occasion which is the subject of a charge was also penile/vaginal intercourse with the eldest daughter. That occurred in the laundry of the premises (Sequence 8).
	
	
	On other occasions, the Applicant would take his eldest daughter out in his car. On one such occasion in or around December 2013, the Applicant drove to a secluded car park; the daughter alighted the car to look at the beach; the Applicant remarked that he wanted to “play”; and the daughter said she did not want to. Notwithstanding that expression of lack of consent, the Applicant took the eldest daughter down a trail; put his singlet on the ground; directed the daughter to kneel down; and engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse. At some stage, the Applicant turned the eldest daughter around and engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse in the missionary position. At the conclusion of this conduct, the daughter said, angrily, to the Applicant: “Why can’t we just be father and daughter?” (Sequence 9).
	
	
	After moving to the house in which Sequence 7, 8 and 9 occurred, the second daughter (Victim 2) was absent from school on numerous occasions. On one such occasion, Victim 2 was at home with the Applicant. The Applicant’s mother, being the Victim’s grandmother, was at home. Victim 2 was sitting on a mattress playing PlayStation. She heard a noise and turned around to see the Applicant.
	
	
	The Applicant threw two pillows onto the mattress. Victim 2 said she did not want to. Victim 2 became scared. The Applicant told Victim 2 to lay on the mattress. Victim 2 hesitated, sat on the corner of the mattress curled into a ball, and again told the Applicant she did not want to.
	
	
	The Applicant told her it would be all right and then had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. At this stage Victim 2 was aged 14 or 15 years (Sequence 4).
	
	
	On 14 February 2014, Victim 2 was at home from school. The other two daughters were at school and the grandmother had gone shopping. Victim 2 was playing PlayStation, when the Applicant came up behind her and touched her cleavage and vaginal area (Sequence 11 – indecent assault).
	
	
	The offender then asked Victim 2 to go in to his bedroom. She did. There was then penile/vaginal intercourse on the bed (Sequence 3 – aggravated sexual intercourse).
	
	
	The youngest daughter, Victim 3, bought herself a new white two-piece swimming costume during the summer of 2013. The Applicant, on the pretence of checking whether the bottom part had a lining, placed his thumb inside the bikini bottoms, touching the top of her genitalia. Victim 3 pulled away to which the Applicant remarked that he needed to have a look. Victim 3 replied that she would take them off and show him and then went to her room, took the costume off and showed the Applicant the lining. (The touching is Sequence 10.)
	
	
	The school at which each of the Victims attended conducted a program for students on domestic violence and sexual assault. Victim 2 became distressed and was taken to the office of the Aboriginal Education Officer, who spent the afternoon with her and who said that she thought that Victim 2 would be ready to talk about what was wrong the next day.
	
	
	The next day Victim 2 went to see the Officer and accused her father of the offences against her. The Aboriginal Education Officer went to speak with Victim 3, who told of the events in relation to her.
	
	
	In an unrelated matter, Victim 1 telephoned the Aboriginal Education Officer and the Aboriginal Education Officer met her outside, had a conversation with her and disclosed to her what had happened to Victims 2 and 3. Victim 1 reacted in the following comment:
	


“The fucking bastard, I thought he would never touch the others.”


	
	A report was made to the Department of Family and Community Services, who notified the Police.
	
	
	The proceedings on sentence occurred on 12 November 2015 and her Honour sentenced immediately.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The Applicant seeks to raise three grounds of appeal, in the following terms:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge failed to undertake a fact-finding process about the Applicant’s difficult upbringing;
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge failed to take into account the Applicant’s difficult upbringing;
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge misapprehended the facts.
	



	
	In each case the facts to which reference is made are the subjective circumstances relating to the Applicant as told to a psychologist. The Applicant did not give evidence to verify the history given by the psychologist, notwithstanding the psychologist’s questioning as to whether the Applicant “was distorting and/or exaggerating his” experiences.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	According to the Applicant, recounted by the psychologist, the Applicant had and has no significant social difficulties (Psychological Assessment Report at [18], Appeal Book at 44), but has little insight into his social functioning. He was the youngest of three children and, on the version told to the psychologist, was physically and sexually abused by his father and by his paternal uncle (the details of which he could not recall) from the age of seven until his mid-adolescence.
	
	
	According to the Applicant, his middle sister also sexually abused him, forcing him to engage in sexual intercourse from the age of eight or nine years. According to the Applicant, she also began bringing her friends around to the family home to have sex with him. This, it was said, continued for a number of years.
	
	
	The Applicant did not suggest to the psychologist that he consented to this sexual abuse, but it is clear that he also did not report any abuse to anyone at the time and, as a consequence, the authorities did not become involved.
	
	
	After the Applicant said he was kicked out of home, because of his father’s jealousy concerning the relationship between the Applicant and his mother, he lived with sex workers, according to the report to the psychologist, who “apparently offered him and a number of other homeless boys accommodation and food” (Psychological Assessment Report at [13], Appeal Book at 43).
	
	
	Notwithstanding the Applicant’s depiction of his father having kicked him out of home, the Applicant returned to live with his parents and continued to live there until he was 17.
	
	
	The Applicant had earlier sexually abused both his daughter and step-daughter in a previous relationship, as a consequence of which, he and his then partner separated, he was convicted of the offences and was imprisoned for the offences.
	
	
	There can be no doubt, whatever be the history of the Applicant, that in relation to the offences for which he was sentenced and to which this application relates, he was “well aware his conduct was wrong and inappropriate” (Psychological Assessment Report at [42], Appeal Book at 48).
	
	
	In relation to this report, only some extracts of which have been recited above, the learned sentencing judge remarked:
	


“In considering [the Applicant’s] subjective circumstances and his background I note that his background is reported to be as set out to the psychologist. If it is taken to be accurate then it would show that [the Applicant] is the youngest of three children. It shows and he reports that he had an unhappy relationship with his father who reportedly physically and sexually abused him but that he had a good relationship with his mother. He told the psychologist that he was abused by his father and uncle sexually and physically from a young age and also by his sister from a young age. He said that at 15 years of age he was put into a boys’ home in relation to some stealing matters. He was reportedly a poor student at school and he was expelled from school at a relatively early age and that he worked as a labourer and in other menial positions throughout his life. He was illiterate until he taught himself how to read and write as an adult. He reportedly was employed for some of his life but found himself on government benefits for most of his life. He has self-reported significant alcohol abuse issues and some other substance abuse issues throughout his life. He was unemployed at the time of his arrest although he has reported that he has done some employment courses while in custody and he has received no in custody misconduct charges.” (Remarks on Sentence at 12, Appeal Book at 22).


	
	The sentencing judge considered some aspects of regret but did not consider that the Applicant’s remorse, as reported to the psychologist, was the kind of remorse to which the Act referred and, in particular, that his version of “remorse” was coupled with a “completely distorted array of thinking and justification for his behaviour” (Remarks on Sentence at 13, Appeal Book at 23). The sentencing judge found he had very limited insight into the serious nature of the offences.
	
	
	The sentencing judge allowed a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of his plea, but, given the strength of the Crown case, did not consider that the plea of guilty was evidence of remorse.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the additional significance of specific deterrence, given the lack of insight and the past conduct to similar effect and the effect of past sentences (Remarks on Sentence at 12, 13, Appeal Book at 22 – 23).
	


Applicant’s Submissions and Consideration


	
	The gravamen of the Applicant’s Submissions is the apparent scepticism with which the sentencing judge treated the Applicant’s background and the failure of the sentencing judge to make findings of fact as to that background. The sentencing judge said:
	


“According to the psychologist’s report [the Applicant’s] background of dysfunctional family and sexual abuse is connected to his current offending. It is noted that this offender did not give evidence in the current proceedings and I have already referred to my concern as to his lack of honesty in his self-report to his psychologist. This fact was pointed out to his counsel and the difficulties that might arise for the Court as a result of his lack of evidence and it was referred to during the course of the sentencing proceeding.

The offender did not give evidence after these issues were raised.” (Remarks on Sentence at 9, Appeal Book at 19)


	
	The learned sentencing judge then repeated the conclusions of the psychologist based upon the history given to her and the comment, already recited above, that the Applicant may have been distorting or exaggerating his adolescent sexual experiences.
	
	
	The sentencing judge had, during the course of the proceedings, drawn the Applicant’s attention (through his counsel) to the lack of evidence from the Applicant and to the lack of independent evidence corroborating the history given to the psychologist. The sentencing judge also drew to the attention of counsel for the Applicant that the Applicant was well aware, prior to the commission of the offences, that what he was about to do was wrong, and seriously so. Evidence was before the Sentencing Court inconsistent with his early childhood and adolescent sexual history, to the effect that he was not unaware of a normal relationship between father and child nor that the conduct and acts he was perpetrating on his own children was part of such a “normal relationship”.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge continued, in her analysis, in the following way:
	


“In any event the fact that this was a second set of sexual assaults committed against members of his family after the 1994 offences and the fact that the offences occurred against three of his biological children over a long period of time and the fact that such serious offences occurred, the weight that I might give any connection between sexual offences upon him when he was a very young child would be not significant considering the seriousness of these offences.” (Remarks on Sentence at 11, Appeal Book at 21).


	
	The Applicant, in his application for leave and, if leave be granted, on the appeal, submits that her Honour failed to make findings as to whether the sexual abuse occurred and discounted the sexual abuse as a child on account of the previous offending.
	
	
	The Applicant’s counsel submits that it is a requirement on a sentencing judge to make factual conclusions about an offender’s personal circumstances: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54 at [1].
	
	
	Next, the Applicant refers to the comments in Bugmy v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 571; [2013] HCA 37 at [43] – [44] in which the plurality refers to the experience of an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence compromising the person’s capacity to mature and to learn from experience remaining relevant, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending. As a consequence of the fact that profound childhood deprivation does not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to give ‘full weight’ to the deprived background in every sentencing decision.
	
	
	The plurality of the High Court in Bugmy go on to say that:
	


“However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender’s deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender’s childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender’s recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender’s moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	In the course of the sentencing proceedings, counsel for the Applicant conceded that there was “not a hard and fast rule”. At Appeal Book, p 65 (Transcript 12 November 2015, p 7), the following exchange occurs:
	


“[Counsel for the Applicant]: There is material before the Court to indicate that he was the victim in his early years of prior sexual abuse. There’s authority which indicate that that can be taken into account in terms of reducing my client’s moral culpability. It is not a hard and fast rule –

HER HONOUR: I don’t have to make a finding that there is a connection or correlation between the two.

[Counsel for the Applicant]: Yes.

HER HONOUR: And I note what the psychologist says but I also note that your client has remained in the dock.”


	
	This Court has for a significant period expressed the view that a sentencing judge is entitled to be sceptical of comments made by an Applicant to psychiatrists or psychologists which, while admissible, may be treated with considerable caution when there is no evidence given by the Applicant: see R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369; [2001] NSWCCA 353 at [58] (per Smart J), at [79] (per Spigelman CJ) (with each of whom Simpson J agreed on this issue: see [80]); R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174; [2002] NSWCCA 381; R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425.
	
	
	In this sentencing proceeding, the sentencing judge drew attention to the scepticism with which some of the history was treated by the psychologist and to the fact that in the proceedings the material was not the subject of evidence from the Applicant.
	
	
	The comments of the High Court in Bugmy as to the continuing nature of deprivation are not in issue and were not in issue before the sentencing judge. On the contrary, the sentencing judge, assuming the history had been proved, took the view that the Applicant was well aware that his conduct was wrong. Nevertheless, the Applicant was not prepared to swear to the truth of the history and his subjective circumstances, including his prior offending, and, when taken together with the seriousness of the offences, it gave rise to significant issues associated with specific deterrence and protection of the community.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was entitled, in the circumstances of the proceedings before her, to express her scepticism of the accuracy and truth of the history given to the psychologist and not supported by the Applicant in evidence before the Court, and to express the view, even if the history were true, given the need for specific deterrence, the seriousness of the crime and the need for protection of the community, that the background would have little weight in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The foregoing renders that which is pressed in relation to the first and second grounds of appeal as unarguable or not arising.
	
	
	As to the third ground of appeal, that the learned sentencing judge misapprehended the facts, this alleged error concerns her Honour’s alleged findings about whether the Applicant ejaculated on each occasion in which penile/vaginal penetration occurred.
	
	
	Her Honour’s remarks on sentence accurately recite or summarise the agreed facts. In an ex tempore judgment, and in summary form, her Honour utilised different terminology for various offences in some of which, the Applicant argues, her Honour was in error by implying that there was ejaculation either during the course of penile penetration or at the end of it. That fact is, according to the submission, to the disadvantage of the Applicant and was not proved, for each such occasion, beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The comments of her Honour in relation to ejaculation “on each occasion of the charged offences” was correct in relation to sequences 6, 7, 8 and 9. Sequences 3 and 4 relate to Victim 2, whereas Sequences 6, 7, 8 and 9 relate to the eldest daughter, Victim 1.
	
	
	In relation to sequence 4 there is no evidence, one way or the other, as to whether ejaculation occurred during the penile/vaginal intercourse. The evidence is that the Applicant, after the intercourse, got up and went to have a shower.
	
	
	In relation to sequence 3, again there is no evidence, one way or the other, as to whether ejaculation occurred during the penile/vaginal intercourse (or immediately after), but there is evidence that no contraceptive protection was utilised.
	
	
	The complaint is that some of the terms or words used by her Honour in the ex tempore judgment are contradictory. While recounting the facts accurately, her Honour referred to ejaculation “on each of the offences”.
	
	
	An examination of the indicative sentences does not reveal that the fact of ejaculation could have had any effect on the sentence imposed and could not possibly have had an effect on the aggregate sentence imposed.
	
	
	In my view the third ground of appeal is an attempt to take advantage of a minor infelicitous comment in the course of an ex tempore judgment and does not properly arise.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the Court deny leave to appeal. I propose that the Court makes the following order:
	



	
	Leave to appeal refused.
	



	
	BUTTON J:  I agree with the order proposed by Rothman J, and the reasons for it. I also agree with the additional remarks of Meagher JA.
	
	
	With regard to proposed ground 3, I would only add that no submission was made at first instance that her Honour could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant ejaculated inside the victims, on the occasions on which he did not ejaculate outside their bodies.
	
	
	Furthermore, I consider that one can readily conclude to the criminal standard that a person who was prepared to offend so deplorably against his own daughters was also prepared to run the risk, on occasion, of impregnating them.

4574952,Dickson v R [2017] NSWCCA 78,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was found guilty, following a trial before a jury, of five offences relating to a number of thefts which occurred in Sylvania Waters on the morning of the 14 August 2013. Although there were three alleged co-offenders, the applicant was tried alone. It was not in issue that there were break and enters, or that the property the subject of each of the counts was stolen.

However, the Crown did not have any witnesses who observed the applicant or any of his alleged co-offenders break and enter into any of the houses nor steal any of the property. Rather, the Crown case was that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the applicant and three co-offenders to travel to Sylvania Waters, break into houses, steal property, sell that stolen property, and divide the proceeds.

The Crown case largely rested upon a series of intercepted phone calls taking place from the afternoon of the 13 August 2013 and concluding on 29 August 2013 between the alleged co-offenders. The Crown also relied on expert evidence in respect of mobile phone tower data tending to show that the applicant travelled to Sylvania Waters on the night of the 13 August 2013 and remained in that area until the early morning of 14 August 2013.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty to all charges on 17 August 2015. The applicant was sentenced on 3 December 2015 to a custodial sentence of 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The applicant appealed against his conviction only.

The issues on appeal were:

1.    Whether the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence because:

a.   the applicant was not a party to a specific agreement to commit the offences; and/or

b.   because the applicant was not proved to be present when each offence was committed.

2.    Whether the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury regarding joint criminal enterprise, by not directing the jury that the applicant must be proved to be present when the agreed crime was committed.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Johnson J and Fullerton J agreeing), dismissing the appeal:

Presence 

(i)    It is well-established that a person will not be liable for a crime committed by another as a result of the principle of joint criminal enterprise merely because the person is a party to an agreement to commit a criminal offence which was subsequently committed by one of the other parties to the agreement. To be liable the person concerned must participate in the commission of the offence: [41]-[44] (Bathurst CJ); [99] (Johnson J); [100] (Fullerton J).

Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; [1998] HCA 75; Huynh v The Queen (2013) 87 ALJR 434; [2013] HCA 6; Gillard v The Queen (2003) 219 CLR 1; [2003] HCA 7; McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 applied.

(ii)   A person can be liable under the principle of joint criminal enterprise if it can be shown that he or she entered into an agreement or understanding to commit a crime and participated in some way in furthering its execution. Presence at the actual commission of the crime is sufficient, but not necessary, to prove participation. It is not necessary to prove presence if the person sought to be made liable participated in some other way in the furtherance of the enterprise: [46]-[47] (Bathurst CJ); [99] (Johnson J); [100] (Fullerton J).

Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; [1998] HCA 75; R v Bingley & Ors (1821) Russ. and Ry. 446; 168 ER 890; R v Morgan [1994] 1 VR 567; R v Franklin (2001) 3 VR 9; Likiardopoulos v R (2010) 30 VR 654; [2010] VSCA 344; Likiardopoulos v The Queen (2012) 247 CLR 265; [2012] HCA 37; R v Prochilo [2003] NSWCCA 265; Sever v R [2010] NSWCCA 135 applied.

R v Lowery & King (No 2) (1972) VR 560; R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 distinguished.

(iii)   The trial judge’s directions to the jury made it sufficiently clear that the applicant could only be liable if in addition to entering into the agreement he participated in the agreed criminal activity: [57] (Bathurst CJ); [99] (Johnson J); [100] (Fullerton J).

Unreasonable verdict 

(iv)    It was open to the jury to conclude that the circumstantial evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the applicant on each count: [87]-[95] (Bathurst CJ); [99] (Johnson J); [100] (Fullerton J).

SKA v The Queen (2011) 243 CLR 400; [2011] HCA 13; M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; [1994] HCA 63; MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 608; [2002] HCA 53; Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559; [2007] HCA 30; R v Baden-Clay (2016) 90 ALJR 1013; [2016] HCA 35 applied.

(v)    It was open to the jury to conclude that the agreement between the co-offenders ultimately embodied the theft of the particular items the subject of each of the counts. This was sufficient to affix the applicant with liability for the theft of the particular items which were stolen: [96] (Bathurst CJ); [99] (Johnson J); [100] (Fullerton J).

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The applicant, Athol Allan Howard Dickson, was charged on indictment with five offences relating to a number of thefts which occurred in Sylvania Waters on the morning of the 14 August 2013. Although there were a number of other individuals said to be co-offenders of the applicant, he was tried alone. The counts on the indictment for the applicant were as follows:
	



	
	Count 1: Aggravated break, enter and steal at XXX Belgrave Esplanade, Sylvania Waters (aggravated by knowing there were persons present) on 14 August 2013,
	
	
	Count 2: Stealing a motor vehicle (Ford Ranger) at Sylvania Waters on 14 August 2013,
	
	
	Count 3: Stealing a box trailer at Sylvania Waters on 14 August 2013,
	
	
	Count 4: Aggravated break, enter and steal at XXX Belgrave Esplanade, Sylvania Waters (aggravated by knowing there were persons present) on 14 August 2013,
	
	
	Count 5: Aggravated break, enter and steal at XX Belgrave Esplanade, Sylvania Waters (aggravated by knowing there were persons present) on 14 August 2013.
	



	
	Following a trial before a jury, the applicant was convicted of all five counts and was sentenced by Judge Lakatos to 4 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. He has appealed against conviction on each of those counts on two grounds. The first ground is that in relation to each count, the jury verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The second ground is that the trial judge erred in not directing the jury that in order to find the applicant guilty under the principles of joint criminal enterprise, it must be satisfied that the applicant was present when each offence was committed.
	


The case at trial


	
	It was not in issue at the trial that there were break and enters or that the property the subject of each of the counts was in fact stolen. Nor was it in issue that there were people present in the houses at the time the relevant offences took place. However, the Crown did not have any witnesses who observed the applicant or any of his alleged co-offenders break and enter into any of the houses nor steal any of the property the subject of the offences. Rather, the Crown case largely rested upon a series of intercepted phone calls taking place from the afternoon of the 13 August 2013 and concluding on 29 August 2013. The Crown also relied on expert evidence in respect of mobile phone tower data tending to show that the applicant travelled to Sylvania Waters on the night of the 13 August 2013 and remained in that area until the early morning of 14 August 2013.
	
	
	The Crown case was that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the applicant, persons named Jamie Nagle and QF (who was a juvenile at the time) and a further unidentified male. The nature of the enterprise was described as being to travel to the Sylvania Waters area, break into houses and steal property and to sell the stolen property and divide the proceeds.
	
	
	The Crown’s position at trial was that for the purpose of showing a joint criminal enterprise existed, the agreement between the co-offenders did not have to relate to stealing particular items of property. Rather, it was claimed that the agreement could be as broad as to break into a house and steal whatever is available. To that extent, the Crown stated in its closing address at trial that it did not have to prove there was an agreement to steal the particular items the subject of Counts 1 to 5.
	
	
	The Crown relied on expert evidence showing the location of various telephone services registered to the co-offenders in different areas. In general terms, the evidence showed that Mr Nagle, QF and the applicant left the north-western suburbs of Sydney on the evening of the 13 August 2013 and travelled to Sylvania Waters. It showed that the group remained in or around Sylvania Waters from just before midnight on 13 August 2013 until approximately 3:30am on 14 August 2013.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was that there was only one possible explanation for the applicant and co-offenders making this journey, being to commit the offences. The Crown referred to evidence of a phone call taking place later between Mr Nagle and a Baden Bell. In this phone call Mr Nagle discusses taking Mr Bell to “have a look at it” and Mr Bell seeks assurances that “it” is not from “around here”. The Crown suggested the inference to be drawn was that “it” was a stolen motorcycle and that this was a plausible explanation as to why the group travelled to Sylvania Waters to steal property.
	
	
	The Crown relied on telephone intercepts between Mr Nagle, QF and the applicant regarding arrangements made to meet on the evening of the 13 August 2013 in order to show the participants to the agreement. A call made from QF to Mr Hastings just before midnight on the 13 August 2013 discussing a “green one” and a “13 250” was suggested to relate to the 2013 KX250 Kawasaki motorcycle the subject of Count 5 on the indictment. QF further stated that he was “just walking around, walking around on the waters, bro, trying to find some tools”. The Crown’s submission was that this established that QF was a party to the criminal enterprise.
	
	
	A phone call was made one minute later by QF to a young woman called “Kayla” who appeared to be his girlfriend. It was submitted that the applicant could be heard in the background stating “once we get a van, bra, we’ll just (unintelligible) all the bikes” and “[m]others, we will get a full weapon hottie”. Detective Bartle gave evidence in the trial that in his opinion, “hottie” is a term used for a stolen vehicle and that “weapon” is often used to describe something that’s powerful or really good, of quality. The Crown suggested that if the jury accepted the voice was that of the applicant, it placed him with QF at a time when part of the stolen property was located by the group. Another call was placed at 2:41am from the applicant’s phone to QF. The only word spoken was “[y]eah”, however the expert evidence suggested that at the time the call was made, the applicant’s phone service was within the pickup area of the Sylvania Waters South cell tower. The Crown suggested this was enough to show that the applicant was present in Sylvania Waters until at least this time.
	
	
	A further call was made at 3:29am where the applicant discusses a trailer, stating “the fuckin’ trailer’s got a lock on it. Told you, bro, we should have just grabbed the one up the road, man. Fuck.” The applicant later states ‘Let’s just go. I’m cuttin’ – mothers, I’m just cuttin’ now’. The Crown submitted that the call demonstrated something needed to be carried that wasn’t brought with them from north-western Sydney, but rather was something they acquired in the vicinity of Sylvania Waters.
	
	
	A further call was made at 4:48am from Mr Nagle to an unidentified male who answered the applicant’s phone. The unidentified male says that he doesn’t know where the applicant is, but tells Mr Nagle to “listen out for the bike”. The inference suggested by the Crown was that the applicant wasn’t with the male who answered his phone and that was because he was riding one of the bikes.
	
	
	The remainder of the calls were predominantly conversations in somewhat coded terms that the Crown suggested involved the making of arrangements for the disposal of two of the motorcycles. These involved a conversation in which the applicant states “I need cash, you know what I mean?” and “[y]ou want to work it out, boy, I’m telling you” which the Crown suggested related to the selling of one of the motorcycles. It was suggested that the discussions about the money from the bikes were in terms of a “demand” rather than a request and indicated the applicant was intent on receiving his share of the proceeds.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the agreed facts which were that the trailer the subject of Count 3 and the motor vehicle the subject of Count 2 were recovered in Blacktown at 5.00am on the 14 August 2013, and one of the motorbikes the subject of Count 5 was recovered in a park across the road from where the car and trailer were found. It pointed to the cell tower evidence which suggested QF was in the vicinity of South Blacktown at approximately 4:30am on 14 August 2013.
	
	
	The applicant’s case was that the Crown had not proved his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He pointed to the fact that the cell tower data did not establish specifically where he was relative to where the crimes on the indictment were committed. He submitted that the content of the phone calls did not establish that the co-offenders were planning to commit the relevant offences but merely that they met for dinner. Although it was conceded that some calls implicated the applicant in sharing in the profits of the stolen bikes when sold, it was contended that the calls did not implicate the applicant in their theft. He further pointed to the call at 3:29am in which the applicant stated “I’m cuttin’"" as suggesting that he was about to leave the relevant area, and submitted that the fact of this phone call demonstrated the applicant was separated from the rest of the group at that time.
	
	
	An application was made on behalf of the applicant at the conclusion of the evidence for a directed verdict of acquittal on Counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 (that is, all of the counts except that relating to the theft of the trailer). In his written submissions in relation to the directed verdict, the applicant submitted that the Crown could not prove who committed the acts nor could it prove whether the person committed the acts by themselves or jointly with others.
	
	
	It was submitted on that application that the calls evidencing a meeting of the group, termed “Group 1 calls”, did not evidence what the group may have been planning or forming an agreement to do. The calls alleged to have been made around the time of the commission of the crimes, termed “Group 2 calls”, were said to not evidence the nature of any pre-agreement between the four alleged co-offenders. It was accepted that at a prima facie level the intentions of the four appeared criminal in nature, but it was submitted that was not sufficient. Rather, it was submitted that it was necessary for there to be evidence that the applicant was aware that at least one of the group intended to commit the specific offences on the indictment and that he agreed to commit those specific offences with a co-offender. Finally, the calls forming “Group 3 calls”, being those after the alleged offending were accepted to allow an inference that the applicant was aware of the proceeds of the crime and perhaps that crimes had been committed. However, it was submitted that the applicant’s knowledge at the time of the Group 3 calls could not be transported retrospectively to the time of the offending as evidence of a joint criminal enterprise to commit those offences.
	
	
	The applicant further submitted on that application that there was no evidence pointing to where each alleged offender was relative to the offence as it was committed. While the applicant’s phone connected to a Sylvania Waters cell tower, this was said to be incapable of itself proving beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in Belgrave Esplanade.
	
	
	The trial judge gave reasons for refusing the application on 14 August 2015, holding that on the material adduced by the Crown there were primary facts which, if accepted by the jury, could reasonably ground an inference that there was an agreement to break and enter the houses, that the bikes were stolen and that the applicant was party to such an agreement.
	


The directions given by the trial judge


	
	In summing up, the trial judge directed the jury on the issue of joint criminal enterprise. He stated:
	


“Perhaps of greater difficulty are issues concerning joint criminal enterprise. The law is that where two or more people carry out a joint criminal enterprise, that is an agreement to carry out a particular criminal activity, each is held to be criminally responsible for the acts of another participant in carrying out their enterprise or activity.

So a joint enterprise, we all agree to steal Easter eggs. If there is an agreement for us to carry that out and I end up sending one of my friends into the next residence to take the Easter egg we know is there, we are all responsible for what he has done, as if I had done it, as if the third person in the agreement has done it.

The joint responsibility is so regardless of a particular role played in the enterprise by the particular participant. The Crown must establish both the existence of a joint criminal enterprise - that is a long way of saying agreement to commit an offence - and the participation in such an enterprise by, in this case, the accused. So there has to be an agreement to do something which is criminal, and you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, in this particular case, the accused was a member of that agreement or a participant.

A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more people reach an understanding or an arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The agreement need not be expressed in words, and its existence may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence that are found to be proved on the evidence.”


	
	He later noted:
	


“It does not matter whether the agreed crime is committed by only one of them or some of them in the joint enterprise, or whether they all played an active part in committing the crime. All the participants in the enterprise are equally guilty of committing the crime regardless of the actual part that they played in its commission.

The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime which was the subject of the joint agreement was in fact committed. It therefore must prove beyond reasonable doubt that each of the essential facts or ingredients which make up the crime was committed regardless of who it was that actually committed the relevant parts of those offences.

As I say, I have spoken to you about the elements of the offence. In circumstances such as this, and I am putting this hypothetically because there is no evidence one way or another, if there was an agreement between some or all of the persons named in this indictment that in fact [QF] should take the bikes, or Mr Nagle should take the box trailer, or the unknown fourth person, if you find there was such a person, should take the Ford Ranger, provided there is an agreement between the four of them, it does not matter who actually did that, but there must be an agreement to hold the person who did not do it liable for that offence.

It therefore must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each of the legal elements which make up the crime was committed, regardless of who committed them, in respect of a particular accused. In this case we are dealing with Mr Dickson. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was a participant in the commission of that crime as part of a joint enterprise with one or more of the other persons named, Mr Nagle, [QF] and the unknown person.”


	
	The applicant’s trial counsel applied for a further direction that the participants must agree to do all the acts with the relevant intention necessary to establish the offence. The trial judge gave the requested direction as follows:
	


“In terms of the joint criminal enterprise direction which I have given you at some length, it is necessary for me to emphasise that for you to consider the issue of joint criminal enterprise in the context of this case, you need to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the participants agreed to do all of the acts which are the elements/charges that I have set out for you, they agreed to do the breaking, they agreed to do the entering, they agreed to steal, and they did so in the aggravating circumstances. You need to be satisfied that all the participants have agreed to do all of those things and to have the relevant intention to commit the offences, so all of those things have to coincide.

Again, to repeat it, for you to be satisfied of the existence of the joint criminal enterprise sufficient to warrant a verdict of guilty in relation to some or all of those three counts, you need to be satisfied that all the participants agreed to do each of the elements relevant to the two groups of offences with the intention to permanently deprive the owners of the property involved.”


	
	Prior to the summing up, the trial judge discussed with the applicant’s trial counsel a problematic point in his address. Counsel had suggested that the Crown could not prove that when the crimes occurred, the applicant was with Mr Nagle and QF. The trial judge asked counsel whether it was necessary that the evidence establish that the co-offenders were with each other. Counsel accepted that people can participate in a joint criminal enterprise without necessarily needing to be together.
	
	
	In summing up, the trial judge noted that he perhaps needed to correct that incorrect impression, stating:
	


“He said to you words to this effect, ‘How can the Crown say that when the crimes occurred, this accused was with the other gentlemen, Messrs Nagle and [QF]?’ To the extent that that is done literally, I need to perhaps correct an incorrect impression, which I am sure Mr Fraser did not intend. He was directing that argument to say, ‘How can you say that this accused was party to any agreement?’

You will remember, when I gave you the directions about joint criminal enterprise, to be party to a joint criminal enterprise did not necessarily mean that everybody had to be doing everything together. Remember the car and the people breaking into the houses. However, I am sure that Mr Fraser meant to say that the fact that he was not together is a further matter that you should take into account to say there is no proper evidence that he was party to an agreement of this kind.”


	
	In dealing with the addresses made by the Crown and counsel for the applicant, the trial judge made the following remarks:
	


“In this case, the Crown relies on circumstantial evidence to establish the fact that there was a joint enterprise and to establish the fact that the accused was party to that joint enterprise. He of course has indicated to you, and I will move to the arguments shortly, that the Crown contends there was a joint enterprise between this accused, two other known individuals, [QF] and Mr Nagle, and one unknown individual, to go from where they resided to Sylvania Waters to do the break, enter and steals which apparently were done by somebody, if I can put it that way, to steal property. The Crown relies upon circumstantial evidence because, as I have said, and Mr Fraser pointed out, there is no direct evidence of an agreement in the usual sense of that term.

…

Similarly too, if one looks at the Crown evidence in this case, we have evidence in relation to cell towers and call charge records. You heard Mr Chang giving evidence about that, and I will speak about his evidence shortly. In those circumstances, the Crown says that you would conclude from that material that indeed this accused was present in Sylvania Waters, but more than that, that he was present in the location of these offences, and that it is part of the material from which you would conclude he was participating in the joint criminal enterprise.”

He made the following remarks in respect of the applicant’s case:

“Mr Fraser, on behalf of his client, says that in any event, say, for example, in relation to those two broad categories of evidence, and I will go into this in a little bit more detail shortly, that all you could draw from the cell tower material was that the phone, which was subscribed to the accused, was in that general area and operating. But he says you could not take the next step that the Crown asks you to do which is to conclude from that that his client was party to these criminal agreements.

In addition, he says that in terms of the telephone intercept material, generally speaking, they may show that his client was part of some inappropriate criminal conduct of some sort or another, but not that he was party to the conduct which the Crown says is involved in these charges. In other words, he may have known what Mr Fraser said about the bikes having been stolen, he may have had some part, you might think, or not, in the disposal of the bikes, but that is not to say that he was party to an agreement to steal and to break into the houses and so on.”

Turning to the Crown case he continued:

“However, he said, looking at the materials generally as well as the call charge records and the cell tower records, you would safely conclude that between about midnight on 13 or 14 August and about 3.30am, at least the three known parties to this enterprise, as the Crown would put it to you, were in the Sylvania Waters area, that is to say at the time the Crown alleges these offences occurred.

He put it to you as a rhetorical question, ‘Why were they there if you agree that this evidence means that they were?’ ‘Was it a sheer coincidence?’ he asks. ‘Do you travel halfway across Sydney from the northwest to the southwest in the early hours of the morning?’ ‘Do you find yourself in the same location at the same time as two other people involved in this alleged agreement?’ ‘Did the offences occur by sheer coincidence?’ His argument to you is no.

Those circumstances paint a picture, a picture of an agreed set of actions involving Mr Nagle, Mr Fraser [sic: QF] and this accused, directed towards breaking and entering into the relevant properties and/or stealing the relevant vehicles.

He says to you that if you look at various of these calls, there is a clear evidence or conclusion that there was an agreement. He drew attention to, amongst others, tab 26 – and I will not go to these except to remind you perhaps of the numbers – and acknowledged that the Crown was required to prove that this accused was a participant in the relevant joint criminal enterprise.”

Referring to the applicant’s case, the trial judge stated:

“He says you may perhaps be satisfied, looking at these telephone intercept materials, that somebody who was in the Sylvania Waters area, perhaps QF, Mr Nagle, perhaps his client, perhaps they were up to no good, doing some form of mischief or another. But he correctly says if that is the highest that your satisfaction can get beyond a reasonable doubt, then that is not enough because it is necessary for you to be satisfied that he was there, party to an agreement, to commit these very offences. All the elements of these offences must be present, he argued, and so much is correct in law. He said there is simply no evidence at all of his client’s knowledge at the time these offences were committed.”

These remarks indicate in my view that the question of the applicant’s participation in the enterprise was put to the jury as a matter for their consideration.

The appeal


	
	The applicant relied on the following two grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1 – verdicts unreasonable and cannot be supported because applicant not a party to specific agreement to commit offence, and/or applicant not present when each offence committed

Ground 2 – The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury regarding joint criminal enterprise, by not directing the jury that the applicant must be proved to be present when the agreed crime was committed


	
	It is convenient to deal with Ground 2 before dealing with Ground 1.
	


The applicant’s submissions on Ground 2


	
	The applicant submitted, referring in particular to the judgment of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316; [1998] HCA 75 and the Full High Court in Huynh v The Queen (2013) 87 ALJR 434; [2013] HCA 6, that for liability based on joint criminal enterprise to arise, it is necessary in addition to an agreement for a crime to be committed that the accused must be present when the offence is committed. He submitted this was also supported by what was said by this Court in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556-557.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in the present case the question of participation was plainly in issue. He submitted, referring to Huynh supra, that the direction must be tailored to the real issues at trial. He submitted that one element of the offence was presence at the commission of the crime and said it was enough for the appeal to be upheld if the judge failed to direct the jury that this element was essential.
	
	
	The applicant also submitted that the totality of the directions were apt to lead the jury into the error that participation and liability could be satisfied by the fact of joining into the agreement without more. He pointed in particular to that part of the direction to which I have referred at [19] above, stating that that had the effect of conveying to the jury on the facts of the present case, entry into the agreement would be enough to ground liability provided that one of the parties to it subsequently committed the crime.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that as no objection was taken to this aspect of the direction at trial, leave was required to argue ground 2 pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW). However, it was submitted that if the contentions as to presence were accepted, the misdirection was to an element of the offence and on the principles explained in TWL v R [2012] NSWCCA 57, this was a potentially decisive consideration in favour of granting leave.
	


The Crown’s submissions on Ground 2


	
	The Crown submitted that while participation of an accused in a joint criminal enterprise may be proved by his or her presence at the crime, the presence of a member of a joint criminal enterprise at the crime is not necessary.
	
	
	The Crown relied on a number of cases dating back to R v Bingley & Ors (1821) Russ. And Ry. 446; 168 ER 890, in which several persons by agreement forged part of an instrument. Mr Batkin participated in the process of forging the note on his own and was not with the other forgers when the instrument was completed but was nevertheless guilty as a principal.
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the dicta of Barwick CJ in Johns v The Queen (1980) 143 CLR 108; [1980] HCA 3 at 112 and that of Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ as suggesting that the ambit of a joint criminal enterprise was not restricted to those who were present at the scene of the crime. Although that case related to the principles to be applied in cases involving an accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree, it was described by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Morgan [1994] 1 VR 567 as concerning the criminal liability of persons alleged to have jointly engaged in the commission of a crime (at 571).
	
	
	The Crown pointed to cases including R v Prochilo [2003] NSWCCA 265 and Sever v R [2010] NSWCCA 135 as indicating that presence at the scene was not necessary to proving participation in a joint criminal enterprise. The Crown also relied on the statements of Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ in Likiardopoulos v The Queen (2012) 247 CLR 265; [2012] HCA 37. In that case the Court had been informed that an accessorial case was advanced out of the concern that the principal case, namely liability on the basis of joint criminal enterprise, might founder on the inability to establish that the appellant had been present throughout the whole of the period in which violence leading to death was inflicted on the deceased. The plurality stated at [21]:
	


“Counsel for the Crown submitted that this concern stemmed from a mistaken belief as to the essentiality of presence, arising out of Smith J’s charge to the jury in R v Lowery and King (No 2). Be that as it may, the trial judge entertained no such misapprehension. Her Honour directed the jury that it was not necessary to prove that the appellant had been present throughout the whole of the time during which the assaults took place in order to establish his guilt as a party to the joint criminal enterprise. The Court of Appeal correctly rejected the appellant’s challenge to that direction.”


	
	In relation to the applicant’s reliance on Huynh supra, the Crown submitted that the appellants in that case were all present when the deceased was killed, and that participation was therefore not at issue: Huynh supra at [41]. The Crown similarly submitted that Osland supra did not assist the applicant because it was not in issue that the appellant was present, and pointed to the later statement of McHugh J (at [93]) where his Honour stated “[w]here the parties are acting as the result of an arrangement or understanding, there is nothing contrary to the objects of the criminal law in making the parties liable for each other’s acts and the case for doing so is even stronger when they are at the scene together.”
	
	
	The Crown also pointed to the dicta of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Osland  supra at [27] where their Honours stated:
	


“More to the point, principle dictates the conclusion that those who form a common purpose to commit a crime together are liable as principals if they are present when the crime, or any other crime within the scope of the common purpose, is committed by one or more of them. The crime having been committed in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all are equally guilty as principals regardless of the part played by each. That result follows from the reasoning in McAuliffe v The Queen. Indeed, that reasoning would appear not to require presence at the scene of all parties to the continuing common purpose if the criteria specified in that reasoning otherwise are satisfied. The appellant's submissions on this aspect of the case proceeded upon a false basis [Footnotes omitted].”

It should be noted that their Honours were in dissent in this case.


	
	It was submitted in response to the applicant’s contention that this dicta was not followed in Huynh supra, that neither participation nor presence was in issue in Huynh. The Crown submitted that it is the law that presence is sufficient but not necessary for participation in a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	At the hearing the Crown prosecutor accepted that liability as a principal in the first degree through joint criminal enterprise requires participation beyond mere agreement, contrasting it to the case of conspiracy where a conspirator is someone who merely agrees. However, he submitted that while there had to be some level of participation, there was no test of sufficiency and it could be as much as joining the planning, standing in the background and saying “we’ll need to load these bikes” and also “we will get a full weapon hottie”. The Crown submitted that the participation was evidenced in the telephone conversations as well as the inferences that were open to be drawn by the jury as to the applicant’s movements in and around the various locations at the relevant times.
	
	
	In relation to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, the Crown submitted that its requirements were not mere technicalities, citing ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148]. It submitted that the critical issue to establish is that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant has lost a real chance or a chance fairly open of being acquitted: Picken v R; R v Picken [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [21]; FP v The Queen (2012) 224 A Crim R 82; [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [73].
	
	
	The Crown pointed to statements made in the trial counsel’s closing submissions which suggested that he was concerned with presence only in so far as it affected whether the applicant was party to any agreement, and noted that counsel did not submit that the presence of the applicant had to be proved as a matter of law, nor was a redirection sought to that effect. It was submitted that r 4 therefore applied, and that because of its submissions to the effect that presence was not required, the applicant had not lost a real chance of acquittal. To that extent the Crown’s submissions on r 4 depend on the conclusions made by this Court in relation to Ground 2.
	


Ground 2 consideration


	
	It is well-established that a person will not be liable for a crime committed by another as a result of the principle of joint criminal enterprise merely because the person is a party to an agreement to commit a criminal offence which was subsequently committed by one of the other parties to the agreement. To be liable the person concerned must participate in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	In Osland v The Queen supra, McHugh J explained the operation of the principle in the following terms:
	


“[72]   However, there is a third category where a person was not only present at the scene with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime but was there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person to commit the crime. In that category, the liability of each person present as the result of the concert is not derivative but primary. He or she is a principal in the first degree. In that category each of the persons acting in concert is equally responsible for the acts of the other or others. The general principle was clearly stated in R v Lowery and King [No 2] by Smith J who directed the jury in the following terms:

‘The law says that if two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement that together they will commit a crime and then, while that understanding or arrangement is still on foot and has not been called off, they are both present at the scene of the crime and one or other of them does, or they do between them, in accordance with their understanding or arrangement, all the things that are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of that crime regardless of what part each played in its commission. In such cases they are said to have been acting in concert in committing the crime.’

[73]   In that case, his Honour directed the jury that ‘they are all equally guilty of that crime’. But as subsequent cases show, and as principle requires, the correct statement is that they are all equally liable for the acts that constitute the actus reus of the crime. The principle is accurately stated by Brett, Waller and Williams in the 8th edition of their work on Criminal Law:

‘[E]ven if only one participant performed the acts constituting the crime, each will be guilty as principals in the first degree if the acts were performed in the presence of all and pursuant to a preconceived plan. In this case, the parties are said to be acting in concert.’ (Emphasis added.)

So far as is presently relevant, these principles were accurately and more fully stated by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Tangye. The Court said:

‘(1)   The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused.

(2)   A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime.

(3)   A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed.’ (Emphasis added.)

…

[79]   The principle that those who act in concert and are present at the scene are responsible for the acts of the actual perpetrator operates to make a person guilty of the principal crime, even though the actual perpetrator is acquitted completely. Thus, the person who did the act may be legally insane. Yet as long as that person had sufficient mental capacity to enter into the arrangement or common understanding, the other participant present at the scene will be guilty of committing the principal crime if he or she has the relevant mens rea. In Matusevich v The Queen, this Court decided that, when two persons are said to be acting in concert, the fact that the actual perpetrator is legally insane does not necessarily mean that the conviction of the other, who was present at the scene, should be quashed. If the actual perpetrator has sufficient capacity to enter into the agreement or understanding, the person present at the scene who was acting in concert may be convicted of the offence.

…

[93]   Where the parties are acting as the result of an arrangement or understanding, there is nothing contrary to the objects of the criminal law in making the parties liable for each other's acts and the case for doing so is even stronger when they are at the scene together. If any of those acting in concert but not being the actual perpetrator has the relevant mens rea, it does not seem wrong in principle or as a matter of policy to hold that person liable as a principal in the first degree. Once the parties have agreed to do the acts which constitute the actus reus of the offence and are present acting in concert when the acts are committed, the criminal liability of each should depend upon the existence or non-existence of mens rea or upon their having a lawful justification for the acts, not upon the criminal liability of the actual perpetrator. So even if the actual perpetrator of the acts is acquitted, there is no reason in principle why others acting in concert cannot be convicted of the principal offence. They are responsible for the acts (because they have agreed to them being done) and they have the mens rea which is necessary to complete the commission of the crime [Footnotes omitted].”


	
	His Honour’s explanation of the principle was approved by the High Court in Huynh v The Queen supra. The Court made the following remarks:
	


“[37]   The respondent's written submissions acknowledged that joint enterprise liability requires proof of the agreement and of the accused's participation in the enterprise. However, on the hearing of the appeals the respondent resiled from that submission in favour of the contention that ‘one plays a part at its most simple by joining into the agreement’. That contention conflated the making of the agreement (whether tacit or express) with participation in its execution and confused liability for conspiracy with liability for the offence that is the subject of the conspiracy. Under the common law the agreement of two or more persons to commit a crime is, without more, a conspiracy. Parties to a conspiracy are liable to conviction for that offence regardless of whether the crime that is the subject of their agreement is committed. The doctrine of joint criminal enterprise provides the means of attaching liability for the agreed crime on all the parties to the agreement regardless of the part played by each in its execution. Of course there will usually be no occasion to have recourse to the doctrine in the case of a party who does some or all of the acts constituting the actus reus. The work done by the doctrine is in making other parties liable for those acts. The principles are as explained by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen. Liability attaches to all the parties to the agreement who participate in some way in furthering its execution.

[38]   A person participates in a joint criminal enterprise by being present when the crime is committed pursuant to the agreement. The unchallenged evidence was that each appellant was one of a larger number of persons who had travelled from Duong's house to the Vartue Street premises. No nice question arises in these appeals of the sufficiency of the evidence to prove participation in the enterprise. If, at any time prior to the stabbing, the appellant whose case was under consideration was found to have come to an understanding or arrangement with others, including the principal offender, that a knife or similar bladed weapon would be used to kill or to inflict really serious bodily harm on a person or persons at the Vartue Street premises, his presence as one of the hostile group amounted to participation in furtherance of the agreement.”


	
	In Gillard v The Queen (2003) 219 CLR 1; [2003] HCA 64 Hayne J described the principle in the following terms (referring to McAuliffe v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 108 at 113-114):
	


“[109]   As was pointed out in McAuliffe, the terms ‘common purpose’, ‘common design’, ‘concert’, ‘joint criminal enterprise’ are used more or less interchangeably to invoke a doctrine by which the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime may be established. It is a doctrine which is separate from the liability of an accessory before the fact, who counsels or procures the commission of the crime; it is separate from the liability of a principal in the second degree, who aids or abets in the commission of the crime. Joint criminal enterprise, or acting in concert, depends upon the secondary party (here, the appellant) sharing a common purpose with the principal offender (here, Preston) or with that offender and others.

[110]   In its simplest application, the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise means that, if a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement with another or others that they will commit a crime, and one or other of the parties to the arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, all are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.

…

[112]   As McAuliffe reveals, the contemplation of a party to a joint enterprise includes what that party foresees as a possible incident of the venture. If the party foresees that another crime might be committed and continues to participate in the venture, that party is a party to the commission of that other, incidental, crime even if the party did not agree to its being committed. In such a case, as was said in McAuliffe, ‘the prosecution must prove that the individual concerned foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed and cannot rely upon the existence of the common purpose as establishing that state of mind’. To hold the individual liable for the commission of the incidental crime, when its commission is foreseen but not agreed, accords with the general principle that ‘a person who intentionally assists in the commission of a crime or encourages its commission may be convicted as a party to it’. The criminal culpability lies in the participation in the joint criminal enterprise with the necessary foresight.” 

Gleeson CJ and Callinan J agreed with his Honour’s remarks ((2003) 219 CLR 1 at [10]).


	
	Each of the authorities to which I have referred emphasised the need for the party to the joint criminal enterprise to participate in the enterprise whilst stating that presence at the time the crime was committed is sufficient to demonstrate such participation: Osland supra at [72]-[73]; Huynh supra at [38]. The issue is whether presence at the time of the commission of the offence is necessary for a person to be liable under the doctrine.
	
	
	Although on one reading the judgment of McHugh J in Osland supra and the passages from R v Lowery & King (No 2) (1972) VR 560 and R v Tangye supra cited by his Honour with approval, would tend to suggest this is the case, I do not think the principle is so confined. Indeed, [93] of the judgment of McHugh J in Osland supra and the statement in Huynh supra at [37] that liability attaches to persons who participate in some way in furtherance of its execution, tends to the contrary.
	
	
	In my opinion a person can be liable under the principle if it can be shown that he or she entered into an agreement or understanding to commit a crime and (to adopt the words in Huynh supra at [37]) participated in some way in furthering its execution. Whilst presence at the actual commission of the crime is sufficient, it is not necessary if the person sought to be made liable participated in some other way in the furtherance of the enterprise.
	
	
	A number of relatively simple examples can be given which show that this is so. A person who agrees with another to murder a victim by poisoning him and who in furtherance of that agreement supplied the poison to the other party who in fact administered it to the victim, will be liable under the principle although that person was not present when the poison was administered. Similarly, a person who created a fraudulent instrument pursuant to an agreement to defraud a victim will be liable for the fraud even if he is not present when the other party to the agreement made use of the instrument to defraud the victim: see, for example, R v Bingley & Ors supra.
	
	
	What I have written is not in my opinion inconsistent with authority. In R v Morgan [1994] 1 VR 567, the Court of Appeal of Victoria stated (at 570) that Smith J in Lowery & King supra was not purporting to make an exhaustive statement of the law governing liability of persons engaged in a joint criminal enterprise and held (at 572) that the test of liability does not depend on the physical presence of a person at the scene of the crime but rather his or her participation in the fulfilment of the common purpose by the commission of the crime.
	
	
	In R v Franklin (2001) 3 VR 9, a case involving what one member of the bench described as murder by prolonged torture, it was argued that the applicant could not be convicted under the principle as he was not present during the whole of the period in which the assault which led to the death took place. Ormiston JA (at [135]) stated that that ignored the existence of authority suggesting continual presence was not essential.
	
	
	In Likiardopoulos v R (2010) 30 VR 654; [2010] VSCA 344 it was argued that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that liability by way of joint criminal enterprise did not require proof of presence and on that basis, joint criminal enterprise should not have been left to the jury when it was not possible to exclude the possibility that the accused was absent when the acts causing death were performed. The appeal was dismissed. The Court (at [59]) referred to authorities which had not required presence of all offenders at the time of the commission of the offences but rather required participation in the criminal enterprise. The Court stated (at [63]) that the Crown needed to prove the accused’s continuing agreement to engage in particular conduct, participation by the accused, performance of all of the conduct necessary to commit the offence by one or more of the parties to the agreement, and that the accused had the requisite mens rea.
	
	
	An appeal from that decision was dismissed by the High Court (Likiardopoulos v The Queen (2012) 247 CLR 265; [2012] HCA 37) the plurality making the remarks to which I have referred at [34] above.
	
	
	In R v Prochilo [2003] NSWCCA 265, a case involving the unlawful supply of drugs, Smart AJ without reference to authority stated (at [59]) that presence at the scene of the supply was one way of proving participation in the joint criminal enterprise but not the only way. Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Greg James J agreed.
	
	
	In Sever v R [2010] NSWCCA 135, in upholding an appeal against a conviction for arson, Latham J with whom Schmidt J agreed, made the following remarks:
	


“[146]    It is, of course, possible for the Crown to mount a case based on joint criminal enterprise where the accused is not present at the commission of the offence ; Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75 at [27], [93] ; (1998) 197 CLR 316 at 329-330, 350; R v Prochilo [2003] NSWCCA 265. However, the existence of the agreement or enterprise, and the participation in it by the accused in such a case cannot be inferred from the circumstances in which the offence is committed, because (to state the obvious) there is no evidence of what the accused said and/or did during the commission of the offence. The jury must look to evidence of events, other than those pertaining to the offence itself, for proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence and scope of the agreement, and the accused’s participation in it.

[147]   In the instant case, there was a complete absence of evidence of that character. There was no evidence of the identity of a potential co-offender. There was no evidence of conversations between the accused and others that were capable of amounting to an agreement to commit an offence. There was no evidence of acts on the part of the accused, such as the transfer of a large amount of money to another or the purchase of material linked to the fire, that suggested an intention to carry out such an agreement.”


	
	The question remains whether the directions were adequate to convey to the jury that it was necessary for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant participated in the enterprise. The directions must be considered in the context of both the Crown case and that of the applicant. The trial judge summarised their respective cases in the manner I have set out at [24] above.
	
	
	That summary shows that the Crown case was that the applicant and the alleged co-offenders had entered into an agreement to travel to Sylvania Waters, to break and enter into houses, to steal property, to take the property and dispose of it amongst the four alleged partners to the agreement; and/or to steal the motor vehicles from the road and that the applicant participated in this agreement and its execution. The case for the applicant put each of those matters in issue.
	
	
	I have set out the relevant directions above. With some hesitation I think the directions made it sufficiently clear to the jury that the applicant could only be liable if in addition to entering into the agreement he participated in the agreed criminal activity.
	
	
	I do not think that the early part of the direction, which I have set out at [19] above, made it clear that it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied that the applicant in fact participated in the alleged criminal activity. Taken alone, the first paragraph does not state that to be necessary. Further the Easter egg example in the second paragraph does not make the requirement of participation clear, or that anything more than the agreement and the subsequent commission of the crime is necessary for liability to arise. The same may be said of the next paragraph where the trial judge instructed the jury they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was “a member” of that agreement or a participant (emphasis added).
	
	
	If the direction had been left at that point it would seem to me that it was inadequate to convey to the jury the need for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant participated in the criminal enterprise as distinct from simply entering into an agreement that it be undertaken. However, a subsequent part of the direction to which I have referred (at [20]), in particular the remarks that “[t]he Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was a participant in the commission of that crime as part of a joint enterprise with one or more of the other persons named” adequately conveyed that participation in the agreed enterprise was necessary for liability to arise.
	
	
	I should indicate that if I had been of the opinion that the need to prove participation in the enterprise was not conveyed to the jury, I would have granted leave to rely on the ground pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Such a failure in the particular circumstances of the case would have deprived the applicant of a real chance of acquittal.
	
	
	In these circumstances, this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 1 – verdicts unreasonable and cannot be supported because applicant not a party to specific agreement to commit offence, and/or applicant not present when each offence committed

The applicant’s submissions

Particularisation of the agreement


	
	This ground of appeal involved two main contentions. The first related to the particularisation of the agreement between the co-offenders. The applicant submitted that a “broad-brush” agreement to break in anywhere and steal anything was not sufficiently specific to be relied upon for the purpose of the law of joint criminal enterprise. He submitted that above a certain breadth, the agreement is no more than a mutual intention to explore the possibility of committing an offence or offences, submitting that was not an “agreement” for the purpose of attracting criminal liability. Rather, greater specificity was said to be needed before criminal liability for particular offences could be imputed to the applicant.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the Crown having run a “broad-brush” agreement case, the applicant submitted the evidence of conversations and conduct prior to 3:29am on 14 August 2013 did not allow any conclusion to be safely drawn about the details or nature of the purpose for which the applicant travelled to Sylvania Waters, other than it was likely illegal. He noted that the Crown case was not that he had gone to Sylvania Waters to fulfil a pre-existing plan of motorbike theft. In that context, the applicant’s reference to “bikes” in the phone call made by QF to Kayla at 11:53pm was said to hold less significance. This was because the agreed facts were that the garage containing the 3 motorbikes stolen was not broken into until after midnight on 14 August 2013. He submitted this meant that the bikes in this phone call could not have been the stolen motorbikes the subject of Count 5.
	
	
	In addressing the fact that a call occurred between Mr Nagle and Mr Hastings at 11:52pm which included discussions about a “green one”, a “450” and a “KX”, counsel for the applicant submitted that while it was “tempting” to “join the dots” and conclude this conversation must have been about the green and black 2013 Kawasaki which was stolen (Count 5), there was no evidence before the jury of earlier reconnaissance, or of the garage having a window. On this basis he submitted that there was nothing from which a finder of fact could rationally conclude that the conversation was about the particular Kawasaki that was stolen, because of the agreed fact that this motorcycle was not stolen until after midnight, at least 8 minutes after the call had concluded.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that joint criminal enterprises can be formed “on the spot” and in an “informal way”, submitting that it is likely that the decisions to break into the relevant places, steal the things stolen and take them away the subjects of counts 1-5 were formed in an ad hoc manner by those at the scene participating in it. However, he submitted that the Crown did not put its case on the basis that all 4 co-offenders were together at the relevant times in Sylvania Waters, a position from which it would have been possible to suggest that there was communication between them to the effect that the offences the subject of Counts 1-5 should be committed, and that plainly they were not in fact together at the relevant times.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown alleged a “free-floating arrangement” that could not found liability for the decision of one or more of those roaming the streets of Sylvania Waters to actually break into a property and steal things, in the absence of any evidence that the applicant had assented to each of those specific plans. It submitted that the evidence in fact indicated that the applicant had failed to make the jump from an agreement to explore with an eye to theft to an agreement to commit a specific offence. It submitted that there must rationally have remained doubt that the offences were committed before 3:29am, after which time the applicant stated he was “cuttin’”. The generalised intent to investigate targets for theft only became a concrete plan caught by the principles of joint criminal enterprise, he submitted, when the agreement was reached between the parties present and able to assist.
	
	
	The applicant conceded that the evidence could lead to the inference that the applicant was in a joint criminal enterprise to steal a trailer, but submitted that the fact of the “trailer” phone call at 3:29am meant that the applicant was physically separated from QF at the time he made the phone call stating that the trailer had a lock on it, and the applicant decided to go, stating “I’m cuttin’”. The applicant submitted that this had to be read with the fact that by 4:49am the applicant was back in Rooty Hill, the trailer actually stolen was unsecured so it could not have been the one in that conversation and that by 4:48am Mr Nagle and the unidentified male did not know where the applicant was. He also pointed to a phone call between Mr Nagle and the applicant at 1:04pm on 14 August 2013 where the applicant asked “how’d you go with the ikebay [bike] and that?” as leading to the inference that the applicant had no knowledge of what occurred in relation to a bike stolen on the night until that point.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that any enterprise to steal a trailer expired on the applicant’s decision to depart, without having borne fruit when he stated “I’m cuttin’”. He submitted that it was not open to the jury acting rationally to infer that the theft which occurred, which was of an unlocked trailer, was pursuant to an agreement involving the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant submitted he was not relying on the evidence to establish withdrawal from a criminal enterprise, but rather the position was that the particular enterprise which the jury could infer he was a part of ended without bearing fruit.
	
	
	At the hearing, counsel for the applicant conceded that if an agreement existed between three people to go to Sylvania Waters to steal unidentified property from an unidentified location and two went ahead and stole particular items, the third could be liable for the theft of those particular items if that third person had done some identifiable act of active participation. However, counsel maintained the difference in this case was that the generalised agreement was over before bearing fruit.
	
	
	Counsel agreed that it would come down to whether the intention to “cut” made by the applicant was something the Crown was not able to adequately deal with such that there remained a doubt about the applicant’s continuing participation. He submitted that there was nothing about the applicant’s stated intention to leave that prevented other persons from making an agreement to do what they had originally intended, and carry that enterprise into effect.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also submitted that the conversation in which the applicant stated “I’m cuttin’” strongly suggested that the enterprise was not complete at that point, such that the possibility that all of counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were committed after the applicant made that comment, that is, after 3:29am, could not be excluded. He submitted that on the evidence it was therefore not open to a jury acting rationally to conclude that the joint criminal enterprise involved in the commission of the specific offences the subject of counts 1-5 was one to which the appellant was a part.
	


Presence


	
	The second contention contained within this ground was that even if the above argument was rejected, the Crown case on each count fails if the applicant’s presence is not proved. I have dealt with this in dealing with Ground 2 above. However, the question remains whether it was unreasonable for the jury to have concluded that the applicant participated in the criminal enterprise the subject of the charges. The submissions relating to presence are relevant to that issue.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that he could not have been present at the time of the offences, based on a “common sense approach” to the facts. The relevant facts included: the length of the journey between Sylvania Waters and Rooty Hill, his stated intention to be “cuttin’ now”, the inference to be drawn that no trailer had been stolen by 3:29am, the fact that the co-offenders had lost the applicant some time before 4:48am, the alleged ignorance of the applicant at 1:04pm on 14 August 2013 as to how a co-offender went with the “ikebay [bike]” and the fact that the telephone tracking records did not show the applicant remained in Sylvania Waters after 3:29am.
	
	
	The applicant also pointed to the fact that by 3:29am he had apparently abandoned an attempt to steal a trailer and stated his decision to leave, and that if the Crown case were accepted and the trailer was used to transport stolen motorbikes, the applicant would have had no need to ask “how’d you go with the ikebay [bike]”. He further submitted that the fact of telephone contact indicated that the 4 co-offenders were not together at all times and the tracking evidence was incapable of proving that the applicant was ever at any of the scenes of Counts 1-5.
	


The Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown correctly submitted that the Court was required to make an independent assessment as to the sufficiency and quality of the evidence in accordance with the principles set out in Gilham v The Queen (2012) 224 A Crim R 22; [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [465]-[466].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in line with its position on Ground 2, the participation of the applicant, not his presence, was at issue.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the cell tower evidence showing the movements of the applicant to and from Sylvania Waters at the relevant times. In relation to the applicant’s argument referred to at [63] above that the 11:53pm phone call in which the applicant referred to “bikes” could not have related to the stolen property, the Crown pointed to the conversation at 11:52pm between QF and Mr Hastings. In that phone call QF indicated that he had located a “13 250” and was “trying to find tools”, and had stated “we’re going to go to the other ones, get them, then put them in here and come back do this one”. The Crown submitted that this evidence allowed for the conclusion that the motorcycles were seen before they were stolen, which the Crown submitted dispensed with the applicant’s argument that he was speaking about bikes that were not the motorcycles the subject of Count 5. It further submitted that the process of reasoning advanced by the applicant was to explain away every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence, which was warned against by the court in R v Micallef (2002) 136 A Crim R 127; [2002] NSWCCA 480.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s submission that the evidence only disclosed a mutual intention to explore the possibility of committing an offence, the Crown pointed to the fact that a car fitting the description of “full weapon hottie” was located burnt out in Blacktown with a trailer attached to it. It further noted that QF stated he was looking for tools just before the applicant was heard speaking in his presence, noting that Count 4 related to the theft of tools, and that the later calls supported a conclusion that the applicant had a financial interest in the proceeds of the offences. The Crown submitted that this all evidenced the agreement and the participation of the applicant in the offences for which he was charged.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the applicant’s submission that any joint criminal enterprise expired without being finalised (see [68]-[69] above) after the applicant had stated “I’m cuttin’”. It was submitted that this contention did not sit well with the conversations in which QF stated he was walking around the waters trying to find tools, and the conversation a minute later where the applicant could be heard in the background of QF’s phone call discussing “all the bikes” and a “full weapon hottie”. The Crown also emphasised that in the 3:29am “trailer conversation” the applicant said ‘Let’s just go’, i.e. ‘Let us go’, submitting this did not lend support to a contention that the applicant was off on a frolic of his own rather than acting pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The Crown further pointed to the fact that the unidentified male answered the applicant’s phone at 4:48am and stated to “listen out for the bike” when questioned about the applicant’s whereabouts. It also noted a phone call on 14 August at 7:03pm which in its submission evidenced that Mr Nagle collected one of the bikes from the applicant’s house. The Crown submitted that the conclusion to be drawn was that the applicant became tired of seeking to obtain a trailer to take the bike (the 2008 Wr250 Yamaha) away and instead rode it from Sylvania Waters to his house. At the hearing, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the jury could infer from the conversation where the applicant indicated an intention to be “cuttin’"" not an intention to withdraw from the enterprise, but rather that he was leaving the area on his own steam, namely, aboard the stolen motorcycle.
	
	
	In relation to the conversation at 1:04pm on 14 August where the applicant asked QF about the ‘ikebay’, it was submitted that the applicant was referring to QF’s efforts to sell the 2013 Kawasaki 250 and revealed his interest in the stolen property, not a lack of knowledge of the motorcycles.
	
	
	The Crown concluded that all of the evidence disclosed that the circumstances were such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the applicant.
	


Consideration


	
	The principles on which a court will set aside a verdict as unreasonable are well established. In SKA v The Queen (2011) 243 CLR 400; [2011] HCA 13 at [11]-[14], the Court stated the approach to be adopted was that laid down in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; [1994] HCA 63 at 492-494, namely that the Court is required to make its own “independent assessment of the evidence”. If after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury in determining the question of guilt or innocence and the benefit of the jury having seen or heard the evidence, the Court is left in doubt as to the reasonableness of the verdict, the verdict should be set aside. In M supra the Court also stated (at 494) that “[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced” and “[i]t is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt … that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred”: see also MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606; [2002] HCA 53 at [59].
	
	
	As was pointed out by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559; [2007] HCA 30 at [113] (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing), for a verdict to be unreasonable it is not enough that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for a jury to reach a different conclusion. However, for a Court to conclude there was no miscarriage, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. If after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the Court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving the doubt that the Court can conclude that there was no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In considering the issue in a case such as the present where the Crown relies on circumstantial evidence, it is important to bear in mind that the task of the appellate court is to consider and weigh all the circumstances in considering and deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence. The evidence is not to be looked at in a piecemeal fashion: R v Baden-Clay (2016) 90 ALJR 1013; [2016] HCA 35 at [46]-[48].
	
	
	In my opinion it was open to the jury in the sense described in SKA supra and Libke supra to conclude that the circumstantial evidence established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the applicant on each count.
	
	
	I have set out below the reasons I have reached this conclusion. It is convenient to deal with the charges in a somewhat different order to that which appeared on the indictment.
	


Count 4: Tools


	
	The transcript of the phone calls showed that QF spoke to Mr Hastings at 11:52pm from Mr Nagle’s phone, stating they had been “just … walking around on the waters, bro, trying to find some tools”, discussed a “13 250” and that they were “going to go to the other ones, get them, then put them in there and come back do this one”. One minute later, at 11:53pm, QF called Kayla and the applicant was heard in the background of that call. The applicant stated that “once we get a van bra we’ll just [intelligible] all the bikes [unintelligible]” and “[m]others we will get a full weapon hottie”. It was open to the jury to conclude that the applicant was present with QF and Mr Nagle at 11:52pm and included in the “we” who were walking around “the waters” trying to find tools. The jury could also have concluded that these tools were those which were in fact stolen at some point after midnight on 14 August 2013, the subject of Count 4 and that the applicant participated in walking around and trying to find those tools. This participation was sufficient to found liability under the principles of joint criminal enterprise for Count 4.
	


Count 5: Motorbikes


	
	It was also open to the jury to conclude on the evidence of these phone calls that the motorbikes the subject of Count 5 were viewed before the point at which they were stolen, which according to the agreed facts, was after midnight on 14 August 2013. Contrary to the applicant’s submission, it was open for a jury to conclude that the references to motorbikes in the 11:52pm phone call matching the description of the motorbikes which were in fact stolen were the same “bikes” the applicant referred to in the 11:53pm phone call. While the agreed facts were that the offences were not committed until after midnight, this does not preclude the drawing of the inference that the co-offenders identified the bikes prior to carrying out the theft. Further this evidence must be considered in the context of the later communication between the applicant and QF and Mr Nagle which tended to suggest the applicant had a financial interest in the proceeds of the sale of the bikes.
	


Count 3: Trailer


	
	As the applicant conceded, the applicant’s 3:29am phone call expressing his frustration to QF that the trailer in front of him was locked is sufficient to evidence that the applicant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to steal a trailer. The fact that he stated at the end of that phone call “I’m cuttin’” does not preclude his participation in the enterprise which resulted in the theft of the unlocked trailer the subject of Count 3.
	
	
	This is because the phone call evidence must be considered in the context of the fact that a trailer and a car matching the description of a “full weapon hottie” were found burnt out in Blacktown and the phone cell tower evidence suggesting that QF was in the vicinity of Blacktown South at approximately 4:30am on 14 August 2013. If the applicant’s argument that the unlocked trailer the subject of Count 3 must have been stolen after 3:29am is accepted, it does not preclude the conclusion that the applicant was nevertheless participating in an enterprise to steal a trailer, albeit that the particular trailer was not stolen until after 3.29am.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant may not have been present when the unlocked trailer was in fact stolen does not preclude liability for its theft. His participation in identifying a suitable trailer “up the road” and in fact attempting to steal the locked trailer is sufficient to found liability. Contrary to the applicant’s submission, the agreement to steal a trailer did not end at the point that the locked trailer was abandoned and the applicant announced his intention to “cut”. Rather, it was open to the jury to find that the co-offenders proceeded to unlawfully acquire the trailer the subject of Count 3 pursuant to their subsisting agreement, being the trailer found with the Ford Ranger in Blacktown. Further, the remark by the applicant “I’m cuttin” did not signal withdrawal from that enterprise. This is for two reasons. First, it was open to the jury to conclude from the telephone calls I have referred to at [11] and [12] above, that the applicant rode off on one of the stolen bikes and was involved in arrangements for their disposal, thus evidencing continuing participation in the enterprise. Second, withdrawal from a joint criminal enterprise generally requires more than a mere change of mental intent and a quitting of the scene of the crime immediately prior to its actual commission. It is necessary that the person concerned at least attempts to take steps to undo the effect of his or her prior participation: White v Ridley (1978) 140 CLR 342; [1978] HCA 38 at 347-351, 354.
	


Counts 1 & 2: Wallet, keys to Ford Ranger, mobile phone and Ford Ranger


	
	The phone call at 11.53pm considered in the context of all the evidence, meant it was open to a jury to conclude that the applicant was part of an agreement to steal a vehicle in order to transport the bikes. It was the prosecution case at trial that in the following statement “[o]nce we get a van bra we’ll just [intelligible] all the bikes”, the unintelligible word was “load”. The original recordings of the intercepted calls were provided to the jury for their consideration. It was open to a jury to accept that this was “load”, evidencing the participation of the applicant in an agreement to transport “bikes” using “a van”, or as is later discussed, “a full weapon hottie” and a trailer. It must also be noted that the cell tower data evidenced that the applicant was located in the Sylvania Waters area at that time and then at 2:41am and it was put to the jury, and in my opinion it was open for them to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant remained in that area throughout this time participating in the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	In addition, the fact that this was a circumstantial case means that all of the evidence must be considered as a whole. Phone calls occurring in the days following 13 August 2013 evidence that the applicant was involved in various discussions about the sale of the bikes and had a financial interest in the proceeds of the sale. In one conversation on the 14 August 2013 the applicant stated “I need cash, you know what I mean” in a conversation that it can be inferred relates to the sale of one of the stolen bikes. I do not accept the applicant’s contention that he was ignorant of what happened to the bike at 1:04pm on 14 August 2013 because he asked QF how he went with the “ikebay”. I accept the Crown’s submission that it was open to conclude the applicant was referring to QF’s effort to sell the bike and that it revealed his financial interest in the stolen property. The question suggested he did have knowledge of the theft of the bikes, not the contrary.
	
	
	What I have written above is also sufficient to dispose of the applicant’s argument based on the fact that the agreement lacks sufficient specificity to be relied upon. It was open to the jury to conclude that the agreement ultimately embodied the theft of particular items the subject of Counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 and of a trailer to carry the bikes. This was sufficient to affix the applicant with liability for the theft of the particular items which were stolen for that purpose including the trailer.
	
	
	It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the result, I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of considering, in draft, the judgment of the Chief Justice.  I agree with the reasons and proposed orders of the Chief Justice.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

4575022,"R v AFSARI, Abbas AKA Shayan [2016] NSWDC 419","Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Shayan Afsari appears for sentence in respect of a number of offences. The first is supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25(1A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty provided is 20 years' imprisonment and/or 3500 penalty units. When being sentenced in respect of that offence he asks to have taken into account three offences contained on a Form 1, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	Those three offences are firstly, supply an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, being 4.17 grams of 3,4–methylenedioxymethamphetamine in respect of which the maximum penalty is 15 years’ imprisonment and/or 2000 penalty units.
	
	
	The second offence is supply an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, being 10.06 grams amphetamine. The maximum penalty is again 15 years and/or 2000 penalty units.
	
	
	The third offence is knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime, being $4390 and, again, the maximum penalty is 15 years and/or 2000 penalty units.
	
	
	In addition to the three matters on the Form 1, asked to be taken into account in respect of the primary offence, there are a number of offences contained on a s 166 certificate to which the offender has entered pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The first of those is possess a prohibited drug, being 8.48 grams of Stanzolol, contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty is two years imprisonment.
	
	
	The second is a further offence contrary to the same section of possessing a prohibited drug, being 0.96 grams of cocaine.
	
	
	The third offence is again contrary to the same section: possess a prohibited drug, being 11.6 grams of cannabis leaf.
	
	
	The fourth offence is possess a restricted substance, contrary to s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act, being 4.98 grams of Alprazolam, in relation to which the maximum penalty is six months.
	
	
	The fifth offence is possess instructions for the manufacture of a prohibited drug contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 s 11C(1). The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment.
	
	
	There is no standard non-parole period in relation to any of the offences provided by the legislation.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts as provided to the Court on 1 September 2016 are as follows:
	


1. On February 2015, police commenced Strike Force Minnamorra to investigate the offender Shayan Afsari and his associates. Police were granted a telecommunications service warrant in relation to certain phone numbers which were being used by the offender.

SUPPLY PROHIBITED DRUG ON AN ONGOING BASIS - METHYLAMPHETAMINE

2. Between 24 April 2015 and 22 May 2015 police lawfully intercepted over 200 phone calls and SMS text messages sent or received by the offender relating to the supply of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. A code was used by the offender when negotiating and arranging the supply of methylamphetamine over the phone.

3. Having made the arrangements with a customer over the phone, the offender or another designated driver travelled in the offender’s car to meet with the customer in order to supply the methylamphetamine in exchange for payment of money. This was captured by police physical surveillance.

4. On more than three separate occasions between 24 April 2015 and 22 May 2015 the offender supplied methylamphetamine for financial reward using this method of telephone contact and delivery.

5. During execution of a search warrant at the offender's premises on 22 May 2015, a total of 36.15 grams methylamphetamine was located by police. This methylamphetamine was held by the offender as stock to service future supplies to customers. The methylamphetamine was located in two separate containers under the house, along with electronic scales, packets of resealable plastic bags and other items used in the supply of prohibited drugs. The purity of 25.31 grams of the methylamphetamine was determined to be 81.5%.

SEARCH WARRANT

6. On Friday 22 May 2015, the offender left his premises in his car and was stopped by police in Lilac Street, Punchbowl, where he was searched. In his possession was a mobile phone with a SIM card for one of the numbers that was being intercepted, as well as $600 in Australian currency which was seized. The offender was cautioned, arrested and taken to Bankstown Police Station.

7. A short time later, police executed a search warrant at the offender's premises at 9 Telopea Street, Punchbowl. The offender elected to return to the premises to observe the search warrant.

8. During the search warrant the following items were located and seized by police:

In the offender’s bedroom:-


	
	8.48 grams Stanzolol (92 tablets) in the wardrobe. Stanzolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid;
	
	
	4 aluminium foil packages containing 3.6 grams of cannabis in the bottom bedside table drawer;
	
	
	a Blackberry mobile phone; and
	
	
	a Nokia mobile phone.
	


In the garage:


	
	1 resealable plastic bag containing 0.5 grams cannabis in a hole in the side wall of the garage.
	


In the garden shed:


	
	one resealable plastic bag containing 2.1 grams of cannabis;
	
	
	one Glad resealable plastic bag containing 5.4 grams of cannabis; and
	
	
	one Dettol container containing five white envelopes and $1,240.
	


Underneath the house:


	
	one crab chips container which held: $2,550;
	
	
	one plastic bag containing 10.84 grams methylamphetamine;
	
	
	10.06 grams amphetamine (31 pills and powder) wrapped in plastic;
	
	
	four packets of resealable plastic bags;
	
	
	one set of electronic scales;
	
	
	one USB drive which contained instructions for the manufacture/production of the prohibited drugs cocaine and methylamphetamine;
	
	
	one white coffee stain remover container which held one Glad resealable bag containing 4.98 grams Alprazolam (19 Xanax) tablets;
	
	
	one Glad resealable bag containing 4.17 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine;
	
	
	one Glad resealable plastic bag containing 25.31 grams methylamphetamine, one set of electronic scales;
	
	
	one cuticle pusher and spoon;
	
	
	three packets of resealable bags; and
	
	
	one plastic bag and rubber band;
	


In the front letterbox:


	
	two Glad resealable plastic bags containing a total of 0.96 grams cocaine.
	


FORM 1 OFFENCES

Supply prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1)

9. A total of 4.17 grams of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine was located during the search and was in the offender’s possession for the purpose of supply. This was later tested and found to have a purity of 76%.

Supply prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1):

10. A total of 10.6 grams of amphetamine was located and was in the offender's possession for the purpose of supply. This was later tested and found to have a purity of 1.5%.

Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act:

11. A total of $4390 in Australian currency, which was the proceeds of crime, was located.

SECTION 166 CERTIFICATE OFFENCES

12. 8.48 grams Stanzolol was located.

13. 0.96 grams of cocaine was located.

14. A total of 11.6 grams of cannabis was located.

15. 4.98 grams Alprazolam was located.

16. A USB drive was located which contained instructions for the manufacture/production of the prohibited drugs cocaine and methylamphetamine.

17. The offender declined to be electronically interviewed but was subjected to a DNA buccal swab forensic procedure. Later analysis revealed the offender's DNA and fingerprints on a number of the plastic bags, containers and electronic scales which were located by police.


	
	Those were the facts as agreed and originally presented to the Court. In respect of that portion of the facts dealing with the primary count of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis, the facts did not provide the Court with any significant information in relation to which the objective seriousness of that offence could be determined. They could be summarised as providing that the intercepts demonstrated that the offender, on more than three separate occasions within the time period, supplied methylamphetamine for financial reward, taking orders by telephone and making delivery by vehicle, either by himself or by another, and using code in that process.
	
	
	The objective criminality of an offence under s 25A is determined by reference not only to the number of instances of supply and the individual quantities but also to the repetition, system and organisation of the ongoing supplies. The Agreed Facts constituted the barest outline of an offence which did not permit the Court to assess the objective seriousness of the offence. Accordingly, the parties were requested to provide further information to remedy that patent deficit in the material provided.
	
	
	On 4 November 2016, a new set of facts were provided which I will refer to as “additional Agreed Facts”. They included additional paragraphs. Inserted between the original para 2 and para 3 was an explanation of the code. The insertion was,
	


""A code was used by the offender when negotiating and arranging the supply of methylamphetamine over the phone. In the text messages and phone calls the offender used terms such as 'pizza', 'chicken' and 'cold' to describe drugs. The offender rarely referred to the drugs by quantity and instead referred to them by value.""


	
	A further paragraph was provided to expand on the content of the original para 4. It is as follows:
	


“On more than three separate occasions between 24 April 2015 and 20 May 2015 the offender supplied methylamphetamine for financial reward using this method of telephone contact and delivery. The Crown relies on the following three instances of supplying methylamphetamine for financial reward:

1. On 25 April 2015 the offender supplied methylamphetamine to a customer at approximately 12pm behind a 7 Eleven shop. The offender received $150 for the drugs.

2. On 6 May 2015 the offender arranged for a driver to supply methylamphetamine for $200 to a customer called Jamie. The exchange took place at Punchbowl train station.

3. On 20 May 2015 the offender supplied methylamphetamine to a customer for $100 in Ryde. He also provided the customer with five Alprazolam tablets.”


	
	In regard to the additional information provided, it is evident from the amounts received that the individual quantities supplied must have been of a comparatively small nature that is likely to have been substantially less than one gram on each occasion.
	
	
	In relation to the third matter referred to, the additional information that he also provided the customer with five Alprozolam tablets is irrelevant to the charge, being the ongoing supply of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	In terms of the geographical area over which the offender was prepared to provide the prohibited drug methylamphetamine, he resided at Punchbowl, was prepared to deliver or have delivered to Punchbowl station and was also prepared to deliver or have delivered methylamphetamine to somewhere in Ryde. There is no further information as to the overall geographic area to which the offender was prepared to conduct a delivery service himself or by way of a driver.
	
	
	There is no evidence as to whether there was only one other driver: that is whether the operation of distribution was any more significant than the offender and one other person who was prepared to drive a motor vehicle, nor is there any evidence other than the agreement that he distributed on more than three separate occasions. That would of course allow a conclusion that there must at least have been four implied by the Agreed Facts.
	
	
	As to the 200 telephone calls and SMS text messages referred to, there is no evidence as to how many of the calls related to any of the individual itemised supplies. That is, there could have been approximately 66 phone calls or SMS messages per delivery or, if there were four supplies, 50 phone calls or SMS messages per delivery. The facts do not take the matter beyond that point. That there were 66 or 50 telephone calls or SMS messages per delivery is at the least highly improbable.
	
	
	The Crown's submissions on sentence refer to 25.34 grams of methylamphetamine located in the offender's house as being included in the charge of ongoing supply: ""This is included in the charge of ongoing supply. The offender had possession of this stock of drugs for the purpose of supplying it to future customers.""
	
	
	The facts disclosed that there were two quantities of methylamphetamine located in the house or underneath the house, being 25.31 grams of methylamphetamine located underneath the house in the white coffee stain remover container, and 10.84 grams of methylamphetamine located underneath the house in the crab chips container. The total of those two amounts is 36.15 grams. A charge of ongoing supply must relate to what are in fact supplies, of which the legislation requires at least three within the period. The possession of 36.15 grams of methylamphetamine located in the garage at his home, in my view, cannot be taken into account as relevant to a charge of ongoing supply. The offender is not charged in respect of the two quantities of methylamphetamine totalling 36.15 grams.
	
	
	De Simoni [1981] 147 CLR 383 is authority for the proposition that a sentencer is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused including that which would aggravate the offence but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence. Although not directly on point in relation to this matter, where the facts disclose an entirely different offence, that is, possession of 36.15 grams which would no doubt qualify as a separate offence of supply, the point in De Simoni is however still relevant to this matter. I make this point to indicate that I will in no way take into account in sentencing Mr Afsari the fact that there was a total of 36.15 grams of methylamphetamine located underneath the house in which he resided and that I reject the submission made by the Crown that it can be regarded as being included in the ongoing supply offence as being his stock for the purpose of future supply.
	
	
	The search of the offender’s house located stashes of drugs in the bedroom, the garage, the garden shed, the letterbox and underneath the house. A number of items being indicia of supply, including resealable bags containing small quantities of various drugs, packets of resealable bags, larger bags containing bulkier quantities of drugs, disposable burn phones and two sets of electronic scales were also located. Underneath the house were two containers holding all of the necessary means to divide and distribute methylamphetamine and other prohibited drugs into smaller packages for supply.
	
	
	The offender concealed the drugs in locations where they would be difficult to see, such as inside the wall in the garage and underneath the house. There is no explanation for why what I would take to be two approximately half gram deal bags of cocaine were located in the letterbox. They would, in those circumstances, be hardly hidden from any member of the family. Presumably they were there either because they had been delivered by someone to the offender’s post-box or they had been placed in the offender’s letterbox for the purpose of someone else collecting them. The MDMA underneath the house was of high purity, 76%, and was more than three times the indictable quantity for this type of drug, the indictable quantity being 1.25 grams.
	
	
	The amphetamines were of low purity, 1.5%, although there was 10.06 grams. The indictable quantity in respect of amphetamine is five grams. The offender had in excess of two times the indictable quantity.
	
	
	Located in the house was a USB stick containing instructions for the manufacture of cocaine and methamphetamine. While that demonstrates his general interest in prohibited drugs, there was nothing located that indicates that he had been or was intending to be involved in the manufacture of either of those substances.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty to supplying three different kinds of drugs, methylamphetamine, MDMA and amphetamine. The additional facts indicate at least a supply of several tablets of Alprazolam on one occasion, although he is not charged with such a supply, but only with the possession of some 19 Xanax tablets. He was also in possession of a variety of prohibited drugs, being cocaine, Stanzolol and cannabis leaf in addition to those already referred to.
	
	
	It can be reasonably said that the offender had available to him a smorgasbord of prohibited or restricted drugs, and that he was operating a business of supplying at least the prohibited drug methylamphetamine in respect of which coded telephone and SMS messages were utilised to place orders and arrange delivery either by himself and/or at least one other. I accept the Crown’s submission that this was a well organised drug supply operation in which the offender played the principal role.
	
	
	Mr James QC, who appeared for the offender, accepted on the facts that the offender had a principal role and that the facts disclosed an organised and planned criminal activity. He also accepted that the activity was for financial gain, although he submitted that it was of a limited kind. As to the organised and planned criminal activity in respect of the offence of ongoing supply, that is of course essentially taken into account by the nature of the offence itself, but the presence of the other materials located by way of prohibited and restricted drugs and indicia of supply, including the amounts relevant to the two supply offences on the Form 1 and the proceeds of crime offence, confirm as a general proposition that the offender was conducting an organised criminal activity.
	
	
	There is a long line of authority commencing with the case of R v Clark, (unreported, 15 March 1990, NSWCCA) which indicates where an individual offender can be seen to have been substantially involved in supply they must receive a full time custodial sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances. That line of authority includes such cases as Blanco, (unreported, 22 October 2987, NSWCCA) Thompson (unreported, 4 April 1994, NSWCCA) and the policy behind that line of authority has been held to be a rule to which sentencing judges must give serious consideration, Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 Howie, J; Cacciola [1998] 104 A Crim R 178.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the accused accepted that a term of imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty in respect of these matters.
	
	
	The Court is required to assess the objective seriousness of the offences in relation to which it must sentence the offender. In this matter it would be artificial to assess the objective seriousness of the individual offences without taking into account the overall circumstances, even though those overall circumstances relate to individual and separate offences. In my view, the offending conduct of Mr Afsari falls within the midrange of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The offender was committed for sentence on 9 December 2015 from the Burwood Local Court. I accept that the plea of guilty in relation to each of the matters was at the earliest opportunity and that he is entitled in respect of each sentence to be provided with a 25% discount for the utility of the plea alone. Such a discount will be provided.
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS


	
	The offender did not give evidence on sentence and subjective matters have been drawn from the following:
	


1. The offender’s criminal history;

2. New South Wales Department of Corrective Services Conviction, Sentences and Appeals Report;

3. The pre-sentence report of Vincent Melton, Community Corrections Officer, dated 1 November 2016,

4. The report of Mr Borenstein, psychologist, dated 19 October 2016,

5. The report of Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 20 August 2014, prepared in relation to previous offending,

6. A letter to the court from Kiana Afsari dated 3 November 2016, being the mother of the offender.


	
	The offender is a 28 year old with no dependants. He was born in Iran and came to Australia at the age of five with his family. He completed Year 11 at school but left because of difficulties arising in his parents’ relationship. He is said to have left school to assist in looking after two younger siblings while his mother entered the workforce. He claims to have been above average at school and to have gotten on well with teachers and never having been expelled or suspended.
	
	
	His parents separated for approximately a year. During his developmental years he was exposed to some domestic violence but no sexual or physical abuse.
	
	
	In 2010/11 his parents lost the home in which they lived because they could not make repayments, and that was an underlying matter in relation to his parents’ separation for a period.
	
	
	He is said to have completed a Certificate IV in General Construction at TAFE and while in custody he is said to have sought work and training. He informed the pre-sentence officer that for a period of 12 months prior to his arrest he worked as a part time cleaner which was confirmed with a former employer. I note in that regard that the August 2014 report of Dr Stephen Allnutt referred, at several locations in the report, to him building his own cleaning company. The employer who confirmed his employment regarded him as a valued employee who worked hard and got on well with his colleagues.
	
	
	His criminal history discloses that in 2006, 2007 and 2008 he had a number of offences in relation to the use of motor vehicles, such as driving while disqualified, or using a mobile phone and driving while suspended, negligent driving and not giving particulars to other driver, and a further offence of drive motor vehicle while suspended in 2013. Those offences are of no significant relevance to sentence in respect of these matters. However, of significance is that in October 2013 he was charged with three offences, being supply prohibited drug more than indictable quantity, knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime and supply of a prohibited drug. Those matters were dealt with on 28 November 2014 by Frearson SC DCJ. Tendered as part of the Crown material are the facts that were then before the Court as well as a copy of his Honour’s reasons on sentence, to which I will refer shortly.
	
	
	His Honour imposed three concurrent Intensive Correction Orders: in respect of the supply prohibited drug, a 12 month ICO, in respect of the knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime, a 20 month ICO and, in respect of the offence of supply a prohibited drug, an eight month ICO. Each of the orders commenced on 12 December 2014.
	
	
	The facts and his Honour’s reasons disclose that the offender was detected as a result of being observed to be driving a motor vehicle while using a mobile phone. He was stopped by police for that reason and, because the vehicle number plates indicated that the offender's driver’s licence was suspended, he was asked, ""Do you have anything inside the car that you should not have?"" and he replied, ""Yes, there is some cash, some phones and some drugs."" ""What types of drugs are there?"" and he replied, ""Methamphetamine and heroin."" There were 7.73 grams of methylamphetamine and 1.26 grams of heroin. Located in the vehicle was some $13,165 in cash and, on a subsequent search of his then residence in Marrickville, a further $4,320 was located, giving a total of $17,485.
	
	
	Some of the money in the vehicle, $875, was located in an envelope labelled ""eargay money"", ""eargay"" being pig Latin for ""gear"", in respect of which he said it was the proceeds from selling heroin, ""gear"" being a reference to heroin. I am, of course, not sentencing him for the offending involved on that occasion. That has already been dealt with by Frearson SC DCJ. However, what is of significance is that his offending on this occasion is not so different to the offending dealt with on 28 November 2014.
	
	
	In addition, the significance of those matters is that his offending in late April to late May 2015 was offending while he was subject to three separate Intensive Correction Orders and to supervision in respect of those orders. The commission of offences while subject to any form of conditional liberty is an aggravating circumstance, although it does not aggravate the objective seriousness of the offences which constitute the breach of conditional liberty.
	
	
	In R v Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464, Street CJ at 465, in referring to breaches of bail as being a serious aggravating factor, said that the protection of the community from those who abuse their liberty on bail to commit further offences calls for severely deterrent sentences which will ordinarily involve a significant accumulation of the sentence for any subsequent offences on top of the sentence to be passed, or passed for the original offence.
	
	
	Although his Honour was dealing with offences committed while at liberty on bail, his comment is however still relevant to offences committed while the subject of an Intensive Correction Order, a different form of conditional liberty. Similar comments have been made in the past in relation to breaches of parole, another form of conditional liberty: ""Parole is a privilege. An abuse of that privilege calls for a higher punishment."" McVeety [2002] NSWCCA 344. Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at 42:
	


""Offences committed while on parole demonstrate that rehabilitation which parole is designed to assist has failed and the court cannot proceed on the same expectation of rehabilitation that is open in other circumstances.""


	
	Greg James J in Huynh [2003] NSWCCA 239 stated that:
	


""...it is a consequence of having enjoyed conditional liberty upon an undertaking to be of good behaviour that if you breach that undertaking you aggravate your culpability for the offence you commit which constitutes the breach, you surrender the prospect of liberty which you have enjoyed conditionally upon your not committing a breach and you must expect to serve in custody the sentence from the custodial nature of which you have been liberated conditionally.""


	
	In Moffatt [1990] 20 NSWLR 114 it was held that the offender should not only suffer the revocation of his parole and the consequent need to serve out the balance of the original sentence, but should also suffer a significant punishment for the later offence to mark the gravity of his conduct in abusing his parole.
	
	
	While those matters deal with breaches of parole, the comments in each case that I have referred to are equally apposite to offending conduct where it is in breach of an Intensive Correction Order, as is the case here. That the offender, having received the benefit of three concurrent Intensive Correction Orders for serious similar offences, designed to assist him in rehabilitation, failed to abide by those orders within a period of approximately six months demonstrates a contempt for the criminal law and also a contempt for the beneficial sentences that were imposed. I note in respect of the previous offending, when sentencing, Judge Frearson said the following: [T4]
	


""I do take into account the actual quantities were not high and quantities are relevant to the criminality but not decisive. But regardless of the quantities it was a blatant and determined breach of the law. I conclude it does involve, in all the circumstances, substantial drug dealing. In relation to the knowingly dealing in the proceeds charge, the offender is not charged with the supplies that produced the profit, he is charged with the dealing in proceeds of crime. The amount itself is substantial. It was the profit of an organised and planned activity, indeed, distribution of drugs. Another blatant breach of the law.""


	
	His Honour referred to the report of Dr Allnutt, although not in detail. His Honour said: [T6]
	


""Is he remorseful? I accept that he is remorseful at this point. I consider he is now sorry for being involved in drug dealing. I do accept that he has got good prospects of rehabilitation. He is described to (sic) a low to moderate risk of reoffending. One would hope he would not reoffend, particularly in this way. I cannot conclude it is actually unlikely he will reoffend.""


	
	After imposing the Intensive Correction Orders that I have referred to, his Honour cautioned the offender in relation to the effect of any breach of the orders, including the following: [T8] ""So you be very careful while you are doing that Intensive Corrections Order to abide by all conditions and not to get into any trouble, particularly in relation to drugs. If you do that you’ve basically had it.""
	
	
	Clearly, the offender failed to listen or, if listening, failed to have any regard to his Honour's comments. While his Honour had available the psychiatric report of Dr Allnutt, in respect of these matters, provided to the Court on behalf of the offender is a psychological report from Mr Borenstein.
	
	
	There is no suggestion in either of Dr Allnutt's or Mr Borenstein's reports that the offender has any psychiatric disorder or is otherwise not cognitively intact. Mr Borenstein found that he had an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and substance dependency leading up to the offending, and that, at the time of consultation on 11 August 2016, he was in remission with regards to depression and substance dependency, the offender then being in custody.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt, in his August 2014 report, made a number of references to what the offender had said to him:
	


""With regard to his offending, he said, 'I took the easy way out…I wish I hadn’t done it. It has caused me so much problems…I was making an income at the expense of others…It’s illegal and it harms people, it destroys lives and affects the overall scheme for people.' He said he took responsibility for his offending…He said he intended to maintain abstinence…At the time that I saw your client he manifested remorse for his actions, he understood the deleterious effect that drugs have on society in general and was motivated to address his personal substance abuse.""


	
	It was perhaps thought unwise for the purpose of these proceedings to return to obtain a further report from Dr Allnutt, who had already had some exposure to the offender in the circumstances of the content of that report. There is no indication in the report of Mr Borenstein that he had been provided with the benefit of the report of Dr Allnutt. Mr Borenstein reported: ""Mr Afsari impressed as highly motivated to ensure he does not repeat old behaviours. Mr Afsari volunteered, 'I tried to fill a void with cannabis and now it is filled with my family and their love.'"" Earlier in the report:
	


""The decision to supply drugs was motivated exclusively by Mr Afsari's need for a supply of cannabis which he used to self-medicate against symptoms of depression. Since coming into prison Mr Afsari appears to have made significant positive steps. He has cut off all ties from those of similar culture or shared drug history. Mr Afsari is gainfully employed in the prison environment. He intends to undertake more extensive drug rehabilitation upon release from gaol. I believe there is a direct connection between Mr Afsari's depressed symptoms, his return to cannabis as a form of self-medication and the offending behaviour which allowed Mr Afsari a free and constant supply of cannabis. The road to recovery with respect to drug dependency is often problematic and rarely successful at the first attempt.""


	
	There is a theme which runs through each of the two reports of Dr Allnutt and Mr Borenstein in respect of the offender turning to self-medication with cannabis as a result of personal stresses, that is, the past breakdown of a relationship and business arrangement with his partner's father, and debt relating to that business breakdown preceding the offending dealt with by Frearson DCJ and a subsequent return to the use, in particular, of cannabis as self-medication as a result of a breakdown of a further different short term relationship while the subject of the ICO, described by the offender as being a “rebound relationship” – it is said that as the result of the breakdown of the short four month relationship:
	


""Mr Afsari returned to his default position. He commenced using cannabis as a form of self-medication. He returned to persons who supplied methamphetamine with whom Mr Afsari joined. He felt included and his involvement allowed for a supply of cannabis which he was smoking at roughly two grams per day in addition to 50 cigarettes per day.""


	
	The report of Mr Borenstein and its relevance to the progress towards rehabilitation of the offender and the issues of remorse and contrition must be considered in the light of the content of the earlier report of Dr Allnutt. In Qutami (2001) NSWCCA 353 at 58 it was said by Smart AJ, Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreeing:
	


""There is one further general observation. In this case, reliance appears to have been placed on statements made by the prisoner to psychiatrists and the psychologist. While those statements are admissible in evidence, very considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon them when there is no evidence given by the prisoner. In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements…There has been a noticeable and disturbing tendency in more recent years for prisoners on a sentence hearing not to give evidence and to rely on statements made to experts. Prisoners should realise that if this course is taken great caution will be exercised in respect of the weight, if any, given to those statements.""


	
	In the circumstances of this matter and the offender's recent past criminal history, little weight can be placed on the statements made by him to Mr Borenstein or to the assessment made by Mr Borenstein in the circumstances where he was deprived of the benefit of Dr Allnutt's report.
	
	
	I note the letter from the offender's mother of 3 November 2016 which indicates her ongoing support for her son and her claims that:
	


""I believe that my son has learnt the biggest lesson of his life. He has learnt his lesson the hard way. I can see in his eyes and his face that he is a completely changed man. He has been drug free and has promised me that he will never commit any offence again. He never wants to go on that road again.""


	
	I accept that Mrs Afsari is expressing her genuine observation and what the offender has said to her, but I note that what he has said to her in entirely inconsistent with his conduct in committing serious criminal offences while subject to three ICOs and while residing in the family home, littered as it was with a variety of prohibited and restricted drugs and the indicia of supply. No doubt, whatever the circumstances of the offender's conduct, Mrs Afsari will continue to support him, like most mothers.
	
	
	The theme in Dr Allnut's and Mr Borenstein's report, as well as the Pre-Sentence Report, is that the offender was only committing the offences in order to fund himself to be able to supply his own addiction to marijuana or cannabis and, according to the Pre-Sentence Report but not referred to in Mr Borenstein’s report, cocaine.
	
	
	Considering the substantial quantities of prohibited and restricted drugs that the offender had and the significant quantity of cash money located, the subject of the proceeds of crime offence, it is in my view patently obvious that the offender was conducting a drug distribution business for financial benefit, that is, greed rather than need, although I accept that it is likely that he at least used some of the substances he possessed. He was assessed for the purposes of the Pre-Sentence Report as being a low-medium risk of reoffending, and under the heading of “Assessment” the report states:
	


""Mr Afsari was cooperative, positive and forthcoming during the assessment process. He exhibited some limited insight, took responsibility for his offending and offered remorse for the impact that this has had on his family without offering the same to the community. Mr Afsari said that he regretted he had not appreciated the opportunity which the previous ICO had given him. Corrective Services records show that while in custody Mr Afsari has continued to receive positive reports regarding his attitude, work ethic and involvement in training opportunities.""


	
	A plea of guilty in itself does not necessarily represent remorse or contrition. In this matter, the Crown case in respect of each of the charges could reasonably be regarded as very strong. The offender has, in the past, expressed his determination to cease offending and rehabilitate himself. He had the benefit of three ICO orders to assist him in doing so. He is familiar with the process of sentencing. In the light of the contrast between the matters I have quoted from Dr Allnutt's report and his subsequent offending and in the absence of evidence from the offender that could have been tested by cross examination, I am unable to accept, despite the content of Mr Borenstein's report and the Pre-Sentence Report, that there is, in fact, any evidence of genuine remorse.
	
	
	As to the prospect of his reoffending, referred to in the Pre-Sentence Report as being “low-medium”, I will simply observe that such an assessment appears to be contrary to the offender's history. As to the prospect of rehabilitation, suffice it to say that in the circumstances it cannot be said that there is a good prospect of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I note in respect of the offence of ongoing supply, as I have previously commented, that the only evidence placed before the Court is of three supplies of unspecified quantities for comparatively small sums of money, but I note that in respect of the offence of ongoing supply the purpose of the introduction of s 25A was to ensure, in effect, that low level dealers such as street dealers who were frequently arrested upon having supplied small quantities such as points of a gram, would be subject to more significant sentences than if they were dealt with for single offences, by providing for the offence of ongoing supply to ensure that street level dealers did not simply get away with a rap over the knuckles, as they had in the past.
	
	
	Taken on their own, the small individual supplies in this matter would perhaps indicate an offence in the lower range because of that matter, but, as I have previously referred to, in the light of the surrounding circumstances these are simply three small supplies as part of a significant criminal distribution by the offender. The Court is required to take into account when sentencing for the ongoing supply the matters contained on the Form 1. In respect of the supply of 4.17 grams of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, or MDMA as it is popularly referred to, the quantity was more than three times the indictable quantity of 1.25 grams. In respect of the 10.06 grams of amphetamine, it was more than twice the indictable quantity of five grams. In addition, the proceeds of crime related to a not insubstantial sum of money, being $4,390. The offender, of course, had what was no doubt a substantial investment by way of the purchase of the various substances in his possession.
	
	
	When dealing with the matters on the Form 1 I have regard to the Attorney General's Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No.1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 in which Spigelman CJ said at (42):
	


""The position, in my opinion, is that although a Court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which the guilt has been admitted with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material to the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence which, the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused is engaged.


	
	The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences…These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.""
	
	
	Those statements of relevant principles are relevant to this matter.
	
	
	Relevant to the matters contained on the s 166 certificate is that the 8.48 grams of Stanozolol, being 92 tablets, is substantially less than the small quantity which is 50 grams. As to the 0.96 grams of cocaine, it is only marginally less than the small quantity of one gram and, as to the 11.6 of cannabis leaf, it is approximately one third of the small quantity. Quantity alone is not the sole basis for determining an individual sentence as referred to in Smiroldo (2000) 112 A Crim R 47 at [14]. However, it is still relevant to any assessment of an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	For the purposes of sentencing I have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Court is required to take into account such aggravating and mitigating factors as outlined in s 21A(2) and (3), as are present, and any other relevant factor. Any sentence imposed must reflect the seriousness of the offence as well as the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence, as well as meeting the fundamental purpose of punishment, the protection of society. In respect of this matter, both general deterrence and specific deterrence are important matters to be kept in mind in the instinctive synthesis of establishing appropriate sentences.
	
	
	I am satisfied, pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that there is no penalty other than imprisonment that is appropriate, as was conceded by Mr James QC on behalf of the offender.
	
	
	As I intend to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence, I am required to provide an indicative sentence in respect of each of the matters in respect of which sentence must be imposed. In respect of the matters contained on the s 166 certificate the indicative sentence in respect of possess instructions for manufacture of prohibited drug is three months. In respect of the offence of possess restricted substance, being the 4.98 of Alprazolam, the indicative sentence is two months. In respect of the offence of possess prohibited drug, being 11.6 grams of cannabis leaf, the indicative sentence is six months. In respect of the possess prohibited drug, being 0.96 grams of cocaine, the indicative sentence is 12 months. In respect of the offence of possess prohibited drug, being 8.48 grams of Stanzolol, the indicative sentence is six months.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of ongoing supply, taking into account in addition the offences of supply an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, 4.17 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and supply indictable quantity of prohibited drug, 10.06 grams of amphetamine, and knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime, to wit $4,390, the indicative sentence is three years' imprisonment. I repeat what I have previously said, that for the purpose of assessing that sentence I have not in any way taken into account the methylamphetamine located under the house that was not the subject of a charge.
	
	
	Mr Afsari, would you please stand up.
	
	
	In respect of each of the s 166 matters and the offence of supply prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, you are convicted. You are sentenced to an aggregate sentence of four years. As to the commencement date of the sentence, I take into account that as a result of the commission of these offences the ICO orders were revoked and a fixed sentence was imposed which commenced on 26 May 2015 and expired on 11 August 2016. I also take into account that there was a period between 22 May 2015 and 25 May 2015, that is, a period of four days, where the offender was in custody solely in respect of these matters, those four days have not been discernibly in any way taken into account in setting the fixed sentence on revocation of the ICOs.
	
	
	I recognise that the sentencing discretion includes the ability to make the sentences imposed in this matter concurrent, partially concurrent with or wholly cumulative upon the sentence which the offender was serving as a consequence of the revocation of the ICO orders, for the reasons expressed by Simpson J in dealing with the revocation of parole in Callahan [2006] NSWCCA 58. I intend to make the sentence partly concurrent with the fixed term imposed in respect of the revoked ICOs. I am of the view that it is appropriate in relation to that matter to date the sentence to commence after the offender had served one year of the fixed sentence imposed, but to backdate it by a further four days. Accordingly, the appropriate commencement date for the sentence is 23 May 2016.
	
	
	I note that means that taking into account the principle of totality and acknowledging that given the one year of the fixed sentence served and the starting point for the aggregate sentence of four years that I am imposing, the total time of the sentence is effectively five years, and it is the offender's first period of time in custody. I find special circumstances in view of the offender's obvious problems in respect of his abuse of prohibited drugs and the need for assistance to rehabilitate himself in that regard, despite his failure to do so while the subject of the ICOs, to warrant variation of the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term. Accordingly, in order to provide for a balance of term of 18 months, the non-parole period has been reduced to two years and six months.
	
	
	Accordingly, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 23 May 2016. You will first be eligible for parole on 22 November 2018. The balance of term is one year and six months and the term of four years will expire on 22 May 2020.
	
	
	Mr Afsari, whether you are released on that date will depend largely on your conduct while in custody. It is not an automatic release date. If and when you are released you will, however, be subject to parole. It is similar to an Intensive Correction Order in that if you breach the parole you will find yourself, no doubt, back in custody again. It is all in your own hands, Mr Afsari. I am not going to repeat the warning that was given to you in unequivocal terms by Judge Frearson but you need to take heed of your position on this occasion rather than ignore it, as you did on the last occasion when you were before Judge Frearson.
	
	
	Now, is there any matter that I have made a mistake in relation to or additional matter other than destruction of the drugs and confiscation of the proceeds?
	


STUART: No matter other than those two, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right, well, I’ll order the destruction of the drugs. I take there is no objection to the confiscation order Mr James?

JAMES: No, your Honour.

STUART: I hand that up for your Honour to sign.

HIS HONOUR: Pursuant to s 18(1), cash in the sum of $4390 found on the person at the premises of the respondent on 22 May 2015 is forfeited to the State. Pursuant to s 18(1), the Nokia mobile, telephone number X0002147256, is forfeited to the State. Similarly, the Apple iPhone, number specified in the order, is forfeited to the State, as, in addition, the Blackberry mobile as specified in the order and SIM card is forfeited to the State and the further Nokia mobile telephone, as specified, is forfeited to the State. I give leave that pursuant to s 19(3)(a) the property forfeited by the orders that I have just made is to be disposed of forthwith and I order the destruction of the drugs and disposal of the utensils and indicia of supply.

		27 April 2017",2016-11-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
4575037,"R v McPhillamy, Richard [2015] NSWDC 423","HIS HONOUR: Richard McPhillamy appears for sentence in respect of six offences.


	
	Two offences, Counts 1 and 3, are contrary to s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. They are expressed in the same terms in the indictment, being: that he, between 1 November 1995 and 31 March 1996 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, committed an act of indecency towards NC, a person under the age of 16 years, namely 11 years old, and at the time of the offence NC was under the authority of Richard McPhillamy. The maximum sentence provided for such an offence is one of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	There are two further offences, being Counts 2 and 4 on the indictment, being offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. They are also expressed in exactly the same terms: that he, between 1 November 1995 and 31 March 1996, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, assaulted NC and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency with NC in circumstances of aggravation, namely that NC was a person under the age of 16 years, namely 11 years old. In relation to those offences the maximum penalty is seven years imprisonment.
	
	
	The two further offences are each contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, being Counts 5 and 6 on the indictment. They are expressed in exactly the same terms as each other, that is: that he between 1 November 1995 and 31 March 1996, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, had sexual intercourse with NC, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely, 11 years old, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the sexual intercourse, NC was under the authority of Richard McPhillamy. The maximum penalty provided for such an offence is one of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	In respect of each of the six offences, they were committed prior to February 2003, and there is no relevant standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The trial commenced in respect of all of the offences on Monday 3 February 2015. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on each count on 13 February 2015.
	
	
	The offender was arrested and charged on 6 May 2013; however, he was released on bail and he has been in custody in respect of this matter since bail was refused at the conclusion of the trial on 13 February 2015.
	
	
	I find the following facts beyond reasonable doubt, consistent with the verdict of the jury.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 2 occurred within the charged date range on the same occasion and Counts 3 to 6 occurred on a separate occasion within the date range a few weeks after the first incident. At all times, the victim was 11 years of age. The offender was at the time an acolyte at St Michael and St John’s Cathedral, Bathurst. He assisted in Mass services particularly on Saturday evenings. The victim lived with his family in Bathurst, and became an altar boy towards the end of 1995. He was under the direct supervision of the offender when they were both present assisting at Mass. On both occasions, the offender followed the victim into a toilet near the front foyer entrance of the Cathedral prior to the service. In respect of Count 1, and the first incident, having followed the victim into the toilet, the offender asked the victim in words to the effect, “Have you tried this before?” or “Have you done this before?” and said, “Let me show you something.” He then commenced to masturbate himself and encouraged the victim to do the same. They had initially both been urinating into the bowl at the same time. The victim replaced his penis in his pants, brought it out again and started to copy the offender, with his encouragement. The offender was saying to him words to the effect of, “Hold it like this and rub it back and forward, like that” and “Doesn’t that feel good?” and similar comments.
	
	
	Count 2; the offender then touched the victim’s hand and penis, demonstrating to him how to masturbate himself. The offender’s hand was mostly in contact with the child’s hand, although there were brief moments of contact with his penis. It lasted for a period of a couple of minutes. At the same time as the offender was touching the victim’s penis and hand, he continued with one hand to masturbate himself and ejaculated. After they had exited from the toilet, the offender subsequently spoke to the victim, indicating to him that the fact that the victim’s penis had become erect meant that the victim was gay, and that the victim would have to be careful about disclosing what had happened because everyone would turn against him. The victim was sure that he could remember the particular phrase, “People like us need to stick together”.
	
	
	The second incident relating to Counts 3 to 6 occurred a few weeks later. Again, the offender followed the victim into the same toilet and commenced to masturbate again and encouraged the victim to do the same, which he did.
	
	
	On this occasion, the victim described the action as being more forceful. After the victim had started to masturbate, the offender took over masturbating the child, wrapping his hand around his penis and rubbing it.
	
	
	A little later he said, “I’ll show you something even better”, and then took the child’s penis into his mouth and performed fellatio on the child. At the time the offender had an erection. The offender sucked the child’s penis for a minute or two before saying to him words to the effect, “You’ve got to return the favour”, or something about “Fair’s fair”, and the victim had to do the same to him. The victim then took the offender’s penis into his mouth and performed fellatio on him. The offender’s penis was erect at the time.
	
	
	The offender was doing most of the movement, although for a bit he put his hands on the back of the victim’s head, and was moving the victim’s head. The victim gagged and commenced crying. The offender stopped and comforted him, and later apologised after they had attended the Mass. Again he impressed upon the victim not to tell anyone.
	
	
	The victim NC made no complaint in relation to the matters until he approached the Catholic Church Professional Standards Office and the Bishop’s Office in about March 2009. He sought compensation from the Catholic Church, and he made a written statement in relation to his claim for compensation in April 2010, and subsequently in November 2012 and February 2013 he made two statements to police about the offences.
	
	
	An aggravating feature is that the offender was in a position of trust and he violated that trust by sexually assaulting an 11 year old child; however the breach of trust is already taken into account in the nature of the charges in respect of Count 1, and also in respect of Counts 3, 5 and 6. It is not taken into account by the nature of the charge in respect of Count 2 or Count 4.
	
	
	Each of the offences within the context of the individual type of charge is objectively serious, as is indicated by the maximum statutory penalties provided, and the nature of the specific acts. The offender engaged in acts of masturbation with the complainant on both occasions, and progressed to two separate acts of fellatio on the second occasion.
	
	
	NC was a pre-pubescent 11 year old boy with no sexual experience, and he was under the immediate care and control of the offender in a religious setting. The offender exploited his authority over the victim in that context to engage in sexual activity with him.
	
	
	The offending involved two separate incidents, and on each occasion more than one offence was committed. The offender must have been well aware of the victim’s age, and having regard to the victim’s evidence, the offender also knew that the victim had no sexual experience. He deliberately arranged to be alone with the boy at the church and took it upon himself to instruct the victim with regard to masturbation.
	
	
	The nature of the offending escalated to include the later offences involving fellatio. The offences are, in those circumstances, indicative of a course of continuing conduct and were not isolated incidents.
	


SUBJECTIVE MATTERS


	
	The offender did not give evidence on sentence. Available to the Court is the evidence of his partner, Mrs Hazel McGrath, and his mother, Mrs Bernadette Healy. Also available is Exhibit M1, being a report of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 24 April 2015; Exhibit M2, being a medical report from Dr Chobecki relating only to the medical problems of the offender’s mother, dated 29 March 2015; a photocopy of various certifications permitting the offender to drive various construction type vehicles; and related matters, being that: he holds certificates for being a nationally assessed plant operator, he has a national licence to perform high risk work, and a general construction induction certificate.
	
	
	In addition, there is a pre-sentence report under the hand of Angela Coker, dated 24 April 2015, together with a Justice Corrective Services pre‑sentence consultation, providing an actuarial risk assessment and an opinion regarding the offender’s suitability for and access to sex offender treatment programmes, and a comment with regard to risk considerations. That report is under the hand of Anne Young, a senior psychologist with the Central West Cluster. It is dated 24 April 2014.
	
	
	In addition, and finally, there is a criminal history.
	
	
	The offender was sentenced on 11 March 2011 in respect of a number of offences involving sexual assault and an act of indecency in respect of two persons, both being under the age of 16.
	
	
	There were four counts in respect of one victim, and two counts in respect of the other victim. He was convicted in respect of those matters after a trial. The offences occurred in two separate periods, but both were in 1985. There were two counts in respect of one victim between 1 February 1985 and 31 March 1985. The remaining four counts, in respect of the second victim, were between 1 October 1985 and 31 December 1985.
	
	
	The offender at the time was a house master at St Stanislaus College, Bathurst. He was a house master in respect of the Boarding College at which the two victims resided, subject to his supervision.
	
	
	His trial in respect of those offences took place in about October 2010, approximately 25 years after the event.
	
	
	As a result of the allegation made in respect of those matters, the offender’s residence, which he then shared with Mrs McGrath and her three children, were searched, and located on a computer was child pornography, which resulted in his being charged with four counts of possessing child pornography. Each of the four counts related to an individual photograph which depicted young boys naked, and in some cases apparently in the process of masturbation, either alone or with others. In respect of those charges he entered pleas of guilty, and on 11 March 2011 he was sentenced to six months imprisonment commencing on 10 December 2010.
	
	
	In respect of the 1985 offences, in respect of four counts occurring between October and December 1985, he received 18 months imprisonment commencing on 10 June 2011 with a six‑month non-parole period, and for the offences occurring between February 1985 and March 1985, he received six months imprisonment commencing on 10 March 2011.
	
	
	His only other conviction is in relation to an offence occurring between 1 December 2013 and 31 December 2013, being an offence of failing to comply with reporting obligations, for which he received a s 9 bond of 18 months on 28 April 2014 at the Bathurst Local Court. The reporting obligations were in relation to the requirement that he report once per year as a result of his conviction for the previous sexual abuse offences.
	
	
	I am of course not sentencing the offender for any matters that he has been sentenced for in the past, but it is relevant that he was convicted in respect of sexually abusing young boys in 1985, some ten years before the current offences. It is also relevant that his possession of child pornography, when arrested in respect of the earlier offences, that that child pornography related to young males and in part young males masturbating or in sexual poses, whether that be masturbating alone or together with others. At the time of these offences, the offender was 34 years of age. He is now 54 years of age.
	
	
	He was raised in the Bathurst area with a strict Catholic upbringing. He is the eldest of four siblings of his parents’ union. His parents separated approximately 25 years ago. He maintains good relationships with both parents, although he only has limited contact with two of his brothers. He lived at home until the age of 29, when he moved to Melbourne to commence studies for the priesthood in the Catholic Church, in respect of which he was not successful, and discontinued after approximately three years, returning to Bathurst. He went to school in Bathurst at various Catholic schools, but did not continue beyond year 10, as he was not motivated to complete the Higher School Certificate.
	
	
	After leaving school, he had a job spraying weeds, then as a roustabout in a shearing shed, as a factory hand at a cannery and labouring in a plastics factory, and as a farm hand with a horse stud. His main occupation eventually became as a bus driver, beginning in 1994 and continuing until 2008. He had driven school buses, CountryLink coach routes and had done charter work for State Rail. At the same time, he was regularly volunteering for work through the cathedral parish. He is said to have obtained a Diploma of Social Welfare through Orange TAFE. There is no evidence that he has any problems such as alcohol, gambling or drugs.
	
	
	His relationship with Mrs McGrath commenced approximately ten years ago in late 2006, and in January 2013 he moved from Bathurst to Dubbo to live with her, before returning to reside with his mother for financial reasons in about October 2014. For a short period, he obtained work at a pet food factory after his release from custody, and before being re‑arrested. His arrest in relation to these matters caused the termination of his work.
	
	
	Mrs McGrath gave evidence that he had never misconducted himself with her youngest son, who was approximately 13 years of age at the commencement of their relationship. She had supported him through the trial in respect of the 1985 charges, and continued to visit him after he was imprisoned. Mrs McGrath is a firm and committed supporter of the offender. She firmly believes that he would not have committed the offences of which he has been convicted, and his possession of child pornography has not affected her view of him at all.
	
	
	What is clear from the material before the Court is that the offender denies having committed any of the offences in respect of which he was convicted after trial in 2010, and also denies having been in possession of the child pornography, despite the fact that he entered a plea of guilty in respect of those charges, as well as continuing to deny the commission of the offences for which he is currently to be sentenced.
	
	
	Mrs McGrath prefers to blame her own child for the pornography, having accepted the offender’s subsequent denials.
	
	
	Since his release from custody in respect of the 1985 offences, and they have had some re‑association, she has said that she was not aware that he was subject to child sex offender reporting or that he had sent letters, contrary to the restrictions, to other child sex offenders, nor that he had received warning letters about such conduct. While I accept that Mrs McGrath is entirely supportive of the offender, it appears to be on the basis that she is prepared to simply bury her head in the sand and ignore the obvious conclusions that must be reached as a result of the course of offending over decades, as demonstrated by the individual charges, including the pornography.
	
	
	The offender’s mother, Bernadette Healy, is also supportive of her son. She is said to have a number of:
	


“quite significant medical problems which are adversely affected by her son’s incarceration”...”her problems include cirrhosis of the liver of uncertain aetiology and oesophageal varices. The threat of a life‑threatening haemorrhage is there all the time. She also suffers from hypertension, osteoporosis and idiopathic thrombocytopenia, all of which can be aggravated by stress and this whole process is certainly stressful for her”.


	
	I have no difficulty in accepting that Mrs Healy is entirely supportive of her son, and that his circumstances and conviction in respect of these matters have had an adverse effect on her. They would be stressful to any parent. However, as to the effect that it may have on a particular condition that she has, I note that she has visited him almost every week in custody. She accepts of herself that she is an active woman. She has been in attendance and present for most if not all of the trial, and whatever health constraints she may have, they have not restricted her in getting out and about or staying in Sydney during the course of the trial. There is nothing exceptional about Mrs Healy’s circumstances that would call for any mitigation in sentence.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen has provided a lengthy report. He has provided a diagnosis of depressive illness on the basis of Mr McPhillamy’s account of his symptoms and the observations of his partner, Mrs McGrath, and a history of some treatment with potent anti-depressant medications, as well as his presentation during an interview. The development of depression in respect of an individual charged with child sex offences and subsequently incarcerated as a result, and being subject to subsequent charges and the prospect of further imprisonment is entirely to be expected.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen states the following:
	


“Mr McPhillamy does not have a history of any pattern of convictions for other types of offences or of a pattern of antisocial conduct nor does he have any kind of substance use disorder, which are the two main clinical predictors of recidivism. Moreover, his offences took place 20 and 30 years ago, and his personal circumstances were very different and took place when he was immature and sexually inexperienced. It seems that he has since formed two long term heterosexual relationships and on his release would return to live with his de facto partner of ten years. Hence an assessment of his criminogenic risk factors including his age and his recent circumstances would suggest that his probability of further similar offences is comparatively low.”


	
	I note that I have some difficulty in accepting Dr Olav Nielssen’s opinion, although I accept that it is based on the information that was provided, which was a Statement of Facts in relation to possession of child abuse material, dated 21 April 2009, a Statement of Facts in relation to charges of aggravated sexual assault dated 6 May 2013, an account prepared by Mr McPhillamy, and a transcript of Mr McPhillamy’s criminal history. The report was prepared on the basis of that material and a single interview at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre on 7 April 2015.
	
	
	I note there appear to be some matters that are inconsistent with other information before the Court. The report of Anne Young of Justice Corrective Services states the following in relation to his relationship history:
	


“Mr McPhillamy stated that in his mid- twenties he was in a relationship with a woman for 12 months. This relationship was not a sexual relationship. When the woman ended the relationship he said he was very hurt by this. He first had sexual intercourse with a female when he was aged in his late thirties. This was a one-off experience. He did not form another relationship until approximately 2007 when he became involved with Hazel.”


	
	Further under a heading of “Intimacy Deficits”, Ms Young states the following:
	


“Based on my contact with Mr McPhillamy throughout his parole period, he appears to have problems in the area of establishing and maintaining intimacy with others. This area, along with general detachment difficulties, was also highlighted in the private psychological report (Michelle Player, 3/12/2010) at pre-sentence stage for the earlier sexual offences. Ms Player described him as appearing to have a ‘history of major attachment problems which has negatively impacted on his ability to form and maintain appropriate intimate relations and has contributed to general interpersonal difficulties.

Although Mr McPhillamy lived (with) Hazel for approximately 21 months in Dubbo, this relationship has appeared to lack real intimacy. During his period on parole, Mr McPhillamy appeared quite ambivalent about his relationship with Hazel. In the recent phone interview he stated that he is not currently in a relationship with Hazel and has not had contact with her since being in custody. He described the relationship as having failed due to stress and the pressure of his legal case. However, he did say that he expected the relationship would resume when he is again in the community.”


	
	I note that, although a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist, Ms Young in my view was in a much better position to be able to make an estimate in relation to the offender and his risk in particular of re-offending. She had available to her material that was provided in relation to the earlier offences. While he was on parole, she had seen him on some ten occasions between 17 February 2012 and 16 November 2012 for the purposes of risk management. He completed his parole on 9 December 2012, and she saw him again at Orange Community Corrections on 17 April 2014 for approximately one hour in relation to his conviction for fail to comply with reporting obligations.
	
	
	Relevant to the risk assessment is the following, as contained in Ms Young’s report:
	


“Attitude to Offence and Acceptance of Responsibility:

Mr McPhillamy pleaded not guilty to all charges but was found guilty in relation to all offences. He continues to deny the offences. In the phone interview he stated that ‘they never happened at all’. He said he could not believe he had been ‘convicted of this shit’. Mr McPhillamy claimed that he believed the victim made up the allegations for ’the money’. Mr McPhillamy made a number of negative comments about the victim and his truthfulness and gave a number of examples to suggest it was impossible for these things to have happened. “


	
	As already noted, Mr McPhillamy not only denies the matters of which he has recently been convicted but denies the matters that he was convicted of in the past, and also denies the pornography charges in relation to which he pleaded guilty. Ms Young found that on applying the Static-99R that the offender was in the moderate/low risk category relevant to other male sexual offenders. However, she also noted that that instrument has some limitations being based on groups of individuals, and accordingly not necessarily reflecting the risk of recidivism of an individual offender, or being sensitive to changes in the offender’s circumstances that may increase or decrease his actual risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The recent review of his overall risk of sexual re-offending has been assessed as moderate/high. I have already referred to the “Attitude to Offence” and ‘Acceptance of Responsibility’ ‘as stated in Anne Young’s report. There is a similar passage in the report of Angela Coca, under the heading “Attitude to Offending”:
	


“Mr McPhillamy maintained that he is innocent of the current charges, adding that these were ‘against my character.’ He expressed no empathy for the victim, insinuating that the allegations were targeted towards him due to previous media exposure involving the offender’s past offending history. He also opined that the reason behind the victim’s allegations was to obtain financial gain from the Catholic Church. Whilst the offender denied any wrongdoing he expressed a willingness to participate in any custody-based sex offender programs.”


	
	She further stated:
	


“According to the level of service inventory-revised actuarial risk/needs assessment tool, the offender is assessed as a medium to high risk of re-offending.”


	
	In my view, the assessment by Ms Young is to be preferred over the assessment by Dr Nielssen, given the significantly greater extent of the information available to Ms Young, and also to her more significant personal exposure to the offender while on parole.
	
	
	There has of course been a lengthy delay between the commission of the offences and now. Delay may be a mitigating factor where it is established that the offender suffered some detriment, although it may not always be a detriment.
	
	
	It is often the case in child sexual assault matters that children do not complain to another person until many years have passed. In these circumstances less weight may be afforded to delay as a mitigating factor in sentencing, R v Dennis (unreported) 14 December 1992 NSWCCA.
	
	
	It is of particular importance where the offender is in a position of trust in relation to the victim, even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence. The sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 549, and be proportional to the criminality involved and the offence committed, Veen v The Queen (1979) 143 CLR 458.
	
	
	General deterrence is of prime importance in making the community aware of the attitude of the courts to child sexual offences, R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148. Any sentence imposed must embrace a substantial element of general deterrence, R v KRC (2000) NSWCCA 541 at 32. The degree of seriousness may depend on the type of forced intercourse, the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted and the humiliation and other circumstances, R v Gebrail.
	
	
	As relevant to s 66C(2), s 61H(1) of the Crimes Act defines a number of specific acts as being “sexual intercourse”, including fellatio.
	
	
	However, it makes no distinction as to any of the defined acts of sexual intercourse as being more or less serious than any other act, as contained within the definition. There can be no prima facie assumption or general proposition that any one form of sexual intercourse is less or more serious than any other form; R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20, Tobias JA at [20-21], “The ‘heinousness’ of the offending conduct depends on the facts of the case and not on the statute defining the offence.” R v Hibberd, Price JA at 55, referring to Ibbs v The Queen [1987] 163 CLR 447; R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561. I will in due course note that there is a distinction, in my view, between Counts 5 and 6 in terms of seriousness.
	
	
	No submissions have been made by either of the parties in relation to the fact that these offences occurred between November 1995 and March 1996, and whether because of that fact alone the offender is exposed to a harsher punishment and sentencing regime than existed at the time of the offence. As I have said, there has been a significant delay between the commission of the offences and sentencing. In R v MJR [2002] 54 NSWLR 368, it was held that:
	


“Where, by reason of delay, an offender is exposed to a harsher punishment and sentencing regime than that which existed at the time of the offence, and if an authentic and credible body of statistical material existed that is capable of reconstructing what would have been done previously, then the approach outlined in R v Shore [1992] 66 A Crim R 37 should be adopted.”


	
	In Shore, Badgery-Parker J at (42) said:
	


“In my opinion, I should, so far as I am able to do so, seek to impose upon the offender a sentence appropriate not only to the then applicable statutory maximum, but also to then appropriate sentencing patterns. That is by no means easy, but in my view I must endeavour to do so.”


	
	In the absence of such statistical material, the Court is constrained to take the non-statistical approach as described by Howie J in R v Moon [2000] 117 A Crim R 497 at 511, and approved by the majority, being Sully J and Spigelman CJ in R v MJR at (107) and (31).
	
	
	R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 Howie J at 40 said (citations omitted):
	


“His Honour was required to sentence on the basis of a proved pattern of sentencing for such matters at the time or, if he could not identify a pattern, he should have followed what I said in R v Moon and adopted by the majority in R v MJR as follows:

The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence: ... and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed: … Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence.

When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the Court will, by approaching the sentencing task in this way, effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of offending, and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at that time.”


	
	The Court has not been provided with any relevant statistical material, so is constrained to take a non-statistical approach as described by Howie J.
	
	
	While I have turned to the Judicial Information Research System and to the recorded sentences imposed for offences prior to the introduction of any standard non‑parole period, I note that the statistics only commence in 2008. In any event, as has been frequently referred to, the statistics are a very blunt tool and in this circumstance are so limited as to be of no assistance. While I am unable to establish a particular sentencing regime for offences of this nature in 1995, I would accept that at least since the introduction of standard non‑parole periods there has been, in general, an increase both to the terms of sentence and the non‑parole periods for standard non‑parole period offences, as referred to in the Judicial Commission publication in 2010, entitled Impact of Standard Non-Parole Periods, Research Monograph 33, 
	
	
	Of course, none of these matters have standard non‑parole periods attaching to them. I would accept that it is at least likely that there has been some increase in sentences provided since 1996, irrespective of the effect of standard non‑parole periods, and that I am required to impose sentences consistent with the pattern of sentencing in or about 1995 or 1996.
	
	
	Before turning to the actual sentences to be imposed, there are a number of matters in respect of this offender that are abundantly clear.
	
	
	There is no remorse, there is no contrition and there can be little prospect of rehabilitation in circumstances where an offender continues to deny commission of the offences. That is of course not to say that there is no possibility of rehabilitation. It cannot be said that there is no risk of re-offending nor that there is a low risk in view of the opinions expressed by Ann Young and Angela Coker, particularly where the information before the Court indicates that he has had a long standing sexual interest in pre-pubescent and early pubescent boys and now being convicted of a number of “hands on” sexual offences occurring in the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s in respect of males between the age of 11 and 13, and where in 2009 he was found to be in possession of pornographic images of young males, and where the evidence would indicate that he has sought occupations or engaged in activities which could reasonably be anticipated to bring him into contact with young males, such as being a housemaster at St Stanislaus, a boarding college for male students, and being an acolyte of the Catholic Church in charge of altar boys and girls.
	
	
	Similarly, I note that he also has had a past association with the scouting movement as a volunteer Scouts Assistant Cub Leader from 1995 to 2000. Even in respect of his bus driving, I note that in one of the reports, he refers to himself in that occupation as driving children to and from school.
	
	
	There are of course no offences before the Court that indicate that he has abused his position in relation to the scouts or as a bus driver, but it does at least appear that the offender has in the past sought out occupations where he could be expected to be associating with young children, and in particular young boys, in respect of whom I accept that he has a sexual interest.
	
	
	In respect of the two offences contrary to s 61O(1), being acts of indecency towards a person under the age of 16 years and under his authority, and in respect of the two offences contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, being assault and at the time of the assault committing an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation, namely that NC was under the age of 16: that is Counts 1 to 4. Each of those matters was capable of being dealt with in the Local Court. In my view, in relation to the first incident, including one offence contrary to 61O(1) and 61M(1), it is likely that if there had been no further charges, it would have been seen as appropriate to deal with those in the Local Court. If he had been convicted of those matters prior to being charged with the matters relating to the second incident, I doubt that that course would have been followed in relation to Count 3 and 4 and certainly it was appropriate in the circumstances of Count 5 and 6, being acts of sexual intercourse, that all of the matters be before this court. Those observations have some relevance to the question of what sentence is to be imposed for the individual offences. Another relevant consideration for the Crown in relation to the charges was the fact that by the time these offences were disclosed and the offender was prosecuted, he had already been convicted of the earlier sexual offending in 1985.
	
	
	For the purposes of sentencing, I have had regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I must take into account the aggravating and/or mitigating factors as referred to in s 21A, subs 2 and 3 as are present, and any other relevant factor. The sentence must reflect the seriousness of the offence as well as reflecting in relation to matters of this nature both specific and general deterrence, as well as meeting the fundamental purpose of punishment: that is, the protection of society.
	
	
	I am satisfied, pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and I note in that regard that no submission has been made that any other alternative sentence would be appropriate.
	
	
	Mr Heathcote, on behalf of the offender, has argued that the Court should take into account when providing the sentences in respect of these offences the fact that the offender has already spent time in custody as a result of his earlier offending in 1985. He has cited a number of cases in that regard:
	


Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; Thorp v R [2010] NSWCCA 261, and Wu v R [2011] NSWCCA 102.


	
	In my opinion, although his past period in custody is relevant to take into account in a general way in relation to sentence, the submissions made in respect of those cases by Mr Heathcote are ill-founded. In respect of Mill the totality principle was held to apply where there were offences of the same nature committed in different States about the same time. In respect of Thorp v R. it was where there were two episodes of offences within a month with a significant delay in the charging in respect of the second offence, and in Wu the offender was being sentenced for multiple offences in 2010, where he had been previously sentenced in 2004 for offences being part of the same course of criminal conduct. The totality principle is not relevant in the same manner as it was relevant in those cases. It is however relevant in respect of the individual matters that he is currently before the Court to be sentenced for, noting that they are entirely independent and distinct in time by ten years from the previous offences.
	
	
	As I intend to proceed by way of an aggregate sentence, it is necessary to indicate the indicative sentence in respect of each of the six counts or offences. In respect of Count 1, an offence contrary to s 61O(1) the indicative sentence is one year. In respect of Count 2, being an offence contrary to s 61M(1) the indicative sentence is 18 months. In respect of Count 3, being an offence contrary to s 61O(1), the indicative sentence is 15 months. In respect of Count 4, being an offence contrary to s 61M(1), the indicative sentence is 21 months. In respect of Count 5, being an offence contrary to s 66C(2), the indicative sentence is three years and six months. In respect of Count 6, being an offence contrary to s 66C(2), the indicative sentence is four years.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 2 were the first offences. The distinction in sentence is because of the nature of the different charges and the different conduct alleged in each. In respect of Counts 3 and 4, while they are similar charges to Counts 1 and 2, and in each case concern conduct of a relatively similar kind to Counts 1 and 2, I have provided an indicative sentence that is greater than in respect of Counts 1 and 2 because they are subsequently committed offences in the course of continuing offending. In respect of Count 5 and Count 6, I have distinguished between the offences on the basis that it is in my view appropriate to distinguish between them on the basis that Count 6 is more serious than Count 5, as it involves the offender placing his penis in the victim’s mouth, and to some extent controlling his head movements until such time as the victim gagged and cried, and the offender ceased.
	
	
	I note that I have not referred during the course of these reasons to any impact of the offending on the victim. No Victim Impact Report has been provided to the Court; however it was patently obvious from the victim’s evidence in court, and his reactions from time to time, that this offending has had a significant adverse impact on him which has not ameliorated with time. It is of course an impact: however, that can be reasonably expected to be caused to young children when they are the subject of significant sexual abuse, as here, an impact which has been recognised in various judgments as likely to continue for many years even without specific evidence of that being given. However, that impact is one that can be reasonably taken as within the expected range of impacts in relation to offences of this nature.
	
	
	In setting the aggregate sentence, I have taken into account that were I to be imposing an individual sentence in relation to each offence, I would have provided accumulation, and I have taken into account the principle of totality.
	
	
	Mr McPhillamy, would you please stand.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of four years. As you have been in custody since 13 February 2015, the non-parole period will commence from that date, and you will be first eligible for parole on 12 February 2019. The parole period is two years and will expire on 12 February 2021.
	
	
	I have found special circumstances, which has reduced the non-parole period by six months on the basis of a perceived need for the offender to be the subject of a more lengthy period of supervision in the community than would otherwise have been provided if the statutory relationship was maintained between the non-parole period and the parole period, as well as to more appropriately reflect the sentencing regime that would have applied had these offences been dealt with at a time closer to their actual commission.
	
	
	Mr McPhillamy, I take it that as you have already spent a period of time in custody that you fully understand that your release on parole will depend upon your behaviour while in custody. You have indicated, as has been referred to in the reports, that you are prepared to take part in the Denier’s Program. I would suggest to you that if you wish to be released when first eligible for release, you will need to convince the authorities that you have changed your ways and made efforts to rehabilitate yourself and lower your risk of reoffending. That will only be done, in my view, should you appropriately participate in relevant programs while in custody. If you do not do so, the risk you run is that you will not be released when first eligible for release.
	
	
	Now, is there anything that I have omitted? I don’t expect you, Madam Crown - you know nothing about the matter. Mr Heathcote?
	
	
	HEATHCOTE: No, your Honour.

	N ADAMS J: 
	


Introduction


	
	Wassim Fayad is a 49-year-old man who seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Woodburne SC DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta on 27 November 2015 for a “ram raid” offence contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant asked her Honour to take three further offences into account on Forms 1. The offence was committed whilst the applicant was on bail.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years to commence on 29 November 2013 and expire on 28 November 2020, with a non-parole period of four years and nine months to expire on 28 August 2018. An offence contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.
	
	
	The procedural history of these offences can be shortly stated. On 28 February 2013, the applicant (in the name of Fred Toufuc Alameddine) was convicted in the Local Court of offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act and stealing from a dwelling house contrary to s 148 of the Crimes Act. That matter concerned the lashing 40 times with a cable of a man who had come to the applicant for guidance in adhering to his religious faith. The matter was adjourned for sentence on 24 June 2013.
	
	
	On 15 May 2013 (before the date of sentence and whilst subject to bail), the applicant and two co-offenders used two stolen vehicles to crash through the glass front doors of a shopping centre in the early hours of the morning in an attempt to dislodge and steal an Automatic Teller Machine (“ATM”) or ATMs. Such an offence is colloquially termed a “ram raid”. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, significant damage was caused. The applicant and his co-offenders fled the scene.
	
	
	On 14 June 2013, the applicant was sentenced in the Local Court to a term of imprisonment for the offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and stealing from a dwelling house. The applicant was released on appeal bail on 24 June 2013.
	
	
	During this period of bail, the applicant became aware that Osama Toffic had been involved in the shooting of Michael Rooke at the Arrows Nightclub in Rydalmere on 1 May 2013. Being so aware, he assisted Mr Toffic by taking steps to ensure that he was warned to leave the country because he was going to be arrested in relation to the shooting.
	
	
	On 29 November 2013, the applicant was arrested for the ram raid offence and also in relation to being an accessory after the fact to the shooting. He was refused bail and has been in custody since that date.
	
	
	On 14 February 2014, the applicant’s appeal against conviction for the Local Court offences was dismissed. His appeal against sentence was successful. In lieu of the sentence imposed in the Local Court, he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years, which was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the CSP Act”). He was not released from custody at that time because he was still bail refused in relation to his other offences.
	
	
	On 26 February 2015, the applicant was committed for trial from the Local Court at Parramatta for the principal offence. On 31 August 2015, the applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing one count of aggravated (in company) break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (steal) contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act in relation to the ram raid offence and a second count of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act. The applicant pleaded guilty to the first count on the indictment and not guilty to the second offence. The applicant’s plea of guilty was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment.
	
	
	The applicant asked that further offences contained on two Forms 1 also be taken into account at sentence pursuant to s 33 of the CSP Act. Those offences were two counts of taking and driving a conveyance contrary to s 154A of the Crimes Act (using the two stolen vehicles to commit the ram raid) and one count of being an accessory after the fact to the shooting of Mr Rooke contrary to ss 98/350 of the Crimes Act.
	


The facts


	
	A nine-page document headed “Agreed Facts” was tendered as constituting the facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. That document included detailed facts of not only the principal offence but also the accessory matter on one of the Forms 1. The applicant’s counsel before this Court submitted that the agreed facts should not have been fully extracted by her Honour as they provided too much detail concerning the shooting of Mr Rooke. I propose to set out the agreed facts so that the applicant’s complaint in this regard can be fully understood:
	


“Aggravated in company break and enter with intent to steal

Events preceding

1. On 14 May 2013 at approximately 1:45pm the offender Wassim Fayad and co‑accused Milad Al-Ahmadzai were together at Bankstown Police Station as recorded in CCTV footage.

2. At 7:50pm the offender and Al-Ahmadzai spoke on the phone. Al‑Ahmadzai said “Tomorrow me and you will try to go job hunting eh.” The offender replied “Yep we got to do that.” The term “job” is a reference to the ram raid.

3. At 11:03pm the offender and Al-Ahmadzai spoke on the phone again, an excerpt of the conversation is as follows.

“WF:    Sorry, brother, if I woke you up, man.

MA:    No.

WF:    I just wanted to let you know, eh, my brother’s wife is very sick.

MA:    Okay.

WF:    My brother’s wife is sick and her son just finished work and she asked me to go pick him up. I got to pick him up, and, um, you know, he might be running a little bit late, you know.

MA:    Ah, it will be good, Allah willing. He’s running late, no worries.”

4. In this conversation the offender was informing Al-Ahmadzai that the third co‑offender was running late. The conversation continued:

“WF:    How was work today?

MA:    Yeah praise be to Allah, man. Oh bro, you know me. I’m dying from work let’s quickly go find something, eh?

WF:    (laughs) (indistinct).

MA:    Mmm.

WF:    Alright, alright.

MA:    (indistinct) just got out of the shower, bro. I’m gonna collapse, man, I’m that tired.

WF:    It will be good, Allah willing. Alright, just be patient, ah, with the brother.

MA:    Yeah, yeah. For sure, for sure.”

Stolen vehicles (Form 1 offences)

5. Shortly thereafter the offender drove Toyota Camry BR40UX to Auburn where he picked up Al-Ahmadzai. At some stage a third unidentified male co‑offender also entered the car.

6. The offender drove Al-Ahmadzai and the unidentified male to Rowe Street, Eastwood, where one of them stole blue Ford Econovan AG91LK. The offender also drove them to Cottonwood Crescent, North Ryde, where one of them stole white Toyota Tarago RZW967. The offender then drove to Pembroke Road, Marsfield, where he parked the Camry.

Ram Raid

7. On 15 May 2013 at approximately 3:50am, the offender, Al-Ahmadzai, and the unidentified male drove in convoy to the Macquarie Shopping Centre. The white Tarago was driven into the shopping centre crashing through the glass front doors. It was driven through the shops and crashed directly into a group of free-standing ATMs in an attempt to dislodge them. The vehicle was then reversed and driven into the ATMs for a second time.

8. The blue Econovan was driven into the shopping centre behind the white Tarago. It did a U-turn and reversed close to the ATMs. The offender was in the front passenger seat of the Econovan. After the Econovan was stopped, the offender opened the passenger side door but he did not alight from the vehicle.

9. The three offenders had entered the shopping centre with the intention of stealing at least one of the ATMs. They intended to dislodge it using the white Tarago before loading it into the back of the blue Econovan.

10. The offenders were unable to dislodge the ATMs so money was taken. The Commonwealth Bank ATM contained $210,090 in cash and sustained $8,887 worth of damage. The ANZ Bank ATM contained $49,170 in cash and sustained $34,941 worth of damage.

11. The white Tarago was damaged and abandoned at the scene. The three offenders entered the blue Econovan and drove away. They then parked the Econovan on Pembroke Road, Marsfield, and set it alight to destroy any forensic evidence.

12. While driving back to Auburn in the Camry, the offender activated a speed camera at 4:18am on Pennant Hills Road, Oatlands, between Glencoe and Gollan Avenues, travelling in a southerly direction. Al-Ahmadzai and the unidentified male were also in the car.

Speeding Fine

13. Toyota Camry BR40UX is registered to Zachariah Alameddine, the offender’s son. They reside at the same address in Auburn.

14. The speeding fine was issued on 21 May 2013. On 23 May 2013 Zachariah phoned the offender and told him that he had received a speeding fine. Upon being informed of the location and time the offender admitted that he had been driving the Camry.

Events following 

15. On a date between 23 May 2013 and 8 June 2013, the offender told his friend Osama Gebara about the speeding fine. Gebara provided the offender with the personal details including licence details of his employee Munther Abu-Taer. On 8 June 2013, a statutory declaration was completed in the name of Zakariya Alameddine falsely asserting that Abu-Taer had been the driver of the Camry at the relevant time.

16. On 10 July 2013, police attended the offender’s home and spoke to Zakariya, they told him that they were investigating a ram raid at the Macquarie Shopping Centre and that his vehicle had been detected in the area. Between 10 July 2013 and 14 August 2013, the offender had a number of discussions with Gebara about ensuring that Abu-Taer would effectively take the blame for the speeding fine.

17. On 12 July 2013 Al-Ahmadzai called the offender, Al-Ahmadzai was in custody for other matters at the time. They had a conversation:

WF:     Do you remember that little, do you remember that little    (indistinct).MA:    The little what?

WF:    Do you remember that little trip? MA:    Yeah.

WF:    Me, you and Abu Ziad? MA:    Yeah.

WF:    Yeah, brother, it's, they've just ah (beeping) yeah.

MA:   Okay. It's gunna cut out.

WF:    ---yeah, listen, I love you for the sake of Allah.

MA:   (indistinct)... you love me. Give my love to all the boys, huh?

WF:    I will, I will but there's something else I needed to tell you,    man. It's just, there's a lot, too much to say, bro.

MA:   I'll try calling you back later today.

18. The term “little trip” is a reference to the ram raid.

19. On 18 July 2013 Al-Ahmadzai called the offender again. The offender indicated that he needed to see Al-Ahmadzai face to face. Al-Ahmadzai was still in custody at that time. They had a conversation:

WF:   Oh man, I, anyway, listen, remember our little fishing trip? MA:   Yeah.

WF:    You - you and Abu Ziad? MA:    Yeah.

WF:    Yeah, guess what, brother? (Laughs) MA:   What? All - all good?

WF:    What? I said, guess - our- our, remember our little fishing trip?    We went and…

MA:   Yeah, yeah.

WF:    We went and fished. MA:   Yeah.

WF:    You remember the fish that we went and tried to catch and    they were very--

MA:   Yeah.

WF:    Very very very hard to get out of the water. MA:   Yeah.

WF:   Yeah, brother, forget it, man. Um, it's come back to ...... ... MA:   Gone?

WF:    Yeah, they, they've- they've come back to bite us. MA:    What do you mean?

WF:    (Laughs). They've come back to bite us. MA:   What....

WF:    Yeah, yeah. Do you remember? On our way home?

MA:   Yeah, yeah, I remember, brother.

WF:    Do you remember on our way back home? When I said to you    Glory be to Allah, did you see a flash?

MA:    Oh, no way.

WF:    Yeah, brother. Yeah, brother. Yeah.

20. In this conversation the “flash” is the flash of the speed camera on Pennant Hills Road, “the fishing trip” is the ram raid, the “fish” being “very, very hard to get out of the water” is a reference to the offender Al-Ahmadzai and ‘Abu Zaid’ being unable to dislodge the ATMs.

21. Between 23 July 2013 and 14 August 2013 the offender had a number of conversations with Gebara and Wesam Hamze in which they discussed how to ensure that Abu-Taer would stick to the story and take the blame for the speeding fine, Fayad said “These pigs are just looking [for] a link”.

22. The “link” referred to by Fayad was the link between the speeding fine and the ram raid.

23. The offender was arrested on 29 November 2013. He declined to be interviewed.

FORM 1: ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT TO ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO ROB ARMED WITH AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON CAUSING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM

24. The offender Wassim Fayad was an accessory after the fact to the shooting of Michael Rooke at the Arrows Nightclub in Rydalmere on 1 May 2013. The shooting was carried out by Milad AI-Ahmadzai, Osama Toffic and Wesam Hamze. The offender afterwards had knowledge of the offence and Toffic's involvement in it, and he assisted Toffic by telling him to leave the country because he was going to be arrested in relation to the shooting.

The shooting

25. On 30 April 2013, the victim Michael Rooke (aged 53 years) attended the Arrows Nightclub located at 17 Bridge Street, Rydalmere. The venue is marketed as a 'Gay and Bi Sex Club'. The victim arrived at approximately 11:08pm and parked his car in the partially underground car park. He left the club at approximately 12:45am (1 May 2013) when he started walking back to his car. Due to the late hour, the car park was almost empty.

26. Upon exiting the club, the victim saw stolen white Toyota Hiace van AJ0-13X parked behind his vehicle, effectively blocking the exit. The van's window had been smashed and the rear sliding door was open. The victim saw two males run from the van and stop approximately 10 metres up the driveway leading to the street. The victim saw the males squat down and look towards him through an opening in the car park wall.

27. The victim returned to the door to the club to inform the manager that a van was blocking the exit. The door to the club is secure and access can only be gained by activating the intercom and waiting for the door to be unlocked by staff inside.

28. A few moments later, the duty manager came to the door. The victim told the manager to come outside because there were ""people"" there.

29. The victim walked back towards his vehicle. He did not appear to be carrying anything. He arrived back at his vehicle and unlocked the doors. The manager was walking a few metres behind him.

30. At approximately 12:47am, the two males ran towards the victim. The victim initially crouched down behind his car before quickly closing the car door and running back towards the entrance to Arrows.

31. Both of the males were wearing facial coverings and gloves. Male #1 was wearing long pants and holding a firearm. AI-Ahmadzai was wearing three-quarter length pants. Male #1 was either Toffic or Hamze.

32. The victim was shot by male #1. The first shot hit the victim's ankle and he fell to the ground. The victim tried to crawl back towards the club but male #1 and AI-Ahmadzai repeatedly kicked and shoved him while he was on the ground and while he was trying to get away.

33. The two males pursued the victim across the car park to the entrance to the club. Male #1 fired six more shots towards the victim at close range. The victim called for help and tried to open the door to the club.

34. The two males ran back to the victim's car and male #1 attempted to shoot the car window, however, the firearm did not discharge. Male #1 spent 22 seconds rummaging through the victim's vehicle while AI-Ahmadzai stood nearby. It is unclear from the CCTV footage whether anything was taken.

35. Male #3 remained away from the car park and closer to the street, either in or near stolen Nissan Pulsar AGN-47U. Shortly after the gun shots, male #3 reversed the Pulsar down the driveway. The two males ran towards the Pulsar and got inside. Male #3 drove them away. Male #3 was either Toffic or Hamze.

Victim's injuries

36. The NSW Ambulance Service registered the Triple 0 call at 12:51am. Ambulance officers arrived at the scene at 12:57am however they were unable to treat the victim until 1:18am because Police were fearful that the shooter was still in the vicinity of the nightclub and would not allow the ambulance officers to enter.

37. The victim had been shot four times - once in the ankle and three times in the torso. He was taken to hospital where he was found to have the following injuries:

•   A metallic foreign body in the right anterior chest wall with subcutaneous emphysema (gas or air in the layer under the skin);

•   Bilateral haemopneumothorax (air and blood in the chest cavity);

•   Right pneumomediastinum (air in the thorax);

•   Free intraperitoneal gas;

•   Right ruptured kidney with surrounding haematoma;

•   Hepatic (liver) laceration with arterial blush and metallic bodies; and

•   Right inguinal (groin or lower abdomen) surgical emphysema.

38. The victim underwent ""urgent damage control surgery"". The surgical procedures included insertion of chest drains, abdominal packing over liver and spleen, repair of diaphragmatic injury, and cleaning of gunshots wounds to right flank, right hip, right suprapubic region, and left leg.

39. The surgical findings were:

•   Haemoperitoneum (200ml of blood in the peritoneal cavity) in both upper quadrants;

•   A through-and-through 2cm liver laceration with long tract;

•   2cm right diaphragm perforation;

•   10cm x Bern right peri-nephric (around the kidneys)/retroperitoneal (abdominal cavity behind the peritoneum) haematoma;

•   Subcutaneous RIF (right iliac fossa) tract connecting gunshot wounds over the right supra-pubic and right hip; and

•   Deep laceration over left ankle exposing the tendon.

40. X-rays showed a comminuted fracture of the left fibula. After surgery, the victim was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring.

41. At 4:10pm, an angiogram revealed ongoing arterial bleeding from the liver. The victim underwent further surgery to repair the bleed.

42. On 2 May 2013, the victim had further surgery to repair bleeding from the spleen, a defect in the right mesocolon (tissue between peritoneal cavity and small intestine), and multiple defects in the omentum (layer of peritoneum that surrounds abdominal organs). His spleen was removed and abdominal drains inserted.

43. On 8 May 2013, the victim was extubated.

44. On 9 May 2013, he underwent further surgery including sphincter repair and repair of a bile leak.

45. On 10 May 2013, he was discharged from intensive care unit and transferred to the high dependency ward.

46. During his hospital admission, the victim had a prolonged period of delirium. He made a ""very slow"" but satisfactory recovery before being discharged on 13 June 2014.

47. His injuries were life-threatening. He will have permanent scarring in his chest, abdomen, and legs and a result of his injuries and treatment.

48. The victim has undergone further surgeries since being discharged from hospital.

Knowledge of the offence

49. On 19 August 2013, the channel 10 television program 'Wanted' broadcast a story about the shooting of Michael Rooke. The story included the broadcasting of an interview with the victim in which he talked about being shot and described his injuries, as well as broadcasting the CCTV from the shooting.

50. Telephone intercept and listening device material prove that the offender became aware of the offence and the involvement of at least AI-Ahmadzai and Toffic either on or before 17 September 2013.

Arrest of AI Ahmadzai 8 October 2013

51. On 8 October 2013, Police attended Goulburn Police Station and arrested AI­ Ahmadzai in relation to the Arrows shooting. He declined to be interviewed.

Arrest of Hamze 10 October 2013

52. On 10 October 2013, Police arrested Wesam Hamze. He denied the offences.

The offender's assistance

53. Shortly before 10 November 2013, Wesam Hamze's wife Tara-Lee Hamze visited her husband in gaol. Wesam told her, ""Go speak to Abu Zakariya and tell him to tell Osama to leave ASAP.""

54. On 10 November 2013 at 11:46am, Tara-Lee phoned the offender. She said that she needed to see him ""very quickly"" and speak to him directly as she needed to tell him something. They arranged to speak again.

55. At approximately 5:45pm, the offender and Tara-Lee had a meeting. Tara-Lee told the offender to tell 'Osama' to leave the country ASAP. At this time, Tara-Lee did not know Toffic's surname.

56. While Tara-Lee was still present, the offender phoned Toffic. The offender told Toffic that he needed to come back to Sydney from Newcastle and see the offender straight away about a ""really serious"" matter that could not be discussed over the phone. The offender said to Toffic, ""Don't go anywhere else, come see me straight away.""

57. At 6:13pm, the offender spoke to Mirwais Danishyar. The offender said that he had ""just received a very important call from inside"" and that he was ""very, very, very busy. I might even have to drive halfway to Newcastle just to see this guy. It's really important, really important.""

58. At 6:13pm, the offender spoke to an unidentified male. The offender said that he needed to meet with the male ""ASAP"" because he just got ""a very, very important message…and I've got to meet up with this guy urgent, urgent. I just received a very important message from someone in gaol, ok? From his wife and I've got to attend to it ASAP.""

59. At 6:20pm, Toffic and the offender agreed to meet on Pennant Hills Road. Later the offender phoned Toffic and told him not to go to a place with a television. The word “television” in this context was actually a reference to a CCTV camera. The offender and Toffic had a face-to-face meeting shortly thereafter. The offender told Toffic to leave the country because he was about to be arrested by Police in relation to the Arrows shooting.

60. At 7:04pm, the offender spoke to William Kostopoulas. He asked Kostopoulas to ask Wesam to put him (the offender) on his visitors list and to phone him ASAP.

61. On 11 November 2013 at 9:56pm, the offender phoned Toffic and said that he will go and see Hamze on Toffic's behalf.

62. On 12 November 2013 at 10:53am, the offender spoke to Tara-Lee and asked her to tell Wesam to call him.

63. At 10:58am, the offender called Toffic and told him that he had confirmation that he (Toffic) was definitely ""that one”. The offender told Toffic not to speak to anyone because he did not want Tara-Lee's information to be exposed.

64. On 13 November 2013 at 5:42pm, the offender called Toffic and said that he wanted to meet however Toffic said that he was ""out of town"". Toffic said, ""You told me to wait til you see him"" and the offender replied, ""I've already done that, brother…I've got a message. I need to see you."" The offender said, ""As soon as you get in the area, like, please come straight to me brother…It's really urgent. Trust me."" Toffic and the offender met shortly after 9pm.

65. At 10:06pm, as a result of the conversation with the offender, Toffic did an internet search looking for cheap flights to Turkey.

66. At 11:45pm, the offender spoke to an unidentified male. The offender said, ""The brother has only one day to leave the country...I told him to call your number...His name is Osama...I told him what to do and the letter came to me from gaol...he has to go and leave the country.""

Toffic's response

67. On 15 November 2013 at 10:57am, Toffic spoke to Bilal Elzamtar. Bilal Elzamtar is Milad AI-Ahmadzai's brother-in-law. Toffic asked him if he had heard any news about ""Milad"" because he thinks he (Toffic) will be charged by Police. Elzamtar asked if he was talking about ""the shooting"" near Ermington and Toffic replied in the affirmative. Toffic told Elzamtar that he would be going on ""holidays"" soon but he didn't want to talk about it over the phone. Toffic said that he was being ""accused”.

68. At 11:28am, Toffic again spoke to Elzamtar. Toffic said that ""they"" came asking about him and that ""the men"" have told him to go. This was a reference to Fayad. Elzamtar told Toffic not to have one bit of regret and Toffic replied, ""I swear by God, I don't. God willing, I will get through the ticket box.""

69. At 2:26pm, Toffic spoke to his wife. He said, ""I am wanted by the fucking Police.""

70. At 3:22pm, Toffic spoke to an unidentified male and said that next week he was going on a holiday. Not a normal holiday- a ""holiday holiday.""

71. At 4:49pm, Toffic did an internet search to compare flight prices to Germany.

Toffic's flight

72. On 16 November 2013 at around midday, Toffic's sister and mother attended a travel agency in Granville and purchased a ticket to Germany via Abu Dhabi in the name of Osama Toffic. The ticket was for an Etihad flight leaving at 9:50pm that night.

Arrest of Toffic 16 November 2013

73. On 16 November 2013 at approximately 8:35pm, Toffic was stopped at Sydney International Airport by customs staff and subsequently arrested by Police. Toffic was in possession of the ticket that had been purchased by his mother and sister.

74. Toffic's arrest at the airport was broadcast on various television news reports. Shortly after Toffic was arrested, Wesam Hamze phoned Tara-Lee Hamze and told her that, ""The guy that got arrested was the guy the [she] called Fadi for.""

The offender's phone call to AI Ahmadzai

75. On 19 November 2013 at 9:57am, the offender spoke to AI-Ahmadzai. The offender said, ""Your brother has been…pretty much collected."" AI-Ahmadzai said that he already knew because it's ""all over the news”.

Arrest of the offender

76. The offender was arrested on 29 November 2013. He told Police that he had ""never heard of” the shooting of Michael Rooke at Rydalmere. He agreed that he knew Milad AI-Ahmadzai, Osama Toffic, and Wesam Hamze as they are his ""brothers in Islam"" however he said he could not remember whether he told Toffic that Police wanted to arrest him and that he should leave the country. He declined to be interviewed.

The sentence proceedings


	
	In addition to the agreed facts document, the Crown tendered the following documents on sentence: a document headed “Crown Sentence Summary”; the applicant’s criminal and custodial histories; the remarks on sentence of Bennett SC DCJ in relation to the applicant’s conviction appeal to the District Court; documentation from NSW Corrective Services concerning the applicant’s segregated custody in the High Risk Management Programme (“HRMP”); and a statement outlining the damage done as a result of the ram raid. In addition, CCTV footage of the commission of the offence was played at the proceedings on sentence and relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant objected to paragraphs [15] – [22] of the agreed facts document, which state that the applicant made a false statutory declaration in the name of his son as to the identity of the driver of the Toyota Camry with registration BR40UX. That vehicle was captured by a speed camera as the applicant and his co-offender drove back to Auburn. The basis of the objection was that this material was irrelevant, in that it pertained to the count on the indictment to which the applicant had pleaded not guilty. Her Honour accepted that submission.
	
	
	The only evidence adduced in the defence case on sentence was an affidavit of the applicant sworn 13 November 2015. In it he deposed that he is being held in the High Risk Management Unit of Goulburn Correctional Centre (“HRMU”). He described suffering extreme distress, nausea and severe migraine headaches since being housed in the HRMU. He has six children whom he had not been able to see as at the date of his affidavit because they were not as yet approved as visitors by Corrective Services. He speaks to his family twice a week. He described not being able to afford the religiously appropriate meals provided at an extra cost in custody and thus his only source of meat is at the halal barbecue conducted in custody one day a week.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel informed the court that he was not in a position to make a submission that there was any evidence of remorse in this matter. He indicated that the applicant’s subjective case would be run solely on the question of the applicant’s custodial circumstances. He focused his submissions upon the proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, a table of cases said to be comparable, the applicant’s hardship in custody and the utilitarian value of the plea.
	


The reasons of the sentencing judge


	
	Her Honour outlined the procedural history of the matter and set out the agreed facts in full. She then went on to note that she could not take into account the facts that form the basis of the alleged offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act to which the applicant had pleaded not guilty. Her Honour proceeded to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the principal offence. Her Honour found that there were five matters relevant to that assessment: that there was considerable planning involved; that the intent was to commit the serious indictable offence of larceny of a substantial amount of cash; that the circumstance of aggravation was that the offence was committed in company (which is less serious than some other aggravating factors); that the damage to the shopping centre and the ATMs was substantial; and that the offence was committed for financial gain. Overall she found that this was “a very serious instance” of an offence contrary to s 113(2).
	
	
	As for the accessory offence on the Form 1, her Honour found that the offence was less serious than some, but not at the lowest end of culpability. She noted that it is necessary to take into account the nature of the principal offence. Her Honour found that the offence contrary to s 98 was a serious one and thus that the applicant had knowingly assisted an attempt to elude justice for a very serious criminal offence.
	
	
	Her Honour allowed a 12.5% discount for the guilty plea. She then considered the applicant’s subjective circumstances. She noted that the applicant was born in November 1967 and was aged 45 at the time of the commission of the “ram raid” offence. She noted that his criminal history revealed early contact with the criminal justice system, but that the history was not extensive. She noted that the main significance of the criminal history was that the principal offence for which the applicant stood to be sentenced, as well as the matters on both Forms 1, were all committed while the offender was on bail. Her Honour noted that this was a matter relevant to the determination of sentence.
	
	
	It was noted that, beyond the conditions of the applicant’s imprisonment, there was little evidence before her Honour as to his personal history or circumstances. In those circumstances, her Honour found that there were “…no matters mitigating Mr Fayad’s criminal culpability for the offence committed by him.”
	
	
	Furthermore, it was noted that there was no evidence of remorse. Her Honour did not find that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were good or that he was unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	As for the applicant’s conditions of custody, her Honour noted that the evidence before her was that the applicant’s segregation was necessary for the security of, and good order and discipline within, a correctional centre. She found that it was reasonable to conclude that it was more likely than not that the applicant would continue to be housed in the HRMU. Accordingly, she accepted that the applicant’s conditions of custody would be harsher than might otherwise be the case and determined that it was appropriate to mitigate the sentence to some degree for that reason.
	
	
	Her Honour then referred to the purposes of sentencing and noted:
	


“This is a case where I am called upon to sentence a mature age man who was at liberty on bail when he committed the principal offence. His plea of guilty has to be duly acknowledged and taken into account. There is no evidence of remorse as I have said and Mr Fayad does not have good prospects of rehabilitation. He cannot be sentenced as though he is a young offender who has both accepted responsibility for his conduct and who is remorseful and who has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.

In all of the circumstances I am satisfied that the sentence to be imposed must fulfil not only the purpose of general deterrence and denunciation but also special deterrence. Mr Fayad must be made accountable for his serious criminal conduct. In so stating I recognise that having regard to all of the purposes for which a sentence may be imposed and having regard to all of the facts of the matter concerning the offence and concerning the offender that there is a need to impose a proportionate sentence.”


	
	Her Honour went on to consider five comparable cases involving “ram raid” offences upon which the applicant’s counsel at sentence relied. The schedule summarising those five cases is annexed to her Honour’s reasons. They are Johnson v R [2009] NSWCCA 204; McDonald v R [2011] NSWCCA 2; Forbes v R [2009] NSWCCA 292; R v DBN [2005] NSWCCA 435; and McGeown v R [2014] NSWCCA 314. Her Honour noted that three of those cases pertained to breaches of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (namely, break, enter and commit serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation). The present offence is contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act (break and enter with intent to commit serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation).
	
	
	Having referred to those cases, her Honour stated:
	


“It should not be thought that the appropriate sentence in a particular case is to be determined by the objective of seeking mathematical equivalence with other cases. In considering the cases brought to the attention of the court it is clearly acknowledged by the parties that there are differences in the facts and circumstances of the offences and the particular offenders. So much can be seen from the nature and number of offences committed by the particular offenders referred to in the chart including by way of distribution of various Form 1 offences. It is to be recalled that one of the matters I am to take into account on sentence is a matter unrelated to the principal offence. Ultimately the sentence to be imposed must be appropriate to the circumstances of the offending and of the offender.”


	
	Her Honour noted that there was no attempt on behalf of the applicant to make a submission that a finding of special circumstances should be made. Nonetheless, having determined to mitigate the sentence by reason of the applicant’s conditions of custody, her Honour made a finding of special circumstances and adjusted the statutory ratio to some limited extent in order not to impose a head sentence that failed adequately to mark the seriousness of the offending.
	


The proposed appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal upon which the applicant relied in this application for leave to appeal is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Mr Scragg of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, submitted first that the applicant’s criminal history was not such that it would disentitle him to leniency. In support of this submission, he relied upon the reasons of Bennett DCJ allowing the applicant’s severity appeal in the unrelated assault and steal from dwelling house matters. In particular, he pointed to Bennett DCJ’s observations that the applicant was of a deep religious faith and had been acting in accordance with what he understood to be his responsibility at the time of those offences. It was also noted that that the complainant had consented to the first three of the 40 blows inflicted and had gone to the applicant looking for guidance and assistance.
	
	
	Complaint was then made that, despite the fact that her Honour stated that she would not take into account the facts pertaining to the count contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act, she nonetheless set out those facts in her reasons. It was submitted that her Honour may not have adhered to her express self-direction. Mr Scragg did not rely upon this as a separate error, but submitted that it is indicative of some misapplication of principle that cannot be identified as any patent error.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the sentencing judge set out the facts for the Form 1 offence in considerable detail and that this too was indicative of error. It was submitted that the error was revealed in the ultimate sentence imposed.
	
	
	Mr Scragg submitted that a crushing sentence had been imposed on the applicant. He accepted that a sentence can be increased in order to take into account a Form 1 offence or offences. Nonetheless, it was submitted that the sentence imposed was unjust and does not promote the objectives of rehabilitation. Mr Scragg relied upon a number of cases by way of comparison, some of which were before the sentencing judge, and submitted that her Honour could not have had proper regard to those cases. In addition to the five cases to which her Honour referred, he also relied upon decisions of this Court concerning “ram raids” prosecuted contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. Those decisions were R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466; R v Leslie [2009] NSWCCA 203; and R v Reilly; R v Smith [2012] NSWCCA 166. He also relied upon the cases of R v Lenthall [2004] NSWCCA 248 and R v Guthrie [2002] NSWCCA 77, which concerned offences contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Mr Scragg submitted that the applicant had led an “unblemished life”, but conceded that there was no material before the sentencing judge upon which such a finding could be made. It was also submitted that a finding of remorse should have been made because of the plea of guilty. However, Mr Scragg accepted that there was no evidence of remorse before the sentencing court.
	
	
	Finally Mr Scragg relied upon the statistics published by the Judicial Commission in its Judicial Information Research System (“JIRS”) in support of a submission that the applicant received the highest sentence imposed for an offence against s 113(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the decisions upon which the applicant relied can all be distinguished from the present case on their facts and their respective subjective features. It was noted that offences under s 113(2) cover a broad range of offending conduct.
	
	
	It was further submitted that, having regard to the multiple objectives of sentencing for offences of this kind, the absence of any strong subjective case, and the inclusion of the Form 1 matters, the head sentence of seven years with a non-parole period of four years and nine months imposed in this matter cannot be regarded as plainly unjust or unreasonable.
	


Consideration


	
	To succeed on a ground of manifest excess, the applicant must establish that the sentence is “unreasonable” or “plainly unjust”: Markarian v The Queen [2006] 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25 at [25]; Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [59]. Consideration of such a ground is undertaken in the context that there is no single correct sentence and that sentencing is not to be understood as a mathematical exercise. Accordingly, sentencing judges are to be allowed as much flexibility as is consonant with consistency of approach and applicable sentencing principle. As Hayne J observed in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111; [1999] HCA 46, “…there will be a range of possible sentences that could be imposed without error.”
	
	
	In Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665; [1999] HCA 19, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ) at [15] expressed the role of an appellate court dealing with a ground of manifest excess this in this way:
	


“…a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. This is basic. The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.”


	
	The focus of the applicant’s submissions in seeking to establish that the sentence imposed on the applicant was unreasonable or plainly unjust was a detailed comparison of the sentence with that imposed in other “ram raid” decisions of this Court. In this regard it is pertinent to extract what the High Court observed in Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R (2014) 305 ALR 323; [2014] HCA 2 at [40]-[41], where French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ stated (footnotes omitted):
	


“The setting of bounds to the available range of sentences in a particular case must, however, be distinguished from the proper and ordinary use of sentencing statistics and other material indicating what sentences have been imposed in other (more or less) comparable cases. Consistency of sentencing is important. But the consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not numerical equivalence.

As the plurality pointed out in Hili v The Queen, in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion. The history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important is the unifying principles which those sentences both reveal and reflect. And as each of Buchanan JA and Kellam JA rightly observed in MacNeil-Brown, the synthesis of the ""raw material"" which must be considered on sentencing, including material like sentencing statistics and information about the sentences imposed in comparable cases, is the task of the sentencing judge, not counsel.”


	
	I have had regard to the five cases to which her Honour referred as well as the additional cases relied upon by the applicant at the hearing of this application. Only three of the cases involved offences contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act (as opposed to s 112(1)). In R v Lenthall, a significantly lower sentence than the present sentence was imposed, but the offender received a 25% discount for his early plea, was found to be genuinely remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. In R v DBN, the sentence of five years was described as “lenient” by Rothman J. In any event, the s 113(2) offence committed by DBN was part of a series of offences for which he was being dealt with and thus the principle of totality applied. R v Guthrie was a Crown appeal in 2002 (prior to the enactment of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act) 2001 (NSW)) where the appeal was allowed and a sentence of six and half years imposed.
	
	
	The submission advanced on behalf of the applicant was that, even having regard to the sentences imposed for the more serious offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of five years), the sentence imposed on the applicant was excessive. Implicit in this submission is a contention that the sentencing judge placed undue weight on the s 112(2) decisions rather than the s 113(2) decisions, and thus erred. The difficulty with this contention is that her Honour’s reasons show that she expressly identified that some of the cases upon which the applicant relied involved convictions for offences contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. There is nothing in her Honour’s reasons to suggest that she did not make the distinction between the respective decisions. Although it is to be accepted that the sentence imposed upon the applicant is towards the higher end of the sentences imposed in the s 112(2) cases upon which the applicant relied, this submission is ultimately no more than a submission that the sentence is too high.
	
	
	The sentencing judge paid close regard to the decisions in other cases and annexed the schedule of the relevant cases to her final reasons. Her Honour clearly had regard to the relevant principles in those cases. “Ram raid” offences are particularly serious property offences because of the potential both for property damage and the theft of large sums of money. The sentencing judge quoted in her reasons from the decision in Reilly v R; Smith v R, where Price J (with whom Basten JA and Campbell J agreed) observed at [37]:
	


“In my opinion, a 'ram-raid' is a serious instance of an offence of break, enter and steal because of the inevitable destruction that is unleashed by the use of a motor vehicle to smash into commercial premises and the difficulty that store owners have protecting their property from such an offence. Both specific and general deterrence would normally play an important part in the sentencing task for a ram-raid offence.”


	
	Her Honour also extracted the observations of Fullerton J in McGeown v R (with whom Leeming JA agreed, Adams J dissenting) at [55]:
	


“Using a vehicle as a ram to force entry to commercial premises with the intention of stealing from them has been recognised as a particular type of offending in breach of s 112(2) largely because of certain common features which, when they are present, serve as an indicator of objective seriousness: invariably a stolen vehicle is used and the offence committed in company; considerable property damage is frequently occasioned and property of not inconsiderable value taken. In addition, while insurance is some measure a proprietor can take against loss, little can be done to protect against the risk of particular commercial premises being targeted. In this case the pharmacy was targeted because of the expectation that there would be quantities of prescription drugs and cash available to be stolen quickly before an escape was effected in the vehicle used as the ram.”


	
	Having had regard to the other decisions concerning “ram raid” cases, her Honour noted that the appropriate sentence in any given sentencing exercise is not to be determined by the objective of seeking mathematical equivalence with other cases.
	
	
	In order for this appeal to be upheld, the applicant must establish that, having regard to all of the features of his case, both objective and subjective and aggravating and mitigating, the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. When regard is had to those matters the following emerges.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment in circumstances where the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years. The offence included a degree of planning that her Honour found to be considerable. The amount of cash in the two ATMs that the applicant sought to remove was in the vicinity of $260,000, although no money was actually taken. There were three offenders involved in circumstances where the aggravating element was that the offence was committed in company. The offence caused damage in the amount of approximately $75,000, which her Honour described as “substantial”. The offence was committed for financial gain. No other explanation was advanced on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	There were three separate offences to be taken into account on two separate Forms 1 in this matter. Although I accept that the offence of taking and driving a conveyance is often associated with offences of this nature, the accessorial offence was a further serious matter unrelated to the index offence. It is well established that a sentence can be increased to take into account matters on a Form 1: Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 518; Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. The seriousness of a Form 1 offence is pertinent to the extent to which a sentence would be increased to take the offence into account.
	
	
	The principal offence was committed whilst the applicant was on bail. The Form 1 accessory matter was also committed whilst the applicant was on appeal bail. It was appropriate to have regard to this an aggravating factor.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty at a relatively late stage of the proceedings. He was afforded a discount of 12.5%. Many of the other cases upon which the applicant relied involved pleas at an earlier stage of the proceedings.
	
	
	The applicant could not rely upon his previous good character. The applicant has a criminal history, but until recently it was not significant. He had a conviction for a stealing offence and a break, enter and steal in the Children’s Court and a conviction for offensive behaviour in 1987. He then had nothing on his criminal record until 2001, when he was fined for driving whilst disqualified from holding a licence. There were no further convictions until he committed the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company offence in 2011, the facts of which were before the sentencing judge in the form of the remarks on sentence of Bennett DCJ.
	
	
	Mr Scragg invited the Court to have regard to the matters to which Bennett DCJ referred in his reasons allowing the applicant’s severity appeal. It is to be noted that her Honour did not refer to the facts of those offences at all in her reasons. Her Honour considered that the only significance of those offences was that the applicant was on bail for them when he committed the present offence and on appeal bail in relation to them when he committed the Form 1 offence. Bennett DCJ imposed a suspended sentence on the applicant for those offences. To the extent that it was suggested on behalf of the applicant that her Honour somehow placed too much weight on those matters, such a submission is not borne out in her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	Although the applicant’s criminal history was not significant, the applicant – a middle-aged man – involved himself in a course of serious offending behaviour over a relatively short period of time. There is nothing disclosed in her Honour’s reasons to suggest that she placed too much weight on the applicant’s criminal record, nor was the applicant entitled to any leniency based on it.
	
	
	Significantly, there was no material put before the Court to assist her Honour as to whether the sentence could be mitigated in any way beyond the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty and was serving his sentence in the HRMU. This is an unusual feature of the case and one that is of some relevance in circumstances where the applicant seeks to rely upon comparisons of this case with other decisions of this Court. In none of the other cases upon which the applicant relied was there such a paucity of mitigating material as in the present case. In some of them a great deal of subjective material was before the Court. It is well established that a sentence can be mitigated by evidence of, by way of example, mental illness, a disadvantaged childhood, remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation, charitable works, extreme hardship to families, provocation, duress, an offer of assistance, or an offer to make reparation to the victim.
	
	
	No material of this nature was put before the sentencing judge by experienced counsel appearing for the applicant. It was not suggested by counsel on the appeal (who was not counsel who appeared for the applicant at first instance) that the decision not to do so was for any reason other than the applicant’s instructions. In circumstances where her Honour found that the offence was “very serious” and that there was no basis to mitigate the sentence any further, a stern sentence was the inevitable result.
	
	
	It is of further significance that the applicant is not a young man, having regard to the fact that offences of this nature are usually committed by young men. The ages of the offenders in the cases upon which the applicant relied at the time of the offence (where the age appears in the judgment) were 24 (Mr Leslie), 19 (Mr Johnson), 24 (Mr Reilly), 22 (Mr Smith), 29 (Mr Forbes), 26 (DBN), and 27 (Mr Guthrie). Only Mr Ceissman at 31 and Mr McGeown at 36 could not be described as young, albeit that they were both considerably younger than the applicant. As her Honour pointed out, she was not able to sentence the offender on the basis that he was a “young offender who has both accepted responsibility for his conduct and who is remorseful and who has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation”. Her Honour could not find that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were good.
	
	
	The only mitigating feature upon which her Honour was in a position to rely was the circumstances of the applicant’s custody. The evidence before her Honour was that the applicant was placed in segregation not for his own safety but because his actions in custody whilst in the general prison population were having a negative impact on the safety and security of the correctional centre. The basis for this was not put before the sentencing judge in any detail; it was simply stated that, whilst in custody, the applicant had been “actively recruiting inmates to Islam” and was a “proponent of the implementation of Sharia law”. Although it was open to her Honour to take his conditions of custody into account “to some degree”, as her Honour did, they did not warrant any significant amelioration given that they are a result of his own actions.
	
	
	I have had regard to the applicant’s complaint that her Honour’s recitation of the facts pertaining to the Form 1 accessory offence contained too much detail of the principal offence (the shooting). Her Honour simply set out the agreed facts, which were before her in their entirety. This is a common practice in sentencing proceedings. It is difficult to see how any complaint can be made to the effect that her Honour recounted the facts upon which the sentence was to be based in the form that it was agreed that they should be before her for the purpose of sentencing the applicant.
	
	
	Finally, in concluding that the sentence imposed was not unreasonable or plainly unjust, I have had particular regard to the sentencing statistics published by the Judicial Commission. They show that, of the 137 cases between January 2009 and December 2015 in which offenders received a custodial sentence for an offence contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act, only three offenders (including the applicant) received a head sentence as high as seven years. That is, the applicant’s sentence is at the top of the current “range” of sentences reflected in those statistics. It is pertinent in this regard to note the observations of Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [303] – [305]:
	


“A history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. Such a history does not establish that that range is the correct range, nor that either the upper or the lower limit is the correct upper and lower limit. Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.

But it would be a mistake to regard an established range as fixing the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence. To take that attitude would be, de facto, to substitute judicial selection of sentences in individual cases for the boundaries of sentencing for a particular offence laid down by Parliament. In this case, that range is from 0 to 25 years. Of course, it is well established that the maximum sentence is reserved for the most serious cases. It is equally well established that it would be an extraordinary proposition that a person convicted of an offence of importing prohibited drugs would escape any custodial penalty. The point I am making is that the ranges of sentences actually imposed, while illuminating, are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. But it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that “unifying principles” may be discerned: Wong and Leung, at [59].

In the end, the sentencing discretion is individual: it must be exercised by the individual judge, in respect of the individual offender. Significant sentencing considerations include the role played by the offender in the particular importation or enterprise, the quantity of the drug involved, and its estimated street or wholesale value (having regard, inter alia, where relevant, to its purity). Also of considerable significance are the character and antecedents of the offender (s 16A(2)(m)). This last consideration bears upon the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, and also to any claim for leniency made on his or her behalf by reason of prior good character.”


	
	These comments were endorsed by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [54].
	
	
	The statistics do not reflect the relevant objective and subjective features in each case. Significantly, they do not record how many of the other offenders committed serious “ram raid” offences whilst on conditional liberty, asked that other matters be taken into account at the time of sentence, and then placed virtually no subjective material before the sentencing court.
	
	
	The sentence imposed is high, but in the circumstances of this case I am not persuaded that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would grant the applicant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

4640410,Application by Peter James Holland pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2017] NSWSC 462,"Judgment


	
	In September 2001 Peter James Holland was charged with five sexual offences alleged to have been committed by him at Goulburn on the evening of 19 July 2001, all against the same adult female complainant. He was tried on those charges in the District Court over seven days in May 2002. He was found guilty on count 1, aggravated sexual intercourse without consent involving digital vaginal penetration, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and on count 2, attempted sexual intercourse without consent. The jury acquitted him of the other three counts.
	
	
	Mr Holland was sentenced to imprisonment. He appealed against conviction. Five grounds were argued, all of which were rejected: R v Holland [2002] NSWCCA 469. He has fully served his sentence.
	
	
	On 28 May 2006 Mr Holland applied pursuant to Part 13A of the Crimes Act for an inquiry into the convictions. On 23 February 2007 the provisions contained in Part 13A (ss 474B – 474N) were repealed and re-enacted as Part 7 (ss 76 – 88) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). Mr Holland’s application under Part 13A had not been finally determined immediately before the repeal and was therefore taken to be an application under the corresponding provisions of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act by force of cl13, Schedule 1 of that Act.
	
	
	On 28 March 2008 Johnson J refused that application: Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251.
	
	
	On 21 July 2016 Mr Holland lodged with the registry of the Court a second application of the same kind as that which had been refused by Johnson J; that is, to have the Court direct an inquiry by a judicial officer into his conviction and sentence. This time the application has been made under ss 78 and 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. These are the Court’s reasons for refusing that second application.
	


The nature and particulars of the present application


	
	By force of subs (2) of s 79 the Court may direct an inquiry into a conviction only “if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”. Subsection (3) of s 79 is as follows, so far as relevant to the circumstances of Mr Holland’s application:
	


“79 Consideration of applications

…   

(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)   it appears that the matter:

(i)   has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)   has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)   … or

(iv)   … and

(b)   the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.”


	
	For reasons which will follow I consider that the operation of subs (3) is attracted to the circumstances of this case by facts which satisfy sub pars (i) and (ii) of par (a). I find no special facts or circumstances for the purposes of par (b) of subs (3).
	
	
	Mr Holland has presented the Court with voluminous written submissions, bearing the following dates:
	



	
	19 July 2016: 93 pages of submissions and 44 pages of annexed documents.
	
	
	22 September 2016: “Addendum” to submissions, comprising 132 pages.
	
	
	19 October 2016: “Further Addendum” of 22 pages.
	
	
	23 October 2016: 17 pages of submissions regarding a video demonstration of the act of digital penetration the subject of count 1, accompanied by a video.
	
	
	20 December 2016: response to Crown submissions comprising 103 pages.
	
	
	5 February 2017: further response to Crown submissions comprising 40 pages.
	



	
	That is, a total of 407 pages, to which I will refer as “Submission (1)”, “Submission (2)” etc. These have been prepared by Mr Holland himself and are repetitive, discursive and unfocused. After a trial in the District Court, an appeal and a previous review of the conviction by a judge of this Court, if there were anything new to be argued in relation to Mr Holland’s convictions it could not possibly require 407 pages of submissions to express it. All of the points which can be extracted from the vast bulk of Mr Holland’s submissions on this application were previously dealt with in his original trial or in his appeal or in the application dealt with by Johnson J – or on more than one of those occasions. The repetition and wordiness of the present submissions is of such an order that their substantive content could have been set out on no more than five pages. I have read all of what Mr Holland has written in support of his present application and I have identified, below, the points he has made.
	
	
	Mr Holland’s Submission (1) commences with a statement that he wishes to “again rely on the extensive submission of 2008”. That is a reference to more than 870 pages of material which he provided to Johnson J. I have not separately reviewed the material submitted to Johnson J and I do not consider it necessary to do so. Self-evidently, if it was before his Honour then it “has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions”, within the meaning of s 79(3)(a)(ii).
	
	
	In these circumstances, by virtue of subs (3)(b) of s 79, there is reposed in the Court a discretion to “refuse to consider or otherwise deal with” Mr Holland’s application if I am “not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action”. I am not so satisfied and I refuse to consider or deal with the application, for the reasons given hereafter.
	
	
	The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) contains no explicit guidance as to what might constitute special facts or special circumstances for the purposes of subs (3)(b). As a starting point for applying that test to this application I regard it as necessary to set out a summary of the evidence in the proceedings which led to the convictions in respect of which the application is made. That summary will expose the relative simplicity of the case and identify the issues which arose.
	


Summary of evidence and issues at trial in the District Court


	
	I draw the following narrative of the case at trial from [3] – [19] of the judgment of Simpson J (as her Honour then was) in the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision, cited at [2]. In July 2001 Mr Holland was a member of the New South Wales Police Service, engaged as a tutor at the Goulburn Police Academy. He was 35 years old. The complainant was then 21 years of age and was a student at the Academy. One of her classes was taught by Mr Holland. Prior to 19 July 2001 she had no social relationship with him.
	
	
	According to the complainant’s evidence on the evening of that day she had dinner with friends at a licensed establishment called Tully Park Tavern in Goulburn and then returned to the Academy. She went to the Academy liquor bar. There she encountered the appellant. They greeted each other in a friendly and physical manner. The appellant showed signs of intoxication. After a few minutes, at the complainant’s invitation the appellant joined her group and they conversed. The complainant purchased a drink for herself and one for the appellant.
	
	
	Mr Holland left the Academy liquor bar and went to Tully Park Tavern. Just before leaving he pulled forward the clothing the complainant was wearing on the upper part of her body, indicated her breasts and made a sexually suggestive remark. After having another drink at the Academy liquor bar the complainant also returned to Tully Park Tavern in the company of others. She encountered Mr Holland and they bought drinks for each other and conversed for about 20 or 25 minutes.
	
	
	Mr Holland behaved in a manner which was increasingly sexually suggestive and, as time progressed, explicit. He placed his hands on the complainant’s back and hips. He told her he wanted to go outside. She asked why and he said he wanted to talk. He took the complainant by the hand and led her out.
	
	
	Outside the Tavern Mr Holland led the complainant to a gate, pressed her against it and made further sexually suggestive references to her breasts. He pulled down her upper clothing, continuing to make reference to her breasts. He kissed her breasts. The complainant was protesting. The act of kissing her breasts was the act that gave rise to count 4 on the indictment (assault with act of indecency). On this count the appellant was acquitted. From a question asked by the jury during their deliberations it may be inferred they felt a reasonable doubt whether this conduct was non-consensual.
	
	
	The complainant said she wished to return inside but Mr Holland held her by the wrist and walked down a hill. The complainant protested. He continued to hold the complainant tightly by the wrist preventing her pulling away. Mr Holland again removed, or tried to remove, the top part of the complainant’s clothing. The complainant continued to protest. He put his hand down the front of the complainant’s pants and inserted his fingers in her vagina. This caused the complainant pain. The penetration of his fingers gave rise to count 1 on the indictment (of which the appellant was convicted). An abrasion to the labia was sustained, as identified by medical examination four days later. This was relied upon by the Crown as malicious infliction of actual bodily harm, constituting the aggravating circumstance of the offence for the purposes of subs (2)(a) of s 61J of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	At the same time Mr Holland attempted with his other hand to remove the complainant’s clothing. He told her she “wanted it because she was wet”. He pulled his trousers down and then hers and attempted to penetrate her from behind. Then, after turning her around he attempted to penetrate her from the front. This gave rise to count 2 (attempted sexual intercourse), on which, again, Mr Holland was convicted.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that Mr Holland tried to put his penis in her mouth and placed her hand on his penis. Counts 3 and 5 were based upon these particulars but the jury did not find them proved. The complainant walked away, to the car park at Tully Park Tavern. The appellant accompanied her. At the car park the complainant joined four of her friends who were already in a car, about to drive to a nightclub called Flamingos.
	
	
	On arrival at Flamingos the complainant found a close friend, Cameron Bellis. Mr Bellis observed that she was crying and “very upset”. The principal evidence of complaint was given by Mr Bellis. When he asked the cause of her distress the complainant gave a brief account which was consistent with the evidence she gave before the jury. This included specific reference to the allegation that the appellant had inserted his fingers in her vagina (count 1).
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that at Flamingos she was experiencing pain in her vagina and went to the toilet to examine herself. She found that her labia were swollen and discoloured. Ms Jennifer Robertson, a friend of the complainant, saw her in the toilet and observed she was crying. She did not tell Ms Robertson the cause of her distress.
	
	
	Ms Donna Green observed the complainant at Flamingos and saw that she had been crying. Her hair was dishevelled and she “looked shaken”. Ms Green also described the complainant’s manner of dancing as “odd” and “sort of sluttish” and said that the complainant was upset because she had lost her jacket. Matthew Ellis was the person who drove the car, with the complainant as a passenger, from Tully Park Tavern to Flamingos. He described the complainant as “very quiet” and said that on arrival at Flamingos she went straight to the bathroom and that when she emerged she “was quite distressed and it looked like she had been crying”.
	
	
	Two days later, on Sunday 22 July 2001, the complainant told another friend (Jason Banks, a senior constable at the Academy) about the incident. He observed that she appeared to be having difficulty walking and was wincing which caused him to assume that she was in pain. Again, she gave a brief account to him which was consistent with the evidence she gave in the trial. Senior Constable Banks passed on the information to Ms Julie-Anne Swords, a clerical officer at the Academy, who in turn spoke to the complainant during that Sunday evening. What the complainant said to Ms Swords was consistent with the account she gave in evidence. Subsequently she spoke to Inspector Lesley Dickens. She then made an official report.
	
	
	There was medical evidence from Dr Christopher Harmon who examined the complainant on 23 July 2001. He recounted the history he took from the complainant, which included her description of the appellant forcing his hand down the front of her pants and inserting his finger into her vagina. Dr Harmon’s examination revealed the complainant’s mons pubis and labia to be contused, swollen and tender, too tender to permit the use of a speculum for further examination. He also noted the presence of a small abrasion internally on the right labia. He said that in his opinion the complainant’s injuries were consistent with the description of how they were occasioned, given in her history.
	
	
	In July and August 2001 the officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Stuart Gray, obtained successive warrants under the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW) with a view to the complainant engaging Mr Holland in conversation during which he might make admissions or incriminating remarks about the events of the evening of 19 July. On 6 September there were three telephone conversations between the complainant and Mr Holland. Tape recordings and agreed transcripts of the first two conversations were before the jury. The third conversation was not recorded but the complainant made an immediate note of its content and this was read to the jury.
	
	
	The content of the three conversations, as tendered in the trial, was substantially reproduced in the judgment of Simpson J in the Court of Criminal Appeal at [14] – [17]. For present purposes it is sufficient to summarise the general effect and nature of the conversations, respectively, as follows.
	
	
	The complainant commenced her first call, at 12:35 pm on 6 September 2001, by asking Mr Holland “What was that all about?”, not specifying what she was referring to. He responded by saying he had been “pissed” and angry, although not at her, and that it would “never happen again”. He did not specify what had occurred. Nor did he initially inquire what the complainant was referring to when she said his conduct had scared her and asked why he had taken out on her his feelings of being “pissed off with the world, pissed off with my life”.
	
	
	The first phone conversation then developed into the complainant inquiring how much Mr Holland remembered, including these passages:
	


“Complainant:   … I kept telling you ‘No’, and, and that I wanted to go back…

Mr Holland:   Yeah. I know.

…

Complainant:   Do you remember what you did?

Mr Holland:   Ah, n … well that’s the ‘hazy part’, hhhuh, as I say, but I don’t wanna, know. I don’t wanna know.

Complainant:   Do you remember me telling you “No”?

Mr Holland:   Ah, n … I don’t remember much about anything. I remember walking outside and tripping over and I remember being on the grass and trying to get over a fence.

…

Mr Holland:   And, and so, mate, I just apologise if I, um, if I hurt you or upset you or offended you.

Complainant:   Mm, hm.

Mr Holland:   ‘Cos I certainly didn’t mean to.

…

Mr Holland:   I didn’t do anything wrong, did I?

Complainant:   Well, I kept telling you ‘no’ and you wouldn’t stop, and things like that, so …

Mr Holland:   Oh, shit!!

Complainant:   And I just telling you I wanted to go back and you just kept me dragging, kept dragging me down …

Mr Holland:   Oh, you’re kiddin’ ‘Krusty’!!

Complainant:   That’s wh …that’s why you really scared me.

Mr Holland:   Oh, fuck, honey!! Oh, fuck!!

…

Complainant:   Well, you, you don’t remember anythink do you?

Mr Holland:   Well, no. Did I hurt you?

Complainant:   You kept tryin’ to grab me between the le … crutch.

Mr Holland:   Ooh, shhh … you’re kidding!!?

Complainant:   And I was, yeah, it was, hurts there. Hu … it hurt there.

Mr Holland:   Oh, fuckin’ hell!! Are your (sic) kidding?

Complainant:   No. I’m not. You really did hurt me. That’s why I wanted to know what, what was it all about.

Mr Holland:   Oh, fuck!! I feel like I’m gonna be sick. Oh, fuck!! ‘Krusty’, are you, are you, are you serious?

Complainant:   Yeh, I’m serious. You really hurt me hhhh. …

…

Mr Holland:   Mate, you’ve got no idea! I mean, I mean, ooohh, fuckin’ hell, mate, I yeah … am I in trouble?

Complainant:   What do you mean?

Mr Holland:   Am, am I, have I done something like, against the law,

trouble?

Complainant:   Ahhh, you could probably say that, yes.

Mr Holland:   Oh, ‘Krusty’! Am I gon … am I gonna get locked up?

Complainant:   Who said that?

Mr Holland:   No, are y… are you gonna get me locked up?

Complainant:   Why? I haven’t said anything to anyone.”


	
	The conversation continued with the appellant expressing his apologies and promising to do whatever he could to make amends. The call was of 28 minutes duration and concluded at 1.03 p.m.
	
	
	Five minutes later, at 1.08 p.m., Mr Holland called the complainant back. He again expressed himself to be “absolutely shocked” and “truly, truly sorry”. Well into the conversation the following is recorded:
	


“Mr Holland:   Just tell me what happened.

Complainant:   You don’t, honestly don’t remember anythink?

Mr Holland:   Well, if you tell me, I might be able to …

…

Mr Holland:   [At Tully Park Tavern] I was talkin’ to ‘Chook’ and Brian Albrecht.

Mr Holland:   Yep, and you walked up and you gave me a ‘shot’.

Complainant:   Yep.

Mr Holland:   And then we’ve walked through the glass doors near the disco. No, near the bistro, sorry.

…

Mr Holland:   That’s the exit. We’ve walked out of the glass doors near the bistro. We’ve turned right, gone down the grass and that’s when I’ve tripped over in the grass.

…

Mr Holland:   And then we’ve moved over to a fence …

…

Mr Holland:   Near a house …

Complainant:   … I was tryin’ to tell you I wanted to go back inside and I didn’t want to just be out there and my friends come lookin’ for me. Do you remember that?

Mr Holland:   I remember you sayin’ that after, when, um, you were going.

Complainant:   No.

Mr Holland:   Yeah. No, no. I remember that, because you went back towards that way, towards TULLY’S, and I went back up towards Tom’s place.

Complainant:   No, ’cause you pulled me outside and I did … didn’t want to go out and then, so I s … said ‘no’, ’cause I will stay inside, and then, well, you, we went out, well you pulled me outside, you …”


	
	Mr Holland disputed with the complainant that he had pulled or dragged her out of Tully Park Tavern or to a gate. He asserted that if this had occurred it would have been observed by others because “the gate is only ten feet away from the bloody main door”. The complainant said that it did occur and that her friends came looking for her, which Mr Holland disputed. He said that when the complainant had walked away from him back to the Tavern he had followed her “to see if you got back there alright”. He claimed to remember having looked around for friends at the Tavern and said that when he could not find them he walked home.
	
	
	The second conversation included this further passage:
	


“Mr Holland:   … I remember walking down towards this house and we moved over towards the fence behind the tree. Is that right?

…

Complainant:   Yeah … And I kept telling you that I wanted to go back.

Mr Holland:   Yep, and that’s when we walked over to the fence and I tripped over the fence too. Remember that? And I said to you I was so friggin’ ‘pissed’ and been such an idiot. Yep? How’m I doin’ so far?

Complainant:   No. I kept tellin’ you that I wanted to go back and you said ‘No, no, no. Stay here. Stay here’.

Mr Holland:   Yeh, but I … yeh, and then when you said ‘That’s it. We’re going,’ what happened.

Complainant:   Yeh, it too … it took a while.

Mr Holland:   It didn’t take a while, ‘Krusty’, come on!! How long were we gone for, ‘Krusty’?

Complainant:   Ages.

Mr Holland:   Bulshit!! Ten minutes.

Complainant:   I don’t know how long we were gone for.

Mr Holland:   Ten bloody minutes, ‘Krusty’!! … because Tom WAIBEL said he saw me and he said they s … they saw that I’d gone and that’s when they got in the car and started lookin’ for me. He said I was gone for ten minutes. Ten bloody minutes, ‘Krusty’!!

…

Mr Holland:   … obviously I wasn’t that drunk, if I can remember this! I thought you were sayin’ that I did somethin’ else!! Now, I, no, I remember things that happened, but I tell you what, I’m not rememberin’ the things you’re sayin’ that I did!! As I said to you, I’m, I am, I’m truly sorry, if you’re, if, if …”


	
	The final telephone call took place at about 2.00 p.m. the same day. This, again, was initiated by Mr Holland. The complainant’s note, made immediately afterwards, recorded that the following conversation took place:
	


“Mr Holland:   I remember everything that happened, can you talk?

Complainant:   No.

Mr Holland:   Listen and tell me if this is what happened.

Complainant:   Yep.

Mr Holland:   You walked out with me, we went for a walk, I fell over, you tried to take my pants down.

Complainant:   I’m listening, I can’t talk.

Mr Holland:   You said to me that you wouldn’t be able to get it up because you’re too drunk. We ended up going because I couldn’t do it to my girlfriend. We were only gone for about five minutes and then we walked back inside. I remember back we walked back inside because Michelle’s car was still there. That’s right, isn’t it?

Complainant:   Whatever.

Mr Holland:   Can we arrange to go out, what’s your roster?

Complainant:   Yep, sometime. Good bye.

Mr Holland:   Good bye.”


	
	On 21 September Mr Holland was arrested and charged. On the same day he participated in an electronically recorded interview. He denied the allegation that while at the Academy Bar, he pulled forward the complainant’s upper clothing. He acknowledged there had been some conversation about the complainant’s breasts, but said he had taken her to be flirting. He acknowledged sexual activity between himself and the complainant but claimed that it was consensual and that the complainant was a willing and active participant. Specifically, he acknowledged putting his hand down the front of the complainant’s pants and inserting one finger into her vagina, but denied thrusting two or three fingers in and out as she alleged. He said the complainant took hold of his hand and sucked his finger. He denied that the complainant protested or said she wanted to return to the Tavern. He claimed that she undid his trousers and performed fellatio upon him. These answers were starkly inconsistent with his professed absence of recollection during the telephone conversations with the complainant and with his expressions of remorse during those conversations.
	
	
	At trial Mr Holland gave evidence in which he denied having forced the complainant from Tully’s Tavern, denied having pulled down her clothing to expose her breasts and denied attempting to kiss her breasts. He said the sexual activity between them had been consensual. He adopted and relied upon the answers he had given when interviewed. He was asked to explain the content of the telephone conversations. Contrary to what he had there repeatedly said, he denied that he had been intoxicated, although he had earlier stated (as he had also said in his interview) that he was “moderately affected” on the night. He explained his responses in the phone conversations by saying that he accepted what had been put to him by the complainant. He said he was ashamed of what had happened. He also claimed to have realised that sexual intercourse was not going to eventuate and that he told the complainant to “just fuck off back to Tully Park”. He said he was ashamed of having said this also.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Holland agreed he had put his hand down the complainant’s pants and admitted that he had inserted a finger in her vagina. He claimed that it was the complainant who attempted to initiate oral sex and that he had rebuffed her. This evidence was also inconsistent with his responses to the complainant in the telephone calls.
	
	
	From the above summary it is apparent the issues at trial were (a) the detail of the sexual contact by Mr Holland with the complainant and (b) whether the complainant had consented to that sexual contact. Differences between the complainant and Mr Holland concerning the manner in which he had digitally penetrated her and the degree of force used had a bearing upon whether the jury would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt she had not consented. The Crown case as to the roughness of the digital penetration and hence as to the absence of consent was supported by the evidence of the complainant and other witnesses as to her physical discomfort when she returned to the company of other friends at Flamingos. It was also supported by Dr Harmon’s findings summarised at [25].
	


Ground 1 of the present application – post trial medical evidence


	
	No doubt because the central issue at trial was consent and because the jury’s finding on that issue would likely have been affected by evidence of the complainant’s discomfort at Flamingos on the night in question and of Dr Harmon’s findings four days later, Mr Holland’s submissions in support of the present application are concentrated on an attempt to cast doubt upon the evidence led by the Crown on those matters.
	
	
	The first ground of the present application is that medical opinion evidence of Drs Newell-Parker, Odell and Reid was not presented at the trial to contradict Dr Harmon and that opinions which those doctors have expressed were not put to him in cross-examination by way of challenge to the evidence the Crown led from him. Neither this nor any other ground is formulated in concise terms or attributed a number. I have done my best to discern the grounds from the submissions and I have attributed my own numbers to them.
	
	
	Dr Newell-Parker had provided an opinion to Mr Holland before his trial to the effect that:
	



	
	she doubted the complainant could have examined herself in the toilet at Flamingos to identify injury from the digital penetration, on the night it occurred, as she described;
	
	
	there appeared an inconsistency between the sexual assault described in relation to count 1 and the injury sustained and
	
	
	Mr Holland had a visible genital abnormality which it would be difficult for the complainant not to have noticed, yet she had not mentioned it in her evidence.
	


Mr Holland asserts that his counsel’s failure to produce this evidence or to cross-examine upon the basis of it gives rise to a doubt or question about his conviction.


	
	Dr Odell’s report was obtained by Mr Holland in about 2006. It expresses the opinion that Dr Harmon’s description of the examination he carried out and of his findings is insufficiently detailed and precise for the evidence to have served as any confirmation that sexual activity on the night in question was rough or to provide corroboration of the complainant’s evidence that she did not consent. He reported that if the abrasion observed by Dr Harmon had been caused four days earlier then in view of the expected rate of healing it must have been severe enough to have bled on the night. He noted an absence of evidence of bleeding. Dr Reid’s report is referred to in Mr Holland’s Submission (1) as supporting the conclusions of Dr Odell.
	
	
	The above points arising from medical expert evidence which was not produced or used at trial are expanded at a great length and repetitively in Submissions (1), (2), (5) and (6). All of this medical evidence was before Johnson J and he considered what is now the first ground in Mr Holland’s present application at [51] – [69] and [91] – [95]. This entire subject has been “previously dealt with under this Part”: see [3], s 79(3)(a)(ii).
	
	
	In particular, Dr Newell-Parker’s evidence concerning Mr Holland’s genital abnormality is the subject of detailed submissions on the present application. Dr Newell-Parker has been Mr Holland’s general practitioner since about 2000. She describes the abnormality as “multiple large infected sebaceous cysts on his scrotum and the shaft of his penis” which, according to the history she took, have afflicted him “over many years”. Her statement dated 26 May 2006 accompanying Submission (1) states that these have caused “visible changes and scarring” and that they are “present, visible and easily identified”. In Dr Newell-Parker’s opinion “it would be difficult not to notice these anatomical changes if [the complainant] was assaulted in the manner described”. The last part of this quotation is, I infer, a reference to the complainant’s evidence that Mr Holland lowered his trousers and attempted, amongst other things, frontal sexual intercourse and oral intercourse.
	
	
	Mr Holland has included at page 66 of Submission (5) a photograph of his scrotum apparently showing that there are attached to it at least twelve large cysts as described by Dr Newell-Parker. He contends that if sexual contact with the complainant had occurred as she described she would have observed this disfigurement yet she gave no evidence of it. Mr Holland argues that, therefore, the sexual contact cannot have occurred as she claims but, rather, must have occurred in accordance with his own description. Namely by the complainant unfastening his trousers and fellating him.
	
	
	This argument was considered by Johnson J at [70] – [73]. His Honour found that no question or doubt about the conviction or about the complainant’s evidence was thereby raised. Johnson J did not accept that the complainant was bound to have observed the abnormality if the sexual violence was perpetrated as she described. Further, the complainant would have had much the same opportunity to observe the genital abnormality whether the sexual contact with her had been in accordance with her description or Mr Holland’s. Dr Newell-Parker describes the disfigurement as extending to the shaft of his penis. If evidence had been led concerning the cysts on Mr Holland’s genitals, as he now says should have occurred, the complainant’s failure to observe them would have been understandable to the jury, consistently with either version of what took place. On any view the opportunity for observation was limited, bearing in mind that this sexual contact took place in darkness, down a grassy slope outside the Tully Park Tavern and in a furtive manner.
	
	
	Had the jury known of the peculiarity of Mr Holland’s genitals they may have concluded that the complainant’s failure to make any observation of it was not attributable to the sexual contact having taken the physical form described by Mr Holland rather than as described by the complainant. They may have thought she missed this detail because she was, as she said, not consenting to what was taking place but was resisting Mr Holland’s rough and painful sexual attack upon her. The jury may well have inferred she was too distressed by the situation to be looking at his genitals in the dark with sufficient particularity to note their medical or anatomical condition.
	


Ground 2 – the complainant’s physical discomfort on the night


	
	The second ground in the current application is that evidence of the complainant’s actions after the assault she described – walking back to Tully Park Tavern and, especially, going to another venue and dancing in a manner which Mr Holland submits did not indicate pain or injury – were inconsistent with her claim that the digital penetration in count 1 had occurred in the rough manner she described. This ground is developed in Submissions (1), (2), (5) and (6). It was agitated on the application considered by Johnson J and his Honour dealt with it at [82], [84] – [86], [88] and [89].
	
	
	Ground 2 relies in part upon evidence provided in 2007 by Constable Bellis. He was a witness in the Crown case. He gave evidence in the trial that the complainant met with him at Flamingos on the evening in question and complained then that she had been sexually assaulted by Mr Holland and that she was in pain. In a post-trial statement provided to Mr Holland Constable Bellis described the complainant dancing with other police officers at Flamingos for some time after she made this complaint. Mr Holland now characterises the description given by Constable Bellis and other witnesses of the complainant’s dancing as “extreme physical activity” which he submits is inconsistent with her having been sexually assaulted by vigorous digital penetration in the manner she alleged. Constable Bellis’ statement was before Johnson J and was taken into account in his Honour’s decision to refuse the previous application under ss 78 and 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	Mr Holland’s submissions now under consideration include a contention that the complainant’s dancing at the Flamingos after his sexual activity with her was in a suggestive and sexually provocative style. This claim is repeated countless times throughout his written submissions, in a manner which I find gratuitous. The characterisation of her dancing as “overtly sexual” has nothing to do with the issues on this application. One of the witnesses at trial described her manner of dancing as “sluttish”, whatever that may have been intended to convey. Mr Holland’s current submissions quote that evidence again and again. The only point now relevant is whether the complainant’s post-assault activity was inconsistent with the bruising and tenderness she claimed to have suffered.
	
	
	I infer that Mr Holland has dwelt upon this description of her dancing in order to try to put the complainant in a poor moral light. Apparently to the same end he has made frequent reference to the fact that she was not wearing underpants on the evening in question. This fact is referred to in the submissions so frequently but to so little purpose that it has assumed the appearance of a prurient pre-occupation. I draw no conclusions about the complainant’s character or veracity from these matters, to which Mr Holland has devoted such considerable attention. I do not find this aspect of his submissions relevant let alone persuasive as to whether there exists any doubt or question about his convictions or about any of the evidence given against him.
	


Ground 3 – report of Brent Turvey


	
	The third ground of the application now under consideration is that a report from Mr Brent Turvey, prepared in March 2006, raises a doubt or question about the convictions. Mr Turvey is an expert in forensic evidence gathering procedures. His report is critical of the collection of evidence by police in this case, including failures to collect certain evidence which he considers would have been material. Mr Turvey has asserted that there are indicia in the case of a false sexual assault allegation. The significance of this post trial evidence is the subject of Submissions (1) and (5). The report of Mr Turvey and Mr Holland’s arguments upon it were before Johnson J and his Honour dealt with this basis of challenge to the convictions at [35] – [40].
	


Ground 4 – inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant’s evidence


	
	The fourth ground of the present application is that there were inherent inconsistencies in the complainant’s account of the assault upon her, as given at trial, as well as contradictions between that account and complaints she made in the days immediately after the night in question, which should have led to the jury feeling a reasonable doubt about counts 1 and 2. These points are developed in Submissions (1), (2) and (5). Submission (1) makes reference to time recordings of Mr Holland walking to and from the place where his admitted sexual activity with the complainant took place, purporting to prove that he and the complainant were absent from Tully Park Tavern together for a shorter period than the 10 minutes which she estimated in her evidence. This is relied upon as tending to indicate that she was with him by consent.
	
	
	In Submission (2) Mr Holland develops arguments about the improbability of the complainant not having screamed for help at the time she was being subjected to sexual contact by him, if she was not consenting. This is part of the general attack on the complainant’s credibility on the subject of consent. That was fully agitated before the jury and they must have accepted the complainant’s evidence, adversely to Mr Holland.
	
	
	Even if this was a new point which had not previously been considered at the trial or by Johnson J it would not raise in my mind any doubt or question about the conviction. It is quite explicable that the complainant, isolated with Mr Holland in darkness outside Tully Park Tavern and trying to resist his sexual contact, should try to get away from him before raising alarm in any manner. The complainant was at a distinct physical disadvantage to Mr Holland. He was larger and more powerfully built and had been her martial arts instructor at the Police College. The fact that the complainant did not cry out to help in these circumstances is not to my mind a significant point affecting her credibility with respect to the question of whether she consented to Mr Holland forcefully digitally penetrating her and attempting intercourse.
	
	
	Mr Holland has supported his arguments by preparing three videos in which he demonstrates with the aid of a live female model why he claims it would have been impossible for the digital penetration in count 1 and the attempted intercourse in count 2 to have taken place as described by the complainant. Submission (4) contains further detailed argument upon what is to be seen in the videos.
	
	
	The entire field of contradictions and improbabilities in the complainant’s description of the sexual contact was explored at the trial. Cross-examination of the complainant did not follow in every detail the lines which Mr Holland now suggests. But in the 407 pages of his current submissions there are quoted or paraphrased or referred to sufficient passages of the cross-examination to show that the complainant was thoroughly challenged at trial regarding the details of the sexual activity. Although the videos were apparently not then in existence and were therefore not tendered or used in cross-examination, they are no more than a refinement and development of the general subject of whether the complainant’s account of the extent and nature of Mr Holland’s sexual contact with herself was credible. Within the meaning of s 79(3)(a), the matter of credibility of her account was “fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction”.
	
	
	For the reasons given in the preceding paragraph Mr Holland’s submissions based upon the three videos are to be disposed of in the same way as all his other submissions. That is, as they have been previously “dealt with” I may refuse to consider them unless “satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action”. Even if the videos and the arguments on them were not to be disposed of on this basis and if they required consideration as to whether they give rise to a doubt or question about the conviction or about any of the evidence, my view would be that they do not.
	
	
	Having watched the videos closely and listened to the speaker’s commentary on them and having read Submission (4) I do not find in this material any reason why the jury ought to have had a doubt about Mr Holland’s guilt. I take into account that he admitted having digitally penetrated the complainant and that he claimed he had had oral intercourse with her. Even if there had been shown to the jury some aspect of how the complainant recalled and described these events which, physically, could not have been correct, that would have been of negligible significance to the principal issue at trial, namely consent. It would have been of negligible relevance to the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s overall credibility.
	
	
	Mr Holland’s argument ignores an available and likely path of reasoning of the jury. If the complainant appeared otherwise credible in her assertion that she did not consent to his sexual acts, lack of precision about exactly what the acts were would be hardly surprising. On her account it was a stressful and frightening situation, being aggressively sexually assaulted by an older, stronger male whilst isolated outdoors away from anyone who could aid her or bring him to his senses. These were not ideal circumstances in which to have formed accurate and lasting recollections of the physical details of the assault.
	


Ground 5 – use of the listening device material


	
	The fifth ground of this application, developed in Submissions (3) and (5), is that Mr Holland was at a disadvantage at trial in attempting to explain the manner in which he responded to the complainant’s conversations with him in the intercepted phone calls of September 2001. The disadvantage is said to have been that his explanation would lie in the fact that he had previously been the subject of false allegations of sexual misconduct made by another young female police cadet. He was not able to explain his phone responses without disclosing the previous complaint and thereby causing prejudice to himself.
	
	
	His argument, as best I can understand it, appears to be that for this reason the intercepted telephone conversations should not have been tendered. If that is a correct understanding then I would refuse to consider or deal with the application so far as it is based upon this ground because Mr Holland raised the admissibility of the phone conversations in his previous application and it was dealt with by Johnson J at [41] – [45].
	
	
	Mr Holland may intend to be arguing a different point. Namely, that overall the trial was unfair and that a miscarriage of justice occurred because he was inhibited from producing evidence of the previous complaint against himself, which might have explained, consistently with innocence, the terms in which he spoke to the complainant on the phone. I would not regard this contention as giving rise to any question or doubt about the convictions or any aspect of the evidence. Mr Holland’s responses to the complainant over the telephone were extremely damaging to him. Far from asserting at the outset that she had consented to the insertion of his finger or fingers in her vagina or that she had initiated oral intercourse with him, initially he agreed that she had “kept telling [him] ‘no’”, he denied any recall of what had occurred, he said he did not want to know what he had done and he apologised with expressions of shock and disbelief as she described the events she recalled.
	
	
	If Mr Holland had introduced at trial evidence that when these phone calls took place he was “scared of [the complainant] contacting me” (Submission (3), p 14) because previously a false allegation of sexual misconduct had been made by another female police cadet, that would have been ineffectual to “explain” the terms in which he spoke with the complainant. I am unable to identify any path of reasoning by which this prior complaint of sexual misconduct could have been used by the jury, had they been made aware of it, to place upon the recorded phone conversations an interpretation less contradictory of Mr Holland’s affirmative case or in any other way less damaging to his defence.
	
	
	Mr Holland’s submissions have not assisted me to understand how it could possibly have diminished the impact of his phone conversations with the complainant for him to have introduced evidence of the prior complaint against himself. Even if his defence could have been enhanced, in some way that I cannot discern, the fact that his counsel would have to have made a forensic tactical decision whether or not to introduce the prejudicial evidence of the earlier complaint would not have been a basis for exclusion of the phone conversations. Nor would it be a basis for finding that the trial involved a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In Submission (3) Mr Holland also asserts that when the complainant took part in the recorded telephone conversations she acted as an “agent of the State”. He complains that at the commencement of these conversations he was not given a caution to the effect that he might remain silent. From this it appears that he intends to invoke s 138(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), pursuant to which evidence obtained “improperly or in contravention of an Australian law” is not to be admitted “unless the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained”. Mr Holland apparently means to assert that evidence of the things he said on the telephone was obtained improperly in the sense provided for in s 139(2). That is, that his answers were given “during questioning” which was “conducted by an investigating official”, after the official had formed the belief that there was sufficient evidence to establish his guilt and without giving a caution.
	
	
	If it was necessary for me to consider these submissions in detail I would have to take into account the definition of “investigating official” in the dictionary to the Evidence Act. The defined meaning of that expression includes “a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior)”. It is not necessary for me to decide this but I do not consider that the complainant’s participation in the conversations was in her capacity as a police officer. Her participation was in her capacity as the victim of an alleged sexual assault which had occurred before she became a police officer.
	
	
	If, contrary to that view, she took part in the telephone conversations as a police officer then she did so in a covert role. It was covert in the sense that the complainant did not reveal to Mr Holland that the conversations were part of an investigation. If she is to be viewed as having acted as a police officer then in my opinion she must also be viewed as having acted under the orders of a superior, namely the officer who was in charge of the investigation.
	
	
	Further, in order to address Mr Holland’s submissions in this respect substantively I would have to determine whether the recorded telephone conversations constituted “questioning” within the meaning of that word as it is used in s 139(2). If it were necessary to decide that, my answer would be in the negative. What took place over the telephone, in each of the three calls, was a conversation in which questions were asked. I do not consider that that constitutes “questioning” as the term is used in ss 138(2) and 139(2); see R v Naa (2006) 76 NSWLR 271; [2006] NSWSC 851 at [98] – [99].
	
	
	I interpret Mr Holland’s submissions as also intended to invoke s 90 of the Evidence Act. Pursuant to s 90, in a criminal proceeding the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission if the evidence is adduced by the prosecution and “having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence”. Where admissions have been obtained from a suspect by covert recording of a telephone conversation with a complainant, the factors which may bear upon the fairness or otherwise of the evidence being used against the suspect have been considered in Pavitt v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 88; 169 A Crim R 452; R v Ryan [2013] NSWCCA 316; R v XY (2013) 84 NSWLR 363; [2013] NSWCCA 121; R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335; 237 A Crim R 238. One such factor is whether the person who takes part in the conversation with the suspect may properly be characterised as an “agent of the state”.
	
	
	Here, if it were necessary for me to decide the matter, I would not characterise the complainant as having acted as an agent of the state in her phone conversations with Mr Holland on 6 September 2001. Although she was by that date a serving police officer the capacity in which she took part in the calls was no different from that of a complainant from any other walk of life cooperating in a police investigation of sexual assault allegations. Upon the information available from Mr Holland’s submissions and from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the other papers before me, I would not consider that any other aspect of the circumstances in which these telephone conversations occurred gave rise to unfairness in the prosecution’s use of them at the trial.
	
	
	The judgment of Johnson J at [42] records that Mr Holland had “raised questions about the … admissibility of the [phone conversations] in the trial” and had referred to The Queen v Swaffield; Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159; [1998] HCA 1. In that case the High Court considered the common law rule under which admissions by an accused person may be excluded on the ground of unfairness in the way they were obtained. Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ held at 194 that ss 90, 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act, in combination, reflect an approach under which, “[p]utting to one side the question of voluntariness”, the admissibility of an accused’s confessions or admissions turns upon
	


“exclusion based on considerations of reliability and finally on an overall discretion which might take account of all the circumstances of the case to determine whether the admission of the evidence or the obtaining of a conviction on the basis of the evidence is bought at a price which is unacceptable, having regard to contemporary community standards”.


	
	Specifically with respect to covertly recorded conversations, with which each of the appeals in The Queen v Swaffield was concerned, their Honours at [91] recognised an approach to whether admissions may have been obtained unfairly
	


“which looks to the accused’s freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned. Where the freedom has been impugned the court has a discretion to reject the evidence. In deciding whether to exercise that discretion, which is a discretion to exclude not to admit, the court will look at all the circumstances”.


	
	Having regard to the subject matter of The Queen v Swaffield and the holdings of the High Court in that case, Mr Holland’s reliance upon it in the application decided by Johnson J means that the arguments regarding admissibility of the telephone conversations which he now seeks to agitate under ss 90, 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act have been previously dealt with. Johnson J considered these admissibility arguments and found that, as a result of them, “no doubt or question arises in my mind concerning the Applicant’s guilt or concerning any part of the evidence in the case”. His Honour felt fortified in the view that the principles considered in The Queen v Swaffield did not assist Mr Holland “by the fact that the Applicant’s previous counsel at trial and on appeal have not seen fit to ventilate this issue”. In short, these admissibility arguments have been “previously dealt with under this Part” and, in the absence of “special facts or special circumstances that [would] justify the taking of further action”, I consider that I should refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the present application in this respect.
	


What will constitute “special facts or special circumstances”


	
	Apart from a small number of inconsequential points now raised by Mr Holland and to which I have adverted in these reasons, none of which either alone or in combination indicates to me that there is any doubt or question as to his guilt on the two counts which the jury found proved, everything else raised by Mr Holland was fully dealt with at the trial or has previously been dealt with under ss 78 and 79 by Johnson J. The fact that the present grounds were dealt with by Johnson J is emphasised by the form of expression of Mr Holland’s Submissions. The Submissions are almost entirely written in the language of a critique of Johnson J’s conclusions and reasoning. Mr Holland has misconceived the present application as a form of appeal from or review of Johnson J’s decision whereas in fact he either has to identify some new matter which was not put to Johnson J or identify special facts or circumstances under s 79(3) which would warrant reopening the matters previously considered by his Honour.
	
	
	It has been said that the emergence of new facts that have not been previously agitated may constitute “special facts or special circumstances” to justify the taking of further action under ss 78 and 79 notwithstanding that there has been a full hearing of the charge at first instance and/or an appeal which has been withdrawn: see Re Cheney (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 291 at [35]. Mr Holland has not identified any such new facts or circumstances, relative to the content of the application considered by Johnson J. If the submissions on the present application contained any new and compelling insight on the issues to which they are directed, despite those issues having been dealt with at trial or appeal or by Johnson J, that might constitute a special fact or circumstance warranting consideration of this application.
	
	
	However in the 407 pages of Mr Holland’s submissions I find no new insight. Rather, the submissions are repetitive of points made in earlier proceedings and internally repetitive, almost to the point of incoherence.
	
	
	It is possible that special facts or circumstances for the purposes of s 79(3) might be manifested if anything advanced by Mr Holland identified a striking improbability in that which was alleged against him and which was found proved by the jury. I see no such glaring improbability. What the complainant described is a very believable account of a sordid and aggressive sexual encounter which eventuated from Mr Holland having had significantly too much to drink.
	
	
	The complainant’s failure to fight him off as he led her out of the Tully Park Tavern to a secluded location is credibly consistent with her lack of consent. Account must be taken of the differences between them in gender, physical strength, maturity and position in the police service. The complainant may not have resisted to her full physical capacity, thinking until it was too late that she could persuade Mr Holland not to force himself upon her. Her failure to scream is also understandable and not inconsistent with her lack of consent to what was taking place: see [55].
	
	
	When the complainant danced at Flamingos after the assault it is not surprising that she should have tried to conceal the pain she felt from the injury to her vagina, at least while she was recovering from the shock of the attack and until she had collected her thoughts as to whom she would tell. The choice facing her, between making a complaint against her superior at a time when she was only three weeks from graduating from the Police College or keeping the incident to herself, was a stressful and difficult one, as she said in evidence.
	
	
	On all these points Mr Holland expresses himself throughout his submissions in extravagant terms, as if the case against him was self-evidently fanciful. In fact his points are not individually compelling and taken together they do not amount to demonstration of an inherently unbelievable case such as to warrant further inquiry into his convictions. Pursuant to s 79(3), I refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application.

		01 May 2017",2017-04-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
4640418,Kelly v R [2017] NSWCCA 82,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree for the reasons given by Price J, that Ground 1 of the applicant’s Grounds of Appeal has been made out but that there is no merit in Ground 2.
	
	
	As Price J points out, it is necessary in those circumstances for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law. In considering this matter, I have taken into account the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the applicant as outlined by Price J. Taking into account those matters, I have reached the conclusion that no lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	In the circumstances, I agree with the orders proposed by Price J.
	
	
	WALTON J: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: Steven John Kelly (“the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court on 28 July 2015 to one count of aggravated enter dwelling with intent pursuant to s 111(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one count of larceny pursuant to s 117 Crimes Act. The maximum penalties for those offences are 14 and 5 years respectively.
	
	
	The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 16 September 2015 to one count of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act and one count of attempted armed robbery contrary to ss 97(1) and 344A Crimes Act. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicant adhered to his pleas before the sentencing judge (“the judge”) on 11 February 2016 and asked that the Court take into account a charge of possession of a prohibited weapon without permit, pursuant to s 7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, on a Form 1 attached to the armed robbery offence. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	After hearing submissions the judge adjourned the proceedings to 7 March 2016. On that date, the applicant was sentenced.
	
	
	Before imposing an aggregate sentence, the judge announced the following indicative sentences as required by s 53A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999:
	



	
	aggravated enter dwelling with intent – 3 years imprisonment;
	
	
	larceny – 12 months imprisonment;
	
	
	armed robbery (including Form 1 offence) – 7 years 6 months imprisonment; and
	
	
	attempted armed robbery – 6 years imprisonment.
	



	
	The judge imposed an aggregate sentence comprising of a non-parole period of 7 years, 1 month and 15 days to date from 18 November 2014 and to expire on 1 January 2022, with a total term of 9 years and 6 months, to expire on 17 May 2024.
	
	
	There are two grounds of appeal:
	


“1. The sentencing judge erred in taking into account the applicant’s prior record when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.

2. The sentencing judge erred in her Honour’s application of the Henry principle to the armed robbery and attempted armed robbery offences.”

Facts


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered which the judge incorporated in her sentencing remarks. The agreed facts may be summarised as follows:
	


Aggravated enter dwelling with intent to commit larceny and larceny – contrary to ss 111(2), 117 Crimes Act 1999 (NSW)


	
	At about 1pm on 13 December 2013, the applicant entered a home in Albion Park where the 17 year old victim was home alone. On hearing noises the victim opened his bedroom door to see the applicant and told him to leave. The applicant ran towards him and lunged at him. The victim shut his bedroom door and tried to keep it closed but the applicant overpowered him. The applicant entered the bedroom and told the victim to get on the ground, threatening to stab him through the skull with a screwdriver.
	
	
	The applicant could not find money in the victim’s wallet but took the victim’s key-card and demanded the PIN, threatening to return to kill the victim if he was given the incorrect PIN.
	
	
	In response to the demands of the applicant, the victim told him that the only money in the house was located in the pantry. The victim removed a jar containing $100 from the pantry.
	
	
	The victim was crying and begging the applicant to leave.
	
	
	Before leaving the applicant pushed the victim onto the bed with his face down and tied his hands and legs with electrical cords. The applicant also tied a shirt around the victim’s face and knotted at the back of his head to prevent him from looking at the applicant. When the victim was sure that the applicant had left, he untied himself and phoned the police. He noted that $100 from the pantry, his wallet, a silver watch and iPhone S4 were taken by the applicant.
	


Armed robbery – contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act


	
	The victim was the owner of a butcher shop in Cabramatta. Each morning the victim would park in the same spot in the carpark near his shop, and would arrive carrying $4,000 to $5,000 to pay for daily deliveries. This money was kept in a small red bag which was in-turn placed inside a larger beige bag.
	
	
	At about 6.55am on 4 November 2014, the victim noticed the applicant standing at the foot of a nearby stairwell when he arrived at the carpark. The victim was carrying $10,000 in order to pay for two days of deliveries. He hesitated before getting out of the car. When he did so, he placed the bag containing the money over his shoulder and held onto it. He noticed the applicant looking at him and put the money back inside the car.
	
	
	As the victim closed the door, the applicant approached him and produced an object that resembled a handgun. It was about 25 centimetres long and black in colour. The applicant pointed the object at the victim’s face, opened the car door and removed the bag containing the money. At that point, the victim, thinking that the object being held by the applicant might be a toy, pushed it away from his face and tried to grab the bag back.
	
	
	During the struggle, the bag dropped to the floor and the applicant pushed the victim’s face, causing him to fall down. The victim screamed for help, but nobody came.
	
	
	The applicant picked up the bag containing the money, and ran out of the carpark. The victim gave chase but was unable to catch him.
	
	
	The applicant entered a waiting car which drove off.
	
	
	The bag contained $10,000 in cash, the victim’s wallet containing $600 in cash, his licence, Medicare card and other cards and papers.
	
	
	A carpark officer (“officer”) had heard the victim’s screams and saw the applicant running from the scene. The officer yelled at the applicant to stop. The applicant turned around momentarily and the officer saw him holding a small black object in the shape of a handgun in his right hand. He also had a small beige bag tucked under his right arm. The applicant flashed the object as a warning before running away.
	
	
	The victim returned to the carpark, and noticed the applicant’s baseball cap had fallen off whilst he was running away. The applicant had also dropped a set of chrome knuckledusters near the vehicle (Form 1 offence).
	
	
	The bag was handed in to police on 4 November 2014. The only items missing were the smaller bag containing the $10,000 in cash and the $600 in cash from the victim’s wallet. There was also a pair of red sunglasses in the bag that did not belong to the victim.
	


Attempted Armed Robbery – contrary to ss 97(1), 344A Crimes Act 1999 (NSW)


	
	The victims were the owners of a butcher’s shop located within the Moorebank shopping complex.
	
	
	On 15 November 2014, the applicant entered the butcher shop, while the co-offender (Jesse Kelly) waited outside. He asked about meat products and then left without purchasing anything, saying, “okay, I will come back”.
	
	
	The applicant returned to the butcher’s shop some two minutes later, while the co-offender waited near the door. The applicant asked for a sausage and as an employee went to get it, he jumped up on the counter and produced a 30 centimetre carving knife. He raised it above his shoulder and demanded money.
	
	
	The employees and customers were terrified, and the customers fled the store, some leaving their belongings behind. One of the owner’s grabbed a large butcher’s knife and began screaming “you go, you go” at the applicant. The applicant jumped down from the counter and both offenders left the store, returning to a waiting vehicle, which was driven away by a third person (Thomas Kelly).
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	The applicant was born on 14 October 1969 and was 46 years old when sentenced. He did not give evidence before the judge but the material tendered on his behalf included a report from Dr Gerald Chew, a psychiatrist and a Justice Alcohol and other Drug Report.
	
	
	The reports disclosed that the applicant had been sexually abused from the age of 8 years which continued into his early teen years. He had a 35 year history of poly-substance abuse which included alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines. He told Dr Chew that his main problem prior to his offending was his use of ice. He attributed as one of the main reasons for his drug use, the difficulty he had managing his emotions arising from the childhood sexual abuse.
	
	
	Dr Chew reported that the applicant told him that because of his mother’s lifestyle, he was exposed to strange men who abused him from the age of 8. This continued and he was subject to sexual abuse on a number of other occasions including at a boy’s home in his early teen years. He was in boy’s homes from the age of 13–14 and had left school around the age of 16.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Chew that most of his life had been characterised by repeated incarceration, that he was in gaol every year, mainly short sentences for relatively minor offences and the longest period he ever had out of gaol was 16 months at the age of 40. He has five children aged 17, 16, 14, 12 and 9.
	
	
	The applicant related to the psychiatrist that he had attended Odyssey House on two occasions and had participated in the Drug Court Programme in 2004–2005 but dropped out as he breached the programme’s terms by being dishonest about his drug use. He was interested in attending a long term rehabilitation programme and there was a letter before the judge from We Help Ourselves (“WHOs”), an alcohol and other drug programme, stating that WHOs was prepared to admit him into the programme.
	
	
	In a letter to the judge, the applicant referred to being repeatedly raped between the ages of 8 and 15 and to his use of drugs to overcome the problems arising from the sexual abuse. He wrote that there had been only two years in his life when he remained abstinent from drugs. He recognised that he needed help, which he asked the judge to give him.
	
	
	The applicant has an unattractive prior criminal history in New South Wales. He has convictions for offences of dishonesty which include accessory after the fact to armed robbery, break, enter and steal, receiving, larceny and goods in custody. Convictions for offences of violence include assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assaulting a police officer in execution of his duty and common assault. There are also convictions for serious traffic offences. His record reveals breaches of good behaviour bonds, non-compliance with a suspended sentence and community service orders and a contravention of a prohibition in an apprehended domestic violence order. The applicant has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicant’s prior record in Queensland reveals convictions for obstructing police, possessing a dangerous drug and breach of a probation order.
	
	
	At the time the applicant committed the offences of aggravated enter dwelling with intent and larceny on 13 December 2013, he was subject to a community service order. The applicant was arrested on 9 January 2014 and was subsequently granted bail. Whilst on bail, he committed the further two offences for which he stood for sentence before the judge.
	


Some findings by the judge


	
	The judge observed that the applicant was 46 years old.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that his criminal behaviour commenced as a juvenile and detailed his prior criminal convictions in New South Wales and Queensland.
	
	
	Her Honour summarised the contents of the applicant’s letter and Dr Chew’s report. Her Honour recounted that the applicant had left school at the age of 16, had spent his life in and out of gaol and the longest period he had spent out of custody was for 16 months when he was 40. Her Honour referred to Dr Chew’s opinion that the applicant required intensive psychotherapy and residential rehabilitation.
	
	
	The judge said that the offences of aggravated break and enter with intent of larceny were serious. Her Honour considered that the armed robbery with an offensive weapon was an extremely serious example of this type of crime.
	
	
	In considering the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 49 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 107 (“Henry”), the judge said (ROS 22):
	


“There is of course the guideline judgment of R v Henry to consider. I find the robbery of 4 November 2014 and the attempted robbery of 15 November 2014 clearly fall above the guideline judgment.

This offender is no longer young. There was considerable planning. They were not opportunistic offences. In the actual robbery there was violence and a significant sum of money taken. The weapon used was at first thought to be a firearm. The offender has a lengthy criminal record, including offences of a like nature and he was on [conditional] liberty at the time.

In respect of the attempted robbery, once again he is no longer young. There was significant planning. There was a real threat of violence. He was armed with a knife. He has an extensive record and he was on conditional liberty at the time. It was of course an offence committed in company.”


	
	Her Honour allowed a 10 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty for the offences committed on 13 December 2013 and a 25 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty for the offences committed on 4 and 15 November 2015.
	
	
	The judge considered that the pleas of guilty demonstrated contrition and found that the applicant was remorseful and contrite. Her Honour said that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were extremely guarded given his history and found that the likelihood of his re-offending was high. Her Honour observed that the applicant had breached every form of conditional liberty that had been placed on him and that he had a significant drug addiction.
	
	
	The judge said that in respect of each type of offence committed, general deterrence loomed large and specific deterrence had a significant role to play.
	
	
	The judge declined to find special circumstances. Her Honour said that the length of sentence and the statutory ratio would be adequate to enable the applicant to engage in treatment regimes both in custody and upon release. Her Honour considered that there would be sufficient supervision post-release given the length of penalty to be imposed.
	


Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in taking into account the applicant’s prior record when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence

Argument


	
	The applicant submitted that the judge has taken into account his prior criminal record in determining the objective seriousness of each offence. Whilst accepting that his record was a highly relevant consideration in the overall sentencing exercise, the applicant contended that the judge had erred as it was not relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences.
	
	
	The Court was referred to the following paragraphs in her Honour’s sentencing remarks (ROS 20–21):
	


“The offence of aggravated break and enter with intent and the offence of larceny were serious offences. On this occasion there was a teenager present in the house who was threatened with harm. The offender was armed with a screwdriver. The victim was assaulted when he was pushed to the bed. He was tied up and he was further threatened. A window frame was damaged in the break in. Cash and items were stolen, although the monetary value would not appear to have been significant. The offence was committed by someone with lengthy criminal antecedents, including offences of a like nature. The extent of planning however appeared limited.

The armed robbery with offensive weapon offence committed on 4 November 2015 is an extremely serious example of this type of crime. The offender was armed with an object thought to resemble a handgun. That object was pushed into the victim’s face. A struggle ensued between the victim and the offender which caused the victim to fall into the ground and sustain injury requiring the attendance of an ambulance. In addition to the item thought to be a handgun, the offender was also armed with a set of knuckledusters. The sum of money stolen was $10,000 and there was clearly a degree of planning involved in the robbery. The offender was waiting in the carpark for the victim. A getaway car was waiting to take the offender from the scene and the offender was armed and used a cap and glasses in an attempt to disguise his identity. It was committed by someone with lengthy criminal antecedents who was on conditional liberty at the time.

The last offence in time is the attempted robbery. There was a significant degree of planning involved, the hiring of a getaway vehicle. Pressure had been brought to bear upon a co-offender to disclose information about the targeted butchery. The premises and surrounding area had been canvassed in the lead up to the planned robbery and the offender was armed with a serious carving knife. The offender was not acting alone. Jesse Kelly went into the premises with the offender and there was a getaway driver, Thomas Kelly, who had been organised to help the offenders flee the scene. There were other customers in the butchery who were clearly terrified as a result of the actions of this offender and his co-offender, in addition to employees also. The anticipated takings were significant had the robbery been successful. Once again, an offence committed by someone on conditional liberty with significant criminal antecedence. [Emphasis added.]”


	
	The applicant contended that in relation to the first three offences, the references to the applicant’s “lengthy criminal antecedents” appear in a list of factors supporting the finding made at the outset as to the objective seriousness of those offences. As to the attempted armed robbery, the applicant noted that the judge did not make an express finding as to where that offence sat in the range, but contended that, when read in context, it was clear that the judge was dealing with factors as to the objective seriousness of the offence when her Honour referred to “significant criminal antecedents”.
	
	
	The applicant pointed to another passage in the judge’s sentencing remarks as supporting his complaint (ROS 24):
	


“In arriving at the indicative sentences, I’ve had regard to the objective seriousness of the offences which I have detailed.”


	
	The applicant submitted that the judge was stating in this passage that earlier in the remarks, there had been an exercise where the objective seriousness of the offences had been detailed.
	
	
	The Crown observed that the judge did not expressly take into account the applicant’s prior criminal record in determining the objective seriousness of any offence. The Crown submitted that the fact that the judge referred to that consideration in a section of her remarks did not lead to the inevitable conclusion that her Honour had elevated the gravity of the offending.
	
	
	The Crown said that at the applicant’s age the principles in Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465; [1988] HCA 14 (“Veen (No 2)”) had a greater role to play and this answered the inclusion next to the listing of the objective factors, the applicant’s prior criminal history. It was inappropriate, the Crown argued, to analyse the judge’s remarks to any greater degree.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s prior criminal history could not increase the objective seriousness of his offences. It gave rise to considerations of retribution, deterrence and protection of society: Veen (No 2); R v McNaughten (2006) 66 NSWLR 566; [2006] NSWCCA 242. It is well-established that a person’s prior criminal history has no part to play in determining the gravity of an offence. Accordingly, I approach the applicant’s complaint of error by her Honour, who is an experienced sentencing judge, with considerable caution.
	
	
	It is true, as the Crown submits, that the judge did not expressly say that the criminal history was taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of any of the offences. Unfortunately, there is no reference in the judge’s reasons as to the precise manner in which this factor was considered in the passages quoted at [52] above. Her Honour’s failure to do so “does nothing to enlighten the sentencing process”: Adegoke v R [2013] NSWCCA 193 at [35]; R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109 at [32].
	
	
	The judge delivered her sentencing remarks some weeks after the proceedings on sentence. It is implicit in a reserved judgment that a judge has given consideration to all of the material placed before her. This Court is obliged to closely examine what was said by the judge, including the order in which matters are referred to, so as to discern her Honour’s process of reasoning.
	
	
	In the passages quoted at [52] above, the applicant’s criminal antecedents are grouped with factors that are relevant to objective seriousness. A key to the judge’s thinking is found in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences of aggravated break and enter with intent and larceny. The reference to the applicant’s lengthy criminal antecedents is not left at the end of the factors relevant to objective seriousness but is included between “monetary value” and “extent of planning”. Both of these factors are quintessentially part of an assessment of the objective gravity of the applicant’s offending on 13 December 2013.
	
	
	As to the offence committed on 4 November 2014, although the reference to the applicant’s criminal antecedents comes at the end of the paragraph, which commences with a conclusion that the armed robbery “is an extremely serious example of this type of crime”, I do not think that this reference can be explained by the way the sentencing remarks are paragraphed. This is a reserved judgment which her Honour has revised. In any event, the applicant’s criminal history is coupled with his being “on conditional liberty at the time”, which is a factor that aggravates the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Later on in the remarks, her Honour states (ROS 23):
	


“I referred earlier to the offender’s lengthy criminal antecedents. This offender has manifested in the commission of these further offences, a continuing disobedience of the law in which case retribution, deterrence and protection of society indicate more severe penalties are warranted. It is clear that nothing has deterred Mr Kelly thus far.”


	
	In this passage, the judge gives specific attention in accordance with the principles in Veen (No 2) to the applicant’s criminal antecedents in considering whether a more severe sentence was warranted. The judge’s reference to these considerations detracts from the Crown’s submission that in the earlier passages (at [52] above), her Honour had in mind the Veen (No 2) principles.
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, the judge did take into account the applicant’s prior criminal history when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. As error has been established, I would uphold Ground 1 of the appeal.
	


Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in her Honour’s application of the Henry principle to the armed robbery and attempted armed robbery offences

Argument


	
	The applicant does not complain that the judge’s assessment that the offences of armed robbery and attempted armed robbery fell above the guideline judgment in Henry was incorrect. The issue is the extent to which the assessment fell above the Henry guideline. The applicant pointed to the starting point of the indicative sentence for the armed robbery being 10 years and argued that had her Honour made an assessment of the offence which took into account the lack of proof that the weapon was real and the lack of vulnerability of the victim (in the guideline judgment sense), the indicative sentence for this offence, may have been lower than it was.
	
	
	Another matter was the judge’s apparent failure to consider the distinction between the discount of 10 per cent for the plea of guilty and the 25 per cent discount that the applicant was afforded. However, as to that issue, the applicant accepted that as he ultimately received a 25 per cent discount, he had not been disadvantaged in the determination of the indicative sentence.
	
	
	The same argument as to the plea of guilty was advanced in respect of the attempted armed robbery but the applicant recognised that he had not been disadvantaged. The applicant contended that the fact that nothing at all was taken, rather than a small amount, should have carried real weight in his favour and the indicative sentence may have been lower.
	
	
	Another argument was that the judge may have double counted those factors that overlapped her Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the armed robbery and attempt offence and the Henry guideline. The applicant contended that the judge’s failure to address the plea of guilty in the Henry context supported a finding that double counting as to the Henry matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences had in fact occurred.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s assertion of error is directed towards the indicative sentences of 7 years 6 months imprisonment for the armed robbery and 6 years imprisonment for the attempted armed robbery. As this Court has emphasised, the indicative sentences are not amenable to appeal, although they may be a guide as to whether error is established in relation to the aggregate sentence: JM v R (2014) 246 A Crim R 528; [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [40]. As the applicant does not submit that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive, I do not understand why this ground of appeal has been advanced.
	
	
	In any event, I am not persuaded that there was any double counting by the judge. The judge’s references to the degree of planning and violence in the assessment of objective gravity of the robbery offences and in the consideration of the Henry guideline did not mean that her Honour had additional regard to these factors. Her Honour was merely providing reasons for determining that the offences fell above the guideline judgment.
	
	
	Furthermore, it is plain that the judge took into account when discussing the Henry guideline that the weapon used in the robbery was not capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. Her Honour said (ROS 22): “the weapon used was at first thought to be a firearm”. Her Honour was well aware that the pleas of not guilty to these offences had been entered at an early stage as the sentences were discounted by 25 per cent.
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
	


Re-Sentence?


	
	As error has been established, it is necessary to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law: Kentwell v R (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 at [42]. The focus of the applicant’s submission on re-sentence is that this Court should find special circumstances which the judge declined to do.
	
	
	In my view, the aggregate sentence imposed by the judge, both in the head sentence and non-parole period, is an appropriate reflection of the totality of the criminality involved in the applicant’s offending and his subjective circumstances. No lesser sentence is warranted in law.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

4705928,Lepine v R [2017] NSWCCA 83,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J and the order which he proposes.
	
	
	WALTON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Mr Brett Lepine (""the applicant"") seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against his conviction for three offences of indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years (s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) following a trial by jury in the District Court at Sydney.
	
	
	The trial ran from 27 May to 6 June 2014. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on Counts 1 to 3 (the three offences against s 61E(1) Crimes Act) and not guilty on Counts 4 to 7 (each alleging an offence of sexual intercourse with a child over the age of 10 and under the age of 16).
	
	
	His Honour Judge Haesler SC sentenced the applicant on 18 July 2014. In respect of Count 1, no conviction was recorded pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In respect of Counts 2 and 3, convictions were recorded but no penalty was imposed pursuant to s 10A of that Act.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant seeks to rely upon a sole ground of appeal:
	


The jury’s verdict, in respect to Counts 1, 2 and 3 were unreasonable in all the circumstances, in the light of the jury’s verdicts in Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7. In that:

i)   The evidence as to intention to assault, lack of consent to assault and any accompanying indecency did not support the guilty verdicts;

ii)   The complainant lacked credibility in respect to the matters the subject of the guilty verdicts and in particular to any alleged indecency;

iii)   The guilty verdicts appear to have been compromise verdicts;

iv)   The guilty verdicts are inconsistent with the acquittals in counts 4-7 inclusive.

An extension of time required


	
	By s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the applicant had 28 days from 18 July 2014 to file a Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal (""the Notice of Intention""). He did not do so until 23 December 2014 but the Registrar granted an application for an extension of time in this respect.
	
	
	The filing of the Notice of Intention was prompted by the applicant having been contacted by police about registering on the Child Protection Register and by him wanting to be able to defend himself against people referring to him as a paedophile.
	
	
	Pursuant to rr 3A and 3B of the Criminal Appeal Rules the applicant had 6 months during the currency of the Notice of Intention to file a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal. The period during which the Notice of Intention had effect could be extended pursuant to r 3A(2). However, no application was made for an extension. The Notice of Intention therefore expired on 22 June 2015.
	
	
	The next thing to occur was the filing of a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal with a Notice of Application for Extension of Time on 2 November 2016.
	
	
	The explanation for the almost 2 year delay from the filing of the Notice of Intention and almost 2½ years from the date of sentence included that the applicant had received a negative advice from senior counsel about his appeal prospects in May 2015. Another advice was obtained from his current junior counsel later that year which was of a positive nature. The applicant then delayed for a year raising the funds to pay the fees of counsel (senior and junior) and his solicitor.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the interests of justice favour an extension of time being granted. The explanation for the substantial delay is unsatisfactory. More particularly, however, the proposed appeal has no merit.
	


The Crown case


	
	The complainant lived with her family in north-western suburban Sydney. She frequently stayed with her grandparents at Springwood. The applicant, who was her cousin and about seven and half years older than her, lived with his family nearby at Blaxland. The complainant would stay at the applicant’s family home for a couple of nights during her visits to her grandparents.
	
	
	The offences were alleged to have occurred in the applicant's home during the complainant's visits from when she was aged 8 in 1985 until she was aged 12 in 1990.
	


Count 1 – between 31 May and 31 December 1985


	
	Count 1 alleged an indecent assault which occurred when the applicant was sitting at a computer and she walked behind him. She said that he leaned out and squeezed her on the bottom with his right hand, using his hand in a claw type position with his palm facing upwards. His hand touched her bottom and parts of his fingers went between her legs. She said this occurred on mutliple occasions during this particular visit to the applicant's house. (AB 173-175)
	
	
	The complainant said that on subsequent visits the applicant's behaviour escalated.
	


Count 2 – between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1989


	
	Count 2 alleged an indecent assault which occurred on an occasion when he called her into his bedroom. She said that he asked or told her to get up on the bed, which she did. He grabbed her in a bear hug type of hold and pulled her onto him on the bed and rolled over the top of her. She said that she could feel something hard under his clothing; ""he was pushing into me, we were both clothed and then I managed to squirm away and got out of the bedroom"". She said she did not realise at the time, but as she got older she recognised that the applicant had had an erection ""because of where it was and where I felt it"". (AB 175-176)
	


Count 3 – between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1989


	
	The offence in Count 3 was alleged to have occurred later on the same day as the offence in Count 2. The applicant came into the complainant's bedroom. He picked up her brush and she asked for it back. He threw it on the bed and said, ""if you want it come and get it"". As she went to retrieve the brush he grabbed her in a similar type of bear hug as before and pulled her onto the bed. He rolled on top of her but she managed to squirm free and leave the room. While he was on top of her she again felt him pushing his erection into her through his clothing, ""like pulling me tight and rubbing it against me while we were rolling around on the bed"". (AB 176)
	


Counts 4 and 5 – between 31 May 1989 and 30 May 1990


	
	On a later visit, when the complainant was aged 12, she went to bed and as she passed the applicant and said good night to him he said to her, ""I'll be in in a minute"". She did not know what he meant by that. She went to bed and was preparing to go to sleep. She said that quite some time later the applicant came in and got into bed with her. He pulled up her nightie and put his hand on the inside of her thigh. He then pulled her underwear to the side and put his finger inside her vagina and started moving it around. She said that it was very uncomfortable and it hurt.
	
	
	The complainant said that the applicant then got on top of her. He pulled her face into his shoulder and she then started to feel an immense pain ""which at the time I thought he had got his whole fist, hand and put it inside me"". She clarified, ""inside my vagina"". She said the pain was ""really bad"". The applicant said, ""Ooh, what's that?"". She replied, ""I don't know"". He was moving forward and back on top of her ""and it really hurt"". She said that she did not know how long it went on for ""and it only stopped when he left"". The next day she felt really sore and she was really upset. She did not know why but she did not tell anyone. (AB 177)
	


Counts 6 and 7 – between 31 May 1989 and 30 May 1990


	
	The same thing happened the following night in the same way. First there was penetration by the applicant's finger and then by what she assumed at the time was his hand. She felt the same type of pain. (AB 177-178)
	
	
	The complainant said, ""I realised thinking as I've got older and I've had three children that I now understand it wasn't his hand, that it was his penis"" on both nights. In hindsight, she realised that it could not have been a hand because he was using his hands to hold onto her and to pull her into him. (AB 178)
	


Complaint


	
	There was evidence of complaint which will be considered in more detail below. In short, the complainant told her mother shortly before the next school holidays, when she was again due to go to her grandmother's home to stay. She confirmed her complaint to her father. She also complained to the applicant's mother, who had heard from the complainant's brother what was being alleged. She also complained to a school friend.
	


Recorded pretext telephone conversation


	
	Another aspect of the Crown case was a recorded pretext telephone conversation between the complainant and the applicant that occurred at the instigation of police on 28 May 2013. The Crown case was that the applicant did not deny most of the allegations that were put to him and specifically admitted certain sexual misconduct. This will be considered in more detail below.
	


The defence case


	
	The defence case involved a denial of any sexual impropriety. If there had been any inappropriate touching it occurred while the applicant had given the complainant a piggy back. There was evidence given by the applicant, his father and five character witnesses.
	


Submissions for the applicant


	
	In written submissions, the applicant contended that this was a ""word against word"" case and by its verdicts of not guilty in respect of Counts 4 to 7 the jury ""did not accept the complainant as a witness of truth"". There was no apparent good reason for the jury to accept her evidence in respect of Counts 1 to 3. It was said that this ""smacked"" of compromise verdicts. (AWS [57]-[59]; [65]; [67])
	
	
	There were deficiencies in the evidence that provided a logical explanation for the jury having acquitted the applicant on Counts 4 to 7 (and these were listed in the written submissions). Further, the complainant's recollection was inconsistent and unreliable with respect to critical elements of the offences. (AWS [60]-[62]; [67])
	
	
	There were also deficiencies in the evidence concerning the indecent assaults in Counts 1 to 3:
	


""The complainant's evidence in relation to them was 'scant in its references' to them. It is apparent that she did not consider there had been any assault, or lack of consent, until in the context of the asserted sexual intercourse she felt that she had experienced contact with a 'hard object' when she reflected on the events years afterwards."" (AWS [63])

""There was a lack of timely complaint which indicated a lack of awareness that an assault or an act of indecency had occurred. The complainant first came to the realisation was in the context of the alleged sexual penetration. Further, she said she reported the alleged assaults after watching a television program about the Catholic Church and sexual abuse."" (AWS [64])


	
	In oral submissions, it was argued that the complaints made by the complainant and the pretext telephone conversation did not support her evidence in relation to Counts 1 to 3 because neither of them related to any of those specific incidents. (27.3.17 at T3-5)
	
	
	I do not understand the submissions for the applicant to involve an overall contention of unreasonableness in the verdicts in the sense that, putting side the inconsistency in the verdicts, this Court would be required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence to determine whether it was open for the jury to find the applicant guilty in respect of the three indecent assaults. The Crown made clear in its written submissions (at [10]) that it perceived the applicant's case for unreasonableness to be based upon the inconsistency in the verdicts and it was on that basis that the oral submissions for both parties were advanced at the hearing.
	


Unreasonable verdicts because of inconsistency of verdicts


	
	The approach to be taken by this Court when there is an assertion that a verdict is unreasonable because of inconsistent verdicts returned by a jury are well known, often recited and need not be repeated. See, for example, TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at [2]-[8] (McClellan CJ at CL); Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58; 240 A Crim R 114 at [19]-[24] (Leeming JA); MG v R [2017] NSWCCA 14 at [82]-[89] (Hoeben CJ at CL).
	
	
	The present application may be determined by considering whether there is an acceptable explanation for differentiation by the jury between Counts 1 to 3 and Counts 4 to 7 as a matter of logic and reasonableness.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind that the jury were directed of a need to ""examine [the complainant's] evidence very carefully in order to satisfy yourself that you can safely act on that evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial"". The trial judge also suggested that the jury ""should of course look to see if other evidence supports what she has told you"". (AB 14) This was a direction based upon R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12.
	
	
	The jury were also directed to give separate consideration to the evidence pertaining to each count but his Honour suggested that there would need to be good reason for the complainant's evidence to accepted on one count and not on others; or rejected on one count but not on others. (AB 7; 14) This was a direction derived from R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 at [186]-[191] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	It is also pertinent to emphasise the following in the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at 617 [34]:
	


""In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.""

Consideration


	
	Deficiencies in the recollection of a complainant in a case such as this, where the charges brought against an accused relate to events alleged to have occurred some 25 to 30 years before the trial, are unsurprising. They are to be expected, particularly in the case of a complainant who was a child at the relevant time. There were such deficiencies in this case but they do not necessarily support the conclusion for which the applicant contends: that the complainant was not accepted ""as a witness of truth"".
	
	
	It is far more likely that the jury heeded the trial judge's directions and suggestions to examine the complainant's evidence very carefully and to look for whether there was evidence that supported what she had alleged.
	
	
	In this case there are two bases upon which the jury could have legitimately differentiated in its verdicts between Counts 1 to 3 on the one hand and Counts 4 to 7 on the other. Complaints made by the complainant were capable of being regarded as supportive of her evidence as to the former far more so than the latter. Moreover, the evidence of the pretext telephone conversation was capable of being regarded by the jury as involving admissions by the applicant to having indecently assaulted the complainant but not to have sexually penetrated her.
	


Complaint evidence


	
	To her mother's statement, ""if anyone touches you between your legs, you need to either tell me or tell your dad"", the complainant replied that the applicant ""does that to me"". Her father then asked, ""Your mother tells me that [the applicant] touched you up"" and she replied, ""Yes he did"". (AB 178)
	
	
	The complainant's mother claimed that she said ""he laid on top of her and he stuck something hard in her and it hurt very much"". However, she conceded in cross-examination that she did not tell police this when she made her statement. She gave an explanation for this but the jury may have been hesitant in accepting it. (AB 397; 409)
	
	
	The evidence of the complainant that she told a school friend of having been ""sexually abused"" was also capable of being regarded as being consistent with Counts 1 to 3 while not specifically supportive of Counts 4 to 7.
	
	
	The school friend's notes made at the time (June 1991 – Exhibit B, C and D) recorded a complaint in the same broad terms: that the complainant had been ""sexually abused"". In her evidence she said that she had a ""vague recollection"" of a complaint involving the perpetrator ""forcing their hands on the person … either down the person's pants or something to that effect"". (AB 439)
	
	
	The complainant said that she told the applicant's mother that the applicant ""put his finger inside my vagina"", a complaint that was more consistent with the events in Counts 4 to 7. However, the applicant's mother did not recall this. Her evidence was that she had heard from the complainant's brother that the complainant had alleged that the applicant had touched her between the legs. She confronted the complainant and was told the same thing. She said that if the complainant had described anything in more detail she would have remembered. (AB 180; 420-421)
	
	
	It would have been well open to the jury to have regard to this evidence of complaints as providing support for the proposition that there had been indecent assaults but providing little or no support for the proposition that there had been sexual penetration.
	


The pretext conversation


	
	At the instigation of police, the complainant called the applicant at his place of work on 28 May 2013. She spoke to him briefly, telling him that she wanted to speak privately about the sexual abuse he had inflicted upon her when she was a child. He said he was busy but gave her his mobile number and asked that she call back.
	
	
	The complainant called the applicant back later and a conversation ensued for about 20 minutes. A recording of the call, and a transcript, were before the jury. Overall, the conversation involved the complainant trying to have the applicant admit to having sexually abused her and also to admit to specific acts that constituted such abuse. Throughout the conversation the applicant was apologetic. It was well open to the jury to construe the conversation as involving admissions to sexual abuse, specifically to indecently assaulting the complainant. For example:
	


""I remember stuff happening on different occasions. … So, mostly the things I remember is taking you for piggy backs and touching you on the vagina. That's all I remember. That's pretty much the only bits that I remember from and that happened on a number of occasions and I remember I was pretty young if I was doing that to you and I know you were younger and that I'm really sorry that it happened …"" (AB 67)


	
	Significantly, however, he was adamant that he did not have intercourse with her. For example:
	


""Yeah ok, I'm absolutely certain that [""you having sex with me""; ""you raped me""] did not happen. I definitely did not have sex with you and I definitely do not have any recollection whatsoever of raping you. So, look if that's what you remember now then maybe your memory is way distorted …"" (AB 71)


	
	In his evidence, the applicant sought to explain that he was taken aback by the call. He said he was trying to help the complainant to move on; he comforted and counselled her; he sought to appease her and to say what she wanted to hear; he tried to make her feel better and placate her. He thought there was no harm in apologising to her ""for whatever she thinks is going on in her head. It's no skin off my nose. And perhaps it can be of a great benefit to her."" (AB 465.15)
	
	
	The applicant was asked about the admission to touching the complainant's vagina. He said it was not a truthful statement and:
	


""I answered like that because I thought that this whole conversation, I'm actually this is about the piggy backs that happened because that was the only thing back when we had the original phone call to my mother that I believed all these years that this is what that is about that she has somehow misinterpreted that I had inappropriately touched her when I gave her some piggy backs in the backyard. Whether I touched her on the vagina actually I have no idea."" (AB 466)


	
	His counsel asked if he would have intended to touch the complainant on the vagina. The applicant replied, ""Absolutely not"". (AB 466)
	
	
	Towards the end of the cross-examination by the prosecutor the applicant gave the following evidence:
	


""Q. Throughout all of that conversation when she put all of those allegations to you where she went from grabbing, talking about grabbing, to you lying and rolling around on her, to penetrating her with your finger, to as you described it alleging that you engaged in penis to vagina sexual intercourse with her, the only thing you denied through that whole conversation flatly was the last thing, that is penis/vaginal intercourse.

A. Yes, because I was trying to help her by not saying anything that would perhaps make her feel worse."" (AB 506)


	
	It would have been well open to the jury to accept the evidence of this conversation as supporting the complainant's account of having been indecently assaulted by the applicant on multiple occasions. Although there was no admission by the applicant of any of the specific events with which Counts 1 to 3 were concerned, the admissions that were made were capable of supporting the complainant's assertion that the charged indecent assaults occurred.
	
	
	Given the applicant's unequivocal denial of sexual intercourse it would have been apparent to the jury that the complainant's evidence in relation to Counts 4 to 7, in contrast to her evidence in relation to Counts 1 to 3, remained unsupported.
	


Conclusion


	
	There is a perfectly logical and reasonable basis for the jury to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant in respect of Counts 1 to 3 but not in relation to Counts 4 to 7. This had nothing to do with there being a doubt about the complainant being ""a witness of truth"". It had everything to do with the jury finding support for her evidence in relation to the conviction counts but not in relation to the acquittal counts.
	
	
	For these reasons, and because of the unsatisfactory explanation for the substantial delay in instituting these proceedings, I propose the following order:
	


Application for extension of time to seek leave to appeal against conviction refused.

4705932,Boikov v Network Ten Pty Ltd; Boikov v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2017] NSWDC 88,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	These are reasons for the orders I made on 30 March 2017 placing restrictions (see orders 4 and 5) on the leave to amend the statement of claim granted to the plaintiff, and reserving the costs of the plaintiff’s application to the Trial Judge.
	
	
	The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation the subject matter of which are set out in my previous judgments: Boikov v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 193; Boikov v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd; Boikov v Network Ten Pty Ltd; Boikov v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 161 (see also Boikov v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 192). All these claims are listed for hearing on 21 August 2017 for a five week jury trial, so it is necessary for me to make orders ex tempore to enable the parties to meet this deadline. As a result, there is a degree of informality in the content and presentation of this judgment.
	
	
	Although I have made orders for access to documents, the principal application before the court is the plaintiff’s application for leave to file a further amended statement of claim to “plead back” imputations currently pleaded by Network Ten Pty Ltd (“Network Ten”) and Nationwide News (“Nationwide News”) Pty Ltd (“the defendants”) as contextual imputations.
	
	
	As this application is brought after the proceedings are set down for trial, it is necessary to set out the procedural history of the claims before the court.
	


The history of these proceedings


	
	The plaintiff’s claims arise from the publication of a broadcast by Network Ten on 30 July 2014 (“the Network Ten proceedings”) and the publication of a number of articles by Nationwide News on 30 and 31 July 2014 (“the Nationwide News proceedings”). Each of the proceedings was commenced on 28 July 2015. Following objections to the imputations, Amended Statements of Claim were filed on 16 September 2015.
	
	
	On 17 August 2016, McLoughlin SC DCJ listed the claims for a five week jury trial, commencing 21 August 2017.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter, the defendants advised their intention to plead an Amended Defence. On 6 October 2016 I made the following orders in respect the Network Ten proceedings:
	



	
	The defendant is to administer any interrogatories on or before 13 October 2016.
	
	
	The parties to serve verified answers to interrogatories on or before 28 October 2016.
	
	
	The defendant to provide the plaintiff’s solicitor with a copy of any proposed amended defence by 18 November 2016.
	
	
	The proceedings be listed for directions on 1 December 2016.
	



	
	Also on 6 October 2016, the following orders were made in relation to the Nationwide News proceedings:
	



	
	The plaintiff is to administer any interrogatories on or before 13 October 2016.
	
	
	The parties are to serve verified answers to any interrogatories by 2 November 2016.
	
	
	The defendant to provide the plaintiff’s solicitor with a copy of any proposed amended defence by 18 November 2016.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 26 of the Civil Procedure Act, the parties attend a mediation on or before 30 November 2016.
	
	
	The proceedings listed for directions on 1 December 2016.
	



	
	On 30 November 2016, the defendants in each of the Network Ten and Nationwide News proceedings served their proposed Amended Defences. I made the following orders on 1 December 2016 in the Network Ten proceedings:
	



	
	The plaintiff is to notify the defendant whether he consents to the defendant being granted leave to file the Amended Defence served on 30 November 2016 on or before 9 December 2016.
	
	
	On the condition that the plaintiff’s consent is given in accordance with order (1) above, the defendant is granted leave to file and serve the Amended Defence on or before 16 December 2016.
	
	
	The defendant is to serve verified answers to interrogatories by 15 December 2016.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to serve verified answers to interrogatories by 17 February 2017.
	
	
	The proceedings be listed for directions or any argument in respect of the proposed Amended Defence on Thursday 2 March 2017 in the Defamation List (subject to compliance with Civil Practice Note 6).
	
	
	Reserve the issue of costs in relation to the defendant’s failure to comply with the timetable for interrogatories on two prior occasions and the late service of the Amended Defence.
	



	
	The orders made on that occasion in relation to the Nationwide News proceedings were as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff is to notify the defendant whether he consents to the defendant being granted leave to file the Amended Defence served on 30 November 2016 on or before 9 December 2016.
	
	
	On the condition that the plaintiff’s consent is given in accordance with order (1) above, the defendant is granted leave to file and serve the Amended Defence on or before 16 December 2016.
	
	
	The parties are to serve verified answers to any interrogatories by 16 December 2016.
	
	
	The parties to complete mediation by 17 February 2017.
	
	
	The proceedings be listed for directions or any argument in respect of the proposed Amended Defence on Thursday 2 March 2017 in the Defamation List (subject to compliance with Civil Practice Note 6).
	



	
	On 2 March 2017, I made the following further orders in relation to both these proceedings:
	



	
	Grant leave to the defendant to file the Amended Defence in court, in the form served on the plaintiff on 30 November 2016, and dispense with the need for service.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to serve verified answers to interrogatories on or before 16 March 2017.
	
	
	Any applications by the parties in relation to costs previously reserved are to be notified to the other party on or before 16 March 2017.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application for leave to file a further amended statement of claim adopting the defendant’s contextual imputations, and any costs applications notified in accordance with order (3) above, are listed for argument in the Defamation List on Thursday 30 March 2017 and/or directions.
	



	
	In the Amended Defences the defendants plead a defence of contextual truth pursuant to s 26 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (“the Act”) based upon the following contextual imputations:
	



	
	The plaintiff conducted himself in a manner which warranted him being monitored by ASIO.
	
	
	The plaintiff was being monitored by ASIO.
	


The defendants’ position


	
	The defendants do not oppose the plaintiff’s application, provided that this leave is conditional upon the preservation of the defendant’s entitlement to continue to rely upon the s 26 contextual justification it already has in relation to these imputations. Orders of this kind have been examined and explained in Pahuja v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 1664 at [3]; Sharp v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 223 at [28]-[30] and Hibbert v Nationwide News Pty Limited (District Court Proceedings 2014/60638, Mahony SC DCJ): no judgment is available for this ruling, but counsel in these proceedings fortunately also appeared in those proceedings).
	
	
	The defendants have provided a form of order to encapsulate such a ruling:
	


“1. Subject to the condition set out in order 2, the plaintiff is granted leave to file a Further Amended Statement of Claim pleading the imputations which are currently pleaded by the defendant as contextual imputations in the Amended Defence.

2. The leave granted in order 1 above is granted on the condition that leave to amend be revoked nunc pro tunc in respect of any imputation proved by the defendants to be substantially true, such that, at trial, the defendants may rely upon any such imputation for the purpose of a defence under s. 26 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).”


	
	The defendants ask the court to exercise its discretion not to grant the plaintiff the leave to amend sought, other than subject to this condition. They draw my attention to Exhibits B and C, evidence recently obtained on discovery which they claim shows the high likelihood of this contextual imputation (which is what the matter complained of is really all about) being proved true. In those circumstances, they argue, the only reason for the pleading back of the imputation is to avoid the impact of the s 26 defence, as opposed to seeking vindication of reputation.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	Mr Rasmussen submits that the entitlement to “plead back” the defendants’ contextual imputations should be unfettered, and that there are no special features in this case warranting such an order. The hearing date is several months away and the defendants have been on notice of this application for some time. He also submits that the evidence asserted to be relied upon in relation to the truth of the contextual imputations is weak and unpersuasive.
	


The relevant principles in relation to the amendment of pleadings


	
	Before considering the circumstances in which late amendments are permitted in defamation proceedings, I first note s 64 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides:
	


“64 Amendment of documents generally

(1) At any stage of proceedings, the court may order:

(a) that any document in the proceedings be amended, or

(b) that leave be granted to a party to amend any document in the proceedings.

(2) Subject to section 58, all necessary amendments are to be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceedings, correcting any defect or error in the proceedings and avoiding multiplicity of proceedings.

(3) An order under this section may be made even if the amendment would have the effect of adding or substituting a cause of action that has arisen after the commencement of the proceedings but, in that case, the date of commencement of the proceedings, in relation to that cause of action, is, subject to section 65, taken to be the date on which the amendment is made.

(4) If there has been a mistake in the name of a party, this section applies to the person intended to be made a party as if he or she were a party.

(5) This section does not apply to the amendment of a judgment, order or certificate.”


	
	As to the overarching obligations of litigation, s 58 provides:
	


“58 Court to follow dictates of justice

(1) In deciding:

(a) whether to make any order or direction for the management of proceedings, including:

(i) any order for the amendment of a document, and

(ii) any order granting an adjournment or stay of proceedings, and

(iii) any other order of a procedural nature, and

(iv) any direction under Division 2, and

(b) the terms in which any such order or direction is to be made, the court must seek to act in accordance with the dictates of justice.

(2) For the purpose of determining what are the dictates of justice in a particular case, the court:

(a) must have regard to the provisions of sections 56 and 57, and

(b) may have regard to the following matters to the extent to which it considers them relevant:

(i) the degree of difficulty or complexity to which the issues in the proceedings give rise,

(ii) the degree of expedition with which the respective parties have approached the proceedings, including the degree to which they have been timely in their interlocutory activities,

(iii) the degree to which any lack of expedition in approaching the proceedings has arisen from circumstances beyond the control of the respective parties,

(iv) the degree to which the respective parties have fulfilled their duties under section 56(3),

(v) the use that any party has made, or could have made, of any opportunity that has been available to the party in the course of the proceedings, whether under rules of court, the practice of the court or any direction of a procedural nature given in the proceedings,

(vi) the degree of injustice that would be suffered by the respective parties as a consequence of any order or direction,

(vii) such other matters as the court considers relevant in the circumstances of the case.”


	
	As Ms Barnett points out in her helpful written submissions, s 64(1) gives the Court a general discretionary power to grant leave to amend pleadings. Section 64(2) relevantly provides that “all necessary amendments are to be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceedings”. The Court’s power pursuant to s 64 is expressly stated to be subject to s 58 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Section 58(1) relevantly provides that in deciding whether to make an order permitting the amendment of the pleading, “the court must seek to act in accordance with the dictates of justice”.
	
	
	However, these provisions need to be seen in the context of proceedings which are listed for hearing in a very short period of time. While this is partly due to the application by the defendants to amend, there is an additional problem in that the reasons for that late amendment come from the provision of documents obtained under subpoena, a step the defendants could not take until after the completion of discovery.
	
	
	I also take into account that applications for leave to amend, and in particular leave to amend at a late stage, turn on their own facts. This means that applications of a similar kind are of assistance to the court but ultimately any determination of this issue depends upon the facts of the case.
	
	
	I also take into account the special circumstances of late amendments in defamation proceedings, which have been the subject of consideration in a series of judgments and practice rules over the past thirty years. Late amendments in relation to the pleading back of contextual imputations form a subset of these applications, and it is helpful to consider how other judges have approached this issue.
	


Amendments in relation to contextual justification


	
	The significant impact of Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode (2011) 81 NSWLR 157 continues to be felt. It appears to be generally accepted that the unfortunate wording of s 26 of the uniform legislation, which led to this result, is unlikely ever to be amended.
	
	
	This has led to further complications. The authorities are divided as to what use may be made by a defendant at trial of any imputation pleaded by the plaintiff, as a comparison of Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2014) 88 NSWLR 421 at [86] with Mizikovsky v Queensland Television Ltd [2014] 1 Qd R 197 demonstrates. As Basten JA noted in Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd, Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode and Mizikovsky v Queensland Television Ltd are not entirely consistent with each other. In addition, there is a third problem, in that the approach taken by Basten JA in Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd is itself suggestive of a third avenue of approach, as the New South Wales Court of Appeal noted in Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd v Balzola [2015] NSWCA 285 at [25].
	
	
	In Kazal v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2017] NSWSC 44, McCallum J noted:
	


“[35] The better view, in my respectful opinion, is that the decision in Kermode is not confined to a pleading point but governs the course of the trial. An imputation relied upon by a plaintiff but proved true may be relied upon in mitigation of damages but does not, in my view, become a “contextual imputation” for the purpose of a defence under s 26.”


	
	Similarly, in Chel v Fairfax Media Publications (No 6) [2017] NSWSC 230 at [35]-[44], Beech-Jones J held that imputations relied upon by the plaintiff but found to be substantially truth can be relied upon by the defendant as contextual imputations for the purpose of a s 26 defence.
	
	
	While, as the defendants point out in their helpful written submissions, this controversy need not be determined on this application, one illustration of the difficulty in relation to this application is that, if the approach taken by McCallum J in Kazal v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd is preferred, the defendants will be deprived of the ability to rely upon their s 26 defence in the manner adopted by Beech-Jones J and, it would appear, also on the interpretation taken by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd v Balzola.
	
	
	The degree of complexity which will be introduced into the trial by this problem is particularly apparent in the present case, as the defendants state that the second of the contextual imputations is highly likely to be established at trial, having regard to material recently produced under subpoena. ASIO has now produced material which the defendants claim will prove that ASIO was indeed monitoring the plaintiff, in that it accessed and printed his Facebook page on 25 July 2014, five days prior to the publication of the matters complained of. It is submitted that, in these circumstances, where this imputation is true will not sound in damages for the plaintiff if the application is granted on an unconditional basis, the defendants will be denied the ability to defend the proceedings on the basis of the substantial truth of this imputation because the plaintiff is seizing on the “loophole” of pleading this imputation despite it being true.
	
	
	The defendants submit that the plaintiff’s application, in those circumstances, is not brought for the purposes of vindication, but to achieve a forensic advantage by pleading an imputation he knows to be true, which the Court of Appeal has held, in Toben v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2016] NSWCA 296, to amount to an abuse of process.
	
	
	The defendants also point to the lateness of the application. Late amendments in defamation were for many decades the subject of special sanctions and rules, some of which were set out by Hunt J in his Honour’s Defamation List Announcement of 14 October 1988. Applications for late amendment which could result in the adjournment of the trial were either refused or the subject of orders of a remedial nature, such as the service of affidavits in relation to late amendments of justification. These two factors – the complexity of defamation jury trials and the discouragement of late amendment in defamation proceedings – need to be borne in mind when dealing with late applications to amend.
	


Reasons for the late amendment


	
	A late amendment which is likely to have a significant impact on the trial must generally be explained, for the reasons set out by the High Court in Aon Risk Services Australia v Australian National University (2009) 258 ALR 14.
	
	
	The defendants complained that the plaintiff has supplied no evidence in support of his application for leave to amend in the way of explanation for delay which is stated to be four months since the plaintiff was notified of the defendants’ intention to raise these matters in the Amended Defence, in circumstances where the plaintiff’s legal representatives (and for that matter the plaintiff) had been aware of the documents produced under subpoena. It is submitted that the true purpose of the plaintiff is not to plead imputations by which he complains he has been injured in his feelings and reputation but take advantage of the acknowledged loophole in the legislation in relation to the defence of contextual justification, either to prevent the defendants from relying upon the defence of justification or to introduce such complexity into the jury questions as will cause difficulties at the trial.
	
	
	This inference is asserted to arise from:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s conduct in resisting the conditional order set out above. If the plaintiff’s true intention were to seek damages and vindication of his reputation with respect to the contextual imputations, this purpose would be served by the making of the orders proposed by the defendants. However, the plaintiff’s resistance to these orders is telling. It reveals that the plaintiff’s true intention is to deprive the defendants of a properly pleaded defence (a purpose that would not be achieved by the making of the conditional orders);
	
	
	The fact that these imputations have not been pleaded by the plaintiff, despite having had ample opportunity to do so and despite being explicitly on notice of those imputations for approximately four months since the service of the proposed Amended Defences, and despite being advised by experienced defamation counsel;
	
	
	The fact that no explanation for the delay has been provided.
	



	
	For these reasons the defendants submit it would not be “just” within the meanings of s 56(1) and/or s 57(1)(a) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) to allow the amendment without conditions as set out above.
	
	
	Alternatively, the defendants submit it is an abuse of process to make use of a procedural power in a manifestly unfair way: Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1982] AC 529 at 536 per Lord Diplock; Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393 - 394; Rogers v the Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 255, 286 - 287; Jeffery & Katauskas v SST Consulting Pty Ltd (2009) 239 CLR 75 at 93, 103 - 104, [56].
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	The reasons for the plaintiff not pleading these imputations earlier are set out in the affidavit of William Allen dated 29 March 2017. He is the solicitor for the plaintiff. He states that he is not experienced in defamation and relied on counsel to plead all available imputations. He states, on information and belief, that the plaintiff told him that “each of the proposed contextual imputations…are [sic] false” (paragraph 12), which I find most unhelpful.
	
	
	The scant and unhelpful nature of the plaintiff’s submissions were a critical factor in my decision. The defendants, by comparison, not only supplied careful written submissions but extracts from the evidence which they assert will establish the truth of the imputation.
	
	
	That evidence is not addressed by the plaintiff beyond the bald statement of the solicitor for the plaintiff (who acknowledges his lack of expertise in this field) that his client has told him these imputations are false.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen also pointed to the number of times that a party was granted leave in other proceedings to amend without this restriction and to the length of time until the hearing for the defendants to come to terms with this amendment. There was, he submitted, no special magic about the contextual imputations the subject of this application, which closely resembled the plaintiff’s own imputations.
	


Conclusions


	
	While parties to applications such as the present are entitled to be cautious about revealing evidence which will be led at the trial in applications such as the present, the total absence of any engagement by the plaintiff’s legal representatives in relation to the evidentiary issues means that I am faced with a picture of evidence under subpoena submitted to be critical by the defendants which is not answered in any way by the plaintiff other than the bald statement, on information and belief, that the contextual imputations are false.
	
	
	Mr Allen’s affidavit is similarly unhelpful in terms of explaining the reason for this application to amend taking so long to be heard that the trial is a matter of months away. Both parties have been aware of the hearing date since these proceedings were set down on 17 August 2016, of the defendants being granted leave to plead these contextual imputations late last year, and that the documents produced under subpoena which led to that amendment say what they say, whether that supports their respective cases or not. (In view of the imminence of the trial it is best not to disclose that information in this judgment).
	
	
	As is set out above, where the facts of the case warrant the making of such a condition, other judges have been prepared to place a proviso upon the granting of leave. Having regard to the evidence here, I am satisfied that this is such a case.
	
	
	For the above reasons, I am satisfied that, having regard to the evidence produced and the issues raised by the defendants in their written submissions, this is a case where leave to amend should be granted, but only upon the conditions sought by the defendants.
	


Costs


	
	There are a number of outstanding costs issues in relation to interlocutory proceedings, as is clear from my orders on 1 December 2016 as set out above. In addition, I reserved the costs of the application in relation to the manner of hearing of these proceedings in my judgment of 5 August 2016.
	
	
	The defendants ask me to determine the costs of that application now. They argue that the plaintiff has sought an indulgence, and that they have been successful in the application, in that the proviso they sought has been granted. The plaintiff could have agreed to this course and avoided both the delay and expense of this argument.
	
	
	These are submissions of considerable persuasive value, and Mr Rasmussen’s submissions were of a perfunctory nature.
	
	
	However, I am of the view, given the imminence of the hearing that this is an appropriate matter to be determined by the trial judge. Accordingly, I reserve all costs issues to the trial judge, including the costs of this application for leave to amend.

He was acquitted of a more serious charge.2    The charges in respect of which he was convicted were Charges 1 and 3.  Charge 1 alleged that the appellant:[b]eing a Defence member in the State of Queensland on 24 April 2014 whilst travelling in a bus bound for Gallipoli Barracks, assaulted 8262392 Sergeant Michael Pithie, a member of the Australian Army who was subordinate to him in rank, by pulling Sergeant Pithie out of his seat.Charge 3 alleged that the appellant:[b]eing a Defence member in the State of Queensland on 24 April 2014 whilst travelling in a bus bound for Gallipoli Barracks, assaulted 8262392 Sergeant Michael Pithie, a member of the Australian Army who was subordinate to him in rank, by kicking Sergeant Michael Pithie whilst Sergeant Michael Pithie lay on the floor of the bus.3    Charge 3 was an alternative to Charge 2, which was the more serious charge of engaging in conduct that is a Territory offence, being assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 24(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT).4    By notice of appeal dated 30 May 2016, the appellant appeals to this Tribunal from his convictions (and seeks leave to do so to the extent necessary) and applies for an extension of time in which to do so.  The respondent Chief of Army does not oppose an extension, under s 21(1)(b) of the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 (Cth) (“the DFDAA”), of the time for appeal until the date on which the notice of appeal was lodged.backgroundFacts5    The DFM made a number of findings, including the following, which he said were not in dispute.6    On 24 April 2014, the appellant, Sergeant Michael Pithie, and other members of 8th/9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment attended the Kilcoy Races, as part of an organised outing by the unit.  While at the Kilcoy Races, Sergeant Pithie, along with some members of the Signals Platoon, consumed too much alcohol and became intoxicated.  When the buses left the Kilcoy Races to take the soldiers back to Gallipoli Barracks, the appellant, Warrant Officer Class Two Iago Walker and at least one other member were left behind, as a result of which one of the buses returned to collect them.  At least one of the members on board the bus had vomited as a consequence of being intoxicated.  Sergeant Pithie was behaving erratically, as a consequence of his intoxication.  7    Warrant Officer Walker and the appellant ended up sitting next to each other on the left-hand side of the bus; Warrant Officer Walker next to the window and the appellant next to the aisle.  Sergeant Pithie was sitting in the same row as them, on the other side of the aisle.  Shortly after the bus departed, Sergeant Pithie was leaning against the seat in front of him, and he began spitting, either on his feet or on the floor adjacent to his feet.  There was some verbal interaction between Sergeant Pithie and Warrant Officer Walker.  Almost immediately after this, the appellant stood up out of his seat and said to Sergeant Pithie, “What the fuck did you say to my CSM [Company Sergeant Major]?” or words to that effect.  He said those words sufficiently loudly that others on the bus could hear.  Sgt Pithie subsequently came to be on the floor of the bus. 8    How Sergeant Pithie came to be on the floor of the bus was the subject of dispute.  The prosecution case was that the appellant crossed the aisle and assaulted Sgt Pithie by lifting him out of his seat.  That conduct was the basis of Charge 1.  The prosecution asserted that, after Sgt Pithie subsequently fell to the ground, the appellant then delivered a number of kicks to the upper body of Sergeant Pithie while he was on the floor of the bus.  Sergeant Pithie sustained a number of injuries, which the DFM found would amount to actual bodily harm.  Sergeant Pithie maintained that he sustained those injuries as a result of the kicking and being half thrown and pushed down the stairwell of the bus by the appellant.  That conduct was the basis of Charge 2.  The DFM was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries were the result of the actions of the appellant.  The appellant was convicted of the alternative charge, Charge 3, the gravamen of which was the kicking of Sergeant Pithie while he lay on the floor of the bus.9    There was evidence that the appellant had called out to the bus driver to stop the bus.  When the bus stopped, Sgt Pithie was assisted off the bus, lay on the grass and was given water.  When the bus and its passengers got back to barracks, Sgt Pithie’s injuries were attended to at the health clinic.The hearing10    At the trial before the DFM, which began on 4 August 2015, some 38 witnesses gave evidence, 33 called by the prosecution and 5 by the appellant.  The appellant was one of those 5 witnesses.  In his detailed reasons for decision on 13 August 2015, comprising about 67 pages of transcript, the DFM carefully summarised and considered the evidence of each witness.11    In relation to Charge 1, the DFM accepted the version given by the appellant as to how Sergeant Pithie came to be removed from his seat.  The appellant gave evidence that he put his hand under the armpit of Sergeant Pithie and lifted him up.  He admitted in cross-examination that, by his actions, he pulled Sergeant Pithie from his seat.  That was an intentional act involving the infliction of force sufficient to constitute an assault.  Counsel for the appellant did not dispute that the appellant had engaged in that conduct; rather, he argued that the appellant was justified in doing so.12    In relation to Charge 3, the appellant said he had no recollection of making contact with Sergeant Pithie using his foot but he conceded that it could have happened.  Much of the cross-examination concerned the level of force used by the appellant, it being put to many of the witnesses that, if there was any contact by the appellant’s foot, it was in the nature of a nudge rather than a kick.13    The DFM concluded that:some 12 of the witnesses, the majority of whom were seated in the rear of the bus at the time of the incident, gave evidence consistent with a finding that they observed the accused kick Sgt Pithie whilst he lay on the floor of the bus.  I accept that the descriptions given by the witnesses is not wholly consistent, either by reference to the number of kicks delivered, the force which was used or the part of the accused’s foot which made contact with Sgt Pithie’s body.14    Although the DFM doubted the reliability of the evidence of some witnesses, on account of their intoxication, he “found the evidence of the witnesses who testified to seeing the accused kicking Sgt Pithie to be honest and reliable, and sufficient to persuade [him] beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did kick Sgt Pithie at least once while he lay on the floor”.  In particular, he accepted the evidence of nine witnesses, whom he named, and who he did not consider had exaggerated their evidence. (One of those nine was Lance Corporal Matthew Maher.)  The DFM said that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant kicked Sgt Pithie at least once whilst he lay on the floor of the bus.  He also said that he was not satisfied that the appellant kicked Sgt Pithie with any great force.  He concluded by saying:In my view, the evidence of the other witnesses, who observed a kick or a kicking motion, is so numerous and so overwhelming that I have no hesitation in preferring their evidence to that of the accused.15    After hearing submissions on sentence, the DFM imposed a reprimand in relation to Charge 1 and a fine of $1500 suspended as to $750 in relation to Charge 3.16    The majority of the prosecution’s witnesses who were on the bus saw the appellant pull Sergeant Pithie from his seat or kick or nudge Sergeant Pithie with his foot when Sergeant Pithie was on the ground, or both, and said that this occurred before the bus stopped.  Only two, one of whom was the appellant, suggested otherwise.  Lance Corporal Joshua Walters said that the bus pulled over before Sergeant Pithie was lifted from his seat, and the appellant said that he instructed the bus driver to stop the bus, and waited for the bus to stop, before he lifted Sergeant Pithie from his seat.  Warrant Officer Walker said that he heard the appellant tell the bus driver to stop the bus but could not recall whether it had stopped at the time when the appellant lifted Sergeant Pithie up.  Certain other witnesses either did not recall the bus being told to stop or did not give evidence as to whether it was in motion at the relevant time.GROUNDS OF APPEAL17    The notice of appeal described five “grounds of appeal” as follows:(a)    That the Defence Force Magistrate failed to take into account the overarching requirement to consider all of the elements of the alleged offending in a true military context.  The appellant’s conduct, in a military context and in the circumstances then presented, was justified.  This constituted a material irregularity in the course of the proceedings and a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.(b)    That the finding of guilt on charges one and three was against the weight of the evidence. (c)    That the Defence Force Magistrate in considering section 10.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code erred in his construction of that exculpatory provision.(d)    That the Defence Force Magistrate in considering section 10.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code erred in finding against the weight of evidence that the appellant had not satisfied the evidential burden for the defence of sudden and extraordinary emergency, and/or, that there was no requirement for the prosecution to negative such a defence beyond reasonable doubt.(e)    That leave be granted to introduce new and/or fresh evidence with consequential orders to flow therefrom.18    By a document dated 2 November 2016 entitled “Amended Appeal”, the appellant sought leave to amend ground (c) and also to add an additional ground (c)(a).  So amended, those grounds would be as follows:  (c)    That the Defence Force Magistrate in considering section 10.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code erred in his construction of that exculpatory provision and by determining that the prosecution had not negatived the defence raised by the appellant.Particulars(i)    That the justification or excuse as referred to therein related to “a law” and not specifically “a law of the Commonwealth”;(ii)     That s 277 Criminal Code (Qld) is such “a law”;(iii)     That s 281 Criminal Code (Qld) is such “a law”;(iv)     That s 10.4(1) and ss (d) and (e) is such “a law” for the purpose of s 10.5.(c)(a)    Alternatively, that pursuant to s 10.4(1) and (2) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, the Defence Force Magistrate erred in failing to find that the defence as set out in s 10.4(2)(d) and (e) had been raised and not negatived by the prosecution.19    What was identified as ground (e) is not in itself a ground of appeal, but an application for leave to introduce fresh evidence, presumably pursuant to DFDAA s 23(2), in aid of ground (b).  That application was abandoned, and rightly so, during oral submissions.  We indicated that we would provide brief reasons in relation to that application, and accordingly we shall do that first.APPLICATION TO CALL FRESH EVIDENCE20    The appellant sought leave to call fresh evidence from himself and his friend Major John Mickle about conversations they had with Lance Corporal Maher at Everton Park Hotel on 26 September 2015.  The evidence was contained in the appellant’s affidavit sworn 9 August 2016 and in an affidavit of Major Mickle sworn 31 August 2016.  21    That evidence was to the effect that Lance Corporal Maher approached the appellant at the hotel and apologised for how everything had turned out following the hearing before the DFM.  The appellant responded by accusing Lance Corporal Maher of lying when he had given evidence that the appellant had kicked Sergeant Pithie when he was on the ground.  Lance Corporal Maher did not concede that he told that or any other lie, but said that he felt under some pressure to give the evidence that he did.  During a later discussion that evening, Lance Corporal Maher told the appellant that he would call the Australian Defence Force (“ADF”) prosecutor the following Monday and tell him that he had perjured himself and that he would “fix the issue”.  22    That did not happen.  Rather, the appellant was subsequently informed by Lance Corporal Maher’s company commander that Lance Corporal Maher told him that “he would not be altering or retracting his statement”.23    In other words, the appellant seeks leave to tender hearsay evidence of what Lance Corporal Maher said to him on 26 September 2015.  When asked whether he could point to any authority to support the contention that hearsay evidence could be used instead of direct evidence from the witness who is said to have recanted his evidence, counsel for the appellant was unable to assist.  He then said that this application would no longer be pursued.24    The following passage from the judgment of Fitzgerald P in R v Bryer (1994) 75 A Crim R 456; [1994] QCA 547 summarises the alternative conditions for setting aside a conviction on the ground of a recantation.  His Honour said, at 458:A conviction is set aside on the basis of a recantation if (i) the witness’s new version of events is sufficiently relevant, cogent and plausible to raise a doubt as to guilt in all the circumstances, including the original evidence and explanations given for the original evidence and the recantation, or (ii) the evidence of the recanting witness is so untrustworthy that it “ought not to be allowed to enter into the reasons for any verdict of guilty”:  Davies and Cody (1937) 57 CLR 170.  In the latter circumstance, it would be inappropriate for the recanting witness to be called in the event of a retrial.25    Clearly it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a tribunal to make these kinds of assessments unless the evidence of the witness is reduced to writing and the witness is available for cross-examination.  The situation is even more complex in the present case because of Lance Corporal Maher’s indication that he would not be altering or retracting his evidence.26    Even if Lance Corporal Maher was compelled to appear before this Tribunal to give evidence, his evidence would not assist the appellant if he adheres to his original testimony.  The appellant would then have to seek and obtain leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Evidence Act”) to cross-examine Lance Corporal Maher as an unfavourable witness in the hope of Lance Corporal Maher accepting as true what the appellant says he said at the hotel and more clearly identifying the alleged lie or lies.  Having regard to factors such as those set out in s 192(2) of the Evidence Act, it is most unlikely that such leave would be given.27    Further, assuming in favour of the appellant that Lance Corporal Maher would now say that he lied when he told the DFM that he saw the appellant kicking Sergeant Pithie, such a recantation would not raise a doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.  There would not have been “a significant possibility that the [DFM], acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before [him]”:  see Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273 (Mason CJ); see also at 275 (Brennan J) and 301–302 (Toohey and Gaudron JJ).  It would not meet the first of the alternatives set out by Fitzgerald P in R v Bryer.  28    We say this because there was an abundance of evidence from other witnesses to the effect that the appellant kicked Sergeant Pithie while he lay on the floor of the bus.  It also follows that, even if Lance Corporal Maher’s evidence before the DFM was disregarded, the result would have been the same.29    Accordingly, we reject the application to adduce fresh evidence and ground (e).MILITARY CONTEXT – GROUND OF APPEAL (A)30    The appellant, at [33] of his Outline of Submissions, contends that the DFM “failed to take into account the framework of military law and discipline when making the findings he did, particularly with respect to its application to the behaviour of individual military personnel [and] most importantly, the behaviour of the complainant”.  His submissions refer to cases such as Re Aird; Ex parte Alpert (2004) 220 CLR 308; [2004] HCA 44 and Re Tracey; Ex parte Ryan (1989) 166 CLR 518 where reference is made to service discipline as relating not only to punishment but also to promote the efficiency and morale of the service.  However, as counsel for the respondent pointed out, these authorities relate to jurisdiction and recognise that the jurisdiction of a service tribunal will always depend upon the offences having a sufficient military context.  31    The appellant also referred to decisions of this Tribunal in Van Damme v Chief of Army [2002)] ADFDAT 2 and Quinn v Chief of Army [2001] ADFDAT 4.  32    Quinn concerned offences of ill-treating a subordinate contrary to s 34 of the DFDA.  At [15] the Tribunal stated that the word “ill-treat” “takes flavour from its context in a statute concerning military discipline” and, at [16], that “whether conduct is ill-treatment … will depend on a careful assessment of all the circumstances, always bearing in mind the military environment in which the question arises”.  As the respondent points out, at [12] of his Submissions, the Tribunal was recognising that “the mere causing of physical pain or mental suffering would not necessarily constitute ill-treatment as service personnel have to be trained to cope mentally and physically with the demands of warfare”.  In such cases, the respondent submitted that “the military purpose and the context in which the events occurred are very relevant considerations”.  This context involves circumstances and concepts quite different to those that would amount to an assault.  An assault, being the unlawful infliction of force (or the apprehension of such force), is no less an assault just because it is committed “in a military context”.33    Van Damme concerned the meaning of the word “assault” in the DFDA and proof of the fault element where the assault comprised threatening words but no physical contact.  The Tribunal noted that the word “assault” is not defined in the DFDA and applied the common law authorities concerning assault, notwithstanding that the conduct occurred in a military context.  34    As the respondent points out, these cases do not stand for the proposition that a superior is authorised to exercise discipline by the use of force, either to compel compliance with a command or as a consequence of a subordinate’s disobedience of a command.  A service member, like any other person, is entitled to be free from bodily interference, subject to any lawful excuse.  Where a service member has disobeyed a lawful command, the appropriate sanction is disciplinary action, not the immediate use of unlawful force.35    Counsel for the appellant stressed the need for the maintenance of discipline and a safe work environment, and submitted, at [36] of the Appellant’s Outline of Submissions, that the appellant found himself confronted with “a drunken and insubordinate Sergeant who failed to comply with a lawful command in circumstances where because of the conditions inside the bus, coupled with the complainant’s extremely intoxicated state, gave rise to workplace health and safety concerns which justified or excused the conduct of pulling him from his seat and trying to move him from the passage inside the coach”.  36    The command referred to is the appellant’s demand that Sergeant Pithie get up from his seat.  This occurred after Sergeant Pithie had said words to the effect of, “What the fuck did you say to my CSM?”, and immediately before the appellant lifted Sergeant Pithie from his seat.  The preponderance of evidence was to the effect that the bus was still in motion while all this was happening.  It is difficult to imagine how it would have been safer for Sergeant Pithie, or anyone else, to require and force him to stand on the moving bus, particularly with vomit on the floor, than to have waited for the bus to stop before requiring him to stand.37    The DFM did consider the military context where relevant.  For example, he considered it in the context of the contentions regarding lawful excuse based upon s 10.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) sch 1 (“Commonwealth Criminal Code”).  However, the “military context” has nothing to do with whether the elements of an assault are established.  This ground of appeal is misconceived.38    Ground (a) is not made out. Finding against the weight of the evidence – ground of appeal (B)39    During oral submissions, counsel for the appellant conceded that this ground effectively does not extend beyond the points made in relation to grounds (c) and (d).  40    As we have pointed out in [11]–[14] above, the weight of the evidence clearly supported the conclusions reached by the DFM.41    Accordingly, ground (b) is not made out.erroneous construction of s 10.5 – ground of appeal (c)42    Section 10.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code provides that “a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the conduct constituting the offence is justified or excused by or under a law”. The Dictionary to the Code provides that “law” means “a law of the Commonwealth, and includes this Code”.43    The DFM said:Dealing first with the defence of lawful authority, no authority was cited to me supporting the submission.  Section 10.5 provides that:A person is not criminal [sic] responsible for an offence if the conduct constituting the offence is justified or excused under a law.  “Law” is defined under the Criminal Code to mean the law of the Commonwealth.44    The appellant makes two complaints about the last sentence quoted above: first, that s 10.5 refers to “a law”, not “the law”; and secondly, that the DFM should not have applied the definition of “law” in the Code.  In relation to the first point, the reference to “the law” was clearly a minor slip which had no relevant bearing upon the DFM’s approach to the matter.  As we have noted (in [47] below) the DFM proceeded to consider whether there was “a law” that fell within the scope of s 10.5.  45    The second point was of no consequence, as the DFM was only asked to consider and apply s 9 of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) and ss 28 and 29 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth), which are both clearly laws of the Commonwealth.  No reference was made before the DFM to the provisions now relied upon, namely Defence Instruction (General) Personnel 35-3 titled Management and Reporting of Unacceptable Behaviour (“DI(G) PERS 35-3”) and, belatedly after this Tribunal had heard submissions and reserved its decision, ss 277 and 281 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) sch 1 (“Queensland Criminal Code”).46    The DFM summarised counsel’s submission to be that:the circumstances which confronted the accused, which involved a drunken and insubordinate sergeant, who had failed to comply with a lawful command to stand up, and which occurred in circumstances where, because of the conditions inside the bus, coupled with Sgt Pithie’s extremely intoxicated state, gave rise to workplace health and safety concerns which justified or excused the accused’s conduct of pulling Sgt Pithie from his seat, under section 10.5.47    The DFM rejected that submission.  He said that the application of s 10.5 “is dependent on a law of the Commonwealth, expressly providing a justification or excuse.”  He referred to s 15KN of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the example referred to in [10.5.100] of Principles of Federal Criminal Law, Stephen Odgers, 3rd edition (2015) (“Odgers”).  He said that:neither section 9 of the Defence Act, which relates to command of the Defence Force,  or sections 28 and 29 of the Workplace Health and Safety Act [sic], which impose certain duties on workers and others in a workplace, can be interpreted as providing a justification or excuse as contemplated under section 10.5.  To put it another way, the argument seems to be that, if an officer gives a subordinate a lawful command which is then disobeyed, the officer would be entitled to resort to using physical coercion on the subordinate in order to get them to comply with the order.  That, in my view cannot be accepted.  I therefore find that the accused has not satisfied the evidential burden of raising a defence under s 10.5 and that he has no defence available to him under that section.Meaning of “law” in s 10.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code48    In the document dated 2 November 2016 entitled “Amended Appeal”, the appellant particularised three “laws” said to be laws within the meaning of s 10.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code: s 277 of the Queensland Criminal Code; s 281 of the Queensland Criminal Code; and “s 10.4(1) and ss (d) and (e)” of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.  We take the third reference as being to ss 10.4(2)(d) and 10.4(2)(e) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.49    The appellant contends that the DFM erred in his construction of s 10.5 because he wrongly applied the definition of “law” as it appears in the Dictionary to the Code.  He should have had regard to the words “a law” and thus not confined himself to laws of the Commonwealth that might provide justification or excuse.  Counsel did not provide any relevant authority in support of this contention.  50    Rather, he submitted that had Parliament intended to confine this defence to laws of the Commonwealth it would have expressly said so in s 10.5.  We reject this submission.  The fundamental function of the Dictionary is to define and give content to words such as this word, namely “law”, which are frequently referred to in the statute.  Where Parliament has found it necessary to distinguish between a law of the kind defined in the Dictionary and some other law, it has done so in clear terms.  An example of that is s 4.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which expressly refers to “the law” in one part (s 4.3(a)) and “a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or … common law” in another (s 4.3(b)).51    In addition, in the Appellant’s Amended Outline of Submissions, counsel, referring to the uncontroversial fact that State laws will continue to operate in conjunction with Commonwealth laws provided that there is no relevant inconsistency, submitted that a justification or excuse provided under a State law would fall within the scope of “a law” of the kind referred to in s 10.5.  52    Such a construction would lead to all manner of anomalies and uncertainties, depending upon where the alleged offence was committed.  In particular, conduct that might be “lawful” (in the sense of “justified”, “excused”, “authorised” or “necessary”, to identify common “defences” under a Code or at common law) in one State or Territory might not be so in another.  It would be odd if, and cannot have been intended by Parliament that, conduct that would otherwise constitute a Commonwealth offence would be criminal if committed in one State or Territory but not if committed in another State or Territory.53    Further, as the respondent has pointed out, s 10.5 is contained in Division 10 of Part 2.3 of Chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.  Part 2.3 provides for circumstances in which there is no criminal responsibility, and Division 10 specifically provides for “circumstances involving external factors”.  Division 10 comprises sections headed “10.1 Intervening conduct or event”, “10.2 Duress”, “10.3 Sudden or extraordinary emergency”, “10.4 Self-defence” and “10.5 Lawful authority”.54    The purpose of Chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code is to provide for the general principles of criminal responsibility that apply under “laws of the Commonwealth”.  Section 2.1 provides that:The purpose of this Chapter is to codify the general principles of criminal responsibility under laws of the Commonwealth.  It contains all the general principles of criminal responsibility that apply to any offence, irrespective of how the offence is created.55    The respondent submitted, and we agree, that there are no textual or contextual features of s 10.5 that would support the appellant’s construction that a Queensland statutory provision can be “a law” for the purposes of s 10.5.  On the contrary, the appellant’s submissions, in effect, provide a construction of the legislation that is at odds with the internal logical consistency and overall consistency of the legislation. 56    As was observed in Independent Commission Against Corruption v Cunneen (2015) 256 CLR 1 at 22; [2015] HCA 14 at [35] (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Nettle JJ):The best that can be done is to reason in terms of relative consistency — internal logical consistency and overall consistency in accordance with the principles of statutory interpretation adumbrated in Project Blue Sky — to determine which of the two competing constructions of “adversely affect” is more harmonious overall.57    If the purpose of Chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code is to provide for the principles of criminal responsibility for offences to which Chapter 2 applies (such as DFDA s 34(1), which is subject to the Code by virtue of s 10 of the DFDA), then construing s 10.5 as applying to Queensland provisions would promote a logical inconsistency within Chapter 2.58    In his original submissions, the respondent referred to part of page 233 of The Commonwealth Criminal Code: A Guide for Practitioners, a document published in 2002 by the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department in association with the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration.  Page 233 relevantly states in relation to s 10.5: Accordingly it was necessary to provide a general defence which will excuse or justify conduct which is authorised by law.  The law in question must be a law of the Commonwealth: Dictionary.  Typical examples for an application of s 10.5 are those provisions which confer investigatory powers on police and other officials, and permits for the import or manufacture weapons, explosives or drugs … &c.  The reference to conduct which is justified or excused “by or under a law” recognises that the authorisation may be indirect or implied, rather than explicit.  (Citations omitted.  Emphasis added.)59    Although no authority was cited in support of the sentence italicised in the passage quoted above, such an inference has also been drawn by other learned authors such as Odgers (at [10.5.100]) and Watson & Watson, Australian Criminal Law: Federal Offences, at [10.4620].60    We agree with the conclusion that a law referred to in s 10.5 must be a law of the Commonwealth.61    As Gleeson CJ and Gummow J said in Re Colina; Ex parte Torney (1999) 200 CLR 386 at 397; [1999] HCA 57 at [25] (“Re Colina”), in the context of s 80 of the Constitution: The term “law of the Commonwealth” refers to laws made under the legislative powers of the Commonwealth.  This meaning is settled by a long line of authority.(Citations omitted.)62    Their Honours referred to the following cases as examples of this line of authority: R v Bernasconi (1915) 19 CLR 629 at 635; Jerger v Pearce (1920) 27 CLR 526 at 531; Commonwealth v Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Co Ltd (1922) 31 CLR 421 at 431; Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 91–92; Western Australia v The Commonwealth (1995) 183 CLR 373 at 436–437.63    In Re Colina, McHugh J said at 402 [45]: “A law of the Commonwealth is simply a law made under or by the authority of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.”64    Sections 277 and 281 of the Queensland Criminal Code are not laws of the Commonwealth.  They are laws of a State.  These provisions therefore cannot provide the appellant the requisite justification or excuse to the offence of assaulting a subordinate contrary to s 34(1) of the DFDA.Defence Instruction (General) Personnel 35-365    Because neither DI(G) PERS 35-3 nor any other similar instrument was referred to by the appellant at his trial before the DFM, in his petition to the reviewing authority, or in his request for a further review by the Chief of Army, this issue arose for the first time when the appellant provided the Appellant’s Outline of Submissions for the purpose of this appeal.  Counsel for the appellant was wrong to complain at [44] of the Appellant’s Outline of Submissions, that “the learned DFM did not take into account this relevant instruction in the emerging situation that occurred”.66    With reference to s 10.5, counsel for the appellant contended at [40] of the Appellant’s Outline of Submissions:The maintenance of discipline would constitute such justification.  In addition, the restraint of a person by virtue of the common law with such person presenting in a mischievous, disrespectful, and manner that was insubordinate or otherwise hitherto, lacked discipline in the ADF is both consistent with a civilian arrest is [sic] a “or and or” [sic], restrained [sic] placed upon an individual by a Commanding Officer in a situation of emergency is “a law” deriving its genesis from the Defence Act 1903 and subordinate instructions such as DI(G) PERS 35-3.  67    Counsel for the appellant submitted that Defence Instructions issued for the purposes of the administration of the Defence Force pursuant to s 11 of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) have the force of law.  The respondent has not suggested otherwise or that Defence Instructions are not laws of the Commonwealth.  68    Counsel for the appellant referred to parts of DI(G) PERS 35-3, such as clause 13, which says that “defence personnel have a responsibility to take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety of themselves and others in the workplace”, and clause 14, which includes a statement that “[s]upervisors will be accountable for … taking all reasonably practicable action to prevent unacceptable behaviour in the workplace”.  The appellant also referred to clause 15, which relevantly provides that Commanders and managers must also “manage and report all unacceptable behaviour complaints promptly and impartially in accordance with this Instruction”.69    We do not consider these to be laws of the kind contemplated in s 10.5.  They are, in effect, aspirational statements of policy, not provisions which purport to justify or excuse conduct that would otherwise constitute an offence.  In any event, “reasonably practicable action” would not include action that is unlawful.  Thus a supervisor could not, in reliance on DI(G) PERS 35-3, physically restrain an unruly worker in handcuffs or detain him or her in a locked room without lawful authority, such as a warrant.70    Odgers identifies, at [10.5.100], s 15KN of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) as an example of a statutory justification within the meaning of s 10.5.  That section provides:15KN Protection from criminal liability – officers of issuing agenciesThe chief officer, or an officer, of an issuing agency who does something that, apart from his section, would be a Commonwealth offence or an offence against a law of a State or Territory, is not criminally responsible for the offence if the thing is done to comply with a request under section 15KI or a direction under section 15KL.71    Odgers also provides, at [10.5.100], an example of a statutory excuse, namely s 105.21(3) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which provides that the provision in that Code making it an offence for a person to refuse or fail to comply with the request of a police officer to provide the person’s name and address “does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse”.72    Counsel for the appellant also contended, at [45] of the Appellant’s Outline of Submissions, that the circumstances that confronted the appellant “gave rise to a workplace health & safety concern which justified or excused the conduct of pulling Sergeant Pithie from his seat (under s 10.5)”.  Not only is this wrong as a matter of law, it is difficult to imagine how workplace health and safety could have been better served by the appellant acting as he did, namely by lifting and kicking Sergeant Pithie on a moving bus with vomit on the floor, than it would have been by leaving Sergeant Pithie in his seat, at least until the bus stopped.Ground (c)(iv)73    Although the appellant has purported to add, without requesting or obtaining leave prior to or at the hearing, a further particular relying upon the self-defence provisions in s 10.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, and in particular in ss 10.4(2)(d) and (e), as being laws for the purposes of s 10.5, no assistance has been provided to this Tribunal by way of submissions on that point.  74    We will deal with the defences raised under s 10.4 later in these reasons.Conclusions75    None of the laws to which the appellant has referred, either before the DFM or in this Tribunal, are laws of the kind that could have applied under s 10.5 in order to justify or excuse his conduct.76    Assuming that the appellant did order Sergeant Pithie to stand up, and assuming that such an order was lawful, no law of the Commonwealth authorised the use of force amounting to an assault to procure compliance with it.  (There is no suggestion that the appellant was exercising a power of arrest without warrant under s 89 of the DFDA, in connection with which use of reasonable force might have been permissible, having regard to s 92 of the DFDA.)sudden or extraordinary emergency – ground of appeal (d)77    The appellant contends, at page 14 of his Outline of Submissions, that the DFM erred in finding “against the weight of evidence that a defence of sudden extraordinary emergency had not been raised and/or the prosecution had not negatived such defence beyond reasonable doubt pursuant to s 10.3”.78    Section 10.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code provides:(1)    A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency.(2)    This section applies if and only if the person carrying out the conduct reasonably believes that:(a)    circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency exists; and(b)    committing the offence is the only reasonable way to deal with the emergency; and(c)    the conduct is a reasonable response to the emergency.79    This defence was also only raised in passing by the defending officer during closing submissions before the DFM, and even then (at least explicitly) only in relation to Charge 1.  He said:Also could you look at sudden and extraordinary emergency at 10.3?  He hasn’t raised what codified laws would normal [sic] consider to be an extraordinary emergency but certainly there are cases that go so far as to say that the emergency doesn’t have to be life or death. He had a situation where no one was doing anything and reacting to it. To that extent, it was an emergency. He wanted the bus stopped to get him off, that’s certainly consistent with an emergency, and he did what he had to do to effect that; that is, pick the man up.80    Before us, the appellant submitted, at [51] of the Appellant’s Outline of Submissions, that:the appellant presented evidence identifying that the commission of the offence of which he had been convicted was the only reasonable way to deal with the alleged sudden or extraordinary emergency, and that his conduct in constituting the offence was of [sic] reasonable response to the emergency.  This taken, with the overall res gestae of the events and circumstances that were taking place at the relevant time aboard the bus could readily be identified by the following …81    The submission at [51] proceeded to refer to a number of circumstances, namely that: the appellant had boarded the bus and noted that a number of individuals were very drunk; he was required as a supervisor and as an officer commanding to exercise management, care and discipline; a number of people had been physically sick on the bus; in particular, Sergeant Pithie “was behaving in a particularly irrational and intoxicated manner, which was both in any objective view unhealthy and comprised [sic] the position in so far as workplace, health & safety was concerned, a severe health danger and concern”; Sergeant Pithie’s actions “were non-compliant with DI(G) PERS 35-3 contravening the standards applicable to service personnel and in particular the orders of his Commanding Officer, with respect to consumption of alcohol and behaviour generally”; Sergeant Pithie posed a risk both to himself and others; and that “a senior Non-Commissioned Officer, including a Warrant Officer did nothing to assist in administering or at least condemning or disciplining the behaviour of Pithie”.  The submission continued at [52] as follows:The appellant called out “stop the bus”, and taken in the context of things, all happened very quickly.  The appellant reasonably perceived that the situation existed that he had to deal with was vital and bearing in mind the competing factors, he had to administer regularity, discipline and appropriate supervision for the health and well-being of others.82    The DFM concluded:Likewise, in my view, the accused cannot avail himself of a defence under s 10.3 of the Criminal Code because, on any view of the circumstances confronting him on the bus, there was no sudden or extraordinary emergency which then justified him pulling Sgt Pithie from his seat.  I find the accused also has not satisfied the evidential burden in raising a defence on the evidence.83    We agree with these conclusions.  We also agree with the following submissions made by the respondent.84    In Parker v Chief of Air Force [2010] ADFDAT 2, the members of this Tribunal were required to consider whether a factual foundation for the operation of the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency had been established.  Parker was prosecuted for causing grievous bodily harm to LAC Hawkins when she struck him with the motor vehicle that she was driving.  Parker and Hawkins had been involved in several verbal confrontations that evening.  When she went to get into her car, Hawkins continued to confront her, including by banging on the vehicle and on the driver’s side window after she had locked herself in her car for protection.  85    After reviewing the law regarding the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency, the Tribunal expressed the following conclusion at [98]:In order for the defence of sudden or extraordinary emergency (or necessity) to be available to the appellant it was necessary for the Court to be satisfied that when she commenced to drive from the car park to the accommodation block, she was facing “an imminent peril”.  This would only be the case if she believed on reasonable grounds that she confronted a threat of death or serious injury from LAC Hawkins.86    At [83], the Tribunal found that “[t]here was no dispute that Hawkins [the complainant] had behaved objectionably towards the appellant”.  The respondent submitted, at [54] of his Submissions, that similar circumstances exist in the present case, though in Parker, the victim actually posed a real and physical threat to the appellant. In this case, Sergeant Pithie never posed a threat to the appellant and there was no imminent peril which required the appellant to pull Sergeant Pithie from his seat on the moving bus, let alone to kick him. As the respondent submitted, at [54], the sole basis for the appellant’s conduct in relation to Charge 1 was that, as he said at trial, he “had an extremely intoxicated individual who was not complying with any orders. [His] only wish at that point was to have him removed from the bus”.87    A person who wishes to escape criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of Part 2.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code (other than s 7.3) bears an “evidential burden” in relation to that matter: Commonwealth Criminal Code s 13.3(2).  The term “evidential burden” is defined to mean “the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist”:  Commonwealth Criminal Code s 13.3(6).  88    This issue, in the context of s 10.3 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, was considered by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia, by Buss JA (McLure P and Mazza JA agreeing), in Ajayi v The Queen (2012) 263 FLR 465; [2012] WASCA 126.  In that case, the appellant, charged with the transporting of prohibited drugs to Australia, maintained that she did this under duress, or alternatively in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency.  The duress comprised the threat of physical danger to her immediate family if she did not comply with the request to transport the drugs.  The extraordinary emergency was the existence of physical danger to her immediate family if she did not transport the drugs.89    Buss JA discussed in some detail the genesis of Chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, and in particular ss 10.2 and 10.3, namely the report of the Criminal Law Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (“the Committee”) entitled Model Criminal Code Chapter 2:  General Principles of Criminal Responsibility, Final Report (1992).  At 468 [28], his Honour  said:Section 10.3 was … enacted in the form recommended by the Committee.  The Committee’s commentary on the draft provision which became s 10.3 reads (at p 67):This section recognises that an accused person is excused from committing what would otherwise be a criminal act in very limited circumstances.  Like duress, the necessity of the occasion and the response to it are both subject to an objective test.  The Committee’s proposal is an amalgam of the principles underlying the common law of necessity and the Griffith Code equivalent.(Emphasis added.)90    His Honour continued at 468–469 [31]–[35]:31    Section 10.3(2) specifies the elements of the defence.  If the accused satisfies the evidential burden in relation to each of the elements (see s 13.3) and the Crown fails to negative beyond reasonable doubt at least one of the elements (see ss 13.1 and 13.2), then the accused will be taken to have carried out the conduct constituting the offence in response to circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency within s 10.3(1).32    As to s 10.3(2)(a), it is an element of the defence that, at the material time, the accused reasonably believed that “circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency [existed]”.  This element incorporates a subjective component and an objective component.  The subjective component is the existence of a belief by the accused that circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency existed.  The objective component is that any such subjective belief by the accused must have been reasonable.33    It is unnecessary for an emergency to be both sudden and extraordinary.  The emergency may be either sudden or extraordinary:  see Nguyen v The Queen [2005] WASCA 22 at [17] (Templeman J, Murray J agreeing and McLure J agreeing generally).  34    However, the concepts of a “sudden” emergency and an “extraordinary” emergency may, in a particular case, overlap.  That is, an emergency may, in a particular case, be both “sudden” and “extraordinary”'.35    The phrase “sudden or extraordinary emergency” in s 10.3 bears its natural and ordinary meaning.  This is apparent from the statutory text and the decision of the Parliament not to define the phrase or any of the words that comprise it.91    At 469 [40], Buss JA summarised what the Court of Appeal had said previously in Nguyen v The Queen [2005] WASCA 22 about s 10.3: (a)    It may be relevant, in deciding whether an emergency is sudden or extraordinary, to have regard to the time which elapsed between the accused becoming aware of the emergency, on the one hand, and his or her acting in response to it, on the other.  However, delay is not a ‘determinative factor’.(b)    The Crown cannot negative the defence by proving that no sudden or extraordinary emergency in fact existed.  Although the absence of an actual sudden or extraordinary emergency may be a relevant factor, the ultimate question is whether the accused reasonably believed, in terms of s 10.3(2)(a), that circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency existed.  See [17] [of Nguyen v The Queen [2005] WASCA 22].92    In Nguyen at [17], Templeman J (Murray J agreeing, and McLure J agreeing generally) had made the following observations about s 10.3:(a)     The circumstances in which the defence may be raised include a sudden emergency or an extraordinary emergency. It is not necessary for the emergency to be both sudden and extraordinary.(b)     In determining whether an emergency is sudden or extraordinary it may be relevant to have regard to the time which elapsed between the offender becoming aware of the emergency and his or her acting in response to it. However, delay is not a determinative factor.(c)     The prosecution cannot exclude the defence by proving that no sudden or extraordinary emergency actually existed. Although that fact may be relevant, the ultimate question is whether the offender reasonably believed in the existence of the emergency.93    Buss JA proceeded to explain that, similar to what he had said at [32] about s 10.3(2)(a), the elements in ss 10.3(2)(b) and 10.3(2)(c) involve not only a subjective element concerning the belief of the accused but also an objective component concerning the reasonableness of such belief:  at 470 [41]–[42].94    Buss JA gave two reasons for rejecting the appellant’s contentions that she had any factual basis for a defence under s 10.3.  At 472 [50], his Honour stated:First, the appellant did not satisfy the evidential burden in relation to those objective elements of s 10.3(2) which required it to have been reasonable for her subjectively to believe that:(a)    committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the alleged sudden or extraordinary emergency; or(b)    the conduct constituting the offence was a reasonable response to the alleged emergency.(Emphasis in original.)95    His Honour referred to a number of decisions which refer to notions of public policy which should be taken into account when considering the reasonableness of conduct said to have occurred in response to a sudden or extraordinary emergency.  One such decision was R v Rogers (1996) 86 A Crim R 542, where the appellant was convicted of attempting to escape from lawful custody.  He alleged that he had attempted to escape from prison because he feared a life-threatening attack was going to be committed on him and he declined to be placed in protection by the prison authorities because he considered that would place him in greater danger.  Gleeson CJ (Clarke JA and Ireland J agreeing) observed at 546 that:[t]he corollary of the notion that the defence of necessity exists to meet cases where the circumstances overwhelmingly impel disobedience to the law is that the law cannot leave people free to choose for themselves which laws they will obey, or to construct and apply their own set of values inconsistent with those implicit in the law.  Nor can the law encourage juries to exercise a power to dispense with compliance with the law where they consider disobedience to be reasonable, on the ground that the conduct of an accused person serves some value higher than that implicit in the law which is disobeyed.96    At 473 [53]–[54], Buss JA continued:53    In the present case, on the evidence as a whole, it was not open to the jury to find, as a reasonable possibility, that at the material time the appellant reasonably believed that:(a)    committing the offence was the only reasonable way to deal with the alleged sudden or extraordinary emergency; or(b)    the conduct constituting the offence was a reasonable response to the alleged emergency.54    At the material time, and on the evidence as a whole, the only reasonable belief open to the appellant, in relation to the factual basis for the alleged sudden or extraordinary emergency, was that reporting the relevant facts and circumstances:(a)    to the authorities (for example, at Perth International Airport immediately upon her arrival); (b)    further or alternatively, to the captain or senior purser of the aircraft while it was in transit to Perth, was a reasonable way to deal with the alleged emergency, further or alternatively, a reasonable response to the alleged emergency.(Emphasis in original.)97    As the respondent has pointed out, the appellant referred to various circumstances which he submits supports the contention that the evidential burden in s 10.3 was met.  We have summarised them in [80]–[81] above.  There is nothing to indicate how the appellant believed, reasonably or at all, that there was an emergency in the relevant sense (such as a person’s life or safety being in peril), let alone such an emergency as could only be addressed by pulling Sergeant Pithie from his seat, while the bus was still in motion, and kicking him on the floor.  98    Objectively, there was no emergency that made it reasonable for the appellant to pull Sergeant Pithie from his seat at all, let alone while the bus was moving and Sergeant Pithie was so intoxicated.  Indeed the unreasonableness of him doing this in those circumstances was demonstrated by what happened next, namely Sergeant Pithie falling to the floor.  Nor was there any emergency that made it reasonable for the appellant to kick Sergeant Pithie when he was on the ground.99    In our view, the appellant did not satisfy his evidentiary burden in relation to any of the requirements in ss 10.3(2)(a), (b) and (c), let alone all three of them.self-defence – ground of appeal (c)(a)100    The appellant contends that the DFM erred by failing to find that the prosecution had failed to negative self-defence of the kind referred to in ss 10.4(2)(d) and (e), after such a defence had been raised by the appellant.  101    Those provisions provide that a person is excused from criminal responsibility for conduct that would otherwise be criminal if he or she believed that his or her conduct was necessary to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises (s 10.4(2)(d)), or to remove from any land or premises a person who was committing a criminal trespass (s 10.4(2)(e)).  Like s 10.3, s 10.4 also contains subjective elements concerning the belief of the accused, and an objective requirement that the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceived them.102    As we have noted, this ground was raised after the Tribunal had concluded the hearing of the appeal.  As is the case with grounds (c) and (d), this is a matter that, if it were to be relied upon, ought to have been raised before the DFM.  This would have been particularly important in relation to this ground, because had it been raised then, the evidence and case may have taken a different course.  For example, it might have been expected that the appellant would have been cross-examined as to his actual belief as to whether Sergeant Pithie was committing or was about to commit a criminal trespass, and whether he believed that it was necessary to pull Sergeant Pithie from his seat while the bus were still moving, in order to prevent any such criminal trespass.103    For those reasons, there is a strong case that leave to add that ground at this late stage should be refused.  However, it is preferable to dispose of the ground on the merits.104    The appellant contends that Sergeant Pithie became a trespasser because his tenure aboard the bus had been terminated following his failure to obey a lawful command.  The Appellant’s Amended Outline of Submissions at [46H] state as follows: His insubordination and failure to remove himself, get up or otherwise handle himself in a fashion, the subject of direct order, and remove himself off the bus put him in the position as a trespasser as at and from the time of the command.105    Counsel for the appellant has not provided any authority to support the contention that such conduct could amount to trespass — let alone criminal trespass.  The appellant would need to at least demonstrate that he believed his conduct was necessary either to prevent Sergeant Pithie committing criminal trespass or to remove him because he was committing such a crime.106    Secondly, even if the appellant believed that Sergeant Pithie was engaged in criminal trespass, we doubt that the bus would fall within the scope of “land” or “premises”; rather, it is a “vehicle”.  107    Thirdly, even if the appellant believed that Sergeant Pithie was trespassing and “premises” included a bus, before resorting to force to remove a trespasser, the appellant would have been required to give a direction to Sergeant Pithie to leave and then give him a reasonable opportunity to comply with that direction.  We agree with the respondent that, on any view of the facts, the appellant removed Sergeant Pithie from his seat before he could have been expected to comply with any direction given.  And in any event, the administration of a kick, even of only moderate force, exceeded what could reasonably have been considered a reasonable response. 108    Accordingly, this ground also fails.CONCLUSION109    We grant the extension of time required in order for the notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal to be lodged.  We also grant leave to appeal to the extent necessary.  None of the grounds has been made out.  The appeal must be dismissed.I certify that the preceding one hundred and nine (109) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Decision herein of the Honourable Justices Tracey (President), Brereton and Hiley (Members).Associate: Dated:    28 April 2017",2017-04-28 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

THE COURT NOTES THAT: 8.    The ground for order 7 is that it is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. Note:    Entry of orders is dealt with in Rule 39.32 of the Federal Court Rules 2011.REASONS FOR JUDGMENT(REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT)RARES J:1    Peter Gregg, the applicant, has filed this interlocutory application for a stay of these proceedings until the determination of two criminal charges brought against him by an informant on behalf of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).  The two criminal charges were proferred in a court attendance notice that came before the Local Court of New South Wales on 31 January 2017.  The charges alleged that Mr Gregg contravened s 1307(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as an officer of Leighton Holdings Limited by engaging in conduct that resulted in the falsification of books affecting or relating to the affairs of Leighton in two ways, first, a payment instruction relating to two payments to be made to Asian Global Projects and Trading FZE in the total sum on USD15,000,000, and,  secondly, an agreement to buy and sell between Leighton and Asian Global dated 1 August 2011.  A person is liable on conviction for a contravention of s 1307(1) to a fine of 100 penalty units or imprisonment for two years, or both, and such proceedings can, and are likely to, be prosecuted on indictment.Background2    It is common ground that the subject matter of those two charges forms one of the principal bases of the substantive defence of justification pleaded by the respondents, Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited and its associated companies, The Age Company Pty Limited and the Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited (collectively Fairfax).  Fairfax pleaded in par 127 of the further amended defence that Mr Gregg contravened s 1307(1) in substantively the same way as ASIC has alleged in the two counts the subject of the criminal charges.3    On 2 February 2016, I made suppression and non-publication orders in respect of a document produced by ASIC in partial answer to a subpoena that Fairfax had served on it and I deferred the question of access to the document to today.  In addition, I ordered that the unanswered portion of that subpoena be stood over to 15 February 2017 before the Registrar.  That portion required ASIC, in substance, to produce the prosecution brief that, with the exception of one document, it had provided to Mr Gregg’s legal representatives in the Local Court proceedings on 31 January 2017.  In addition, on 2 February 2017, PwC Strategy& (Australia) Pty Limited also produced documents in answer to another subpoena issued at the request of Fairfax.  I also deferred the issue of access to those documents.  I also stood over to 15 February 2017, before the Registrar, a third subpoena issued to CIMIC Group Limited, which is the new name by which Leighton is now known.4    It is common ground that these civil proceedings should be stayed until the determination of the criminal charges against Mr Gregg, but the parties are in dispute as to whether, as Fairfax wishes, the stay should be fashioned so as to permit Fairfax, first, to have access to the documents already produced by ASIC and PwC, and secondly, to require ASIC to produce the documents comprising the prosecution brief that it delivered to Mr Gregg in the criminal proceedings on 31 January 2017.  Fairfax does not seek that the CIMIC subpoena be called on before the stay ceases.5    The subject matter of the charges and, indeed, the matters complained of in the proceedings have been the subject of extensive publicity.  Upon being served with the court attendance notice earlier in January 2017, Mr Gregg resigned his positions as managing director and chief executive officer of another public listed company, which then made an announcement to the Australian Securities Exchange of his resignation and the fact of his facing charges.6    I noted when I made the orders for suppression and non-publication in relation to the document produced by ASIC on 2 February 2017 and of certain portions of the evidence and submissions on which ASIC relied in support of the making of those orders, that those orders were necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice:  see s 37AF(1)(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).  That necessity, of course, arose in the context of the criminal proceedings and the overlap of issues in those proceedings and the present civil proceedings.7    On 27 September 2016, I made a number of orders preparing this matter for the trial that I fixed for hearing, with an estimate of four weeks, commencing on 4 September 2017.  Those included order 12, that required Mr Gregg to serve outlines of evidence of any lay witnesses on which he proposed to rely, including himself.  Mr Gregg’s solicitor, Paul Svilans, has given evidence that Mr Gregg had intended, but for the intervening pendency of the criminal charges, to serve in his case in chief his own outline of evidence.  Clearly any such outline, if now served, would have the capacity to traverse issues the subject of the criminal charges, and any compulsion, under order 12, for him to do so would undermine his common law right to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination.8    The substantive overlap of issues involving whether Mr Gregg had acted in contravention of s 1307(1) in both these civil proceedings and the criminal proceedings is obvious.  To require Mr Gregg to continue to prepare this civil matter for trial and to participate, under compulsion of the orders made on 27 September 2016 to do so, would not be in the interests of justice, because it would impinge on his important common law rights not to incriminate himself or to reveal how, and in what way, he may wish to defend himself against the criminal charges.9    Moreover, there is an overlap of issues between both proceedings, notwithstanding that there are also wider, but related, allegations of criminal conduct alleged in Fairfax’ defence of justification.  If these civil proceedings were to proceed concurrently with the criminal proceedings, there are real prospects that:    Mr Gregg may have to disclose information in the course of pursuing the civil proceedings that he could not be compelled to disclose in criminal proceedings;    disclosures or attempts to obtain statements or other evidence that Mr Gregg, Fairfax or persons under subpoena might make in the further conduct of these proceedings might influence witnesses in the criminal proceedings by alerting them to matters that they were not otherwise aware of;    were there to be a continuation of these civil proceedings with its attendant publicity, that might influence persons who were, or might become, members of a jury or jury panel if the criminal charges are prosecuted on indictment;  and    this might lead to public speculation or conclusions about the criminal proceedings that would not be in the interests of justice.10    Those factors, doubtless, informed the considerations of Fairfax in accepting the appropriateness of a form of stay, including an order vacating the orders of 27 September 2016 for the preparation of this matter for trial and the hearing date of the trial.Fairfax’ submissions11    However, Fairfax argued, but led no evidence, that I should make an order that it have access to the documents produced by ASIC and PwC on 2 February 2017, and that I should continue to require ASIC to answer the balance of the subpoena to it on 15 February 2017.  It also argued that Mr Gregg’s written submissions on this application had changed the forensic context significantly.  That was, Fairfax contended, because those submissions included an argument that, were Mr Gregg convicted, Fairfax would be entitled to rely on s 42 of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) in relation to that conviction, to the extent that it was relevant, which in turn might lead to a potential shortening of these proceedings and a substantial saving of time and costs.  Senior counsel for Mr Gregg retorted that, notwithstanding his own words in his written submissions, if it transpired that Mr Gregg were convicted on the counts charged, these proceedings effectively would not proceed.12    Fairfax argued that it did not have any onus to establish why the orders it sought for access and further production should be made.  But, Fairfax submitted in any event, that, if it did have such an onus, it would use the documents to which it were given access in order to update its own current knowledge and understanding of the material now in its possession while that material was relatively fresh in counsel’s and solicitor’s minds, particularly having regard to the extensive work that had been done in preparing the current version of the defence of justification as extensively and thoroughly as it had.13    Fairfax also said that it wishes to be able to use information that emerged from any such documents within the constraints of the implied undertaking not to use documents or information produced under the compulsory processes of the Court in civil proceedings for a purpose other than that for which the documents were produced or the information obtained:  see Hearne v Street (2008) 235 CLR 125.  Fairfax argued that, by being able to have access to those further documents, not only would it be able to correlate the information in them to its current understanding of the material already in its possession, but it would also be able to pursue enquiries, including of witnesses, consistently with its obligation under the implied undertaking in circumstances where there was no evidence that, in doing so, such action had the capacity to interfere in or to prejudice the administration of justice in the criminal proceedings.  It argued that access to the further documents would enable it more effectively, should it choose to do so, to interview witnesses responsibly in a way consistent with its obligations in the use of documents obtained under compulsory process and the suppression and non-publication orders that I made in respect of the documents produced by ASIC.  It argued that the Court had power to condition any stay so as to fashion it consistently with the purposes both for which a stay was granted and Fairfax’ interest in the proceedings, relying on observations by the Court of Appeal in Tringali v Stewardson Stubbs & Collett Ltd (1966) 66 SR (NSW) 335 at 344, and the approach that Waddell J took in a claim for stay of civil proceedings where there were concurrent criminal proceedings in Beecee Group Ltd v Barton (1980) 5 ACLR 33.14    Fairfax contended that it was entitled to expect that, in the ordinary course, it would be granted access to the documents produced by ASIC and PwC, to expect the enforcement of the balance of the subpoena by ASIC and subsequently that it would granted the right to inspect those documents in accordance with what Moffitt P said in National Employers’ Mutual General Association Limited v Waind and Hill [1978] 1 NSWLR 372 at 383-384.  It also relied on what Jagot J said in Ransley v Commissioner of Taxation [2016] FCA 778 at [22].  Her Honour observed that it was necessary for an applicant for a stay, on the ground that there were pending concurrent criminal proceedings, to demonstrate real prejudice to justify the grant of the stay and that the mere existence of criminal proceedings was insufficient.  Consideration15    The question whether the common law felony tort rule continues to apply in Australia has not been finally considered by the High Court. However, in Halabi v Westpac Banking Corporation (1989) 17 NSWLR 26 (in which special leave to appeal was refused:  see 169 CLR 692) Kirby P and McHugh JA held that that rule no longer applied in Australia, and that the Court had a discretion to determine whether, and on what terms, civil proceedings should be stayed to prevent abuse and to achieve justice between the competing rights of the plaintiff and defendant (or applicant and respondent), having regard to the existence of concurrent criminal proceedings:  at 42D-E per Kirby P and at 58F-G, 59A-B per McHugh JA;  see also Cameron’s Unit Services Pty Limited v Kevin R Whelpton Associates (Australia) Pty Limited (1984) 4 FCR 428 at 435 per Wilcox J.  In Beecee 5 ACLR at 39, Waddell J said that, in the exercise of its inherent powers, the Court would not permit civil proceedings to go to trial if to do so would in any way create a real likelihood of prejudice to the defendant in the criminal proceedings.16    In Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Zhao (2015) 255 CLR 46, French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ held that the courts have the power to control their proceedings and to order a stay in an appropriate case.  They said that it will be appropriate to do so where the interests of justice require such an order. Their Honours held that the question was whether it was in the interests of justice that the civil proceedings should continue, or not, and that an important consideration was the risk of prejudice to a person’s defence of criminal proceedings (see at 58-59 [36]-[37]).17    They rejected an argument that, ordinarily, where issues in civil and criminal proceedings were identical, the mere existence of a statutory cause of action implied that the plaintiff or applicant could pursue that cause of action in civil proceedings regardless of the effect on the defendant’s or respondent’s defence of the criminal proceedings (255 CLR at 59 [38]-[41]).  They said (at 59 [39] and [42]):39    It may be accepted that forfeiture proceedings should not be unduly delayed. No litigation should be delayed except for good cause, especially criminal proceedings. On the other hand nothing in the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth)] or in the nature of forfeiture proceedings under the Act suggests that they must proceed at all costs. It could hardly be said, from any point of view, that they are more important than criminal proceedings and should be given priority.…42    The risk of prejudice to the second respondent if a stay is not granted in the forfeiture proceedings and the exclusion proceedings is plain. It is not necessary for the second respondent to say any more than he did on the application for a stay in order to identify that risk, given that the offences and the circumstances relevant to both proceedings are substantially identical.  (emphasis added)18    Their Honours held that it was not necessary for the defendant (or respondent) to identify specific matters of prejudice.  That was because requiring him or her to do so would be to make the risk of prejudice a reality through the person having to reveal information about his or her defence, the very situation an order for a stay sought to avoid.  They also rejected the Commissioner’s contentions that a decision on whether any order for a stay ought be made should be deferred until the parties had exchanged their evidence and that protective orders could be made that could maintain the confidentiality of that evidence, having regard to the principles of open justice (see 255 CLR at 59-60 [43]-[44]).19    French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ said that, were the defendant required in the civil proceedings to provide his evidence to the Commissioner, even if that evidence could not be used as evidence against him in the prosecution, “its possession by the prosecution might affect his defence.  The Court of Appeal’s view that protective orders would not suffice to remove the risk of prejudice to the second respondent’s defence is clearly correct” (255 CLR at 60 [46]).  In the end, their Honours held (255 CLR at 61 [50]) that the interests of justice were not served by requiring the defendant to defend the civil proceedings before the finalisation of his criminal proceedings, especially since the Commissioner would suffer no relevant prejudice from any delay.20    The Court’s inherent power to stay proceedings is not confined to closed categories.  Rather, the power is to be exercised in the interests of justice:  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales (2006) 226 CLR 256 at 266-267 [14]-[15] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ.  That case concerned the Court’s powers to prevent an abuse of process.  Their Honours held that any procedural step in the course of proceedings that have been properly instituted is capable of being an abuse of the Court’s process and that the failure to take, as well as the taking of, procedural steps and other delay in the conduct of proceedings is also capable of constituting an abuse of the process of the Court.21    There is no suggestion here that the basis of the power to stay rests in the principles apposite to an abuse of process.  However, the power of the Court to stay proceedings can arise from the circumstances in which its procedural rules are used, or proposed to be used, where there are concurrent civil and criminal proceedings involving an individual who is liable to criminal punishment.  The purpose of the Court’s power to order a stay, as the Court explained in Zhao 255 CLR 46, is to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice.22    The Court exercises a discretionary judgment in deciding whether to grant a stay that involves a balancing exercise in ascertaining where the interests of justice lie.  The fact that there are concurrent criminal proceedings is a primary consideration in the sense, as Dowsett, Tracey and Bromberg JJ explained in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2016) 242 FCR 153 at 167-168 [59], that the risk of prejudice to the fair and efficient conduct of the criminal proceedings should be given especial significance.  They observed, as did Jagot J in Ransley [2016] FCA 778 at [22], that such a risk must still be established.  However, in Zhao 255 CLR at 59 [42], the Court held that the risk of prejudice was “plain” on the face of the issues in the civil and criminal proceedings and did not need to be established there by detailed evidence.  That is so here.23    I am satisfied that the parties’ recognition of the substantive overlap between the criminal charges against Mr Gregg and the subject matter of these civil proceedings requires that there be a stay of these proceedings in the interests of justice until the finalisation of the criminal charges that have been brought against Mr Gregg.24    In essence, Fairfax seeks that I impose a condition on such a stay that would enable the making of orders granting it access to the documents already produced by ASIC and PwC, compelling ASIC to produce further documents and granting it the right of inspection of those new documents.25    The inherent power of a superior court of record, such as this Court, to stay its proceedings (and the corresponding implied power of an inferior court to do so) carries with it the power to impose conditions on, or in respect of, any order for a stay of proceedings such as these:  Grassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16-17 per Dawson J, with whom Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ agreed;  Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) (2006) 226 CLR 486 at 492 [10], 498-499 [33]-[34], 504 [53]-[54] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Crennan JJ;  FAI General Insurance Company Ltd v Southern Cross Exploration NL (1958) 165 CLR 268 at 283-284 per Wilson J, with whom Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ agreed, and at 290 per Gaudron J.26    If a party seeks to vary, or make conditional, an order for a stay of civil proceedings that is appropriate to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice in concurrent criminal proceedings, the party, ordinarily, will have an onus to establish why the variation or condition is necessary or in the interests of justice.  Here, of course, Fairfax sought that the order for a stay, which it accepted was appropriate in principle, should be so fashioned as to permit it to pursue its interests by utilising the Court’s processes in having access to documents produced in answer to subpoenas and compelling further compliance by ASIC with the unanswered portions of the subpoena addressed to it.27    In Waind [1978] 1 NSWLR at 384C-D, Moffitt P said that if a subpoena for production were properly issued and not set aside, and if there were no valid objection to the production of the documents to the Court:then the documents are in the control of the judge, who is invested with jurisdiction to take all steps necessary for the proper trial of the issues before him, subject to the due observance of any relevant rules and procedures of the court. …The only legitimate purpose of requiring the production, and permitting the inspection, of a stranger’s documents can be to add, in the end, to the relevant evidence in the case.  (emphasis added)28    I am not persuaded that it is necessary or in the interests of justice to impose conditions on a stay of these proceedings.  It is not necessary, in the circumstances, for Fairfax to have access to documents that have been produced by ASIC and PwC or for ASIC to be compelled to produce the balance of the documents the subject of the unanswered portions of the subpoena to it.  I accept that Fairfax may wish to use the benefit of access to those documents for the purposes of developing its own current understanding of the material that it may later be able to deploy in its defence of these civil proceedings and to pursue further inquiries.  However, it seems to me to be antithetical to the purpose of granting a stay to contemplate that further use could now be made of those documents.29    Such a use could only be for the purpose of conducting these proceedings in accordance with the implied undertaking given to the Court by a party who obtains access to another’s information or documents under compulsion of the Court’s process:  Hearne 235 CLR at 158 [105] per Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ.  The implied undertaking is given by a party obtaining access to documents produced under the Court’s compulsory processes not to use them “for any purpose other than the action in which they are produced”.  Since the action is stayed, albeit that it is capable of being revived once the criminal proceedings are concluded, balancing the interests of justice as best I can, I am not satisfied that it is necessary or appropriate to condition what would otherwise be a general stay of the proceedings so as to permit Fairfax to pursue further inquiries by reference to more material that may become available to it were I to allow it to have access to documents already produced or to require the production of, and then give it access to, further documents.30    If the criminal proceedings run their course and the stay in these proceedings is lifted, Fairfax will have access at that stage to what is likely to be the far more extensive material that becomes available during the criminal proceedings.  Moreover, in those circumstances, there is likely to be no necessity for the continuation of the suppression and non-publication orders that I have made for the purposes of protecting the administration of justice in respect of the criminal proceedings.31    There is also a potential that steps that Fairfax might undertake, were it to have access to the further material it seeks, could, innocently and inadvertently on its part, have unintended or uncontrollable impacts on the conduct of the criminal proceedings.  I do not suggest that that would come about in any conscious way, but having regard the purpose for which the stay is granted, I see no need for Fairfax at the present time to be given such access, pursuant to the Court’s orders;  cf. the analogous, but not identical, position in Zhao 255 CLR at 59-61 [42]-[50].32    Moreover, the purpose for which a stay is appropriate necessarily will involve the delay of these proceedings.  That consequence arises by reason of the real risk to the administration of justice in the criminal proceedings were these civil proceedings to continue.  Unfortunate as that consequential delay might be, I am not persuaded that it is appropriate to fashion a stay that, in effect, permits these proceedings to continue in part by giving Fairfax access, at this stage, to material in the hands of the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings that is not in the public domain and also to other material produced by PwC under compulsion.Conclusion33    For these reasons, I am of opinion that it is appropriate to order that these proceedings be stayed until the determination of the criminal proceedings in the Local Court of New South Wales and on any indictment brought in respect of those proceedings and to make consequential orders vacating orders made on 27 September 2016, including the trial fixed for 4 September 2017.I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.Associate:Dated:    28 April 2017",2017-02-08 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia
4771470,Thornton v R [2017] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The appellant, Robert John Thornton, was found guilty on 9 April 2015 of two counts of aggravated indecency contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), following a judge alone trial in the District Court. He was found not guilty of one count of attempted sexual intercourse with a person under 10 (contrary to s 66B of the Crimes Act). He had pleaded not guilty to each of the charges. The complainant (M) was the same for all counts.
	
	
	On 10 September 2015, the appellant was sentenced in relation to each offence to a total sentence of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 12 months. The sentences were partially accumulated by 5 months. The total sentence was fixed to commence on 14 February 2017, at the expiration of the non-parole period specified in relation to a previous sentence. The appellant will be eligible for release to parole on 13 July 2018.
	
	
	The appellant appeals against his convictions (and to the extent necessary applies for leave to appeal) on the following grounds:
	


1.   In reaching the verdicts, English DCJ did not consider all the evidence and did not consider (or properly consider) the defence case.

2.   English DCJ did not give adequate reasons for the verdicts.

3.   The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

Background


	
	M was born in March 2004. Her mother (N) is the appellant’s first cousin. The appellant was about 10 years older than N. When N was 16, and still in high school, the appellant and N commenced a sexual relationship that continued off and on until she was around 28 (ceasing when the appellant was arrested in January 2010 on charges of sexual misconduct with his daughter, H – see [14] below).
	
	
	N met her first husband (DP) at the appellant’s wedding to MB. In 2000, N moved in with DP in Londonderry. Living nearby in Londonderry at the time were the appellant and MB. N was in contact with the appellant and his wife while the respective couples were living in Londonderry.
	
	
	N separated from DP in 2005, when M was a baby. N moved back (with M) to live first with her mother and then with her father. From about the time that M was two years old, M had nothing to do with DP. According to N, shortly prior to M’s second birthday, DP disputed that he was M’s biological father (T 39.2). It is relevant to note, particularly in light of the tendency evidence adduced at the trial, that the appellant believes himself to be M’s biological father (see his written submissions on this appeal at [5]). In his electronically recorded interview with the police in 2013 (ERISP), which was admitted into evidence at the trial, the appellant stated that technically he was the biological father of M and that was how he knew her (Q/A 12-13). He said that he was in a “full on” sexual relationship with N casually over a 10 to 11 year period and that DP had a DNA test done in relation to M when he and N got divorced and the result was that DP was not the father and that the father must be a very close relative. M did not know that the appellant was her father or that there was a possibility that he was her father (Q/A 42-43).
	
	
	In October 2005, the appellant and MB separated (according to the Agreed Facts tendered on the sentencing of the appellant for sexual offences concerning H – which were admitted as tendency evidence at the trial concerning M – “H Agreed Facts”).
	
	
	N met P in 2007. She was staying with her mother in Mascot at the time (T 40.2). She then moved to her father’s house in Riverstone. Her relationship with P continued while she was living there (T 40). N’s evidence was that M was with her some days but most days she was with N’s mother (W) (T 40). This was because, on her own evidence, N was “too busy partying”, taking drugs (“anything really from speed, cocaine, ecstasy pills”), going out and getting drunk (T 40/41). P moved in with N for a while at Riverstone. According to N, while she was at Riverstone, she saw the appellant a couple of times and he met P; the appellant and P formed a bond; and they would “always get together and have a couple of drinks late at night, stuff like that” (T 41).
	
	
	In 2007, just before she fell pregnant with her second child (D), N and P moved with M to a house at Londonderry (which N described as an old shack or horse stable turned into a house) owned by P’s father. D was born in September 2007. N said that she stopped using drugs after she fell pregnant with D but starting using drugs again on occasions after his birth (though she said less than before).
	
	
	When M was roughly four years of age (so around 2008), there was a period of about 12 months when N did not allow her mother W to see the children. W also remembered a conversation with M (before the 12 month period when she was not allowed to see the children) when M was about four and was having a bath and M asked if babies grow in your bottom. W got N and asked M to repeat the question to her mother. W said N said to her something like “Until she’s old enough to say who doing what to her I can’t do anything”. W said that it was at P’s direction that she was not allowed to see the children for that 12 month period (T 92).
	
	
	The timeline of events from around 2009 is somewhat confused on the evidence. As it assumes no or little importance, having regard to the challenges now made to the appellant’s convictions, it is necessary to set out the evidence in some detail.
	
	
	The first point to note is that, at some time (N did not remember when), the social relationship between N, P and the appellant became a sexual relationship in which the three engaged together in sexual activity. N said the sexual activity always involved P (as well as the appellant) and that it took place in her bedroom at Londonderry. N said that during the course of the sexual relationship between the three of them she did not watch pornography together with P and the appellant. She did watch pornography with P in her bedroom when the children were not around, either in the form of DVDs or streamed online. N said they probably had about four DVDs, which she threw out when P died in 2012 (T 56; 58; see [38] below).
	
	
	N’s evidence in relation to the sexual relationship was broadly confirmed by the appellant. In his ERISP, the appellant said that he, P and N “had threesomes all the time” (Q/A 38-41). He said that he had watched pornography movies in the N/P household; that he had streamed porn on the computer when N and P were there; and that that happened very rarely in the lounge room area when the kids were asleep upstairs. He also described the sites they looked at (Q/A 235-251). Asked whether he ever watched any pornography movies or DVDs, the appellant said it was “probably like once” and that it was generally internet stuff. He also said, “it was generally the night would start off drinking, then doing drugs, whatever we wanted to do ... And then end up being an orgy” (Q/A 252-256).
	
	
	The second point to note is that (again according to the H Agreed Facts), on sentence in relation to the sexual offending by the appellant of his daughter H in March 2009, H told her grandmother that the appellant had been touching her and had been getting in and out of her bed when she and her brother stayed with him on access visits. H spoke to police and disclosed that at the end of November 2008, when she had just turned seven and when she and her brother were in the care of the appellant, the appellant rubbed her vaginal area before removing his pants and holding his penis; that he rubbed his penis on H’s upper legs and vagina; and that he then performed cunnilingus upon her. H described a further incident in January or February 2009 which occurred in a similar manner. The H Agreed Facts noted that these acts were representative of a wider number of similar acts which were committed upon H by the appellant.
	
	
	N became aware that allegations of sexual misconduct involving H had been made (though she denied being told of the “complete detail” of the allegations) at some time around late 2009. She placed her awareness of the allegations as being at some time after an occasion on which she had left her children in the appellant’s care and had gone with P away for a weekend to Stockton Beach (the Stockton Beach trip). This was when M was around five and a half years old. That would put the Stockton Beach trip as occurring around September 2009, at which time D turned two.
	
	
	N’s evidence was that after (though it is not clear how long after) the Stockton Beach trip the appellant came to her house and told her that he had been accused of doing things to H that he had not done. N said that she was not aware of anything at all about that before he told her and that he did not go into “complete detail”. N also said that, a couple of days after the appellant told her about the H allegation, MB (who N said had separated from the appellant in the time immediately before N was told about the H allegation) rang her and was a bit concerned with the appellant being at N’s house with her children. N said that MB did not go into complete detail about what the sexual allegations were but offered to show her H’s statement (an offer which N said she declined – T 59). In cross-examination, N said that the appellant came to see her the same day that MB rang her about this (T 75) and that she became aware of the allegation by H the day that it was made (T 76).
	
	
	Pausing there, there are obvious inconsistencies in the timeline given by N in relation to when she learnt of the H allegations. First, from the H Agreed Facts, it appears that the appellant and MB had separated in 2005 but the H allegations were not made until March 2009 and related to conduct in November 2008. Therefore, on any view of things, it could not be the case that the appellant and MB had separated immediately before N became aware of the H allegations. Second, N’s evidence is internally inconsistent in that she cannot have become aware of the H allegations on the day they were made given that they were made in March 2009 and she said she only became aware of them after the (late 2009) Stockton Beach trip. (She may of course have meant she learnt of them at the time the appellant was first interviewed by the police about them – see below – but that is not what was put to her in cross-examination and is not what she had there accepted.) Third, there is an internal inconsistency in N’s evidence as to when MB rang her to express concern in relation to the appellant being with N’s children at N’s house – i.e., whether it was the same day that the appellant came to tell N about the making of the allegations or a couple of days after that. Insofar as N recalls that MB offered to show her H’s statement, which presumably refers to a statement made to the police, it is not clear when H made a statement as to the allegations.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact at the trial concerning M that the first police interview with the appellant in relation to the H allegations was conducted on 15 September 2009. It was agreed that there was a second police interview conducted with the appellant on 22 January 2010. It was also an agreed fact that H had commenced counselling by 12 January 2010 (according to a statement dated 15 April 2010 by her mother).
	
	
	On the assumption that H had made a statement to the police prior to the September 2009 interview conducted by the police with the appellant, the most likely chronology of events is that the appellant (and MB) disclosed to N the making of the allegations some time around the time of the first police interview (and therefore close in time to the Stockton Beach trip).
	
	
	In his police interviews the appellant denied the H allegations. N’s evidence was that the appellant continued to come to her place after he told her about the H allegations (i.e., September 2009) but not as regularly. That is confirmed by the appellant’s statement in his ERISP to the effect that the last time they (he and N) had sex was the weekend he “got arrested for [H]” (Q/A 14-33) because the appellant was not charged with sexual misconduct in relation to H until 22 January 2010 (see affidavit of the Crown’s instructing solicitor, Scott Jaeger, Exhibit E at [5]). The charges were of two counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged under 10 years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act. Thus the evidence supports the conclusion that there was still some sexual activity between the appellant and N (and, since N said it always involved P, with P as part of the threesome) in the period from September 2009 to January 2010.
	
	
	N said that she left the children in the appellant’s care “a couple of times”. Cross-examined on this, she said she thought she may have allowed the appellant to look after M because she trusted him when he said that he did not do anything to his own child. In context, this must refer to the time after N heard about the H allegations in about late 2009. She said she let the appellant look after the children on maybe a couple of occasions when she was going out (T 60).
	
	
	N had made a statement to police on 28 May 2014 in which she said that the appellant “didn’t look after the kids many times” and that “if [the appellant] was around the kids with me not there it would be a case of I’d gone out and left the kids with [P] and [the appellant] would come over”. In cross-examination (T 68) she said that the statement was not wrong but that what she was saying was that the appellant did look after her children but not all the time by himself. N said that she told the police the one time that she could remember that the appellant looked after her kids alone and that that was all that she could remember off the top of her head. She said back then she was bad with drugs. She agreed that she was not bad with drugs on 28 May 2014. She could not remember exact dates (T 68).
	
	
	In cross-examination N was asked whether she had a clear recollection of whether the appellant had minded the children after she found out about H’s allegation; and she said “I can’t remember, to tell you the truth. He may have looked after them, he may not have looked after them”. She confirmed that the time she went to Stockton was the only time the appellant was alone with the children that she recalled at the time. She agreed that her memory had not really changed since 28 May 2014 (T 69-70).
	
	
	N agreed that she did not go out of the house enormously often when D was two or three years old (i.e., when M was about five or six) (T 73). She agreed that the cessation of the sexual relationship between herself and the appellant after the Stockton Beach trip (the appellant himself put the cessation somewhat late in January 2010) reflected her becoming less close to him but not her wanting less to do with him (T 73). She agreed as soon as there was an allegation (i.e., the allegation relating to H) she was very much on her guard about leaving the appellant alone with her children but said that she gave him the benefit of the doubt and believed what he was saying because he was family (T 74).
	
	
	N agreed in cross-examination that throughout the year 2010 she was getting more and more distant from the appellant. She said that she was not trusting the appellant less (somewhat inconsistently with her acceptance in cross-examination that, after she found out that the criminal investigation had finished and the appellant had been formally charged with the offences regarding H, she did not leave the appellant alone with her children – see T 80) but agreed that, as a result of seeing him less and less, he saw her children less and less (T 82). Also in cross-examination, N said that once the appellant was charged (which was in January 2010) he did not attend her house (T 80).
	
	
	In re-examination, N said that at the start of 2010 (when D was two to three years old) she lived at Londonderry but that, before D turned three (which was in September 2010) she split up with P and she moved with her children to her mother’s house at Minto. She said that she lived there for four or five months before returning back to Londonderry on her birthday (which was in November). She said she was not really in contact with anyone in that time, including the appellant (T 83). Taking the time of her return to Londonderry as the end of the four or five month period, on that timeline N was at Minto from about June or July 2010 to November 2010. (W’s evidence was broadly consistent with this in that she said that, at some stage when she was living in Minto, N and her then two children (M and D) moved in with her. She said they stayed “a couple of months” and then N and P were “starting to date again” and N moved back out to Londonderry. W said that N was possibly pregnant (with J) when N moved in with her at Minto. She said there was more than one occasion when N, M and D moved into her house in Minto. Relevantly, however, on W’s timeline of “a couple of months”, the period N was at Minto was shorter – say, from October/November 2010.)
	
	
	The appellant pleaded guilty to the charges relating to H on 7 March 2011. On 15 April 2011, his bail was revoked and he was taken into custody (see affidavit of Scott Jaeger, Exhibit E). He was sentenced by English DCJ on 29 July 2011.
	
	
	The relevance of the timing of the appellant’s guilty plea and the revocation of his bail is that N said that, after she became aware of his guilty plea, she sent the appellant a message via email or Facebook, telling him never to come near her and her children again and that he had lied (T 62). N said that after she sent that message the appellant never came back to her house and she became aware shortly thereafter that he had gone into custody in relation to the H allegations.
	
	
	In cross-examination, N agreed that she made a decision not to let the appellant around her and her children after he pleaded guilty (T 74; T 81.30; T 84.16). She denied that she had cut off contact with the appellant a year prior to when he was found guilty (T 79) and denied that it was a year before he “got locked up” that he stopped coming around to her place (T 81). She agreed that she could not recall the date that the appellant stopped coming around to her house but put that date at “about six months before he was found guilty” (T 81.25). On that timeline, the appellant ceased coming to N’s house around September 2010. Leaving out the time N was at Minto, this would mean that there was a period from September 2009 through to around June or July 2010 and then from around November 2010 to September 2011 when, according to N, there was still contact (albeit not sexual contact after January 2010) between her and the appellant.
	
	
	Part of the difficulty in making sense of N’s evidence as to the time of the above events is that there was evident confusion on the part of N as to the respective stages of the criminal justice process.
	
	
	In answer to a question in re-examination as to what “being charged” meant to her, N said (T 84.11) “[w]hen he went into custody and was locked up in gaol”. She accepted that in her mind there was no differentiation between the time the appellant was charged and when he pleaded guilty (T 84.20). She assumed that that was the same time (T 84.23).
	
	
	In fact, as noted earlier, the appellant was first interviewed about the H allegations in September 2009; charged in January 2010; pleaded guilty in March 2011; and was taken into custody on 15 April 2011. Leaving aside the potential unreliability of N’s memory due to her drug use (a factor to which the trial judge expressly had regard), it is by no means clear that N understood or was focussing on those different events when giving her evidence as to when (in advance of her final email or Facebook communication telling the appellant never to come near her again) the appellant stopped coming to N’s house.
	
	
	W agreed in cross-examination that she had a conversation with N after she heard that the appellant had been arrested in which she asked N not to leave her grandchildren with anyone and if she needed to go out to call her and she would come and get them (T 92.2; AB 353). She agreed that she specifically told N not to leave them alone with the appellant and that N told her that “she doesn’t, she leaves [P] with them if she has to go out (T 92.6-11; AB 353).
	
	
	The next relevant point to note in the chronology is that N said that, after she found out that the appellant had pleaded guilty to H’s allegations, she spoke to M about the appellant. This is relied on by the Crown as the complaint evidence. N thought the conversation was when M had turned seven (which was on 14 March 2011) and the family had come to the Londonderry house to celebrate. N could not remember whether the appellant was there. (M’s evidence was that he was there. The appellant in his ERISP denied that he was there.)
	
	
	N’s account of that conversation was that she asked M if anyone had touched her in an inappropriate way on her body and said that it was all right for M to tell her and that M had not done anything wrong. N said that M told her that nobody had. N said she continued to talk to M and that M kept telling her “No mum” but then M turned around and said, “Yes” and told N that the appellant and P had touched her in the bum. N asked her if she was sure that this was what had happened and M said “No”. N said that she called P into the bedroom and that P swore to her that nothing had ever happened to M and nothing would ever happen to her. N said she then told M that if it was true they would have to pack their bags and leave the house straightaway; and that M then said “I was lying mum, sorry” (T 61). (M denied that part of the account of the conversation.)
	
	
	In cross-examination, N agreed that M, after initially denying that the appellant had touched her private parts, said words like, “Uncle R [the appellant] had touched and dad [P] touched me down there” (T 77) and that she took M to be referring to her personal areas where nobody should be touching her. She agreed that when M disclosed this she immediately thought that M may have heard one of their conversations out the front about what was going on between the appellant and H. She agreed that she never specifically asked M about whether P had touched her (T 78).
	
	
	N said that after she spoke with P she rang the appellant and asked him to come around and see her; that she told him what M had told her; and that he said that he never touched M and he never would (T 62). Seemingly inconsistently with this, in cross-examination N said that the conversation with the appellant when she asked him whether anything had happened with M was before he was charged - T 74; that, however, would place the conversation well before the date of the family celebration for M’s seventh birthday, since he was charged in January 2010 – though, again, N’s impression as to what was meant by “charged” must be kept in mind.
	
	
	P died in a boating accident in March 2012. N said that between the time that she stopped having contact with the appellant (which on the above timeline seems to be a reference to March 2011 when she found out he had pleaded guilty to the H allegations) and the time of P’s death, she never had any further conversation with P about what M had told her and she never brought it up with M again (T 63).
	
	
	In March 2013, N and her children moved in with the appellant's father at Riverstone. N said that in that year she was told something by another cousin about M and that she told her mother (W). A “trust circle” was then conducted: N and her then partner sat down with M, M’s brother, two other children (M’s cousins) and their parents; and there was a conversation about sexual matters and the human body and about “who can touch you and see you naked”.
	
	
	N said that during the trust circle M came up to her; cuddled up to her on the lounge; and asked her if she (N) had ever kissed P on the private parts. N said she went into the bedroom with M where M disclosed that she had kissed P and the appellant on their private part; and said that she had put their private parts in her mouth and kissed them. N did not ask for any more detail. She said that she walked out of the room crying (which W corroborated); that W came up to her and asked her what was wrong; and that she (N) told W to go to M. W did so.
	
	
	W’s evidence as to the trust circle was broadly consistent with that of N. At some point W heard M say something to her mother about whether her mother had kissed P on his private parts. She said that M and N then went into a bedroom; that after about five minutes or so N came out and was very distraught with tears running down her face; and that N asked W to go to M. W asked M what she had told her mum. W could not remember the exact words M said but W said M implied that something had happened of a sexual nature. She said M said words to the effect that P and his friend Uncle R [the appellant] used to make her kiss their penis (T 90-91).
	
	
	This occasion was also relied upon by the Crown as evidence of complaint.
	
	
	The matter was then reported to Quakers Hill Police Station.
	
	
	On 15 July 2013, a couple of days after that report, N and M attended the Joint Investigative Response Team (JIRT) offices at Emu Plains where an interview with M (at which N was not present) took place. N could not recall whether she had a conversation with M about the H allegations on the day that they went to the JIRT interview; said that she did not know of the contents of the JIRT interview and had not spoken to M about what she might have said during that interview (T 66).
	


JIRT interview of 15 July 2013


	
	The recorded JIRT interview of 15 July 2013 was played in the trial (Exhibit G). The transcript of the interview was marked MFI 2. M was nine years old at the time of the interview. She gave her father’s name as P and identified the appellant as her uncle and as “Mr Roberts” (Robert is the appellant’s first name, not his surname). Throughout the interview, M referred to the appellant as her uncle and as Mr Roberts. The appellant confirmed in the ERISP that “uncle” and “father” was the way M referred to he and P, respectively.
	
	
	When asked what she had come to talk to them (the police) about, M said “My dad and my uncle” (Q/A 53). When asked what it was about her dad and her uncle, she said:
	


They used to try and do something to me, ’cause my uncle always tried to, I don’t wanna tell you. (Q/A 54).


	
	Asked about her response that “they do something to me”, M said:
	


Well, my uncle used to try and have sex with me. (Q/A 62)

…

He showed me these videos of it and I didn’t wanna watch it and all that but he, he kept on making me, and so did my dad. And they just tried to kiss me and all of that. And I kept on tryin’ to stop them but they wouldn’t. (Q/A 63). (my emphasis)


	
	M was asked when it happened that she had to watch movies and her dad kissed her. She said “When I was about, I think when I was five and seven” (Q/A 66) and explained that answer on the basis that “dad used to do it when I was little and then he, I kept on trying to stop him when I was seven” (Q/A 67). She said “I don’t really know” when asked how many times this had happened (Q/A 70-71).
	
	
	At Q/A 75-76, when questioned whether this was on one occasion or on separate days, M said:
	


My, Mr Roberts, my uncle, he used to babysit me when dad went with mum on a, for dinner or anything, and then -

...

- dad would do it when his mates weren’t there and he was just looking after me when mum went out and all that with her friends.


	
	When asked where her “uncle” was now, M said “In jail, ’cause he done it with his daughter too” (Q/A 77).
	
	
	M said that the appellant started babysitting her from when she was two years old (Q/A 99). M was asked what she remembered happening with the appellant and she said:
	


He showed me pictures like my dad and his beard and all that and – (Q/A 105 as corrected). (my emphasis)


	
	M described the pictures that the appellant showed her (Q/A 106-112) as videos, saying that they were “gross and about sex and all that” (Q/A 106). She described the videos as “these big things that are, they’re different to discs, discs” and as “square things” (Q/A 111-2). Asked how many times she watched this with her “uncle” she said “since he kept on babysitting me” (Q/A 113). She said the appellant looked after her at her home at Londonderry (Q/A 119-123).
	
	
	Asked how old her brother D was when the appellant would babysit her and make her watch the movies, she said “Well he started showing when I was five so [D] would be zero years old” (Q/A 132).
	
	
	M said that the appellant showed her the videos upstairs in the room she shared with D in which they had two separate beds (Q/A 139-143). She said there were three lounges in the room (a brown two-seater; a yellow brown one-seater and another yellow brown one-seater); a TV on top of the drawer; and a DVD and a video player (Q/A 150-168). M said the appellant “brought his discs without anybody noticing in a bag” and pretended it was “his stuff” and he would put the movies in the DVD player, which she said had one for the disc and one for the square thing and the appellant would put in the square thing (seemingly describing a VHS tape, not a DVD) (Q/A 176-183). M drew a diagram of the room (Exhibit A). She said the appellant would move the two-seater lounge diagonal to see the TV (Q/A 184-190). (Pausing there, M was questioned at the trial as to the layout of the bedroom and the drawings she had done (T 18/19), as was N (T 41-49), and as to the furniture in that room (T 70-72). However, ultimately it was not suggested that any inconsistency in the evidence as to the configuration or furniture in the room should have given rise to a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt and it is not necessary to set out that evidence in these reasons).
	
	
	As to how she came to be on the lounge with the appellant, M said:
	


He would, he would, he would put me on his lap.

…

He would just sit down and grab me and put me on the single lounge and then he would sit, he would put me on the two seater and sit down and then he would grab me [around my waist] and putting on, he would put me on his lap (Q/A 192-196).


	
	M seems (from the transcript) to have physically demonstrated how they sat. She then said that her legs would be on his legs (Q/A 198). She said the appellant made her watch these gross (“really, really gross”; “very, very gross”) videos, describing boys coming up and kissing girls while they were dancing on bars [later described as “a dancing pole … [t]hat they do at a club or whatever” (Q/A 275)] and the girls had their clothes off and only had bras on (Q/A 200-203). She said that while she was sitting on his lap “[h]e pulls his pants down and makes me sit on him”; that he would sit down on the lounge, pull his pants down and make her stand up and pull her pants down and he would sit her on his lap; she said he told her to walk in front of him and he pulled her pants down and she was trying to pull them up but he just quickly pulled her onto his lap (Q/A 204-215). M described the pyjamas she was wearing at the time in some detail (purple with coloured spots) (Q/A 218-225). She said she had undies on and he pulled her pants and undies down to her knees (Q/A 226-228).
	
	
	M said she could feel the appellant’s legs and his “private” (which she said was also called a “willy” or “doodle”). She did not see his penis. Asked how she felt it, she said: “Because he put it, my bum on it. That’s how I felt it” and then apparently physically gestured where she felt it (Q/A 229-235), marking the back of a picture of a girl to show where she felt it. She described his willy as “soft” (Q/A 243). Asked if the appellant touched her anywhere, she said “The nimmy” and described that as what she used for weeing (Q/A 5245-248). She then showed how his hand “goes like that at me on my – on my nimmy and he tickles me there. And that’s all” (Q/A 248-249). After a couple of answers to the effect that she did not remember whether the appellant touched her “nimmy” where she “wee[d]” or how many times he touched her “nimmy”, she confirmed that on the occasion when he moved the lounge he touched her “nimmy” for a short time; around two or three minutes (Q/A 250-257). M said that:
	


And then he would just squeeze me and say, Are you enjoying the movie and I would be closing my eyes and not watching it and I would say, Yes so I would be lying to him (Q/A 258).


	
	M said the movie would finish and the appellant “would pull his pants up and all that and then he would go back down ’cause mum would be back after, they [her mum and dad] would just go out for dinner and come back. It would take them about five or 10 minutes and that’s how long that this took, five or 10” (Q/A 260).
	
	
	M was taken again through a series of questions about the room; about what the appellant did; and about the movie she was made to watch. Asked about her statement that appellant “tries to have sex with me”, she said:
	


He tried to kiss me on the lounge and have sex and all that, have sex.

…

[it happened] All the times he babysitted me.

…

He would, he would watch the movies every time he would come and babysit me. (Q/A 283-285)


	
	She confirmed that the time the appellant put her on his lap and rubbed her “nimmy” was the same time that he kissed her and tried to have sex with her. She said he used to do it all the time (Q/A 286-287).
	
	
	M was asked a series of questions as to what happened when he kissed her on the lounge. She did not understand the question “Is it like a lip on lip kiss or is it something else”. She said she was sitting on his lap and “he moved her head to the side and then he moves his head in front of me and kisses me” (Q/A 288-298). She explained what she meant by him trying to have sex with her as:
	


He tries to hump me.

…

He humps me when I’m on his lap and he just, I don’t remember the rest but -

…

He tries to what it’s called, up and down, up and down (Q/A 301-303).


	
	Asked what goes up and down, she said his “willy” and she then said that he goes “hump, hump, hump to me” and that his willy touched her bum; “it goes in my bum hole and yeah” (Q/A 304-310). She said his willy goes in her bum hole and then he humps her when it goes in there Q/A 310); that it felt bad but that it did not hurt (Q/A 311-313); that she did not really know how long his willy was in her bum hole for but, when asked to compare it to the time that he rubbed her nimmy, she said around five and three [minutes] (Q/A 314-318). She said it stopped when “[h]e pulls it out” (Q/A 321). She again was asked, and demonstrated, how they were sitting when it happened; and she said that when his willy was touching her “bum hole” it was “light”; “soft” (Q/A 330-331).
	
	
	The conduct involving alleged penetration by the appellant of M’s anus with his penis was the subject of count 1 (and the alternative count 1A of aggravated indecency) on the indictment. The conduct involving touching M’s vagina and squeezing and kissing her during the movie was the subject of count 2 on the indictment.
	
	
	Asked in the JIRT interview about her father, M said that:
	


He just kissed me and done the same thing as Mr Roberts but he didn’t show me these videos, he didn’t show me the videos.

…

Try and have sex and do the same things [as the appellant] but didn’t show me the videos.

He done the same thing as Mr Roberts (Q/A 361-364).

…

He done the thing, the same thing, like tried to kiss me. (Q/A 365)

…

Kissed me, had sex with me, tried to and he putted his willy up my butt in the same way as Mr Roberts and that’s all I remember from dad (Q/A 367)


	
	M said that this happened with her father when she was six (Q/A 368-370). Asked whether she remembered whether her dad or “Mr Roberts” did something first, she said that “Mr Roberts started” (Q/A 372-374).
	
	
	M said that she told N about what the appellant had done to her the day she turned seven, after her party. She said she did not tell her mother about her father when she was six because she was shy. She said she told her mother that the appellant tried to kiss her, that he tried to have sex with her and that he put his willy up her bum hole (Q/A 375-378). She said this conversation took place in the lounge room with the door closed while everyone was outside playing games. She said that her mother “called Mr Roberts ’cause he was at my birthday party and she got angry with him and told him to stay away from my daughter. And don’t babysit her every [sic] again” and that the appellant replied, “Ok, I’ll stay away from her” (Q/A 379-382).
	
	
	M said she knew that the appellant was in gaol for doing the same thing to his daughter because her mother told her when they were having lunch before she came in for the interview. She said that they were talking about her (M) having to speak to the police and that she asked her mother whether there was anybody else he had done it to and her mother said, “yes, [H], his daughter” (Q/A 414-420).
	


M’s oral evidence at trial


	
	M gave evidence via CCTV at the trial. It was a few days before her 11th birthday. In her evidence in chief she answered questions as to her family members and when she lived in Londonderry; she identified the drawing she made during her JIRT interview of the house at Londonderry (which was marked Exhibit A); and explained what she meant by the word “nimmy”.
	
	
	She was asked very little else in chief. She agreed that in her JIRT interview she had told the police officer that, on the day she went to speak to the police, she had asked her mother whether the appellant had done it to anyone else and her mother had told her, “yes to H his daughter”, but denied that her mother had told her any detail of what the appellant might have done to H (T 8.30-34). She denied that she and her mother had ever spoken about the appellant doing anything to H at another time before that conversation (T 8.37). She said she had not seen her cousin H after what she thought was her eighth birthday party and said she did not speak to H about what her dad might have done to her (T 8.41-50). She denied overhearing her mother speaking to anybody about what the appellant might have done to H (T 9.6).
	
	
	M was then cross-examined, in the course of which she said that the last time she saw the appellant before her JIRT interview (in 2013) was “last year, two years ago” (T 10.13) and agreed that it had been a “fair while” (T 10.15). She agreed that earlier in her life there was a time when she used to see the appellant (T 10.23). She thought she was not seeing him anymore because her mother was angry at him (T 10.31). She did not know why her mother was angry at him (T 10.35). She agreed that she saw her mother get angry at him at the time of her seventh birthday party (T 10.37.41). She was asked various questions about her recollection of the birthday party and the complaint made to her mother on that occasion. She said that after her seventh birthday her mother didn’t ever talk to her about the appellant.
	
	
	Relevantly, she was cross-examined about the answer she had given in the JIRT (at Q/A 63) in which she had said, after saying that the appellant showed her the movies, “and so did my dad” (see #[47] above). M said that her dad did not keep on making her watch videos and repeated that “well my dad actually didn’t show the – my – the videos. Only my uncle did” (T 17/18).
	
	
	The appellant relies on, as critical, the evidence M gave during cross-examination as to what P did when he did the “bad touching”. M said what he did was always the same. The cross-examiner then took M through a list of things and she agreed that: her dad sat down on the lounge; he pulled his pants down; he was on the lounge with his pants down; he got her to come over to in front of him; he held her around the hips (the cross-examiner physically demonstrating this in some fashion); he took her pyjamas and undies down; he made her sit on him; and she could feel his willy in her bum hole; nobody else was there when it happened; he rubbed her “ninny” and kissed her on the lips; and his willy went “hump hump hump, up and down”; and that was basically what happened “the same every time” (T 27). Pausing there, the cross-examiner did not put to M anything about watching videos in the list of things that he put to her had happened during the bad touching by P.
	
	
	M denied that P sometimes showed her dirty videos in the house in Londonderry (T 29). She remembered that P did the bad touching on the lounge in her bedroom. When it was put to her that it was just her dad and not the appellant who did the willy on the bum hole and the bad touching things on the lounge, she said that was wrong (T 29).
	
	
	She denied that when she was in the trust circle she said to her mother “Have you ever kissed daddy on his privates” and she denied that she said to N or W something like she had “kissed P and [the appellant]’s private parts”. She agreed it would not be true to say that she had kissed P’s and the appellant’s private parts (T 24).
	
	
	M agreed that she told the police that she could not remember how many times something happened with the appellant. She disagreed with the proposition that when her mum and dad went out for dinner they did not always take D with them. She agreed that it was true to say that there was only one time she remembered with the appellant. She said that her mum and dad went out for dinner “only sometimes” (T 26). She said the appellant didn’t look after her and D at the same time, it was just her (T 27).
	
	
	In re-examination M said that she only remembered that one time with the appellant and did not know whether there were other occasions when things happened with her and the appellant (T 29).
	


Tendency evidence


	
	At the trial, the Crown relied on tendency evidence in respect of the offending by the appellant against his daughter H when she was seven years old.
	
	
	It was the Crown case at the trial in relation to M that the pleas of guilty and the H Agreed Facts showed a tendency on the part of the appellant to have a sexual interest in female children aged six to eight years who he believed were biologically related to him; and that he had a tendency to act upon that sexual interest on occasions when he was the carer for such children and engaged in sexual conduct by touching them, exposing his penis to them and engaging in acts of other sexual natures. It was the Crown case that these tendencies made it more likely that the allegations made by M were true.
	


ERISP


	
	The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. He relied on the electronic record of interview conducted by the police with the appellant on 18 December 2013 (Exhibit G). A transcript of the interview was marked as an aide memoire (MFI 6). Two diagrams of the premises drawn by the appellant during the interview were also tendered (Exhibit H).
	
	
	The appellant denied M’s allegations when put to him in the interview (Q/A 11; 220-233; 261-263).
	
	
	He agreed that he went to the premises at Londonderry but could not remember babysitting M (Q/A 46-52).
	
	
	He denied that he had babysat M since she was aged two and that she had had time alone with him. (He said when she was around two she was living next door and from that time he went to his dad’s.)
	
	
	Asked later in the ERISP about babysitting M, the appellant said he could not remember. He said at the time M was six he would have been investigated for H and that he kept N up to date with everything that was going on (Q/A 272-278). He said he “honestly couldn’t remember” if he babysat M and that if he did it would have been a “very, very rare occasion” (Q/A 286-290). He said he could not even recall being alone with M (Q/A 294).
	
	
	The appellant described the upstairs room in Londonderry. He said there were three beds; no lounges; and only a tallboy with a TV on top. He thought there was a DVD and a VCR player but said that most of the time it did not work (Q/A 121-154). He drew the layout of the room (Exhibit H; Q/A 155-172). The appellant said that N was constantly changing the room set up but there was never a lounge in there (Q/A 178-184).
	
	
	Asked whether there was something that happened in that household involving M, the appellant said not in a sexual way but that M had seen things a five year old should not have seen (Q/A 344). He said P told him that M had seen P and N having sexual intercourse. The appellant said the chances of M seeing him with N and P (i.e., the threesome) would be “pretty high” if she got out of bed (Q/A 353-361). He said M would have seen him naked because occasionally he would shower there and there was no privacy (Q/A 362-365). He described the shower area which had no door and said that to dry off you were in the kitchen area (Q/A 367-378).
	
	
	Asked whether there was anything that he wanted to say about the allegation, the appellant said “I’ll probably be fighting it” (Q/A 389).
	


Defence case at trial


	
	The appellant identifies the two principal aspects of the defence case at trial as relevant to this appeal as being: first, that the Court could not be satisfied that he had the opportunity to commit the alleged offences in the indictment period; and, second, that the Crown case depended on “an extraordinary coincidence of repeated, almost identical allegations” by M of abuse both by the appellant and P and that the Court could not exclude the reasonable possibility that M had conflated or comingled the appellant and P in her mind, and was honestly mistaken about who had abused her.
	
	
	As to the first, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that he would not have had the opportunity to commit the offending during the period on the indictment (i.e., between 14 March 2010 and 14 March 2011) because N lived at Minto for about five months during that period and N’s evidence was that the appellant stopped coming around six months before he pleaded guilty and she saw him less and less throughout 2010. It was the appellant’s case that there would not have been an occasion when the appellant minded M alone; rather, M’s brother D would have been present. As to the second, the appellant argued that discrepancies in the complaint evidence add force to the argument that M had conflated in her mind the two men (the co-mingling argument).
	


Reasons for judgment


	
	The trial judge delivered reasons for judgment orally on 9 April 2015. No complaint is made as to the manner in which the trial judge directed herself as to the applicable legal principles (although the appellant complains that the trial judge’s reasons do not evidence an actual application of the warning her Honour gave in relation to scrutiny of a child’s evidence and more generally as to the need to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence (AT 8.46)).
	
	
	The trial judge noted that the Crown case in respect of each charge depended on acceptance of the substance of M’s evidence since there was no independent objective evidence confirming her testimony; and that it was necessary to scrutinise her evidence on each count very carefully (reasons p 3).
	
	
	The trial judge summarised (reasons pp 7-13), the evidence relied upon by the Crown, having earlier noted that M gave her evidence in the form of a pre-recorded interview and then gave the remainder of her evidence in chief, and was cross-examined and re-examined by way of CCTV in the presence of a support person. Her Honour referred to the contents of the JIRT interview, then to the evidence given by each of N and W. Her Honour then referred to the tendency evidence led by the Crown (as to the appellant’s conviction and sentencing for offences of a like nature against H).
	
	
	Her Honour noted that, as was his right, the appellant had chosen not to give evidence but had asked that his police record of interview be taken into consideration and her Honour referred to the contents of the appellant’s police record of interview (reasons pp 15-17).
	
	
	The trial judge then set out facts which were not disputed (reasons pp 18-19) before identifying the areas of dispute raised on behalf of the appellant as being:
	


The age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences; whether or not there was opportunity for the accused to sexually assault the complainant as alleged, whether or not the accused ever in fact babysat the children of [N]; whether or not the accused ever babysat M alone; whether there has been comingling in the mind of M as to the identity of the perpetrator of the alleged sexual assaults upon her; whether or not the complainant was sexually assaulted by [P]; the timing of when [N] became aware of the arrest and charging of the accused relating to his daughter H; when she became aware of the change of plea and when she became aware he went into custody; what complaint was made by the complainant to [N] regarding the accused and [P] and what followed thereafter and what was the nature of the complaint made on the day of the circle of trust just prior to the allegations being raised with the police for the first time.


	
	The trial judge, as noted earlier, found the appellant not guilty of the first count on the indictment but found him guilty of the alternate count of aggravated indecent assault and guilty of count two.
	
	
	Her Honour found M to be a witness “who was both honest and accurate as to the important matters and doing her best from the outset to be honest and accurate, given her age”. Her Honour acknowledged that there were discrepancies in M’s evidence but did not consider them such as to cause doubt as to the reliability of the important matters (reasons p 19-20).
	
	
	Her Honour found that M was clearly able to differentiate between P and the appellant and that her evidence stood up to the lengthy cross-examination and level of scrutiny to which she had been subjected (reasons p 20). Her Honour described M’s account of what she said had happened to her as compelling.
	
	
	As to the timing issue, her Honour found that the abuse by P and the appellant was persistent and ongoing and that it occurred during the period nominated in the counts on the indictment (reasons p 20).
	
	
	Her Honour found M’s description of sitting on the lap of a man naked from the waist down with a flaccid penis particularly telling (reasons p 21) and noted that M had described and demonstrated the appellant rubbing her in the area of her vagina and tickling her in that area, an act which her Honour said clearly had a sexual connotation. (The description of the appellant’s penis as light or soft and the lack of sensation of pain were the matters which caused her Honour to have reasonable doubt as to the offence charged as count one.) The Crown in closing submissions conceded that in the absence of any description of pain, in combination with M’s perception of the appellant’s penis as soft, there would have to be some reasonable doubt as to actual penetration of the anus, but submitted that there was an attempt to penetrate her anus (T 4). The Crown submitted that there was clearly an aggravated indecent assault but reiterated “of course it would have to be within the timeframe” (T 4).
	
	
	Her Honour considered that M’s evidence was supported both by her complaint to her mother and by the tendency evidence (though noting that there were some differences in the charges to which the appellant had pleaded guilty in respect of H, namely the acts of cunnilingus in the case of H and that there was no discussion with M about keeping their activity secret) (reasons pp 21-22).
	
	
	The trial judge found beyond reasonable doubt (contrary to M’s evidence supported by that of her mother) that M’s brother, D, was certainly in the premises at the time the assaults took place although her Honour could not be certain as to where he was in the premises at the time (reasons p 22).
	
	
	Her Honour rejected the submission for the appellant that there was no opportunity for him to commit the alleged offences, saying (reasons p 22):
	


The evidence of the complainant and her mother is that the accused babysat her and her brother on occasions. Indeed the accused himself, although clearly reluctant to admit that he may have done so, admitted that there was the rare possibility that he may have done so. There is no doubt in my mind that he certainly babysat not only the complainant but also her brother on occasion when their mother and [P] and some of their friends went away for a weekend [the Stockton Beach trip] but that is not at the time when these alleged offences are said to have occurred.


	
	Her Honour noted that the appellant had in his police interview put himself at the premises taking showers (when explaining occasions when the complainant may have seen him naked), which her Honour found to be:
	


…an endeavour on his part to undermine the complainant’s credibility, a rather bizarre account given by him to police during the record of interview, rather like the entirety of the record of interview.


	
	Her Honour said that there was consistency of evidence between the appellant and N that, following his charge for the assaults on H, N was being kept advised of the investigation and progress of the Court proceedings, if not the details of the allegations. Her Honour noted that the appellant had said in his record of interview that when he sexually assaulted H he was not intoxicated and that there was no suggestion of intoxication at the time of the assaults against M.
	
	
	At pp 23-24 of her Honour’s reasons, her Honour made express findings that: there were other occasions on which the appellant indecently assaulted M (though could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those occasions “other than to the extent that her evidence discloses other such occasions existed”); M did make complaint to N about the indecent assaults on her by the appellant and P at around the time of her seventh birthday, if not necessarily on that day; after the allegations about H, N chose to believe the accused’s protestations of innocence rather than her own daughter and there continued to be a relationship between them, such that the appellant had the opportunity to assault M; M also raised allegations with N concerning P but M chose to withdraw her allegations following a discussion as to the consequence of reporting such matters; and all contact ceased with the appellant when he entered his pleas of guilty (in respect of the H charges).
	
	
	The discrepancy between M’s denial of making a complaint to the effect that she had kissed either the appellant’s or P’s penis did not cause her Honour to doubt the entirety of M’s evidence. Her Honour said either N and W were mistaken or M was (reasons p 24). Her Honour was satisfied that there was no risk of concoction or contamination of M’s evidence and that of H, or as between M and N (reasons p 25). Her Honour found that N was mistaken as to dates but noted that “life was chaotic at the time of these events” in terms of N’s relationship with P and the appellant and with her own mother (W) and M; and that N “was someone who on her own admission had been abusing drugs over a very lengthy period of time” (reasons p 25).
	
	
	The essence of her Honour’s conclusion as to the guilt of the appellant on the alternate to count one and on count two of the indictment can be gleaned from the following (reasons p 24-25):
	


[M’s] evidence as to the important matters of the Crown case was compelling and entirely consistent throughout …

Some aspects of her evidence had an extraordinary ring of truth to them, her description of a sensation of a male flaccid penis could only be something described from experience. Her reaction to being forced to watch pornographic videos was particularly telling, one of revulsion. Her recall of the incidents which form the counts on the indictment were very graphic as to what she says the accused did to her, what he said to her and how she felt about it. When the tendency evidence is taken into account it makes her version even more credible.

Grounds 1 and 2: Consideration of evidence/defence case; adequacy of reasons


	
	These grounds were grouped together in the appellant’s submissions and I will deal with them in the same fashion.
	
	
	Numerous complaints were made of the trial judge’s reasons. Counsel for the appellant accepted that if only grounds 1 and/or 2 were upheld then (subject to application the proviso) the appropriate ruling would be for the verdict to be quashed and for a re-trial. However, it was submitted that there is some interplay between these grounds and ground 3 (which if successful would lead to a verdict of acquittal (AT 10.18-11.14)).
	
	
	First, as to the consideration her Honour gave to the evidence, the appellant raises the following matters.
	
	
	As to M’s evidence, the appellant accepts that the trial judge outlined much of the JIRT interview but says that there was no reference to the additional evidence in chief given by M in court, nor to the evidence given by her in cross-examination or re-examination. The appellant says that her Honour “barely referred” to the allegations M made about P and submits that this gave “a marked prominence and individuality” to the allegations about the appellant.
	
	
	As the Crown points out, the additional evidence in chief given by M was uncontroversial introductory evidence prefatory to the playing of her recorded interview (T 1-5). Nothing turned on this evidence and there is no basis for any complaint as to the fact that her Honour did not refer to it.
	
	
	As to M’s cross-examination, the Crown points to the reference by her Honour to M being cross-examined at length about the assaults upon her by P and to M’s ability to differentiate between the two men. The appellant does not point to any aspect of the cross-examination that it is contended should have been made the subject of express reference.
	
	
	As to the re-examination of M, as the Crown points out, it consisted of three questions directed to confirming her evidence in chief that she could only remember one occasion of abuse (at the time of her giving evidence) by the appellant. (T 29). The Crown submits and I agree that there was no requirement for her Honour to refer to this evidence.
	
	
	As to the complaint by the appellant that the trial judge “barely referred” to the allegations made about P, the Crown notes that the trial judge expressly referred to the fact that M made allegations about both men (reasons p 7-8) and had complained to N about both men (reasons p 11-13); that her Honour expressly made reference to the issue as to whether there had been comingling in the mind of M as to the perpetrator of the alleged assaults (reasons p 19); and dealt with the comingling argument by reference to the evidence (reasons pp 20-21).
	
	
	It is submitted that, in light of her Honour’s finding that M was persistently abused by both men and was well able to distinguish between the two, it was not necessary for her Honour to go into further detail about the allegations concerning P. I agree.
	
	
	As to N’s evidence, the appellant submits that the trial judge “left out or was incorrect in a few pertinent details”.
	
	
	In that regard, the appellant refers, first, to the fact that her Honour incorrectly referred in the context of the trust circle complaint (reasons p 12) to N’s evidence of the discussion with M that they would have to leave the family home if what M was saying was true whereas that discussion occurred (on N’s evidence) when M first made the complaint in March 2011. The appellant notes that later in her Honour’s reasons the withdrawal of the allegation is not so linked (see reasons p 24).
	
	
	Second, the appellant points to her Honour’s reference to the confrontation between N and the appellant about the allegations raised by M (reasons p 12) and to her Honour’s statement that after that the appellant “continued to attend their home but not as regularly as previously”. The appellant notes that N’s evidence was that she confronted P in M’s presence but that M was not present when she confronted the appellant; and that N said that the appellant never returned to the Londonderry house after she confronted him in relation to M’s allegations. It is not entirely clear what the appellant’s complaint is in relation to this aspect of N’s evidence. However, it seems to be as to the time at which N did give evidence that after the March 2011 conversation with M (which followed the appellant pleading guilty to the H allegations) she not only confronted P but she rang the appellant, asked him to come around and see her and confronted him with what M had told her (see T 62).
	
	
	There is no basis for complaint as to her Honour’s reference to there being a confrontation between N and the appellant about what M had told her. The trial judge made no reference in this part of her reasons to the confrontation being in the presence of M.
	
	
	Where the trial judge may have transposed dates is that it was following the conversation between N and the appellant about the H allegations (which he denied) that N’s evidence was he continued to attend their home but not as regularly, whereas after she found out about the plea of guilty (i.e., March 2011) N told the appellant never to come near her again (as the trial judge recorded later in the same paragraph about which complaint is made). Nothing turns on this.
	
	
	Next, the appellant points out that her Honour did not refer at all to N’s cross-examination or re-examination (placing some significance on the latter).
	
	
	As to the matters that the appellant says were omitted or incorrectly stated in her Honour’s summary of parts of N’s evidence, the Crown submits that it was not necessary for the trial judge to deal with every aspect of N’s evidence that was the subject of criticism by the appellant at trial (citing Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247), particularly where her Honour found N to be somewhat unreliable (reasons p 25). The Crown submits that the finding that N corroborated M’s evidence in relation to opportunity (reasons p 24) was well open on the evidence and that it was open to her Honour to accept N’s evidence that M did complain to her about the appellant’s conduct but to reject other aspects of her evidence.
	
	
	Apart from adverting to the transposition of dates referred to above, the appellant does not identify what parts of N’s cross-examination or re-examination should have been expressly set out.
	
	
	As to W’s evidence, the appellant points to the omission of some details, namely that it was at P’s direction that she did not see her grandchildren; and that (after she found out about the plea of guilty to the allegations) she had asked N not to let others babysit the children, especially the appellant.
	
	
	The Crown submits that there was no obligation on her Honour to include reference to all the details of W’s testimony. I agree. The significance of the fact that it was at P’s direction that W not see her grandchildren for 12 months is not made clear in the appellant’s submissions. The significance of W’s request that N allow her (instead of others and especially the appellant) to babysit the children in future - and N’s response - goes to the question of opportunity to commit the offences to which I will return in the context of ground 3.
	
	
	The appellant submits that the inference to be drawn from the trial judge’s approach in this regard is that her Honour was “excluding from consideration” evidence adduced by the defence as well as certain of the Crown’s evidence relevant to the defence case.
	
	
	No such inference can in my view fairly be drawn. Her Honour addressed the question of opportunity to commit these offences. The statement by W as to babysitting in the future goes to the period after the appellant pleaded guilty.
	
	
	I do not consider that it can fairly be suggested that her Honour did not give proper consideration to the defence case.
	
	
	Second, as to the adequacy of her Honour’s reasons, the appellant criticises the trial judge’s reasons as “somewhat rambling and repetitive”. The complaint is that the reasons “do not address much of the volume of evidence not referred to earlier in the judgment”. The appellant complains that the reasons state conclusions without much or any supporting analysis.
	
	
	In particular, on the two principal issues identified as giving rise to a reasonable doubt as to his guilt (namely, the asserted lack of opportunity to commit the assaults and the identical nature of the allegations made by M against each of the appellant and P), the appellant refers to various findings by the trial judge in the course of which he makes the following complaints as to her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	First, it is submitted that her Honour erroneously thought that N had disbelieved M “in favour of” the appellant (submissions at [58]). This relates to the statement by her Honour (reasons p 24) that:
	


I find it was at the time that [N] became aware of the allegations raised by the accused about his natural daughter that she chose to believe the protestations of innocence by the accused rather than her own daughter.


	
	There is force to this complaint but it is again simply referable to the transposition of timing as between the allegations (in 2009) and the March 2011 conversation.
	
	
	Second, there is at least an implicit complaint that her Honour made a finding “without analysis and contrary to [M’s] evidence, that D was home” at the time of the assaults and used that to facilitate the finding that the appellant took up the opportunity when, in N’s absence, he was babysitting M and D, “just as he did when he sexually assaulted [H]” (reasons p 22).
	
	
	I accept that the basis for a finding that D was present at the time of the offences is not apparent - due perhaps to the unlikelihood that N and P would go out for dinner or elsewhere taking with them a two year old (D) and leaving behind a six year old - but I do not accept that the trial judge used that finding “to facilitate” or support the conclusion that the appellant chose the opportunity to assault M.
	
	
	Third, the appellant complains that her Honour did not, in the course of considering the issue of opportunity to commit the assaults, advert to the necessity that her Honour be satisfied of opportunity and the commission of the alleged offences within a relatively confined period (which the appellant puts as being between 14 March and late June 2010) with, it is said, no reliable reference point for the first date in that period.
	
	
	This complaint raises an issue as to the basis on which the case was conducted by the Crown. The period specified on the indictment was between 14 March 2010 and 14 March 2011. Those dates correspond to M’s sixth and seventh birthdays (the latter being the date on or about the time both M and N gave evidence as to the making of the first complaint). The appellant argues that in the Crown’s closing address, the Crown effectively conceded that the date period specified on the indictment was to be treated as essential, i.e., an element of the offence, when conceding that the Court had to be satisfied that the alleged offences occurred within that period (see T 3). What the Crown prosecutor said was:
	


In terms of the first count on the indictment the Crown says that there are effectively three elements. The first is it has to be within the time range that the Crown says. The second is that the accused attempted to have sexual intercourse with [M] and the third element is that she was under the age of 10 years.


	
	Again, at T 4, the Crown prosecutor, conceding in effect that there might be reasonable doubt as to actual anal penetration having occurred, submitted that nevertheless there was an attempt (and that was clearly aggravated sexual assault), and said “of course it would have to be within the timeframe”.
	
	
	At T 10 , counsel then appearing for the appellant in his closing submissions noted the Crown’s concession that her Honour would need to be “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offences occurred in the indictment period while [M] was six years old”. He submitted to the trial judge that the bulk of the evidence as to the conversation in the bedroom at Londonderry regarding P and the appellant (where M retracted her allegation that P and the appellant had touched her in the bum) could not have occurred after March 2010 (and therefore could not have related to an offence occurring during the period specified in the indictment) (T 10).
	
	
	In this context the appellant submits that the finding by the trial judge of “persistent and ongoing abuse” (but not beyond reasonable doubt) was “curious, arguably unnecessary … suggestive of some tendency reasoning [and] … not supported by the evidence”. The appellant argues that the available time period was much more limited than a year.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the significance of her Honour’s finding of persistent ongoing abuse is that this was not an isolated incident in the course of a long run of offending by the appellant. The Crown argues that therefore the date was not vital to the charge (referring to R v Stringer (2000) 116 A Crim R 198; [2000] NSWCCA 293 and Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Knight; (2006) 162 A Crim R 555; [2006] NSWSC 646).
	
	
	The Crown points to the recognition by counsel appearing for the appellant on the making of an application for a Prasad direction (R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161 at 163) during the course of the trial (T 97.20) to the effect that:
	


… if there was overwhelming evidence that [the appellant] committed all of the acts alleged but committed them when the complainant was five years and 365 days old, one day before the start of the indictment period then there’s no dispute that [the appellant] would not be entitled to an acquittal on that basis. The issue would be ventilated … provided that [the appellant] was plainly put on notice by the content of the evidence and addreses then the inaccuracy to the date would be no bar”.


	
	The Crown says the submission put for the appellant at that stage was not that the date was an element of the charge but, instead, that the time was very significant in this case because it went to opportunity (“it goes to what was actually going on in the lives of [N] and [M] at the time so as to give rise to the asserted inaction with [the appellant], the asserted commission of the offence by [the appellant]. And it goes to the [P] point …”).
	
	
	The Crown submits that a specific date was not required to be identified for the offence, nor was the occasion of the charged conduct identified by M with particularity so that the appellant ran his case to meet a particular date. The Crown emphasises that the Crown case was put that, on an occasion within the indictment period (13 March 2010 to 12 March 2011), the appellant babysat the complainant and committed the indecent assaults.
	
	
	The Crown points out that at the trial the Crown prosecutor submitted the following:
	


The Crown says that in terms of the issue of cogency if there is a difficulty with the cogency of the Crown’s evidence it only relates to the timing as set out in the indictment as to the time at which the offence occurred. That is between 13 March 2010 and 12 March 2011, being the year in which the complainant was six years old. And … the Crown says that it remains open for the Crown to run a case on the evidence before your Honour that the accused on a number of occasions committed sexual offences against the complainant as she indicated in her interview to police on 15 July 2013. (see T 101)


	
	The Crown submits that both parties addressed the period from 2008 to 2011, which was when the Crown says the appellant occasionally babysat the complainant and when the appellant admits he maintained a sexual relationship with N.
	
	
	On that issue, while I accept that the Crown should be bound by the forensic decisions made during the course of the trial, it was clearly accepted by the defence that the significance of the dates specified on the indictment was not that occurrence of the offences within that period was an element of the offence charged; rather, the significance lay in the opportunity to commit the offences. It was not suggested in this Court that the appellant would have conducted his defence differently had the Crown’s misconceived concession not been made (indeed the “concession” came during closing submissions).
	
	
	The appellant points to the fact that, during the JIRT interview, M could only recall the one specific incident with the appellant and by the time she gave evidence in Court she did not know whether there were others. The appellant argues that her Honour’s reasons indicate that she did not consider N’s evidence in its entirety. It is submitted that N’s evidence cannot give confidence that there was much access (if at all) in the relevant period and that the appellant’s response on this in the recorded police interview was “so nebulous” that it provided no support for the conclusion that there was such access.
	
	
	Complaint is also made that her Honour did not consider M’s evidence (of numerous occasions of babysitting) against the evidence pointing against the conclusion that he in fact had the opportunity to commit the assaults in the relevant period.
	
	
	I consider in due course the issue of lack of opportunity when considering ground 3. Suffice it to say for the present that insofar as criticism is made of adequacy of reasons on this issue, it is not made out further simply because the trial judge did not set out the whole of the evidence. This does not mean her Honour did not consider it.
	
	
	As to the second principal issue, the making by M of “repeated, almost identical” allegations of assaults by the appellant and by P, respectively, complaint is made as to various aspects of her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	First, insofar as her Honour, when referring (reasons p 20) to M first making complaint about the appellant and P at around the time of her seventh birthday, said “although she was not believed or when discussions about the consequences of her disclosures were brought to her notice she withdrew her allegations at that time”, the appellant points out that this was more N’s version than that of M (the latter denying that N ever put the consequences of her disclosure to her); and the appellant says that it was not (on N’s evidence) that M was not believed; rather, that M was unsure and then said she was lying.
	
	
	Secondly insofar as her Honour later (reasons pp 23-24) said that the complaint (as evidenced by N and M) that both the appellant and P had touched her in the bum was made when “fresh in [M’s] mind”, the appellant complains that it is not clear what her Honour meant by “fresh in her mind”.
	
	
	Third, the appellant criticises her Honour’s reference to M having differentiated between the appellant and P by reference to the former’s use of pornographic VCRs (reasons pp 21; 25), on the basis that there was no further elaboration of this as a point of distinction.
	
	
	Complaint is made that, apart from “some incidental references” when summarising the contents of the JIRT interview, her Honour did not state in her reasons what M said about P in that interview or in cross-examination. The appellant identifies the “very marked similarity” of the allegations as a crucial component of the defence case and argues that her Honour was required “at the least” to set out the allegations and to explain how “given the apparently extraordinary coincidence of the much the same conduct being committed against her separately and repeatedly by 2 people” her Honour had excluded the reasonable possibility that M was simply mistaken that there was an occasion on which the appellant was the offender rather than P. It is submitted that reliance on the complaint evidence and the distinction in relation to the use of pornographic VCRs does not suffice in this regard.
	
	
	The appellant further submits that the fact that M’s descriptions were considered by her Honour to be graphic and realistic for a child does not “delimit the source of [M’s] knowledge” to abuse from the appellant; and that the tendency evidence “did not otherwise cure the case”.
	
	
	Finally, the appellant complains that, although her Honour found that N was mistaken as to dates, her Honour did not identify which dates or what was the significance of this (see reasons p 25).
	
	
	The Crown submits that the requirement to give reasons does not require the trial judge to perform the functions now contended for by the appellant (of setting out in detail the respective allegations of abuse by each of the appellant and P and then giving an explanation of how the trial judge “excluded” the reasonable possibility that M was mistaken). It is submitted that it is sufficient for the trial judge to have stated generally and briefly the grounds which led her to the conclusions reached concerning the comingling question and to have set out her findings on the principal contested issues (citing Soulezmis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd).
	
	
	The Crown argues that, while it is necessary that the judge articulate the essential ground or grounds on which the decision is based, there is authority that while in many cases the reasons for preferring one conclusion over another should be given, where the resolution depends entirely on credibility, it is (or may be) enough that the judge simply finds one way over another (citing Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd per McHugh JA at 280-281; W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [147]; Siafakas v R [2016] NSWCCA 100 at [68]; Cutajar v R [2016] NSWCCA 222 at [12].
	
	
	The appellant relies on Douglass v The Queen (2012) 86 ALJR 1086; [2012] HCA 34, where the High Court upheld an appeal as to the insufficiency of reasons. There, the Court (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) at [12] identified the error of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of South Australia as being to view the appellant’s trial as reducing to a case of “word against word” and went on to say:
	


It is a characterisation which fails to recognise that the resolution of a criminal case does not depend on whether the evidence of one witness is preferred to that of another. The resolution of a criminal trial depends upon whether the evidence taken as a whole proves the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.


	
	The Court said (at [13]) that to dismiss the complaint as to sufficiency of reasons on the footing that the trial judge’s acceptance of the complainant’s evidence necessarily carried with it rejection of the appellant’s evidence “was to overlook that the judge’s acceptance of [the complainant] as truthful was not inconsistent with the existence of a reasonable doubt as to guilt” and that:
	


Even if the judge was not persuaded by the appellant’s evidence, he could not convict unless satisfied that it was not reasonably possibly true”.


	
	The failure in that case of the trial judge to record any finding rejecting the appellant’s evidence left as one possibility that the judge “simply preferred” the complainant’s evidence and proceeded to convict upon it, applying a standard less than proof beyond reasonable doubt ([14]). The absence of reasons sufficient to exclude that possibility was what constituted legal error. However, it was unnecessary for the Court to address the consequence of that error in circumstances where the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was successful, requiring the conviction to be quashed ([14]).
	


Determination


	
	In the present case, the complaints as to adequacy of the trial judge’s consideration of the evidence and/or the defence case and as to the adequacy of her Honour’s reasons are not made good.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), the trial judge was required to include in the reasons for judgment the principles of law applied and the findings of fact on which her Honour relied. She was required to refer expressly to all warnings that would be required to be given had there been a jury. In other words, her Honour was required to expose her reasoning process (see Filippou v The Queen (2015) 256 CLR 47; [2015] HCA 29 at [6]). Her Honour was also required to explain the reason for findings of fact (Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250; [1998] HCA 68 at [30]).
	
	
	The obligation to give reasons has been considered in various authorities. Most often cited in this context is Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (albeit a case in the civil context). There, Kirby P said:
	


This decision does not require of trial judges a tedious examination of detailed evidence or a minute explanation of every step in the reasoning process that leads to the judge’s conclusion. But the judicial obligation to give reasons, and not to frustrate the legislative facility of appeal on questions of law, at least obliges a judge to state generally and briefly the grounds which have led him or her to the conclusions reached concerning disputed factual questions and to list the findings on the principal contested issues.


	
	In the present case, the trial judge did not fall into the error identified in Douglass of reducing the case to a “word against word” case. Nor did her Honour proceed on the basis that, if she accepted M’s evidence, that alone would be sufficient to convict. Rather, her Honour did what the High Court in Douglass emphasised was necessary – considering M’s evidence in the light of the whole of the evidence. Her Honour gave reasons for rejecting the comingling/conflation argument. Accepting that there is force to the criticism that on some issues (such as the presence of D at the time of the offences) her Honour’s reasoning involved simply a statement of conclusion, there was in my opinion a sufficient statement of reasons for her Honour’s ultimate satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt on the indecent assault counts.
	


Ground 3: unreasonable verdict ground


	
	As to the final ground of appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge’s advantage in seeing M give evidence could not, in the circumstances, ameliorate the difficulties with the Crown case, which should have compelled a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	This argument is based on the two issues identified earlier: lack of an opportunity to commit the assaults in the indictment period and the co-mingling argument based on the similarity of the allegations made against the appellant and P, respectively (coupled with the discrepancies in the complaint evidence). I consider each in turn.
	


Lack of opportunity


	
	The appellant emphasises N’s evidence as to the following: that throughout 2010 she and the appellant were getting more and more distant and seeing each other less and less (T 81-82); that N moved with her children back to her mother’s home in Minto for about five months when she split up with P, returning on her birthday on 22 November 2010 (T 83); that she did not see the appellant while she was living at Minto (T 83); and that she was not in contact with the appellant when she returned to Londonderry, and that he did not come around for about six months before he pleaded guilty (T 81, 83).
	
	
	The appellant argues that this effectively excluded from consideration the period from late June 2010 and therefore that the Court had to be satisfied that the alleged offences occurred in the limited period between 14 March 2010 and late June 2010.
	
	
	As to the evidence of babysitting, the appellant argues that M’s evidence (that the appellant had babysat her since she was two years old (Q/A 99-102) and to the effect that he had babysat her alone on numerous occasions (Q/A 54, 62, 63, 75, 113, 205, 284-285; read with Q/A 137; T 26-27)) is not consistent with that of N. He points to N’s evidence in chief that the appellant babysat her children a “couple of times”, including in about mid to late 2009 when she and P went away to Stockton Beach for the weekend (T 54-55) in contrast with her statement to police to the effect that the appellant did not look after her children on many occasions, and if he were around them with her not there it was a case of her going out, leaving the children with P and the appellant coming over (T 67-68). At the time of making the statement, N recalled only one occasion when the appellant babysat alone, that being the Stockton Beach trip (on which occasion the incident could not have happened).
	
	
	The appellant notes N’s evidence that after the Stockton Beach trip, the sexual relationship with the appellant stopped and they became less close (T 55, 73) and that it was some time after the Stockton Beach trip that N became aware of the H allegations (T 55).
	
	
	After MB’s call to N, N said she trusted the appellant’s denials, and thought she may have allowed him to babysit her children on “maybe a couple” of occasions (T 59) but, when cross-examined on her recollection of the appellant babysitting after she became aware of the allegations, she said “I can’t remember, to tell you the truth. He may have looked after them, he may not have looked after them” (T 69).
	
	
	W’s evidence was that when N reported to her that the appellant had been arrested over H’s allegations, she (W) asked N not to leave M and D with anyone, specifically the appellant, and she says that N replied “she doesn’t, she leaves [P] with them if she has to go out” (T 91-92). The appellant also points to the evidence that N had a friend who helped babysit and that she and P did not go out together much in the evening (T 73).
	
	
	In his ERISP, the appellant said he could not remember if he babysat M. Later, he denied that he babysat her from when she was two or three or had alone time with her. Later again, he said he could not remember whether he did or didn’t, and if he did, it would have been a “very, very” or “super rare” occasion. He could not remember being alone with her.
	
	
	The appellant submits that N’s evidence, coupled with W’s evidence and his own statements in his ERISP, did not support M’s evidence that he babysat her on numerous occasions, including alone. Apart from the Stockton Beach trip, there was no specificity as to when the appellant might have babysat her. It is submitted that there was no compelling evidence that the appellant babysat M much or, by the indictment period, at all.
	
	
	It is submitted that, since M lived with P, who did care for her in N’s absence, M’s belief in repeated babysitting by the appellant ought to have raised reasonable doubt as to whether she had mistakenly transposed the appellant for P.
	
	
	The Crown points out that it is not uncommon in child sexual assault matters for a complainant to be able to describe in detail only one specific incident of sexual misconduct (referring by way of example to HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen (2008) 235 CLR 334; [2008] HCA 16).
	
	
	The Crown points to the statements by M in her JIRT interview that the appellant “always tried” to do something to her (Q/A 54); that he “used to try and have sex with me” (Q/A 62); that, when asked how many times she watched the videos with her “uncle”, she said “Since he kept on babysitting me” (Q/A 113); and that “[h]e tried to kiss me on the lounge and have sex and all that, have sex”, that he did this “[a]ll the times he babysitted me” and that “And he used to do it all the time” (Q/A 283; 283; 287).
	
	
	The Crown also refers to the evidence of M that the appellant started babysitting her when she was two years old (Q/A 99) (based apparently on her mother taking her with her when she was one and that her mother had said the appellant could take care of her when she was two years old - Q/A 100; though she denied this was something that her mother had told her recently) and that it stopped at around her seventh birthday (see Q/A 381 as to the complaint and her mother confronting the appellant). The Crown notes that N confirmed that the appellant did babysit the complainant on occasions; and points to the appellant’s answers in his police interview.
	
	
	It is submitted that this evidence provided the basis for the finding that the abuse was persistent and ongoing.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the appellant’s assertion that the offences could only have happened between 14 March 2010 and late June 2010 (and that the period from June 2010 is effectively excluded from consideration) (see appellant’s submissions at [16], [59]) is based on the acceptance of the whole of N’s evidence but points to the finding by the trial judge that N was mistaken as to dates due to her chaotic lifestyle and drug abuse, a finding well open on the evidence. The Crown also points to the statement of the appellant that he continued to have a sexual relationship with N until the “weekend I got arrested for [H]” (Q/A 31) [which was 22 January 2010 – see Scott Jaeger [5]) Exhibit E].
	
	
	The Crown also points to the following admissions by the appellant in his recorded interview as support for M’s complaint: that he watched pornography at N’s home (Q/A 234); on a VCR (Q/A 254); 40, that (if he did babysit her) it would have been a very, very rare (super-rare) occasion (Q/A 290; 293) (earlier having said he honestly could not remember if he did or if he did not babysit M - (Q/A 286)); and that M would have seen him naked (Q/A 363).
	
	
	The Crown submits that the finding that there was contact between N and the appellant until the appellant pleaded guilty (7 March 2011) was a finding which was open on the evidence and was consistent with M’s evidence that he was at her birthday party on or around 14 March 2011.
	
	
	Thus the Crown submits that it was well open to her Honour to find that the appellant had the opportunity to commit the offences.
	


Repeated, almost identical allegations


	
	The appellant notes that in the JIRT interview M suggested that the appellant’s sexual misconduct occurred on multiple occasions (referring to Q/A 50, 102-103, 272, 286-294, cf 206-208) but that, when giving evidence in cross-examination and re-examination, M remembered just the one occasion with the appellant, and did not know if there were others (T 26, 29).
	
	
	The appellant emphasises that both in the JIRT interview and at the trial, M spoke about abuse committed upon her by P. It is suggested that the JIRT officers may have been more interested in finding out about the appellant because by then P was dead (submissions [27]).
	
	
	The appellant notes that in the JIRT interview, M described the appellant’s appearance but says that she did so “not in any distinctive, compelling way” (she said he was tall; she did not know his hair or eye colour; she said that he wore jeans and joggers, and a green shirt – see Q/A 338-340). He points out that M was not asked to, and did not, describe what P looked like.
	
	
	He points out that the conversation to which W gave evidence as to M asking whether babies grow in your bottom was put as being when M was four and that there was then a year-long period when W was not allowed to see her grandchildren (at P’s direction) (T 92).
	
	
	He also refers to N’s evidence that she and P watched pornography together in her bedroom, on probably about four DVDs and the internet; and that she threw out the DVDs when P died, and did not remember their content (T 55-56.58); though noting that M said she never watched videos on the computer (T 18).
	
	
	The appellant argues that there was no suggestion that the appellant and P orchestrated separately to abuse M in an almost identical fashion and that the suggestion that they did separately abuse her in an identical fashion is extraordinary. He points out that initially M said twice that P also played her pornographic videos and that there was pornography available in the house. It is submitted that the rest of M’s account of the repeated acts of abuse was essentially the same.
	
	
	It is submitted that, coupled with M’s questionable belief in repeated babysitting, and that she could only separately identify one incident involving the appellant and by the time she gave evidence did not know if there were others, heightens the inference that she confused them for this one occasion, when it was P who was systematically abusing her.
	
	
	As to the complaint made by the appellant as to her Honour’s findings in light of the similarity of the accusations made about P, the Crown emphasises that M consistently (both in the JIRT interview and in evidence at the trial) complained that she had been abused both by the appellant and by P; and that a major point of distinction between her description of the abuse was that the appellant showed her pornography and P did not (referring to Q/A 362, 363; T 17.40, 18.5, 29.5).
	
	
	The only suggestion to the contrary is from early in the JIRT interview at Q/A 62-63:
	


Q62.   OK. Now, you said some, They do something to me.

A   Well, my uncle used to try and have sex with me.

Q63   Yeah.

A   He showed me these videos of it and I didn’t wanna watch it and all that but he, he kept on making me, and so did my dad. And they just tried to kiss me and all of that. And I kept on tryin’ to stop them but they wouldn’t. And that’s all I could remember of that one. (my emphasis)


	
	However, it is clear by the time the detailed description is given of watching the movies that M is speaking about the appellant; and (at Q/A 362; 363) M said that P kissed her “and done the same thing” as the appellant and that he “tr[ied] and have sex and do the same things” but did not show her the videos. Cross-examined on this (T 17/18), M was (at least on paper) adamant that P did not show her the videos, only the appellant did. M answered without qualification in the JIRT interview that the appellant had started doing something to her first (before P started) (Q/A 372).
	


Complaint


	
	As to the evidence of complaint, the appellant argues that it did not provide much support for the Crown case and can be seen as furthering the argument of comingling by M of the appellant and P. The appellant contrasts M’s version with that of N.
	
	
	As to M’s version, in the JIRT interview, M said that at her seventh birthday party, in the lounge room at Londonderry while others played outside, she complained to N about the appellant (but not P as she was shy) (Q/A 370, 375-380). Her complaint was in similar terms as what she said P did. M said the appellant was at the birthday party, and N called him into the room and got angry with him and told him to stay away from her and not babysit her again (Q/A 381-384). In cross-examination she said that N tried to punch him (T 11, 13).
	
	
	In evidence-in-chief N could not remember if the appellant was at M’s seventh birthday party, but when told the year of 2011 in cross-examination said that he was not. (The appellant points out that this is consistent with her evidence that she saw the appellant less and less and that she cut off contact when he pleaded guilty, which would have been about a week earlier) (T 60-61, 79).
	
	
	In cross-examination, M agreed that she told N about what P had done at the house in Londonderry; that she was seven years old; and that P was still alive. M did not remember what she said to N nor N’s reaction but recalled that N got P to come straight into the room, yelled at him and “told him everything”. M did not remember what he said back (T 15-16). After P died, she again complained to N about P (T 23-24). There is no suggestion that she then complained about the appellant. When cross-examined, N denied that M had made a second complaint about P (T 80).
	
	
	The appellant refers to N’s evidence of M’s complaint; including that, when she spoke to M in her bedroom before the appellant had pleaded guilty to offences against H, M had initially said “no” when asked if anyone had touched her inappropriately; had then said both the appellant and P “had touched her in her bum” and then, when asked whether she was sure and telling the truth, M said “no” (T 61). In cross-examination, N agreed she asked M about “Uncle Robert” but not specifically “Dad”. N thought M may have overhead conversation between P, his then wife MB, the appellant and herself as to what was going on between them and H (T 77-79). The appellant submits that the combination of these circumstances do not provide reliable evidence of complaint against himself.
	
	
	The appellant submits that N’s evidence of her confrontation with the appellant suggests that M has mistaken a scene she witnessed with P for one with the appellant.
	
	
	There was also an inconsistency between N’s and W’s evidence about the trust circle held on 13 July 2013 (in which they both recounted a complaint by M to the effect that both P and the appellant had put their penises in her mouth or made her kiss their penises) (N at T 64-65; W at T 90-91) and M’s denial that she complained in these terms, or that it was the truth (T 24).
	
	
	The appellant notes that neither N nor W said that M ever made a complaint about the appellant in separate or in different terms from that against P.
	
	
	The Crown points out that the assessment of the credibility and reliability of the evidence of witnesses in the present case was quintessentially one for the trial judge to determine (referring to what was said by RA Hulme J in Atai v R [2014] NSWCCA 210 at [134]). The Crown emphasises the advantage her Honour had in seeing not only the complainant M but also her mother N give evidence. The Crown also points to the significant support for the Crown case found in the tendency evidence, namely the tendency of the appellant to have a sexual interest in young girls aged between six and seven who were in his sole care and that he was prepared to act on that interest. The Crown points out that, at roughly the same time as the appellant was babysitting M, he was sexually abusing his seven year old daughter H (and on at least one of those occasions he was babysitting H when her mother went out).
	


Determination


	
	In Filippou v The Queen, the majority (French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ) made clear (at [11]-[12]) that the finding of guilt in a judge alone trial is to be treated as if it were a jury’s finding of guilt. In the absence of a misdirection leading to a miscarriage of justice, such a finding is not to be disturbed unless, relevantly, there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the evidence is all one way or the finding is otherwise unreasonable. This Court has applied this principle recently in Parton v R [2016] NSWCCA 291.
	
	
	In M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; [1994] HCA 63 at 493, the High Court (going on to recognise (at 494) that a doubt experienced by an appellate court, making full allowance for the advantage enjoyed by the trial judge, will be a doubt which the trial judge ought to have experienced) said that:
	


Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. (footnotes omitted)


	
	In Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559; [2007] HCA 30, Hayne J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed) said (at [113]):
	


It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant’s guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence that the complainant and the appellant gave that was relevant to the issue of consent to the digital penetration that had occurred in the park. That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt. (my emphasis; footnotes omitted)


	
	In Filippou, at [12], the plurality adopted and adapted the following from M v The Queen:
	


It is only where a [judge’s] advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may …conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. ... If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the [judge], there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.""


	
	I have carefully reviewed the transcript of the proceedings and exhibits admitted into evidence at the trial, though I have not had the benefit of observing the recording of the JIRT interview or the ERISP.
	
	
	That material, and particularly the cogency of the description by M of the sexual and indecent acts that were done to her, leaves me in no doubt that she was subjected to sexual abuse; and on more than one occasion. As the trial judge noted, her description of the flaccid penis against her anus is particularly telling; so also is her graphic description of the video she was made to watch during the one incident that she remembered with particularity. So too is her description of the “hump hump hump” motion as the penis went up and down. But for the description of the penis as light and soft; and the fact that though it felt bad it did not hurt, the description of the abuse stopping when “he pulls it out” of her “bum hole” would have supported a conclusion of anal penetration.
	
	
	Here, the trial judge’s undoubted advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence of M, through both the JIRT interview and during her evidence on CCTV, cannot be underestimated. Not only did M describe what happened to her in terms that her Honour accepted, and understandably so, were particularly telling, M also demonstrated the rubbing/tickling in the area of her vagina that her Honour considered clearly demonstrated an act with a sexual connotation. As I read the transcript, M also demonstrated the manner in which she was pulled onto the perpetrator’s lap and how they were sitting. Similarly, the trial judge was in the position to see both N and W give their evidence.
	
	
	The appellant does not seek to persuade this Court that sexual abuse of the kind comprised in counts 1A and 2 did not occur. Rather, he argues that the trial judge should have had (and this Court must have) a reasonable doubt as to whether the offences occurred in the indictment period and as to whether he was the offender or, which he contends, whether M had conflated him in her mind with P (against whom she made almost identical allegations).
	
	
	As to the asserted lack of opportunity, there is no doubt that N was unreliable in her recollection of dates - perhaps in part caused by her confusion or misunderstanding as to the stages in the criminal justice process; perhaps also by the fact that for a period of time she acknowledged she had a drug abuse problem.
	
	
	Taking W’s evidence (that N stayed with her in Minto for “a couple of months” - T 88.45, until she and P “were starting to date again”), the period in which there would have been opportunity for the offences to be committed cannot necessarily be confined to the three month period contended for by the appellant. On W’s evidence the period in which access was possible during the indictment period would have been from March 2010 through to about September 2010.
	
	
	Nor is the happening of the offence during the indictment period properly described as an element of the offence. In that regard, it is relevant to note that the appellant’s access to M clearly extended back at least to September 2009 and for a time before that when he was involved in the sexual relationship with P and N (when he admits that he was at the Londonderry house). He had a familiarity not only with the layout of the house but of matters such as that the VCR player in the bedroom did not work (according to him). And his denial of having babysat M at the age of two can be contrasted with his acceptance that he may have babysat her or the children at Londonderry.
	
	
	There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt (as she clearly was) that on at least one occasion around March 2010 (or thereabouts) when M was around six years old, through to somewhere towards the end of that year, the offences happened.
	
	
	As to the conflation or comingling argument, the most striking point to note is that the allegation of abuse by both men was made by a child who lived with one of the men she was accusing (and who she thought was her father) and the other was familiar to her as someone she thought was her uncle. It beggars belief that she would not know the difference between the two men. There was certainly no suggestion that they were so alike in their features that they might have been confused.
	
	
	The complaint made in March 2011 when (as the trial judge pointed out) conduct occurring sometime during the previous year would have been fresh in her mind. At the very least it would have been more fresh than it was when she had her interview with JIRT and, later, when she gave evidence at the trial in March 2015. That complaint extended to conduct by both P and the appellant. True it is that there were discrepancies in the complaint evidence -particularly, whether N told M at the time of the first complaint that if it were true they would have to leave the home and whether M referred to kissing the appellants’ penises at the time of the “trust circle” complaint. However, the touching of her bottom was common amongst the differing accounts given of M’s two complaints.
	
	
	The significance attributed by the trial judge to the differentiation made by M as to who showed her the videos was in my opinion well placed. I accept that in the JIRT interview M twice suggested that P had also made her watch videos. However, it was (seemingly emphatically) denied both when the account was clarified at the end of the JIRT interview and at the trial. The reference to “so did my dad” was in response to a question exploring what she meant by saying “[t]hey do something to me”, to which M had said “well, my uncle used to try and have sex with me” and then elaborated on that answer by referring to the videos. In that context, it is possible that the words “and so did my dad” related to him trying to have sex with her. It would be necessary to see the recorded interview in order to form an opinion as to how that was said at the time. The corrected answer at Q/A 105 (‘like my dad”) is, at least on paper, a clearer response linking P to the showing of pornographic videos. That makes more critical the ability to have seen the manner in which M answered the various questions because later in the interview it was M who volunteered that P did not show her the videos (about which she was later cross-examined).
	
	
	If M had indeed conflated the two men in her mind there would have been no occasion for her to have distinguished between them in this regard. Nor is there any obvious reason for her to have deliberately sought to introduce such a distinction. Moreover, her description of the appellant bringing the videos in a bag (coupled with her detailed description of how the movie was shown on the video player) is again particularly telling.
	
	
	Where the appellant’s submission has some force is in the unlikelihood that two men would separately abuse M in precisely or almost precisely the same way. Counsel for the appellant emphasised, more than once, the extraordinary or inherent unlikelihood of the same “peculiar” allegation being made in relation to two men (using “peculiar” in the sense of “particular”, not in the sense of “strange”). I accept that there was no suggestion of any orchestration between the two men. However, there need not have been orchestration between them to give rise to the possibility that each separately engaged in substantially the same acts with M (even though their common participation in other joint sexual activity was with an adult not a child). Counsel for the appellant accepted that this was a factor that might be taken into account (AT 7.24) but maintained that it nevertheless did not lessen the unlikelihood of the two men independently doing the same thing to M (other than, if M’s evidence is accepted, showing her the videos).
	
	
	That said, he evidence said to be critical in emphasising the identical nature of the allegations was in truth a list of things put to the appellant by defence counsel (and largely accepted by M in monosyllabic answers), but not including the one differentiating factor that M was not shaken on in cross-examination (the showing of the videos).
	
	
	In those circumstances, having regard to the tendency evidence, to M’s familiarity with the men, and to the fact that from the time of the first complaint M identified both men as having abused her, I am not persuaded that there is a significant possibility that the appellant has been wrongly convicted. When full allowance is made for the advantage enjoyed by the trial judge in that regard, I am not persuaded that the evidence is such that the trial judge must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt; nor that there has been a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Leave is required to appeal on the basis of ground 3 (s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)). As that ground is linked with the first two grounds of appeal for which leave would not be necessary, I would grant such leave in relation to the third ground of appeal but would dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Ward JA. I agree with her Honour that the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	With respect to grounds 1 and 2, I am not satisfied that the trial judge’s reasons were inadequate or that she failed to consider all of the evidence and the defence case for the reasons set out by Ward JA.
	
	
	With respect to ground 3, I too am not persuaded, for the reasons set out by her Honour at [209] – [222], that the trial judge ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. My agreement with her Honour on this ground was reached after an independent examination of the trial evidence. In particular, I have had regard to the complainant’s interview and evidence at trial, which are summarised by Ward JA at [45]-[76].
	
	
	This ground was based on a submission that the trial judge ought to have had a reasonable doubt about when the offences took place and also as to whether the complainant had conflated or comingled the appellant with [P]. It was not suggested that the trial judge ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to whether the indecent assaults had occurred. This is no doubt because the description of the assaults given to police by the complainant when she was nine years old was so compelling. I share the trial judge’s observation that some of the complainant’s evidence had an “extraordinary ring of truth” to it (see extract at [106] above).
	
	
	I have had close regard to the complainant’s evidence regarding the allegations made against both the appellant and [P]. I am satisfied that, although the complainant was cross-examined at length about the assaults upon her by [P], she was nonetheless able to differentiate between the two men by the appellant’s use of pornographic videos. In her interview, the complainant was also able to state that, out of the two men, it was the appellant who did something to her first. I am not satisfied that the trial judge ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt concerning the appellant’s guilt on the basis that the complainant also made complaints about [P] at the same time. The complainant was familiar with both men and was able to differentiate between them.
	
	
	Despite this, as Ward JA has pointed out at [229], there is some force in the appellant’s contention that it is unlikely that two men would sexually assault the complainant in such a strikingly similar manner. I have had particular regard to this submission. As Ward JA has noted, the two men in question had regularly engaged in sexual activity together with the complainant’s mother. It seems to me that this fact reduces the unlikelihood that both of them would independently act towards the complainant in the same particular way. The appellant’s argument would carry more weight if the two men were strangers. In addition, the complainant did not volunteer two separate accounts that were substantially the same in her JIRT interview; it was only in cross-examination that the child agreed with a list of propositions that were put to her by defence counsel.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon tendency evidence at trial. The appellant had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his own daughter when she was seven years old at about the same time as the allegations concerning the complainant, at which time the complainant was aged six years old. The appellant told police in his ERISP that he believed that the complainant was also his biological daughter. The tendency relied upon was that the appellant had a sexual interest in young girls aged between six and eight years of age whom the accused believed to be biologically related to him. This evidence adds further support to the Crown case.
	
	
	In Filippou v The Queen (at [12]) their Honours stated that, to “adopt and adapt the language of M v The Queen”, it is only when a trial judge’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. I agree with Ward JA’s observation at [210] that this is a matter in which the trial judge’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence of the complainant, both in the JIRT interview played as her evidence in chief at trial and her cross-examination at trial, cannot be underestimated. The trial judge described the complainant as “honest and accurate” and stated that she gave an account that was “reliable” and “compelling”. The trial judge concluded that the complainant’s evidence stood up to the level of scrutiny required. I have had regard to the advantage experienced by the trial judge when considering the trial evidence. I am not satisfied that the trial judge ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt in this matter.

4771474,Sharma v R [2017] NSWCCA 85,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	WALTON J: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J for the reasons given by his Honour.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Amit Sharma (""the applicant"") was sentenced by her Honour Judge Huggett in the District Court at Sydney on 22 April 2016 to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. The sentence was specified to commence on 24 July 2015.
	
	
	The sentence was imposed in respect of four offences (counts 2, 3, 5 and 6 on the indictment) with one further offence listed on a Form 1 document taken into account in relation to count 5. Each offence was contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The details of the offences, the maximum penalties (""max"") and the indicative sentences (derived after a 10 per cent discount for the applicant's late pleas of guilty) are set out in the following table. In relation to counts 5 and 6 the standard non-parole period (""SNPP"") is prescribed by Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

	The applicant was also sentenced on the revocation of a previously imposed good behaviour bond. The judge imposed a term of imprisonment for 3 months dating from 24 July 2015. It was totally subsumed by the aggregate sentence, a course her Honour chose because the breach of the bond was taken into account as an aggravating circumstance.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


1   Her Honour erred in finding that the two offences contrary to s 61I Crimes Act 1900 of sexual intercourse without consent were ""serious offences of their type"".

2   Her Honour failed to make a proper assessment of the objective seriousness [of the two offences] contrary to s 61I Crimes Act 1900.

3   The aggregate sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive.

Facts


	
	Given the nature of the offences the complainants cannot be identified (s 578A of the Crimes Act). Counts 2 and 3 concerned a complainant who I will refer to by the pseudonym ""Jane"". Counts 5 and 6 and the offence on the Form 1 concerned another complainant, ""Alice"".
	
	
	The facts concerning the offences were agreed by the parties. I summarise as follows.
	


Counts 2 and 3 concerning Jane


	
	The applicant lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Alexandria. He occupied one of the bedrooms and the other was occupied by two female English tourists.
	
	
	Jane was a 29-year old American tourist who arrived in Australia on 13 March 2014. She had previously posted her profile on a website set up to connect tourists with locals who are prepared to accommodate them in their homes, generally by sleeping on a couch (""the website""). The applicant responded to Jane's post and some email communication ensued. The applicant gave Jane his telephone number.
	
	
	Jane planned to stay in Sydney for two weeks before travelling to Brisbane. She planned to stay with a friend in St Peters during the first week and at the applicant's home during the second week. She made contact by text message with the applicant the day after her arrival. There were subsequent communications which resulted in them going out together on the evening of the following day. They went to a number of bars where alcohol was consumed. The applicant became intoxicated to the extent that Jane had to help him to stand. She had planned to return to her friend's place but he persuaded her to come back to his place.
	
	
	More alcohol was consumed at the applicant's apartment. Jane became tired and wanted to go home. The applicant implored her a number of times to come into his bedroom but she repeatedly declined. She said she would stay on the couch which was the arrangement for when she was to stay at his place the following week.
	
	
	The applicant kissed Jane and she responded for a short time before stopping and telling him to go to bed. He again asked her to come to his bedroom but she told him that things between them were not going any further. He said, ""Yeah, we are just friends but I can kiss you and touch your tits if I want to"". She repeated her rejection. Eventually he went to bed and she fell asleep on the couch.
	
	
	Sometime later while she was asleep, Jane felt the applicant beside her. He put his arm over her and they both fell asleep. Not long after, she awoke to find him on top of her trying to kiss her. She was fully clothed but he was naked from the waist down and had an erection. She did not respond to his kissing and was moving her head to avoid him, saying, ""No, please get off me"".
	
	
	Jane was unable to get up because the applicant was kneeling on her biceps (causing bruising) as she was lying on her back. He was pinning her hands above her head. She protested, asked to be left alone, and told him to get off her. The applicant responded to Jane’s protests by repeatedly saying “Ssshhh”. At one point he let go of her hands and began grabbing her breasts. She struggled but was unable to move away. He grabbed one of her hands and tried to move it towards his penis but she said, ""No, I don't want to, please stop, please leave me alone"".
	
	
	Eventually Jane was able to knee the applicant, causing him to fall back on the couch. She then grabbed her phone and began running around the unit trying to find the door. She was disoriented and was repeatedly saying that she needed to get out of there and go home and ""this is not okay"". When she eventually found the door and had it partly open the applicant grabbed her right arm forcefully and tried to pull her back into the unit towards the couch. She managed to maintain her grip on the door, saying ""this is not okay, I need to go home"". She begged him to leave her alone. She broke free of his grip and fled from the apartment, shaking and scared.
	
	
	The applicant sent Jane a text message the following morning asking what happened and she replied. The effect of the applicant’s responses was that he professed no memory of his behaviour and he was sorry. He asked her to ""forget about it"" (and he said in his evidence before the sentencing judge that he said this because he did not want her to go to the police (POS 12.8)). He asked to meet her in order to apologise but she declined. She did not respond to his subsequent attempts to call her.
	
	
	Jane's friend asked if she wanted to report the matter to police but she said she just wanted to forget about it. However, in a subsequent telephone conversation with her sister she was encouraged to report the matter in case it happened to someone else. Accordingly, on 20 March Jane reported the incident to the website and on 21 March she reported it to the police.
	


Counts 5 and 6 and the Form 1 offence concerning Alice


	
	Alice was a 29-year old tourist from Canada who arrived in Sydney on 19 March 2014 (three days after the incident with Jane). She booked into a hostel in the city and, on the recommendation of a friend, she posted her profile on the website. That evening she received a response from the applicant and they exchanged telephone numbers. She suggested that they meet before she agreed to stay at his apartment. That evening they met in the city and went to a hotel.
	
	
	They went to various places and at some stage Alice agreed to stay the night at the applicant's apartment. They watched a movie in the applicant's bedroom, using headphones so as not to disturb the tourists staying in the other bedroom. When it finished the applicant persistently tried to convince her to stay with him but she left and went out to the couch where she slept.
	
	
	The next day (20 March) the applicant took her to various beaches and that evening they went to a nightclub until 3.00 am. When they returned to his apartment he again tried to persuade her to stay with him in his bedroom but she refused. At 5.06am the applicant sent Alice a text message saying she should find somewhere else to stay from tomorrow. Soon after that he came out of his bedroom to the couch and eventually persuaded her to join him in his bed. This was after she had said that she had a boyfriend and was not going to do anything with him. Once in his bed he put his arm around her and was touching her arm. She fell asleep.
	
	
	Sometime later she became aware of the applicant touching her and kissing her breasts. She was dazed and thought it was her boyfriend. (This is the indecent assault offence taken into account.)
	
	
	Alice then felt a hand moving down her stomach and inside her leggings. She next recalled her vagina being licked in a hurried manner. She awoke and looked down to see the applicant's head between her legs. She said, ""stop"" and tried to push his head away but could not. He proceeded to lick inside and outside her vagina, notwithstanding her repeated demands to ""stop"". (Count 5)
	
	
	The applicant desisted from that activity but then pulled Alice's singlet top down over her body and legs, causing her to be completely naked. He recommenced licking her vagina and then inserted his finger about five or six times while she was saying, ""No, no"". (Count 6)
	
	
	The applicant was kissing Alice's stomach and breasts as she was trying to push his head away. He also tried to kiss her on the mouth. She could feel that his penis was erect. At one point he shifted his body weight which enabled her to move from underneath him but not quite get completely free. She curled up in a ball and he got off her. She put her clothes back on and went to the bathroom and showered before leaving the apartment.
	
	
	Alice spent the next day walking to Coogee and Bondi Beach. She later called the applicant to arrange to collect her possessions. She met him in the city where he was playing pool with a friend. The three returned to the unit so that she could retrieve her things.
	
	
	That evening the police attended the applicant's home to execute a crime scene warrant in relation to the complaint by Jane. They asked the two female tourists and Alice whether the applicant had made any advances towards them. Alice broke down in tears and began shaking. She replied, ""Yes, yes he has, he raped me this morning, I didn't know what to do"".
	


Assessment of objective gravity of the offences


	
	The learned judge's discussion of matters relevant to her assessment of the objective gravity was quite detailed. After noting features of the offence of indecent assault in Count 3 concerning Jane she said, ""There can be no doubt that Count 3 is a very serious offence of its type"". The offence in count 2 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was ""undeniably serious"", more because of the circumstances in which it occurred than the seriousness of the bodily harm.
	
	
	Her Honour discussed various matters relevant to Counts 5 and 6 before announcing that, ""All things considered I am of the view that counts 5 and 6 are serious offences of their type"".
	


The applicant's personal circumstances


	
	There is no complaint about the manner in which the sentencing judge had regard to the evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances. The following are drawn from the judgment.
	
	
	The applicant was born in India in 1985. He was aged 28 at the time of the offences. He did not have any adverse experiences in his formative years in India aside from having been sexually assaulted at the age of seven by an older male cousin. This was a matter he had forgotten about until he was interviewed by a psychologist prior to sentencing. His family circumstances were favourable and he did well at school.
	
	
	The applicant came to Australia on a student visa at the age of 23. His father passed away a short time later. His mother was left in debt and he tried to assist her financially. He completed a course in hospitality at a college. He had worked in a retail store, as a pizza delivery driver and as a warehouse assistant where he had been promoted to a managerial position.
	
	
	The applicant was married, having met his wife online in 2010. They have no children. She experienced anxiety and depression which caused problems in their marriage. This led the applicant to excessive drinking and gambling and they separated in 2012. They reunited for a time and again separated some months before the offences in March 2014. In the latter period the applicant was described as engaging in party-type behaviour, drinking to excess at clubs and bars, mostly with international tourists. He appeared to have few friends in Australia.
	
	
	Two psychologists assessed the applicant as likely suffering from an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood at the time of the index offences and a previous indecent assault offence. On the basis of his history of alcohol use in early 2014 he was also assessed as meeting the diagnostic threshold for alcohol use disorder (mild and in remission in a controlled environment).
	
	
	The applicant had a previous conviction for an offence of indecent assault. On 22 May 2013 in the Local Court he entered a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of 12 months. It was an aggravating feature that he was subject to this bond at the time of the index offences.
	
	
	The judge noted the circumstances in which the applicant entered his pleas of guilty. On 10 August 2015 he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing seven counts, count 2 being an alternative to count 1. A voir dire hearing proceeded in relation to two aspects of evidence the Crown proposed to lead. One concerned the use of tendency reasoning across the counts concerning Jane and Alice but the applicant's objection was rejected.
	
	
	The other objection concerned the Crown's proposal to call two other young women to give tendency evidence. The judge ruled in favour of the applicant in respect of one of them but not the other. This other woman was the victim of the indecent assault for which the applicant was on a bond. Initially the Crown said it was experiencing difficulty locating her. Resolution of a question whether the Crown could adduce her evidence by way of tendering a transcript of her evidence before the Local Court was deferred.
	
	
	A jury was empanelled the following day (11 August). Later that day the Crown indicated that the witness had been located and was willing to give evidence. The proceedings were adjourned to the following day.
	
	
	On 12 August 2015, following negotiations, the applicant was re-arraigned and entered pleas of guilty to the index offences. The plea in respect of count 2 was accepted in full satisfaction of count 1. The offence in count 4 was put on a Form 1 document. No further proceedings were taken in respect of count 7.
	


Findings as to subjective matters


	
	The judge said that the applicant's psychological disorder or condition was relevant in reducing his moral culpability such that general deterrence, retribution and denunciation had slightly less weight. However, given that at least by the time of the offences concerning Alice the applicant acted with knowledge of what he was doing and the gravity of it, she said the moderation to the otherwise appropriate sentences would not be great.
	
	
	Specific deterrence was held to be relevant given the offences were committed in breach of a good behaviour bond. That bond was imposed in respect of the applicant's only prior conviction and his limited criminal history was a matter which entitled him to some leniency.
	
	
	Her Honour was satisfied that the applicant was genuinely, albeit belatedly, remorseful.
	
	
	Findings were made that the applicant's risk of re-offending was low and his prospects of rehabilitation were good. In this respect, the judge referred to the revival of the applicant's relationship with his wife; his disavowal of alcohol consumption and ""the party life""; and his statements of positive intentions concerning self-improvement, employment and financially supporting his mother and family in India.
	
	
	Special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were found to warrant a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.
	


Grounds 1 and 2 - errors in assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences of sexual intercourse without consent (counts 5 and 6)


	
	The applicant's submissions in respect of these grounds commenced with an acknowledgment that all offences of sexual intercourse without consent are serious. It was submitted that the judge was required to do more than simply state that in this case the offences ""were serious offences of their type"".
	
	
	The circumstances relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences that were identified by the applicant were:
	


a)   The initial contact between the applicant and Alice occurred as a result of him attempting to meet people. The judge rejected the Crown's contention that he was a predator seeking women in order to sexually assault them. She accepted that he had an initial belief that Alice might be sexually interested him.

b)   The initial 36 hours or so of the applicant's contact with Alice involved a friendly social relationship.

c)   Alice had agreed to sleep in the applicant's bed.

d)   Although Alice disabused the applicant of the notion that she was sexually interested in him, the period of time in which the applicant went beyond what was consented to was comparatively short.

e)   The acts of intercourse were of short duration and there was little use of force or coercion.

f)   There were no threats or pressure before the offences to ensure compliance or afterwards to ensure silence.

g)   Alice was not obviously terrified or upset afterwards in that she was content to meet the applicant again in order to obtain her possessions.

h)   Alice made no complaint until specifically asked by police whether the applicant had done anything to her.

i)   The acts of intercourse comprised cunnilingus (count 5) and digital/vaginal penetration (count 6). There are a number of other forms of intercourse are far more intrusive, humiliating and degrading.


	
	It was contended that when all relevant matters were considered, ""the facts of the case place the offence[s] at the less serious end of the spectrum for sexual intercourse without consent"". A correct assessment would have been that both offences were ""below the mid-range and towards the lower end of seriousness for offences contemplated by the section"".
	
	
	In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant advanced arguments to the effect that there was error in the sense referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 in that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account a relevant consideration and taken into account an irrelevant consideration.
	
	
	The irrelevant consideration was that in the course of discussing the various matters relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences the judge made reference to the fact that the applicant was on a good behaviour bond which was a matter of aggravation.
	
	
	The second House error, a failure to take into account a relevant consideration, was a failure to identify and take into account that the offences involved ""a very low level of violence"".
	
	
	The third error was said to arise in the following passage of the sentencing remarks:
	


""While each offence would appear to have been of relatively short duration, I am mindful that sexual offending often occurs over a short period of time and placing undue focus on the duration of such offending has the capacity to minimise, if not completely ignore the profound effects such offending can have upon a victim. (See R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56.)""


	
	Counsel for the applicant pointed out that R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 was concerned with sexual offences against a child and sought to distinguish the present case where the victim was an adult.
	


Relatively short duration of offending


	
	Dealing with the various points raised in reverse order, when asked why the ""relatively short duration"" of the offending should differ in its significance depending upon whether the victim was a child or an adult, counsel for the applicant responded, ""I don't seek to push that submission to any great extent"". (31.3.17 at T8.20)
	
	
	In my view, the proposition is difficult to sustain. In R v Daley [2010] NSWCCA 223 (a case concerned with an adult victim) Price J said (at [48]):
	


""As the respondent has pointed to the short duration of the offence, I propose now to deal with this issue. In R v Hibberd (2009) 194 A Crim R 1 I said at [56] that the duration of the offence was a relevant consideration in the assessment of the seriousness of an offence contrary to s 61I Crimes Act. I wish to make it clear that the short duration of a sexual assault would not ordinarily be considered as a factor which reduces the objective seriousness of the offence. Most sexual assaults will not be prolonged as the offender will seek to avoid apprehension. On the other hand, a sexual assault of an extended duration will necessarily add to the seriousness of the offending as the suffering and the humiliation of the victim will be increased. The short duration of the present offence neither mitigated nor magnified the objective seriousness of the offence. The degree of violence, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation were all relevant considerations in determining where on the scale of objective seriousness the offence lay: R v Gebrail (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 November 1994, unreported) at [10-11] per Mahoney JA.""


	
	In the impugned passage of the sentencing remarks set out above (at [52]), I see the sentencing judge doing no more than identifying the ""relatively short duration"" of the offences as being a relevant matter but stating (correctly, with respect) that one must be careful not to make too much of it in the assessment of the objective seriousness because it is not an uncommon feature. As Leeming JA observed in Cowling v R [2015] NSWCCA 213 at [16], citing R v Daley, the short duration of a sexual assault ""would not ordinarily be regarded as a factor which reduced its objective seriousness"".
	
	
	No error is established in this respect.
	


Very low level of violence


	
	There is a significant limitation on taking into account violence in an offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. To take into account that there was intentional or reckless infliction of actual bodily harm, or a threat to inflict such harm by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, would infringe the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 because such aggravating features would render an offender liable to punishment for a more serious offence (that against s 61J): R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186 at [23].
	
	
	It is true that a threat of inflicting actual bodily harm (not by means of an offensive weapon etc) or physical force short of inflicting such harm could be taken into account as an aggravating factor, however a failure to refer to the absence of an aggravating factor is not erroneous. The requirement to explain the reasons for imposing a sentence do not extend to the need to identify the absence of every factor that might aggravate the seriousness of an offence if present.
	
	
	The judge referred to some matters relevant to sexual offences in an introductory fashion when discussing the objective seriousness of the offences. She specifically mentioned that they included ""whether violence or force was used"". It may be assumed, therefore, that if she was satisfied that there was ""violence or force"" she would have mentioned it. It follows from the absence of such mention that she was cognisant of the fact that there was a ""very low level of violence"".
	
	
	No error is established in relation to this matter either.
	


Error in the assessment of objective seriousness?


	
	But for one aspect (to which I shall return) I see no error in the manner in which the judge articulated her assessment of the objective seriousness of the s 61I offences. In the course of her discussion on this topic she mentioned the following:
	


●   It was an element of the offences that there was a lack of consent and that the offender knew this to be the case. (ROS 16)

●   The act constituting Count 5 occurred in the face of Alice repeatedly saying ""No"" and trying to push the offender's head away. (ROS 17)

●   The act constituting Count 6 occurred after he had pulled Alice's top down, causing her to be completely naked. He was also kissing her stomach, breasts and mouth as she was trying to push his head away. (ROS 17)

●   Both offences occurred in circumstances where Alice had expressly informed the offender that she had a boyfriend and was not interested in sexual contact of any sort with him. (ROS 17)

●   The offence in Count 6 was more serious than the offence in Count 5 in that it involved several acts of penetration after the offender had removed Alice's top exposing her breasts, she having by then said ""no"" many times. However, given Count 5 had the offence on the Form 1 attached, the indicative sentences would be the same. (ROS 17)

●   The offender had engendered in Alice (and Jane) a feeling that each would be welcome and safe in his unit which was located in an area unfamiliar to Alice (and Jane). (ROS 18)

●   The offender initially had a belief that Alice (and Jane) might have been sexually interested in him. But he was disavowed of that in very clear terms when his advances were resisted. (ROS 18)

●   He was on notice at the time of the offences concerning Alice that he had tried to take advantage of Jane and that he had ""scared her shitless"". Despite this, he sought out another female traveller, drank alcohol with her and forced himself upon her when she had told him, ""No"". (ROS 18-19) ""It is in this way that the offender's behaviour can be described as determined and deliberate and to a limited extent predatory"". (ROS 19)

●   The offences concerning Alice (and Jane) were of relatively short duration but this should not receive undue focus because that could minimise, if not completely ignore, the profound effects such offending can have upon a victim. (ROS 19)


	
	It was after making reference to these matters (and the matter I will mention shortly) that the sentencing judge stated her conclusion that the offences concerning Alice were ""serious offences of their type"". There is no requirement for a sentencing judge to rank the objective seriousness of the offences on a scale; rather, the requirement is that a judge ""identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed"": Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [29]. The High Court merely requires that there be such an assessment of objective seriousness and this is what her Honour did.
	
	
	Whilst her Honour’s broad expression is not erroneous, the term ""serious offences of their type"" is open to the criticism that it is vague or imprecise. It has been held that it is not inappropriate for sentencing judges to make an assessment of objective offending according to a scale of seriousness: Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153; 227 A Crim R 184 at [33] per Davies J (citing R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 at [18]-[19]; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [45] and [47]). Whilst greater precision may be desirable, it is not essential.
	


Taking into account offending whilst on conditional liberty


	
	In the course of recounting the various factors relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences the judge said:
	


""It is a matter of aggravation that at the time of each offence the offender was on a bond to be of good behaviour."" (ROS 19.2)


	
	Whilst this proposition itself is uncontroversial, its location in the part of the sentencing remarks assessing objective seriousness supports the inference for which the applicant contends, namely that her Honour took this into account in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. Taking into account a matter personal to the offender, such as that the offending occurred while he or she was subject to conditional liberty (e.g. Boney v R [2015] NSWCCA 291 at [18]-[20]) or had a criminal history (e.g. McCabe v R [2016] NSWCCA 7 at [15]-[23]) is erroneous in light of R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [24] per Spigelman CJ and at [81] per Barr and Bell JJ and Muldrock v The Queen at [27].
	
	
	I accept that this error may well be the result of an inadvertent slip in the order in which matters were addressed in an ex tempore sentencing judgment. If the statement by the sentencing judge had appeared two paragraphs later there could be no complaint. However, on the face of it, error has been established.
	


Resentencing


	
	It is unnecessary to deal with Ground 3 (manifest excess) in its terms but there is utility in discussing some of the submissions that were made as they are relevant to the task of re-exercising the sentencing discretion that becomes necessary in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	The applicant pointed to a number of favourable findings made by the sentencing judge. These are included above under the heading ""Findings as to subjective matters"". These findings should be maintained.
	
	
	Judicial Commission sentencing statistics were relied upon in support of a submission that the indicative sentences assessed for the s 61I offences were relatively high in this case. This claim does not appear to be supported by the statistics. I note that included amongst the well-known limitations on having regard to sentencing statistics, for this particular offence about half of the offenders in the database had pleaded guilty and it would be fair to assume that a reasonable proportion of them would have received a greater reduction of sentence on account of their pleas than the applicant did. Further, 30 per cent of the offenders had no previous convictions. I note also that when the factor ""Priors - same type"" is selected (offenders with previous sexual assault offences without having a custodial sentence imposed), although the number of cases in the database is reduced substantially, the picture is somewhat different and the indicative terms assessed in the offender's case do not appear out of the ordinary.
	
	
	A table of cases concerned with sentencing for s 61I offences where the act constituting the intercourse was either digital penetration or cunnilingus was provided by the applicant. It is useful in identifying the range of conduct and other pertinent circumstances that may be encountered, although subjective matters in each case vary, sometimes quite significantly. I have had regard to the cases in this table in a broad sense in reflecting upon the sentence I consider should be imposed in this case.
	
	
	I have had regard to the matters referred to by the primary judge in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the each of the offences (of course with the exception of the applicant being on conditional liberty). I agree with her assessment that they are serious but compared to the range of conduct that may be encountered I agree with the applicant's submission that they are below the middle of the range, but in my view this is not by any substantial margin.
	
	
	The aggravating factor of the offences being committed whilst on a bond to be of good behaviour for offending of the same type is a significant matter.
	
	
	Two affidavits were read in the event that the Court was moved to resentence. The applicant deposed that he was being held in protection but this would appear to be in a form that does not impose any significant restrictions in that he also speaks of engaging in work, exercise, bible study and courses. He also mentions having no misconduct or disciplinary offences whilst in custody. He enjoys the support of his wife and maintains contact with his family in India. Confirmation of most of these matters is found in the documents annexed to the affidavit of the applicant's solicitor.
	
	
	This evidence supports this Court maintaining the findings made by the primary judge as to the applicant's low risk of re-offending and good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	A matter of controversy arose during the hearing of the application, namely that it would be open to this Court in re-exercising the sentencing discretion to form its own view of the amount by which the indicative sentences should be reduced on account of the applicant's very late pleas of guilty and the manner in which the totality principal should be applied in assessing an appropriate aggregate sentence. Counsel for the applicant argued that in the absence of a Crown appeal the Court should not make findings that would be adverse to the applicant in these respects. Leave was granted at counsel for the applicant's request to file further written submissions. Senior counsel was engaged for that purpose. What was received was a lengthy submission mostly directed to the proposition that the Court should not impose a sentence greater than that imposed in the court below.
	
	
	It is uncontroversial that the task for this Court is to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, taking into account the purposes of sentencing and all matters relevant, both objective and personal, to the applicant. The three possible outcomes are that compared to the original aggregate sentence the Court will find that the same, a lesser, or a greater aggregate sentence should be passed. The manner in which it should proceed in each case was clearly described in Kentwell v The Queen at [43]. Nothing was said at the hearing of the application that could be taken as an indication that the Court might act in a contrary fashion.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the indicative sentences should be reduced on account of the applicant's pleas of guilty but it should be by less than 10 per cent. The further submissions on behalf of the applicant briefly addressed this issue. Those submissions cited two cases where the plea was entered after the commencement of a trial and a 10 per cent discount was given, as well as a case discussing the considerations relevant to the discount. I have noted these cases, but as the submissions made no argument about how those cases relate to the applicant’s circumstances I found them to be of limited utility.
	
	
	Having regard to the fact that the pleas were entered at an extremely late stage as described earlier (at [37]-[40]), their utilitarian value was quite marginal. A 5 per cent reduction should be allowed (although there will be some rounding down in the applicant's favour in order to achieve a practical outcome).
	
	
	In the assessment of an appropriate aggregate sentence the totality principle should be applied in a manner that has regard to the fact that the offences concerned two different victims. Further, there was criminality in the commission of the offence in Count 6 that cannot be subsumed by the sentence assessed for Count 5. However, I agree with the reasons of the primary judge for the indicative sentences for those offences being the same.
	


Conclusion


	
	The indicative sentence of imprisonment for the offence in Count 2 should be 11 months (derived from a starting point of 12 months).
	
	
	The indicative sentence for Count 3 should be 1 year 10 months (starting point 2 years).
	
	
	The indicative sentences for each of Counts 5 (taking into account the Form 1 offence) and 6 should be 5 years 8 months (starting point 6 years) with non-parole periods of 4 years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence should be 7 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1   Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal against sentence.

2   Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 22 April 2016.

3   Sentence the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 7 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. The sentence will date from 24 July 2015. The non-parole period will expire on 23 July 2020 whereupon the applicant will become eligible for release on parole.

4771484,R v AA [2017] NSWCCA 84,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: This judgment concerns a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Ellis DCJ on the Respondent for the commission of a number of serious sexual assaults on his two nieces when they were between the ages of five and eight years old. At the time of the commission of some of the offences the Respondent was a juvenile. Accordingly, neither the Respondent nor the victims can be identified (Crimes Act 1900, s 578A; Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, s 15A). To that end, the Respondent will be referred to as “AA” and his victims as “BB” and “CC”. They are not their initials.
	
	
	On 9 December 2016, AA was sentenced in the District Court for five offences to which he had pleaded guilty. The first offence was aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of ten years contrary to former s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. It was committed upon BB between 7 July 2008 and 21 December 2008. AA was fifteen years old and BB was five years old when the offence was committed. The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years imprisonment. As AA was under eighteen years of age when the offence was committed, there was no applicable standard non‑parole period. For this offence, AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 months with a non‑parole period of 8 months commencing 31 December 2015.
	
	
	The second offence also involved a contravention of former s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. It was committed between 1 January 2009 and 7 July 2009 when BB was still five years old and AA was either fifteen or sixteen years old. For this offence, AA was sentenced to another term of imprisonment of 14 months with a non‑parole period of 8 months. This sentence commenced on 31 March 2016.
	
	
	The third offence was having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years, namely CC, contrary to former s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act. It was committed between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2011 when AA was between sixteen years and ten months and eighteen years and eight months old. CC was aged either five or six years old. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 25 years. For adult offenders there was a standard non‑parole period of 15 years for this offence. AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non‑parole period of 2 years and 3 months. This sentence commenced on 30 June 2016.
	
	
	The fourth offence was another contravention of former s 66A(1) committed against CC. The offence was committed between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 when CC was either seven or eight years old and AA was either eighteen or nineteen years old. For this offence AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 9 months with a non‑parole period of 2 years and 9 months. This sentence commenced on 30 August 2016.
	
	
	The fifth offence was also a contravention of former s 66A(1) committed against CC. The offence was committed between 15 November 2012 and 25 November 2012 when CC was eight years old and AA was nineteen years old. For this offence, AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 2 months with a non‑parole period of 2 years and 7 months. This sentence is due to commence on 31 May 2017.
	
	
	When being sentenced for the third offence, AA requested the Court take into account, on a “Form 1”, two offences under former s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act committed against CC between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2010 (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 32(1) (the “Sentencing Act”)). When being sentenced for the fourth offence, AA requested the Court take into account another offence under former s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act committed against CC between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 (the “Form 1 offences”).
	
	
	The total sentence imposed on AA was imprisonment for 6 years and 7 months commencing 31 December 2015 and expiring on 30 July 2022. He received a combined non‑parole period of 4 years expiring on 30 December 2019.
	
	
	The Crown now appeals the sentence pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It accepts that to succeed on the appeal it must first establish the existence of an error of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505 (“House”); secondly, identify the sentencing principle that is said to be engaged by the errors (R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326 at [19]); and thirdly demonstrate that “the total sentence imposed — even if erroneously reached by the sentencing judge — was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case” (R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [25] per Hunt AJA with whom Spigelman CJ at [1] and Howie J at [41] agreed) (“Janceski”). Even if those matters are established, the Crown must “negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised” (R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; 136 A Crim R 451 at [12] per Heydon JA cited in CMB v Attorney General for the State of NSW [2015] HCA 9; 256 CLR 346 at [34] per French CJ and Gageler J and [56] per Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ; “CMB”). Before those matters are addressed it is necessary to outline the facts of the offending and summarise the sentencing judgment.
	


The Offences


	
	Placed before the sentencing judge was an agreed statement of facts. What follows is a summary of those facts.
	
	
	AA is the paternal uncle of BB and CC. BB and CC are cousins. At the time of the offences AA lived with his parents. From time to time BB and CC visited AA’s home to be looked after by AA’s mother who is the grandmother of BB and CC.
	
	
	On an occasion between 7 July 2008 and 21 December 2008, BB was visiting AA’s home to be looked after by her grandmother. As noted, BB was then five years old and AA was fifteen years old. While BB was seated on a lounge with AA watching television, AA placed “his hand on her vagina over the top of her clothing”. AA’s conduct constituted the first offence noted at [4] above.
	
	
	Sometime between 1 January 2009 and 7 July 2009, BB was in AA’s bedroom sitting on his chest while he was lying on the bed. According to the agreed facts, AA “touched her vagina on top of her underwear and moved his finger on her vagina”. BB tried to stop him by moving away. AA’s conduct constituted the second offence noted in [5] above. The agreed facts stated that “[t]hese were not the only occasions that [AA] touched [BB] on the vagina”.
	
	
	The agreed facts also record that between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2010 AA engaged in two indecent assaults upon CC similar to those he committed against BB. They were committed while AA and CC were sitting on a lounge watching television. These two indecent assaults constitute the first two Form 1 offences noted in [9].
	
	
	As noted, the third offence was committed between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2011. CC was sleeping in the lounge room at AA’s home. AA approached CC while she was asleep. AA gave her some “Nutella” on a spoon. The agreed facts record that AA “removed her pants, spread her legs open and licked her vagina” and that CC told him to stop but he continued. The facts record that CC “described [AA] as licking ‘inside’ her vagina which made her cry because it hurt”. As noted, at the time of this offence CC was six years old and AA was “16, 17 or 18” years old. This conduct constituted the third offence noted above. The facts record that this “was not the only occasion that [AA] performed cunnilingus on [CC]”.
	
	
	Sometime between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012, CC was in AA’s bedroom with the door closed. AA told her to get into bed with him. He pulled his pants down and told CC to “suck his penis saying ‘it’s like a lollipop’”. AA “guided” CC’s head onto his penis with his hand and she performed “fellatio on him”. As noted, at this time CC was seven or eight years of age and AA was eighteen or nineteen years of age. This conduct constituted the fourth offence. The facts record that this “was not the only occasion that [AA] had caused [CC] to perform fellatio on him”.
	
	
	Immediately after this offence was committed, AA told CC to take off her clothes. CC was lying on his bed. AA pushed her legs open and licked her vagina. CC told him to stop because it hurt. AA continued saying “if you want something, you have to like it”. This conduct constituted the third of the Form 1 offences noted in [9].
	
	
	The fifth offence was committed between 15 November 2012 and 25 November 2012 when CC was in AA’s bedroom with her brother. The police facts record that, while her brother was “fixing something, AA and CC were watching television on AA’s bed. They were covered by a blanket. AA removed CC’s underpants and pulled his own pants down. According to the police facts, AA “pushed his penis into her vagina”. CC told AA to stop but he said “No, you’ll like it”. According to the facts CC “squeezed her legs together but [AA] pushed his penis through her legs and into her vagina”. CC felt pain. At some point AA said “Didn’t that feel good” and CC responded “No, I hated it”.
	


The Investigation


	
	In light of the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to describe how AA’s crimes were discovered. This was also covered by the agreed facts.
	
	
	On Friday 16 October 2015, being approximately three years after the commission of the fifth offence, CC disclosed to a worker at an after school care centre that she was concerned for her cousins because “one of her uncles had touched them”. She also stated that “[a] man has touched me as well” and said it was her uncle. The worker reported the disclosure to her manager. The following Monday, 19 October 2015, the after school centre reported the disclosure to the “Children’s Services helpline”.
	
	
	On 23 October 2015, CC’s and BB’s parents were notified of the allegations. When asked about the allegations by her parents, BB confirmed that she had been “touched … on the vagina”. On the same day, AA’s mother was advised of the allegations. She spoke to AA on the telephone. He denied the allegations. However, in a later telephone call he asked his mother to come home to speak to him. When she returned home, AA said to her “well my Dad molested me when I went to his house ...”. It seems that AA’s parents had separated when he was young. AA’s mother asked him what he did to the girls. AA replied “I can’t say, you may as well put me in jail with my Dad”.
	
	
	On the evening of 23 October 2015, AA attended a police station. According to the agreed facts he stated that “I was sexually assaulted by my father. I have done things to my nieces like my Dad did to me”. AA was then arrested and interviewed. According the agreed facts, AA “made admissions to indecently assaulting the two complainants”. He was released. BB and CC were interviewed in November 2015 and December 2015 respectively. AA was rearrested on 31 December 2015 and interviewed again. He has remained in custody since that date. According to the police facts, during that interview he admitted to touching the vagina of both BB and CC “on four or five occasions”, performing cunnilingus on CC “several times” and having her “perform fellatio on him several times”. He also “admitted to placing his penis between [CC’s] legs against her vagina but denied penetration”.
	


The Sentencing Judgment


	
	In the sentencing judgment, his Honour noted that there was an agreed statement of facts and briefly referred to the salient details of the offences. His Honour also noted the maximum penalty and applicable standard non‑parole periods. I note the following nine points about the sentencing judgment.
	
	
	First, his Honour determined that AA would receive a discount in the “range of 20-25%” for his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	Second, his Honour considered the sentencing regime that would have been applicable had AA been prosecuted as a juvenile shortly after he committed the first three offences. Thus his Honour concluded that, with the first two offences, AA “would have been dealt with in the Children’s Court and would not have been committed” to the District Court, and if sentenced to imprisonment, “it would have been served in Juvenile Justice detention”. With the third offence, his Honour accepted that it was a “serious children’s indictable offence” (as defined in s 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act such that if AA had been prosecuted when he was under 21 years of age then he would have to have been dealt with “according to law” (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, ss 16 and 17). However, his Honour observed that, if he was under the age of eighteen at the time of sentencing, the Court “would have imposed a control order”. (The Crown contends this is incorrect). His Honour further observed that if AA was over 18 at the time of sentencing then the Court could have directed that he serve some part of the sentence as a “juvenile offender” until he attained the age of 21 (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act; s 19(1)). His Honour stated:
	


“I mention all of those factors as they are matters that I will take into account in the same way as I would take into account a different sentencing regime in other cases of for instance, historical sexual abuse.”


	
	Third, his Honour appears to have concluded that AA was entitled to a discount in addition to his plea. His Honour noted the chronology of events outlined at [21] to [24] and stated:
	


“Having regard to the fact that [AA] came forward and made full admissions prior to the complaints, he is, in my view, entitled to an unspecified further ‘Ellis type’ discount.” (emphasis added)


	
	At a later point during the delivery of ex tempore reasons for judgment, his Honour inquired of the legal representatives whether any corrections were required. The Crown’s representative submitted that “full admissions” were not made on the first occasion that AA attended the police and were also not made when AA was interviewed on 31 December 2015. His Honour stated that he had only “meant to indicate that [AA had come] forward to admit that he had sexually abused the [children] … and then subsequently entered an interview after that at some stage”. His Honour did not qualify the earlier observation that an “unspecified further discount” was being applied.
	
	
	Fourth, his Honour made various findings concerning the circumstances of the offending that bore upon a determination of its objective seriousness. His Honour noted that, with the exception of the fifth offence, the offences were “reasonably spontaneous” in that “often other people [were] present within the house”. His Honour noted that “[e]ach offence was of short duration”. His Honour noted that the third offence involved an inducement. His Honour noted the respective ages of AA and the victims. His Honour noted the three year delay between the commission of the fifth offence and the offences being discovered. His Honour concluded that AA had “voluntarily ceased his conduct some time in 2012”. His Honour also cited the decision in Jonson v R [2016] NSWCCA 286 and referred to the fact of the offences having been committed in a “home” as an aggravating factor even though “[the offending] took place in the home of the offender while the victims were visiting”. No issue as to the correctness of that approach is raised on this appeal.
	
	
	Later in the sentencing judgment, his Honour characterised the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour described each of the first two offences as “toward the lower end of the range” as they involved “touching on the outside of [BB’s] clothing”. His Honour stated that they would be at the “lowest end of the range” other than allowing for her age. In relation to the other three offences, his Honour stated:
	


“Having regard to the young age of the complainant, that is, [CC] was six for count 3, seven or eight for count 4, and eight for count 5, but that the offender was either 16, 17, 18 or 19 years of age during the course of those offences, that each offence was of relatively short duration, and apparently of a spontaneous nature, the offending, in my view, is below the mid level.

…

I can indicate that his youth is a large factor in my assessment of the criminality and of what the total effective sentence should be to reflect that criminality.” (emphasis added)


	
	Fifth, his Honour addressed AA’s personal circumstances. His Honour noted, and appeared to have accepted, AA’s statement that he had been sexually abused by his father. His father was due to be sentenced on “unrelated child sexual assault offences”. His Honour also noted that AA had no criminal history. By the time of sentencing, AA was 23 and his offending occurred from when he was aged 15 to aged 19. His Honour noted that a psychologist’s report was tendered at the sentencing hearing which referred to the impact on AA of his father’s conduct. It also stated that AA was socially dysfunctional and that as a teenager he suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) as well as “anger issues and impulsivity”.
	
	
	Sixth, his Honour accepted that AA was remorseful. His Honour considered this was demonstrated by AA’s cessation of offending three years before his actions were discovered and by his attendance at the police station on the evening of 23 October 2015. His Honour noted that he had expressed remorse to the psychologist whose report was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The report referred to AA “express[ing] regret for his offending behaviour and describ[ing] feeling guilty and ashamed of his crimes”.
	
	
	Seventh, his Honour felt unable to make a positive finding concerning AA’s prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour noted that AA “has been assessed as having a medium risk of reoffending without treatment” but that he was “amenable to treatment while in custody”. His Honour noted that AA’s youth when he ceased offending was a “positive factor” but added that the Court “would have to be prescient in order to finally determine what his prospects of rehabilitation are”.
	
	
	Eighth, his Honour made a finding of “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act. His Honour identified five matters as supporting that finding, namely: AA’s youth; his “mental health issues” as referred to in the psychologist’s report; the necessity to assist in his “reintegration back into the community” given that AA was serving his first period in custody, the lengthy sentence of imprisonment and the effect of partial accumulation of the sentences.
	
	
	Ninth his Honour stated that he had taken into account the victim impact statements from BB and CC. In their statements they described their distress as a result of the offences. BB described the difficulties she had at school and how since the offending she had become “closed off” from her family and friends, including her cousins. She also described the breakdown in family relationships that followed from the discovery of the offences, which has been upsetting for her.
	


Grounds 1 and 2: Ellis Discount and Failure to Apply s 23(4)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	Ground 1 of the appeal contends that the sentencing judge erred in “applying an Ellis discount”. Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge erred “by failing to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed pursuant to s 23(4)(b) of the Sentencing Act. These grounds can be dealt with together.
	
	
	As noted in the sentencing judgment, his Honour stated that AA would receive an unspecified “further Ellis type discount”. The reference to “Ellis” is to R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 (“Ellis”) which includes the following statement by Street CJ at 604:
	


“This Court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence. The degree of leniency may vary according to the degree of inevitability of conviction as it may appear to the sentencing judge, but it is always a factor to which a greater or lesser degree of weight must be given.

When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.

The leniency that follows confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.” (emphasis added)


	
	This passage adverts to the leniency that is proffered to an offender on the account of a plea of guilty and the possibility that a “further element of leniency” may be afforded in circumstances where the plea of guilty “is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt” such as in the circumstance “[w]here it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence”. This additional measure of leniency is often referred to as an “Ellis discount”.
	
	
	The above statement from Ellis is accommodated by two provisions of the Sentencing Act. First, s 21A(3)(i) provides that remorse shown by an offender is a mitigating factor and can be considered by a sentencing judge as part of the “instinctive synthesis”. If an offender discloses unknown offences to the police, that can be powerful evidence of their offender’s remorse. No separate discount should be given on account of remorse (R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32] per Howie J; “Borkowski”).
	
	
	Second, s 23 of the Sentencing Act provides:
	


23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1)   A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2)   In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(a)   (Repealed)

(b)   the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c)   the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d)   the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e)   the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f)   any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g)   whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h)   any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i)   whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(j)   (Repealed)

(3)   A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4)   A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a)   indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b)   state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c)   where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons—state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5)   Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6)   The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.


	
	Sub-sections 23(4) to (6) were inserted with effect from 14 March 2011 by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010.
	
	
	In CMB at [72], Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ held that disclosure by an offender to law enforcement authorities of otherwise unknown guilt involves the provision of assistance to law enforcement authorities within the meaning of s 23(1) and is thereby “subject to the stricture of s 23(3)”. French CJ and Gageler J adopted the same construction (at [41]). In such cases, sentencing judges are also required to comply with s 23(4) and specify the level of the discount proffered (see Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85 at [34] per Adams J with whom Ward JA at [1] and Bellew J at [60] agreed in this respect). The combination of CMB and the introduction of s 23(4) to (6) rendered a change in the position previously adopted in this Court which was to the effect that the level of discount afforded on the basis of the disclosure of previously unknown offending did not need to be stated (see Borkowski at [32]).
	
	
	Beyond this, there is conflicting authority as to whether a sentencing judge’s failure to comply with s 23(4) necessarily results in an error of the kind referred to in House (see s 23(6) and s 101A; and compare Panetta at [34] to [37] with R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12 at [42] per Basten JA (“Robinson)” and Avery v R [2015] NSWCCA 50 at [68]). Section 23(6) provides that the failure to comply with s 23(4) does not “invalidate the sentence”. However, s 101A provides that a “failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence”. These provisions operate as a form of privative clause. Their combined effect is to negate any contention that a sentence imposed by a sentencing court that is not a superior court of record is affected by jurisdictional error by reason of a failure to comply with s 23(4). Instead, complaints about such failures fall to be considered as part of the appellate process.
	
	
	The end result is that, if sentencing judges are considering imposing a lesser sentence on account of the conduct of an offender in disclosing previously unknown offences, then they must consider the factors in s 23(2) in determining whether to proffer the discount (Williamson v R [2015] NSWCCA 250 at [68]) and, if so, its level. They also must ensure that the penalty imposed is not disproportionate (s 23(3)) and they must specify the level of discount in accordance with s 23(4). Irrespective of whether s 23 is engaged, sentencing judges may also consider whether the offender’s actions demonstrate remorse.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 1, the Crown contended that the sentencing judge “erred by failing to properly consider the factors in s 23(2)” of the Sentencing Act. The Crown submits that, had his Honour done so, then there would not have been applied an “unspecified further Ellis discount”. Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge erred in failing to specify the level of discount. The submissions on behalf of AA contend that his Honour did not afford any “specific type of discount” but instead treated his attendance at the police station as “confirmation of the respondent’s remorse”. Otherwise, it was submitted on behalf of AA that the Court should not intervene merely because of a failure to comply with s 23(4) (citing Robinson at [42]).
	
	
	In this case there are reasons to doubt whether the form of “assistance” that AA provided on the evening of 23 October 2015 would fall within the passage from Ellis set out above. By the time AA attended the police station, the process for reporting BB and CC’s complaints to the police was already in train. Nevertheless, his actions in attending the police station in advance of the police being notified of the complaints, and in admitting some of the abuse, does fall within s 23(1).
	
	
	Accordingly, the real debate between the parties was whether the sentencing judge afforded a “discount”, albeit “unspecified”, on account of AA’s “assistance” or only considered his assistance as demonstrating his remorse. I consider that the sentencing judge adopted the former approach. The sentencing judge stated that he would give a “further discount” being a reference to a discount beyond that which was allowed for the utilitarian value of AA’s plea. When the Crown corrected his Honour’s initial finding that AA made full admissions on 23 October 2015, his Honour had the opportunity to clarify the statement that a further discount was being given but his Honour did not. In a separate part of the judgment his Honour expressly referred to AA’s actions in approaching the police as “confirmation of remorse” (see [33]).
	
	
	It follows from this conclusion that Ground 1 of the Crown’s appeal must be upheld. His Honour allowed a discount on account of AA’s assistance but in doing so failed to address the factors in s 23(2). In view of that conclusion it is not necessary to address the issue raised by Ground 2 as to whether error was established by the further failure of the sentencing judge to specify the level of discount in accordance with s 23(4).
	
	
	Further, it is appropriate to determine afresh whether, having regard to the factors in s 23(2), any discount was warranted, as that may be relevant to an assessment of whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. In considering those factors it is to be recalled that when AA attended the police station the child protection authorities were already investigating BB’s and CC’s complaints. Further, AA did not initially confess to all his sexual acts with BB and CC. Instead, he only admitted to those acts that his family accused him of engaging in. In those circumstances, it was not established that what he provided on the evening of 23 October 2015 was ultimately of significance or especially timely in that the police would have been notified and would have ultimately interviewed BB and CC in any event (s 23(2)(b); s 23(2)(d)). The information he provided was not complete (s 23(2)(c)). AA did not obtain any other benefit from the assistance he provided (s 23(2)(f)). AA’s provision of assistance did not result in him suffering harsher custodial conditions (s 23(2)(g)) or injury to himself or his family (s 23(2)(h)). The assistance AA provided concerns the offence for which he is being sentenced (s 23(2)(i)). Bearing in mind that AA only attended the police station after he was notified of the complaints, when they were about to be reported anyway, and that his admissions were incomplete, I do not consider that the imposition of a lesser penalty on account of his assistance is warranted.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would uphold Ground 1 of the appeal. Ground 2 of the appeal does not arise.
	


Ground 3: The objective seriousness of Counts 3, 4 and 5


	
	Ground 3 of the appeal contends that the “sentencing judge erred in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of Counts 3, 4 and 5”.
	
	
	In the passage extracted in [31] above the sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the third, fourth and fifth offences as “below the mid level”. The Crown accepted that this assessment is an evaluative one and is only reviewable for House error (Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282) at [46]). Nevertheless, the Crown contended that his Honour took into account irrelevant considerations in assessing the objective seriousness of these offences, namely, AA’s age and the duration of the offending.
	
	
	In relation to the age of AA, the Crown referred to the statement in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27] (“Muldrock”) to the effect that, at least when considering offences to which a standard non‑parole period applies, the “objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders”. Instead, the objective seriousness is “to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"" ([id]). Muldrock also distinguished between an assessment of the ""objective seriousness"" of an offence and an assessment of the offender's ""moral culpability"" for the offence (see Muldrock at [54]). An assessment of the latter can, and should, take into account matters personal to an offender such as his or her impaired intellectual functioning (see McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29] per McCallum J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing (“McLaren”); Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 at [33] to [34] per Beazley P). An assessment of moral culpability can also extend to an offender’s relative youth (see KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [22] to [25] per McClellan CJ at CL) although there are limits to its mitigating effect (JH v R [2017] NSWCCA 22 at [128]).
	
	
	In the passage set out at [31] above the sentencing judge expressly referred to AA’s youth as bearing on an assessment of his “criminality”. Considered in context, the reference to his “criminality” was a reference to his moral culpability. It follows that that aspect of his Honour’s reasons was not affected by error. However, in the earlier part of that extract his Honour expressly referred to AA’s age in the context of a determination of the objective seriousness of the offending (the “offender was either 16, 17, 18 or 19”). Nevertheless, in the context of a sexual offence some aspects of an offender’s personal circumstances may bear upon the “nature of the offending” (Muldrock at [27]). For example, the age difference between a sexual offender and their perpetrator can affect an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. Additionally, the age of the perpetrator can be relevant to an explanation of the context in which the offending occurred. In the present case, AA was in his late teens when he committed the offences. He had not assumed responsibility for the care of BB and CC. It is likely, or at least possible, that BB and CC could distinguish between him and an adult. This does not deny or even mitigate the seriousness of his conduct and its terrible effect on the victims. However, at least in the present case, I do not accept that the sentencing judge erred in referring to the age of AA and his victims in assessing the objective seriousness of his conduct.
	
	
	Otherwise, I do not accept that his Honour erred in referring to the “relatively short duration” of the offending in assessing the objective seriousness of the third, fourth and fifth offences. The Crown contended that the agreed facts did not “suggest any particular time period relating to these counts” so as to enable his Honour to draw a conclusion about these offences. However, the description of the events and the context in which they occurred, namely while the children were in the care of AA’s mother, enabled his Honour to make the finding that was made. While the short duration of a sexual assault “would not ordinarily be considered as a factor which reduces the objective seriousness” of such an offence (R v Daley [2010] NSWCCA 223 at [48]; Cowling v R [2015] NSWCCA 213 at [16]), it was open to His Honour to have some regard to it (see Russell v R [2010] NSWCCA 248 at [61]).
	
	
	This ground of appeal was ultimately directed to his Honour’s finding as to the objective seriousness of the third, fourth and fifth offences. At first instance, the Crown submitted that the third offences fell “within the mid-range for offences of this nature” and the fourth offence fell “in the middle of the range for such offences”. His Honour found that they both were “below the mid-level”. The distinction between the Crown’s submission and his Honour’s finding for both offences is barely material. In any event, I do not accept that his Honour erred in this respect.
	
	
	The position is not the same with the fifth offence. This offence involved the penile penetration of an 8 year old girl in circumstances that caused her pain and in which she protested. I do not accept that it was open to his Honour to characterise the offence as “below the mid level”. To the contrary, I consider that it was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Further, given that AA was nineteen when the offence was committed his moral culpability was heightened compared to the other offences.
	
	
	I uphold Ground 3 in relation to the fifth offence but reject it in relation to the third and fourth offences.
	


Ground 4: Punishment under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987


	
	Ground 4 of the appeal contends that the sentencing judge erred “by taking into account irrelevant considerations concerning the possible outcome had the respondent’s offending been detected earlier and by mistaking the effect of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act]”.
	
	
	This ground of the appeal refers to that part of the sentencing judgment noted at [27]. The Crown contends that his Honour erred in having regard to the sentencing options that were open under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act had AA been prosecuted as a juvenile shortly after he committed the first three offences. It also contends that his Honour erred in concluding that AA could have received a “control order” under s 33(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act for the third offence. The Crown contends that, as the third offence was a “[serious] children’s indictable offence it had to be dealt with according to law” (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act; s 17). The result is that, if AA had been prosecuted as a juvenile, he would have been dealt with in accordance with the Sentencing Act which would have precluded the imposition of a control order (see R v KBM [2004] NSWCCA 123 at [20]).
	
	
	Counsel for AA, Mr Fernandez, submitted that, in addressing this issue, the sentencing judge was merely referring to submissions made before him on this topic. He submitted that his Honour was only “describing the complicated sentencing task before him, and the way the different sentencing regimes for children and adults operated”. He submitted that the sentencing judge was referring “by analogy, to another circumstance where sentencing is complicated in this way, [namely] sentencing for historical sexual abuse”.
	
	
	A review of the transcript of the sentence hearing reveals that it was the sentencing judge who first introduced the topic of the sentencing regime that would have been applicable for the first three offences had AA been prosecuted immediately after he committed them. Consistent with the statement set out at [31] above, his Honour asked whether he should “take into account that had [AA] been charged [for the first and second offence] while he was still under 18 ... [the matter] … would have stayed in the Children’s Court ...”. Counsel for AA embraced the proposition. The Crown’s representative did not expressly reject it.
	
	
	I do not accept that the sentencing judge merely referred to the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act as part of a recitation of the submissions made during the sentencing hearing. Instead, his Honour had regard to that legislation as a matter in mitigation of sentence. His Honour stated he would consider the regime for sentencing children “in the same way as I would take into account a different sentencing regime in other cases of, for instance, historical sexual abuse”. This is clearly a reference to the arguably analogous proposition that in sentencing for offences involving historical sexual abuse it is proper for a sentencing court to take into account the sentencing practice prevailing as at the date of commission of the offence charged when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offence since that time (R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 at [31] per Spigelman CJ, at [71] per Grove J and at [105] per Sully J).
	
	
	Neither of the parties referred to any previous decisions of this Court that have addressed whether a sentencing court, in dealing with an adult offender for an offence committed while they were a juvenile, can have regard to the sentencing regime available for juveniles had they been prosecuted earlier. However, this issue has been addressed by this Court. In TC v R [2016] NSWCCA 3, this Court found error in circumstances where a fifty‑five‑year‑old offender was sentenced for an offence he committed when he was seventeen years old. The judge at first instance was found to have erred in failing to specifically address the statutory regime for the sentencing of children prevailing at the time the offence was committed (at [42] to [48] per Gleeson JA with whom Rothman and Bellew JJ agreed, at [88] to [89]). Similarly, in SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94, Fullerton J accepted that an offender who was thirty nine years old but had committed serious sexual assaults when he was 16 years of age had the capacity to “ask what might have happened had he been arrested and dealt with expeditiously after the offending” (at [50]; Basten JA and Davies J agreeing). However, it was of no assistance to the offender in that case as his offences were “serious children’s indictable offences” that had to be dealt with according to law and not in accordance with the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act (at [50] per Fullerton J).
	
	
	It follows that so much of Ground 4 as makes complaint in relation to the sentencing judge’s approach to the relevance of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act to the sentencing of AA for the first two offences, must be rejected. His Honour was entitled to adopt the approach that he did in relation to those two offences.
	
	
	However, his Honour erred in his approach to the third offence in this respect. Given that it was, and is, a “serious children’s indictable offence” it had to be dealt with according to law and that could not have included the imposition of a control order.
	
	
	I would reject so much of Ground 5 as concerns the first two offences. I would uphold Ground 5 in relation to the third offence.
	


Ground 5: AA’s youth


	
	Ground 5 of the appeal contends that the “sentencing judge erred by taking into account [AA’s] youth when finding special circumstances”.
	
	
	The matters relied on by the sentencing judge in finding special circumstances are set out at [35]. The Crown’s written submissions noted that the sentencing judge took into account AA’s youth when having regard to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, in observing that considerations of general deterrence do not have the same force for a young offender as they do for an older adult, in finding that AA’s conduct ceased when he was 19 and in determining both the objective seriousness of the offences and his “criminality”. I have already addressed complaints about the first and last of these matters.
	
	
	The Crown contended that, having considered AA’s youth in those various respects, his Honour erred by further taking into account his youth in finding special circumstances. The Crown submitted that was an impermissible form of double counting in that matters taken into account in reducing the head sentence should not be used to reduce the non‑parole period. The Crown referred to R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [47] (“Simpson”) and R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] per Spigelman CJ (“Fidow”).
	
	
	The relevant passage from Fidow is as follows (at [18]):
	


“‘Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non parole period, must be avoided. (See Simpson at [47]). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur”.


	
	The reference to “Simpson at [47]” in this passage appears to be a mistake in that [47] of Simpson does not address this topic. It may have been intended to be a reference to Simpson at [67] in which Spigelman CJ stated:
	


“Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period. Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non-parole period by reason of that circumstance, he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence.”


	
	This passage informs what is meant by the reference to double counting for “matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence” in the above extract from Fidow. A sentencing judge may be found not to have engaged in “double counting” if the analysis of the relevance of a particular circumstance to the non‑parole period “travels beyond” the analysis of its relevance to the head sentence. Thus, for example, matters which are purely subjective to the offender, such as their ill health or the effect of their plea of guilty, do not warrant a reduction in the head sentence and a further reduction in the non‑parole period (see Bell v R; Jelisavac v R [2009] NSWCCA 206 – medical condition; and Trindall v R [2013] NSWCCA 229 at [17] – plea of guilty). For such factors the analysis of their relevance to the head sentence and the non‑parole period is usually the same.
	
	
	However, in this case I do not accept that there was any relevant form of double counting. The analysis of the relevance of AA’s youth to the head sentence was different to the analysis of its relevance to the non‑parole period. With the former, AA’s youth was considered by the sentencing judge as part of the determination of his moral culpability and the objective seriousness of the offence. It was also considered when the sentencing judge had regard to the relevant sentencing regime for juveniles in determining the appropriate sentence for the first two offences (and erroneously in sentencing for the third offence). Thus, in the determination of the head sentence AA’s youth was not considered by the sentencing judge to be some generally mitigating circumstance. It was considered in that way as part of the determination of special circumstances, but only because, when considered with other factors, it bore upon the assessment that a longer period of supervision was required as part of AA’s rehabilitation. His Honour did not err in this respect.
	
	
	Before the sentencing judge, the Crown accepted that the combination of AA’s need for treatment, his age and the fact that it would be his first time in custody “could allow the Court to make a finding of special circumstances in this case”. This is arguably inconsistent with this ground of appeal although, as I have explained, the substance of the complaint was the reliance by the sentencing judge on AA’s youth in determining the head sentence and finding special circumstances. In any event, for the reasons set out above, I would reject Ground 5.
	


Ground 6: Accumulation


	
	Ground 6 of the appeal contends that the “sentencing judge failed to sufficiently accumulate the sentences”. The Crown’s submissions accepted that the sentencing judge had regard to Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 but submitted that the accumulation between the sentences did not “adequately reflect the totality of the criminality”.
	
	
	The sentence for the second offence was partially accumulated on the first offence by three months and the sentence for the third offence was partially accumulated on the second offence by three months. The sentence for the fourth offence was partially accumulated on the sentence for the third offence by two months and the sentence for the fifth offence was accumulated on the fourth sentence by a further nine months.
	
	
	A determination by a sentencing judge that sentences should or should not be accumulated is discretionary (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [37]). The Crown’s complaint that, even though his Honour accumulated sentences and referred to the appropriate principles, the sentences are not “sufficiently” accumulated, does not raise a complaint of an error of the kind referred to in House. However, I will treat the Crown’s complaint as if it asserted that the sentencing judge’s determination was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” such that this Court could “infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion” to accumulate sentences or make them run concurrently (House at p 505). Even treating the complaint in that way, I do not consider that it is established. While the accumulation of a period of two months for the fourth offence was lenient I am not persuaded that it or the other periods of accumulation reveal that the sentencing judge’s discretion was exercised “unreasonably”.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 6.
	


Ground 7: Individual sentences are each manifestly inadequate


	
	Ground 7 of the appeal contends that the “terms and non-parole periods of the individual sentences are each manifestly inadequate and ‘plainly unjust’”.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions referred to the seriousness with which sentencing Courts regard offences committed against children (R v CJP [2004] NSWCCA 188 at [21]) and the necessity to ensure that “sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished” (R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445). They also noted that the agreed facts concerning the first four offences record that each act was not the only occasion that the respective offence occurred. Such a statement has been held as “appropriate to be taken into account for purposes of rejecting any claim to mitigation and attendant reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence” but is not “to be taken into account as a circumstance of aggravation” (R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466 at [68] per Spigelman CJ). Further, as each of the third and fourth offences was accompanied by offences on a Form 1, the sentencing for those offences was required to be undertaken in a manner consistent with what Bathurst CJ stated in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [22] to [23].
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions did not specifically address the sentence imposed for the first two offences. At the time they were committed, AA was fifteen or sixteen years old. There was no standard non‑parole period for those offences. When they were committed AA had no prior convictions and a strong subjective case, especially given his father’s conduct towards him. AA admitted these offences on the evening of 23 October 2015. He later pleaded guilty. In those circumstances a combined sentence of 17 months imprisonment with a total non‑parole period of 11 months for the first two offences was certainly not manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The position is less clear with the third, fourth and fifth offences. As part of the assessment of the adequacy of the sentences for the fourth and fifth offences, the Crown provided a table identifying some sentences imposed or considered by this Court for offences against former s 66A(1) or (2) committed by offenders aged between eighteen and twenty-five years. I will not describe all of those decisions. Instead, a consideration of some of them will suffice.
	
	
	In R v Ronald King [2009] NSWCCA 117 (“King”) this Court allowed a Crown appeal against a 2 year suspended sentence imposed on a 23 year old male who broke into a home and digitally penetrated a four-year-old girl and also indecently assaulted her. This Court concluded that the offending was “only slightly below [the] mid range in seriousness” (at [48]). The offender had a long criminal record but it did not include any sexual offences (at [17]). This Court imposed a non‑parole period of 4 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. The Court described this as a “sentence of significantly less severity than should have been imposed” by the sentencing judge (at [71]). King was decided prior to the enactment of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by this Court in King reflected the principle that following a successful Crown appeal this Court will impose a sentence that is either at the bottom of the applicable range (see R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 232 per Spigelman CJ) or towards the bottom of that range (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CR 321 at [62]). After the enactment of s 68A the position is that, if this Court intervenes, it will impose the penalty that is appropriate (R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7).
	
	
	In AAT v R [2011] NSWCCA 17 (“AAT”), this Court allowed an appeal against a sentence imposed for three offences against former s 66A and two child pornography offences. One of the offences against former s 66A had a charge of aggravated indecent assault included on a Form 1 (at [3]). The offender was twenty-two years of age and the victim was his eight‑year‑old half-brother (at [6]). The three offences under former s 66A involved the offender and the victim performing oral sex on each other (at [14]). One of the child pornography offences concerned photos of the victim that had been taken by the offender (at [13]). The offender had no prior convictions and a history of depression (at [17]). He had pleaded guilty and proffered assistance that involved nominating others who had committed child sex tourism and child pornography offences (at [29]). This Court concluded that the assistance and his plea were not such as would “warrant a discount in excess of 50%”. In resentencing the offender, this Court imposed non‑parole periods of 4 years 3 months, 3 years 3 months and 3 years 3 months for the three offences under s 66A respectively. The overall sentence imposed was a non‑parole period of 5 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years.
	
	
	In Jones v R [2012] NSWCCA 262 (“Jones”), the offender was convicted following a trial of two offences under former s 66A(1) and indecently assaulting the victim. The offender was twenty years of age and attended at a home of a friend where the six year old victim was staying with his family. The offender stated that he was taking the victim to a shop but instead drove him to a secluded spot. The first offence under former s 66A was constituted by the offender sucking the victim’s penis. The second offence was committed when the offender anally penetrated the victim (at [7]). The indecent assault was committed the next day when the offender played with the complaint’s penis. An appeal to this Court against conviction was dismissed but an appeal against sentence was allowed. The offender was resentenced to a non‑parole period of 3 years imprisonment in respect of the first offence under former s 66A(1) and 8 years imprisonment in respect of the second offence.
	
	
	AA’s offending was similar to, but less than, the criminality of the offenders in AAT and Jones. AAT’s use of the victim for child pornography arguably makes his total criminality the worst of these examples. Like AAT and King but unlike Jones, AA pleaded guilty to the charges against him. Unlike King, AA is not eligible to receive a discount for assistance.
	
	
	Overall, a consideration of these sentences and the other sentences referred to by the Crown confirms that the sentences imposed on AA for the third, fourth and fifth offences were undoubtedly very lenient, especially when the sentences are corrected for the errors that have been identified. However, I am not persuaded that, considered either individually or in their totality, the sentences for those offences or any of the offences were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 7.
	


Disposition


	
	Even allowing for the errors made by the sentencing judge, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed, considered individually or in their totality, were “manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case” (Janceski at [25]).
	
	
	I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

-v-


 

Ming Jiang 


Manchester (Minshull Street) Crown Court 


2nd May 2017 

 

 

Sentencing Remarks 

 
 
 

 
 
The Defendant has refused to come into Court to hear this sentence being imposed.  
 
With the consent of his advocate I will proceed to impose sentence upon him in his 
 
absence and will refer to him in these sentencing remarks in the second person. I am 
content for him to be given a copy of these remarks to read.  
 
Last Friday you Ming Jiang were convicted at this Court of the single count you face 
on this indictment of murder. The trial was fully contested over a four week period. I 
presided over the trial. The jury took a little over four hours to reach their verdict. 
 
The Facts 
 
 
You were convicted of the murder of Yang Liu, somebody you knew via your joint 
interest  in  gambling  at  casinos  and  with  whom  you  shared  a  membership  of  the 
Chinese community in Manchester. 
 
Yang Liu was born in China on the 6th May 1980. He was the only son of Li Ping Liu 
and  Ning  Sheng  Ouyang.  His  parents  have  provided  a  heartfelt  and  moving  victim 
 
impact statement to which I shall refer later. 
 
Yang Liu, just thirty-six years old when he died was a young man whom his parents 
describe  as  warm  and  full  of  life.  He  was  kind  and  well  loved.  He  was  respectful 
towards his family, in particular his grandparents before they died. 
 
He was intelligent and studied hard at school and university in China. He gained good 
qualifications and told his family of his wish to further his education by studying in 
the United Kingdom. His parents and grandparents encouraged him in this ambition.  
 
The family saved up money to help him go abroad and they maintained their financial 
support for him once he arrived. They kept in close contact with him even though he 
 
was to live the last sixteen years of his life many thousands of miles away from them. 
  
Yang  Liu  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  in  2000.  He  came  to  study  at  Leeds 
University. He met his wife Nan Wang. They graduated together before marrying and 
moving  to  Manchester  where  they  bought  a  flat.  Unfortunately  they  were  to  grow 
apart and divorced after eleven years together. They had no children. 

 

1
--------
Yang Liu lived alone in a flat he owned in Media City in Salford. He retained a circle 
of  friends  in  the  Chinese  community.  He  was  successful  in  finance,  investing  in 
stocks and shares and acquiring wealth. His family also sent him money.  
 
He  lived  comfortably.  He  liked  to  dress  smartly.    He  enjoyed  a  social  life 
characterised  by  eating  out  and  visiting  casinos.  He  remained  a  popular,  kind  and 
gentle person to spend time with. 
 
 
You, Ming Jiang befriended him at this part of his life, you moving in the same social 
circles as he. 
 
The  evidence  in  this  trial  bears  testimony to  your  obsessive  desire  to  gamble  large 
sums of money in casinos.  
 
There  was  evidence  that  you  were  viewed  by  some  clubs  you  visited  as  worthy  of 
special status such was the extent of your custom given to them. You were given this 
status despite being barred by some other casinos who had grown tired of what has 
been described as your erratic behaviour – generous and kind when you won, rude 
 
and abusive to staff and others when you did not.  
 
At  one  casino  where  you  remained  a  member,  you  were  assigned  to  a  special 
employee  whose  role  was  to  encourage  you  and  other  high  spending  customers  to 
remain  loyal  to  the  casino.  You  were  provided  with  gifts  and  other  gratuities  like 
 
nights away at expensive hotels in London.  
 
Like  many  of  those  attracted  to  this  type  of  life  your  high  spending,  high  rolling 
behaviour was in fact a selfish and self centred veneer behind which you hid a life of 
increasing dependency on debt which was rapidly spinning out of control.  
 
The estimated losses you accumulated ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds over 
a comparatively short period of time and were to increase once you put into effect the 
plan you came up with to address the debt problems increasingly confronting you. 
 
The plan was chilling but straight forward. You would commit a murder for personal 
gain. 
 
You would exploit your supposed friendship with Yang Liu to lure him to your flat 
and  kill  him.  You  would  dispose  of  his  body  by  making  it  look  as  though  he  had 
disappeared. 
 
You  would  then  use  your  considerable  experience  of  identity  theft  to  adopt  his 
 
identity, thus have access to his wealth and giving you the funds required to maintain 
 
your gambling “VIP” persona. Should you be challenged you thought you would be 
able to lie your way out of trouble. 
 
On the 5th October 2016 you put your plan into effect. Telephone evidence suggests 
 
you contacted Yang Liu and invited him to your flat in the east of Manchester. The 
 
last pictures of him being alive are taken by CCTV cameras at the Metrolink station 

 

2
--------
near to your flat where you are seen to meet him and then walk with him towards your 
flat. 
 
 
At your flat you killed him. You then treated his body in the most disrespectful and 
 
appalling way. As a consequence of these actions by you, there is no evidence to say 
precisely where in your flat you killed him or how you did this.  
 
However, given your plan it seems to me likely that you killed him quickly and that 
by the early hours of the 6th October he was dead. 
 
In order to adopt his identity you were required to buy time before his disappearance 
could  be  noticed.  To  give  yourself  the  greatest  chance  to  do  this  you  decided  to 
dispose of his body so that no trace of him could be found.  
 
To do this you decided to dismember him by removing from his body his head, hands 
and feet. You did this over a period of time, again in your flat either in the living room 
using a set of ladders to lay him flat or in your bathroom, in the bath.  
 
You  used  sharp  metal  objects,  probably  knives,  to  conduct  this  grotesque  activity. 
These metal objects have never been found you having disposed of them. 
 
Having  dismembered  his  body  you  disposed  of  those  parts  you  had  removed  by 
possibly  discarding  them  in  a  communal  rubbish  bin  serving  the  block  of  flats  in 
which you lived. The contents of this bin were incinerated before your involvement in 
this crime was discovered.  
 
 
The  body  parts  you  removed  have  never  been  found.  Your  willingness  to  treat  the 
remains of another person in this manner portrays you as ruthless and cruel. 
 
Discovery of what had happened started to occur after you disposed of the remaining 
torso  from  your  victim’s  body.  You  did  this  by  placing  the  torso  in  a  suitcase  and 
taking it to a lay-by some distance from Manchester on the main road to Sheffield.  
 
You did this on the night of the 9th October.  Before going to this site you purchased a 
can of petrol. You poured the contents of the can onto the suitcase before setting it 
 
alight in the lay-by in the hope that the suitcase and its contents would be so badly 
destroyed by fire as to prevent identification. 
 
The remains of the suitcase and what was left of Yang Liu’s body were discovered by 
walkers the following morning who then contacted the police.  
 
The  police  commenced  a  painstaking  enquiry  which  via  number  plate  recognition 
technology traced your motor vehicle as having likely visited the lay-by at the time a 
 
fire had been seen in there the previous night by passing motorists.  
 
In due course the police came to you. They seized your car. DNA from Mr Liu was 
found on the boot. You were arrested.

Before your arrest you had made considerable progress with your plan to cover up 
your victim’s killing and dismemberment, before adopting his identity and obtaining 
his wealth. 
 
You made concerted attempts to clean up and leave your flat, changing the position of 
furniture  so  as  to  hide  the  blood  stains  you  couldn’t  remove,  painting  parts  of  the 
 
walls and ceiling, washing furniture coverings and giving your landlord notice to end 
your tenancy. 
 
You  had  transferred  significant  sums  of  money  from  Mr  Liu’s  accounts  to  those 
controlled by you. You had spent liberally on his credit and debit cards, even buying 
the petrol you were to use to burn his torso in the lay-by with one such card.  
 
You made arrangements to sell Mr Liu’s flat in Media City, with a view to obtaining 
the proceeds of sale quickly. You were told the flat was worth at least £185,000 and 
expected to receive this money within a matter of days or weeks. 
 
You took control of Mr Liu’s mobile phone, and more than once pretended to be him 
when speaking to lending institutions or estate agents either remotely or in person. On 
 
one occasion you callously sent a text to Mr Liu’s mother in China pretending to be 
her son and re-assuring her as to her son’s well-being. 
 
You  had  continued  to  gamble,  spending  hours  almost  every  day  at  casinos  in  both 
Manchester and Nottingham. You wagered thousands of pounds in the days after the 
 
5th October before your arrest on the 20th October. There was a significant increase in 
 
the amount you were prepared to risk during this period as compared with the period 
prior to your killing Mr Liu. 
 
When the police spoke with you both before and after your arrest you put into action 
your plan to lie your way out of trouble.  
 
You told the police that you and your victim were in a homosexual relationship and 
planned  soon  to  enter  a  civil  partnership.  You  explained  this  was  why  the  police 
enquiries had revealed you being so heavily involved in controlling Mr Liu’s financial 
affairs. All this was untrue. 
 
You  told  the  police  you  knew  nothing  of  Mr  Liu’s  disappearance  but  believed  the 
 
person  responsible  may  have  been  someone  called  John  Wong  who  had  become 
friendly  with  Mr  Liu  over  a  number  of  years  and  bore  him  ill-will  following  a 
gambling dispute.  
 
You said Mr Wong and another unnamed man had been present with Mr Liu in your 
flat before the latter’s disappearance. 
 
On the evidence presented at trial I am sure that the existence of “John Wong” and the 
other man is doubtful and is likely to be a smokescreen deliberately created by you to 
hide your culpability.

--------
You repeated these lies in evidence at trial and as with the police enquiry before, the 
jury saw through them and delivered a verdict which was entirely consistent with the 
evidence presented to them. 
 
  
This was a planned murder committed by you I am sure for personal gain. 
 
Your actions ended the life of a gentle and kind young man.  
 
 
They  demonstrate  that  you  are,  a  highly  dangerous,  cunning  and  ruthless  killer 
prepared  to  stop  at  nothing  to  fulfil  your  own  selfish  desire  to  feed  your  gambling 
habit. 
 
 
Victim Impact Statements 
 
Yang  Liu’s  parents  have  provided  a  joint  victim  impact  statement  which  has  been 
read out in part to the Court. The contents of the statement are highly personal and 
make clear the terrible loss they have suffered.  
 
I do not propose to repeat the contents of the statement here given it was recently read 
out in part during this hearing and has already been widely reported. However, I fully 
understand the daily torment and anguish Mr Liu and his wife have to endure. 
 
For any parent to lose their child is extremely painful. In this case these parents have 
had to face the loss of their only child.   
 
I accept and understand that the loss to Yang Liu’s parents will leave them bereft of 
significant emotional support in their lives from their only son – support they were 
entitled to expect as they grow older, and which is so important in Chinese culture. 
 
I recognise that there is little that I can say to help these parents with their grief at the 
 
loss  of  their  son.  I  wish  to  express  however  the  Court’s  condolences  to  them, 
confident as I am that even though they are not present to hear what I am saying the 
contents of these remarks will be translated and made available to them. 
 
 
The Sentence 
 
There is only one sentence that can be imposed on conviction for murder and that is a 
sentence of life imprisonment. That will be the sentence in this case when I announce 
it shortly. 
 
A sentence of life imprisonment imposed on a dangerous offender means what it says, 
life imprisonment. 
 
 
You, Ming Jiang may spend the entirety of the rest of your life in prison and you will 
 
certainly not be released from this sentence unless the Parole Board comes to the view 
that you are no longer to be considered a danger to the public.  
 
Given  the  nature  of  this  murder  I  anticipate  the  authorities  at  the  appropriate  time, 
should it ever be reached, will have to consider with very great care the issue of the 
danger you present to the public if you are once more in the community.  

 

5
--------
It  is  entirely  possible,  in  the  circumstances  that  you  will,  in  fact  never  be  released 
from custody. 
 
I am required to fix the minimum term that you will serve. This means the minimum 
period that you will serve in custody before you are even considered for release by the 
Parole Board. 
 
You  should  note  this  minimum  term  cannot  be  reduced  or  changed  and  as  I  have 
 
already said there is no guarantee that at the end of it you will be released. This will 
be a matter for assessment by the Parole Board at the time. 
 
Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Schedule  21  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  a 
murder done for gain or for money is viewed as of particularly high seriousness and 
has as a staring point a minimum term of 30 years. 
 
For reasons I have already alluded to I agree with the prosecution submission that this 
is the appropriate starting point in this case.  
 
This murder was planned from the outset and the clear motive for the killing by you 
of Mr Liu was so that you could adopt his identity and gain access to his considerable 
 
financial assets. 
 
The starting point is thus thirty years. 
 
Aggravating Features 
 
 
Having adopted this starting point, I now turn to those and other aggravating features 
of this murder that Schedule 21 asks me to consider when adding to the starting point.  
 
I am of the view that the following features aggravate this murder for gain;  
 
There was dismemberment of Mr Liu’s body. 
 
There was destruction and concealment of the body thereafter, the torso was set alight 
 
and the head, hands and feet have never been recovered. 
 
There was an attempt to mislead others at to the fate of Mr Liu and in particular the 
text to his mother in China. 
 
You, Ming Jiang have shown a complete lack of remorse throughout and have been 
prepared to maintain a fabricated account both to the police in interview and in the 
presentation of your case at trial which in part I view as having been demeaning to 
your victim.  
 
In particular you continued to describe him as in employment as a male escort without 
producing a shred of evidence to this effect.

--------
Your  attitude  towards  your  victim  can  be  seen  from  the  evidence  of  one  witness 
(Kristian Gallagher) who indicated you referred to Mr Liu in far from complementary 
terms shortly after, in my judgement, you must have killed him. 
 
 
 
Mitigating Features 
 
 
I am prepared to afford you some mitigation for your lack of previous convictions and 
in particular that you have no convictions of violence recoded against you. However I 
do note your previous admitted involvement in identity fraud, all be it that there are 
no convictions for dishonesty recorded against you. 
 
I have also listened carefully to everything said appropriately on your behalf. 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
I sentence you Ming Jiang to life imprisonment for the murder of Yang Liu.  
 
The minimum term I impose is one of thirty-three years. This means you will not even 
be considered for release by the Parole Board until the year 2050. 
 
The  days  you  have  spent  in  custody,  one  hundred  and  ninety  of  them,  will  count 
towards this sentence. 
 
A victim surcharge is payable. 
 
 
I have already set a POCA timetable earlier in this hearing. 
 
I will make the Forfeiture and Destruction Orders the Crown seek as outlined in their 
written  sentencing  submissions  and  other  documentation  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
POCA proceedings.  
 
 
On the assumption the POCA proceedings are settled I will make the Forfeiture and 
Destruction Orders administratively at the appropriate time without the need for this 
case to be re-listed. 
 
I make no order as to your immigration status. These are matters to be dealt with by 
the appropriate authorities in due course and given the sentence I have imposed upon 
you form no part of this sentencing exercise.
