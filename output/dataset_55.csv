ORAL JUDGMENT
This action, which was started on 14 October 1989 by Jacky's Electronics (S) Pte Ltd against Komrades Air/Sea Forwarders Pte Ltd (formerly known as Komrades Air & Sea Forwarders Pte Ltd), was founded on an alleged breach of the contract of bailment allegedly entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants and under which the plaintiffs allege the defendants had failed or refused to deliver to them a total of 44,000 rolls of film. Of those films, it was alleged that 18,100 rolls of Konica SR-V100 135-24 and 25,800 rolls of Konica SR-V100 135-36 were missing. It was also alleged that 100 rolls of Konica SR-V200 110-24 discharged from motor vessel ""Gao Cheng"" were damaged. The claim in contract was the value of the Konica films at $133,136.
The bulk of the rolls of Konica film was discharged from motor vessel ""YS Prosperty"" which was contained in two containers. They were said to have been contained in 422 cartons, each of which contained 10 boxes and each box contained 100 rolls of film. They were allegedly sold by United Sources Trading Co (""USTC"") of Dubai to Jacky's International, a limited company in Hong Kong.
In the alternative, the plaintiffs also claim damages for conversion, presumably in the same sum. For them to succeed in the tort of conversion, the plaintiffs have to prove on a balance of probabilities that they were the owners of the Konica films.
The plaintiffs are a company dealing in Konica films in Singapore and the secretary of the managing director, Ms Meenatshi Sundari Bagavathy (PW1), gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs. PW2, Mr Govindasamy Kovalakrishnan, who went by the name of Mr Gopal, also gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs. PW2 was at all material times a sole-proprietor of G K Express, which was a sole-proprietorship in 1988, and was in the forwarding business. Since 1989 the sole-proprietorship was converted to a private limited company of which PW2 is the managing director. Ms Sundari engaged G K Express to collect and store the Konica films and to effect deliveries of parts of the consignment to customers of the plaintiffs in Singapore.
According to the evidence, there were altogether three storages of three containers of Konica films. Mr Gopal was introduced to Mr Karuppiah (known as ""Kannan"") of defendants by a family friend sometime in October 1988. Shortly thereafter the plaintiffs informed Mr Gopal of the anticipated arrival of the first batch of Konica films. Mr Gopal visited Mr Karuppiah and he said in evidence that he discussed the terms of storage. He agreed on the rate to be charged for the storage of the goods. He also said that eventually he paid for the storage charges directly out of his own sole-proprietorship and he charged the plaintiffs a separate and a higher storage rate. He, of course, went on to say that he did tell Mr Karuppiah of the defendants that G K Express were not the owners of the rolls of Konica film.
In the event, the first shipment arrived in December and was stored in the defendants' premises for which a Storing Order was issued by the defendants in favour of G K Express. The second Storing Order was issued for the second shipment. The defendants duly returned all the rolls of film. Both shipments are not really directly in issue nor involved in this action except for the 100 rolls of film which were damaged and which I mentioned earlier.
It is the third shipment which looms large in this case. As evidenced by Storing Order No 1283 issued by the defendants in favour of G K Express, 422 cartons of specified measurements were stored with the defendants. Under the column 'Marking & Number', there were stated ""Konica Films"". It is significant to note there is no mention of any agency whatsoever in this document. For eg. G K Express was not described as ""Agents of (the plaintiffs)"" or simply ""As Agents"". Secondly, and it is not really material but worthwhile to mention, the defendants had stamped on the documents just above the signature the words ""Goods & Quantity unchecked"". There is no other document disclosed in this court which connected or indicated a nexus between the plaintiffs and the goods.
We have to return to the oral evidence of both Ms Sundari and Mr Gopal. All it boils down to is that there is evidence that Ms Sundari visited the defendants' premises after the first visit of Mr Gopal in which Mr Gopal had come to a provisional agreement on some matters, particularly the rate of the storage charges. Ms Sundari later inspected the defendants' premises and expressed the view that they were acceptable for storage. Mr Gopal said that Ms Sundari had said to Mr Karuppiah that plaintiffs were the owners of the goods. Mr Gopal went on further to say in evidence that he had told Mr Karuppiah that G K Express was not the owner of the goods in question. That was the sum total of the evidence bearing on the question whether the plaintiffs were an undisclosed principal in privity with the defendants under the contract of bailment as evidenced in the third Storing Order.
I turn first to the question whether there was an expressed contract of bailment which was entered into by G K Express on the express authority of the plaintiffs. There is absolutely no evidence from either Ms Sundari or Mr Gopal which begin to establish that Ms Sundari on behalf of the plaintiffs had clothed Mr Gopal trading as G K Express with the express authority to enter into any contract of bailment for and on behalf of the plaintiffs. Mr Suresh on behalf of the plaintiffs stressed that he relies on the doctrine of undisclosed principal between the plaintiffs and the defendants. Now, he is saying that a court could in certain circumstances infer by an agent's disclosure of the existence of the principal to the other party which would result in the formation of a contract which was in truth and in substance entered into between the other party and the undisclosed principal. Nominally, the contract was apparently formed between the agent (though not mentioned as such) and the other party. If a person is an undisclosed principal in connection with a contract, it is of course the law that that undisclosed principal can sue the other party to the agreement simply because the underlying principle is that the other party had known or ought to have known that he was contracting with the undisclosed principal. This common law development of the doctrine was in recognition of the growing multiplicity of parties involved in transactions, particularly like the middleman, referred to by Lord Lindley in Keighley, Maxsted & Co v Durant < 1901 > AC 240 at 261. But as rightly pointed out by Mr Jeyaretnam that case does not help the plaintiffs at all because it was a case that principally dealt with the question of ratification. Each case must turn on its own facts. There is nothing here on the evidence given by the plaintiffs to suggest that what they have said about ownership was enough to impute on Mr Karuppiah the knowledge and therefore his agreement and consent that he was entering into the contract with the plaintiffs as owners of the Konica films. Now, I need not say much about Stockton v Morton < 1979 > RTR 130 which was relied by Mr Suresh. Again, I am in agreement with Mr Jeyaretnam when he said that that case dealt with the ambit of the authority of the insurance broker who was clearly the agent of the insurance company and where, in a particular situation, that insurance broker could and would bind his principal. We are concerned with the question of who was the contracting party rather than with the ambit of an agent's authority.
So quite obviously, there is completely insufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the contract of bailment as evidenced by the Storing Order of 16 December 1988 found in AB7 was entered into between G K Express and the defendants with the plaintiffs as the undisclosed principal. I find that the plaintiffs were a total stranger and a third party wholly unconnected in contract with the defendants in respect of the storage for bailment of 422 cartons of Konica films.
I turn very briefly to the state of evidence on the ownership of the rolls of film. The question of ownership is most important on the plaintiffs' alternative claim founded on the tort of conversion. Although Mr Suresh had conceded that the plaintiffs had certain difficulties of proving ownership, I must say that the evidence of the plaintiffs' alleged ownership of the goods is wholly unsatisfactory. They had produced a copy of the original bill of lading but it was generally endorsed. Evidence was given that the plaintiffs had possession and control of the 422 cartons but as everybody knows possession is not ownership. They could have been agents for the true owners, Jacky's International. If it had been a suit in detinue, it seems to me on the evidence the right to possession so far as the defendants were concerned was G K Express because it was G K Express who had stored the goods with them. In terms the Storing Order stated ""This Storing Order must be produced when delivery of Cargo is requested"". So far as the 422 cartons of Konica films are concerned, they were said to have been sold by USTC of Dubai to a company in Hong Kong which appears to have been associated with the plaintiffs. Who paid for the goods? On that question there is absolutely no evidence.
I should also say a few words on the attempt to prove ownership at the resumed hearing this afternoon. Ms Sundari attempted to produce the debit notes under which the Hong Kong company purportedly debited the accounts of the plaintiffs in a running account between the two entities. Accompanied with the debit notes were copies of Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong Ltd's advice of the negotiation of a draft drawn by USTC and the invoice of USTC. The latter two documents were withdrawn by Mr Suresh because there was no compliance with s 63 and following of the Evidence Act. I came to the conclusion that the pre-conditions as set out in s 32 of the Evidence Act were not complied with. There was in fact no evidence as to who the maker of the debit notes was, let alone evidence to show that the maker could not have been called to give evidence on the debit notes without unreasonable expense.
A further attempt to establish ownership was made by Ms Sundari producing a list of ledgers. She was not the maker of that document which allegedly recorded the debiting of the plaintiffs in the running account between the plaintiffs and the Hong Kong associated company. By that evidence it was sought to be established that the plaintiffs had given value for the rolls of Konica film and therefore they could properly claim that they were owners of the goods. Here again, I declined to admit the list of ledgers because it was not shown to me that it was too expensive or not possible or otherwise unreasonable to procure the attendance of the maker to give evidence as required by s 32 to enable hearsay evidence to be introduced. Obviously, we have to observe the provisions of s 32 which is an exception to the hearsay rule. If s 32 applies the other party will have no opportunity to cross examine on the evidence admitted. We must therefore be careful and take steps to ensure compliance with the pre-conditions as set out in s 32 of the Evidence Act.
So, at the end of the case for the plaintiffs, Mr Jeyaretnam made the submission of no case to meet. On being put to election whether to call evidence or not, he confirmed that the defendants would elect not to call any evidence if my ruling had gone against the defendants. Now, in view of what I had said, it is quite clear that the plaintiffs had not proved their claims founded in contract or in tort.
Their claims are accordingly dismissed with costs.",1993-05-05 00:00:00,SG High Court
